Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Health Care REIT Earnings Conference Call. My name is Holly, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President, Operations & General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey H. Miller: Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for HCN's first quarter 2014 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at hcreit.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Health Care REIT believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company's filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Tom DeRosa, the CEO of HCN. Tom? Thomas J. DeRosa: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. It's a pleasure to be the speaking with you as the new CEO of HCN. I know many of you from my long career in healthcare and real estate, and I'm looking forward to meeting those of you that I don't know over the coming weeks. HCN had a strong first quarter, delivering outstanding portfolio NOI growth and investing $542 million with both new and existing partners. As you'll hear from Scott Brinker and Scott Estes, our first quarter performance clearly demonstrates that the HCN strategy works. Establish long-term partnerships with the best-in-class healthcare operators, and those partnerships provide access to the best healthcare real estate in the best markets. Before we get into a more detailed discussion of the quarter, I want to mention that we had the opportunity to honor our friend and former CEO, George Chapman, at our annual shareholders meeting last week. We posted some pictures and a video of George speaking at the meeting on the HCN website. And I hope you all take a look. I know that many of you on the line have known George for many years. And I know you will enjoy seeing this emotional, heartfelt tribute as well as hearing George's remarks about succession planning at HCN and my appointment as CEO. During George's tenure, HCN's assets grew from $500 million to $22 billion, and, more importantly, the company delivered an average of 14% annual total shareholder returns. That's an enviable record, and we thank him for his contributions to the company. Also at that meeting, our Chairman, Jeff Donahue, was pleased to announce that all of our proxy proposals passed by wide margins. On behalf of our Board of Directors, I want to express our appreciation for your trust and confidence. Many of you know that I have been associated with HCN for over 20 years, and I'm intimately familiar with the company's management, business and strategic initiatives. I have deep experience with public real estate companies as well as healthcare, both in the U.S. and abroad. One thing you should all know is that the experienced and talented team we have at HCN is just remarkable. Whether it's on our unique campus here in Toledo or at our offices in Minneapolis; Jupiter, Florida; Newport Beach; or London, England, you sense a dynamic, vibrant culture and commitment to excellence as soon as you walk in the door. That, my friends, is our secret sauce. Let me be clear : HCN is not just some financing source chasing deals. We are deeply engaged in the seniors housing and the broader healthcare industries and have a seat at the table with healthcare systems and senior housing operators who are driving efficiencies and improvements in healthcare delivery. What underlies this team is the dynamics of an aging population. You're all aware of this, and it's a global issue. We're spending a lot of time thinking about what aging means and positioning HCN to align with this powerful trend. You'll be hearing more about this from me in the future. As Scott Brinker will describe in greater detail, we are delivering consistent, strong external and internal growth. During the first quarter, we secured a new partnership with Senior Resource Group, yet another leading U.S.-based operator. We also continued to innovate and improve our best-in-class portfolio management systems, like our expense benchmarking tool, which provides our operating partners with information to drive even better results. We have also been the most active player outside of the United States. And, just like in the U.S., we focus on the best markets with the best operators in healthcare property types that we know well. For example, let's take the U.K. HCN has invested over $2 billion into high-end seniors housing, primarily located in the dynamic London Metropolitan area. One year ago, HCN opened an office in London, which is staffed both by local hires and some members of the Toledo team that have transferred there. The point I'm making here is that we are extremely well covered in Europe. A market, by the way, that I know, exceedingly well, having lived in London, and I've been working there over the last 20 years in both real estate and healthcare. I'm also pleased to tell you that we just reached terms this week with a senior U.K. healthcare investment professional to join our London office, someone that I've known for 2 decades and is well known to the HCN management team. We are excited about what he will add to our international efforts. And now Scott Brinker will review our investment activity. Scott? Scott M. Brinker: Thanks, Tom. The year is off to a great start with sector-leading 4.4% same-store NOI growth, and our investment activity was once again the highest in the sector. I'll start with some color on the portfolio, beginning with seniors housing. Results this quarter were way above guidance. Same-store NOI growth in the operating portfolio was exceptional at 8.1%. Rental rates led the way with 4.5% growth. Results were strong across the U.S. and Canada and were especially robust in the U.K. In Metro London, the source of more than half our U.K. income were benefiting from incredible affluence and tight supply. Results in the operating portfolio continue to be exceptional in comparison to every benchmark. Our locations and physical plants are sustainable advantages that will drive continued outperformance. And with occupancy at 89%, there is still plenty of room for upside. If you want to play in a healthcare REIT with the highest organic growth, HCN is the pick. Turning to triple net senior housing, the portfolio continues to generate strong, predictable growth. Same-store NOI grew 3.3%, in line with guidance. Payment covered was unchanged and remains at comfortable levels. Moving to post-acute, results continue to be remarkably consistent. Same-store NOI, once again, increased 3%. Payment coverage after management fee improved to a healthy 1.34x. Many of you will remember touring a Genesis PowerBack facility at last year's Investor Day in New Jersey. HCN and Genesis will open their seventh PowerBack this summer. PowerBack is redefining the standard for rehab therapy. Patients and families love the private rooms, therapy pools, full-time physicians and large therapy gyms. Medicare and commercial payers love that PowerBack delivers tremendous value per dollar spent. This is just one of many examples of HCN partnering with operators to move the industry forward. Medical office. Same-store NOI increased 1.5% last quarter, in line with guidance. This is a low-risk asset class with predictable cash flows. We like the business because of its stability. Equally important, it allows us to build relationships with hospitals and physician groups. Over time, it will be a huge advantage for us to have scale across the continuum. Healthcare is becoming more integrated and more collaborative. The days of silos are numbered. Our relationships across the continuum will put us right in the middle of the collaboration. Investments. As you've come to expect, we're finding accretive deal flow, thanks to the breadth and depth of our relationships. Investment volume last quarter was more than $540 million with a Year 1 cash yield of 6.5%. The activity included follow-on acquisition to a Sunrise and Genesis, a continuation of our longstanding history of growing with our partners. The headline last quarter was a nearly $400 million investment with Senior Resource Group, who's been on our wish list for years. The assets are concentrated in highly affluent Southern California markets. These are among the highest-quality assets in our entire portfolio. And that's a very high bar to exceed. Importantly, SRG becomes another high-quality partner to help grow our business. The ownership group is a joint venture that includes the SRG management team and PSP, the Canadian pension fund who's our partner on the Revera portfolio and the Sunrise management company. Note that our relationships include capital partners, not just operators. The ability to collaborate with partners is increasingly important in healthcare, and HCN excels at it. International. We were the first mover in the U.K. 2 years ago, and we quickly established a leading market position. It's exciting to see that our relationship investment strategy can be translated into overseas markets. To date, we've invested nearly $2 billion in the premium quality U.K. real estate. Our senior team based in London has decades of experience in the U.K. They know every portfolio, operator and market just as we do here in the States. This is -- this allows us to invest strategically, and helps explains why our NOI growth rate exceeds every benchmark. Looking forward, we have active dialogue with 30-plus existing partners. They are the sector's best origination team. The deals are big, small and in between. The common link is high-quality real estate that will appreciate in value over time. Accretive investments have been an important part of our story, and that will continue. Two final points about healthcare real estate : One, it's a fragmented business. Two, it's evolving into a core asset class. The upshot is that, over time, the real estate will flow to large, efficient owners like HCN. With our vast network of relationships, we're going to be at the leading edge of the consolidation. I'll now turn to Scott Estes for our financial results. Scott A. Estes: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. I'll center my remarks today around 3 core themes : First, our first quarter financial and operating results were outstanding; second, our balance sheet and credit metrics remain solid, and we retain considerable capital availability at quarter end; and third, we've increased our 2014 guidance to reflect the strength of our first quarter results. So I'll begin by taking a look at our first quarter financial performance. I think the most important thing for you, all, to pay attention to is the rate of earnings growth our platform is generating. Normalized FFO increased to a record $1 per share for the first quarter, while FAD came in at $0.90, representing strong 10% and 11% increases year-over-year, respectively. Results were primarily driven by the same-store cash NOI increase and $3.4 billion of net investments completed over the prior 12 months. G&A for the first quarter came in at slightly under $33 million, in line with our expectations. As a reminder, this quarter included about $3 million of accelerated expensing of stock and options that will not be included in our run rate entering the second quarter. We will pay our 172nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend on May 20 of $0.795 per share or $3.18 annually. That's 43 years of dividends. Our new 2014 dividend payment rate represents a 4% increase over the dividends paid last year and a current dividend yield of 5.1%. Our FFO and FAD payout ratios for 2014, based on the midpoint of our revised guidance ranges, have declined to 78% (sic) [80%] and 88%, respectively. We continue to enhance our supplement this quarter. The most significant change was standardizing the presentation of our portfolio and investment balances at HCN's pro rata share throughout the entire document. In addition, we've provided a new chart on Page 1 that details bed and unit mix by asset type within our seniors housing and care portfolio. And on Page 5, we've added disclosure detailing same-store CapEx as a percentage of NOI within our seniors housing operating portfolio. I would also point out that we've begun adding pictures to the portfolio map on our website starting today, with the 10 SRG assets located in California, Arizona and Oregon and plan on adding a more significant number soon. Turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. In terms of capital and liquidity, it was a fairly quiet quarter for us. We repaid approximately $130 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.7%. In addition, we issued a little over 1.1 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program during the first quarter, generating $64 million in proceeds. We ended March with $562 million of line borrowings, largely as a result of completing $542 million of net investments during the quarter. We are in a solid liquidity position at quarter end based on the following items : As of March 31, we had $1.7 billion of credit line capacity and $186 million in cash. We have $250 million of pending dispositions throughout the remainder of 2014, and we continue to raise over $60 million per quarter through our dividend reinvestment program. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position and know we have limited near-term debt maturities, the HCN's share of debt maturing through year end 2014 at only $218 million. In terms of financial metrics, as of March 31, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization was 43%. Our net debt to EBITDA stood at 6.2x, while our adjusted interest in fixed charge coverage remains solid at 3.6x and 2.8x respectively. As a result of the secured debt paid off during the first quarter, our secured debt as a percentage of total assets declined to 12.6%. I'll conclude my comments today by providing an update regarding the more significant assumptions driving our 2014 guidance. I'll begin with our same-store cash NOI growth outlook. Given our strong first quarter results, we are increasing our 2014 forecast from the previous range of 3% to 3.5% to a point estimate of 3.5%. The increase is based on the better-than-expected results now anticipated from our seniors housing operating portfolio. More specifically, we're now projecting strong growth of approximately 6% in our seniors housing operating portfolio for the full year. Our 2014 same-store cash NOI forecast for the remaining components of our portfolio remain unchanged. In terms of our investment expectations, there are no acquisitions beyond what we've completed in the first quarter included in our formal guidance. Our guidance does include $163 million of additional development conversions throughout the remainder of the year at a blended projected yield upon conversion of 8.6%. Our forecast continues to include approximately $250 million of dispositions at a blended yield on sale of 9.5%. I'd note that approximately $200 million of these dispositions could occur in the second quarter. There is no change to our annual capital expenditure forecast of $66 million for 2014, comprised of approximately $46 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio and the remaining $20 million from the medical facilities portfolio. Our 2014 CapEx as a percentage of NOI for both segments is expected to run in the 7% to 9% range, which we believe is an appropriate level to maintain our premier quality portfolio. In terms of G&A, we're reducing our annual forecast to approximately $125 million from the previous $127 million. We continue to believe that our overall platform is in great position, and we're making a concerted effort to drive down overhead expenses. We're reducing our forecast for the full year primarily as a result of reductions in professional services and consulting costs relative to our initial expectations. I would note that our revised forecast excludes any costs associated with our CEO transition that will impact our second quarter results. Finally, we've increased our normalized FFO and FAD per share guidance for the full year. As a result of our strong first quarter operating results and investment activity, we have increased both normalized FFO and FAD guidance by $0.02 per share. Our normalized FFO guidance was increased by another $0.08 per share to reflect $23 million of additional straight-line rent as a result of the recent Genesis lease modification. Effective April 1, our lease was modified to replace the CPI-based component of the annual increaser with a fixed annual increaser, providing us with a certainty that our full annual cash rent increase will be achieved. So as a result, we are increasing our normalized 2014 FFO guidance by a total of $0.10 to a range of $4.03 to $4.13 per diluted share from the previous range of $3.93 to $4.03, which now represents 6% to 8% growth. We're also increasing our normalized 2014 FAD expectation by $0.02 to a range of $3.55 to $3.65 per diluted share from the previous range of $3.53 to $3.63, now representing a strong increase of 6% to 9%. That does conclude my prepared remarks, but I would finish by saying that we're pleased with our strong start to the year and feel great about our portfolio and financial position at the end of the first quarter. So with that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you for some closing comments. Thomas J. DeRosa: Thanks, Scott. I'd like to highlight a few points before we take questions. First, our platform is stronger than ever. Our network of partners in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. continues to give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. I think our Q1 results speak to that. We have a strong pipeline of accretive deals that our team is working on as we speak and expect that to grow throughout the year. We are maintaining a financial position that enables the company to execute on these opportunities, and most importantly, we have the best team in the sector. Our results this quarter are exciting, and we're very pleased to share them with you. But, we remain laser-focused on our mission of delivering superior long-term total shareholder returns. Holly, now we'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is going to come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Scott, can you give us some more details for the reason of the Genesis lease modification? Was it just a straight-line PPI, I guess, bumps switching to a fixed bump, and what is the fixed bump? Scott M. Brinker: Yes, Scott Brinker speaking. The increaser with Genesis was 3.5% for the first 5 years, and then 3% the final 10 years of the lease. And a portion of that increaser was tied to CPI, and then a portion was fixed, and with inflation seen as low as it has been, this year, there might have been a shortfall in the cash ramp that we actually received, and Genesis was a good partner and agreed to essentially fix the increaser for the remainder of the lease term so that we could ensure ourselves of getting the full cash rent. The result is that, for GAAP purposes, we have to now straight-line all the rent. Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, so there is nothing changing I guess in the current run rate. It was just that slight adjustment to the CPI portion of that rate? Scott M. Brinker: Correct. Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then how you guys are thinking about your current financial position? I know that Scott previously indicated that he is comfortable with a little bit of a higher leverage ratio because of the strong liquidity. Now that you have about $500 million drawn on the line of credit, are you still comfortable with that liquidity position? Scott A. Estes: We are, Mike. I think, most importantly, we look at the flexibility by having over $2 billion of available capital. But our answers as always were timing of any future capital raise is contingent upon future acquisitions and our investment pipeline. Michael Carroll - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then my last question is for Tom. I know, in your comments, you kind of highlighted the expertise you guys have internationally, mainly in the U.K. Should we read into that, that the company wants to expand more meaningfully in the U.K. and then London? Thomas J. DeRosa: I think that is a good read on where we're coming from. I think that -- as I mentioned, we've just hired a quite experienced senior guy that we've all known for a long time to join our London office. I think we have great relationships there with the best operators, and we are going to continue to look for good opportunities for accretive investments in the U.K., and we will be looking even outside the U.K. but very carefully and staying with the strategy that we delivered on for many years. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Just going back to the Genesis lease, again, I understand the modification. I'm just curious, it seems like you guys got all the upside from that to the detriment of Genesis. Just wondering on the other side, what are they getting that made them comfortable with basically fixing that piece of the rent bumps? Scott M. Brinker: Yes, Tayo, it's Scott. I mean, this is a long-term fixing your partnership with Genesis. We're doing active investments with acquisitions and new development. So there's no tradeoff other than it's a partnership, and we work together when they need a favor and vice versa. That's the way HCN works. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : All right. I appreciate that. And then for the quarter, I believe this was the first quarter where we -- for the senior housing operating platform, the same-store numbers were impacted by the addition of some of the recent transactions that were done, I think, last year. Could you just talk a little bit about what that net impact was on those numbers from the change in the same-store pool? Scott M. Brinker: Let me make sure I understand your question. The same-store pool has increased, and you're asking if the composition changed the growth rate? Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Yes, and if it did by, how much? Scott M. Brinker: I see. Well the same-store pool grew 8.1% over the prior year, and the major addition was Sunrise, and their performance was sort of right in line with that overall average. So I would say, on average, it had really no impact. Scott A. Estes: The only thing I would add to, Tayo, I think is an important point. It's largely a stable pool. So the stabilized result of that same-store pool, there's not a lot of assets until up [ph]. It was within 50 basis points of the 8.1% if you just looked at the stable component. Omotayo T. Okusanya - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Great. Okay. Last one from me. I get it. It definitely sounds like acquisition activity you guys are feeling much better about that. Your name, along with some of your bigger peers has kind of been thrown around on some fairly large potential deals in Australia and as well as the U.S., and even in the U.K. You've made some comments about the U.K., just curious about domestically with Griffin-American and Australia with Healthscope, whether those are things you're looking at, and where things may stand on that? Thomas J. DeRosa: Well, we look at everything. And we have a pretty high bar here. So if there's a large transaction that you're hearing about, assume that we've looked at it, but we're certainly not going to invest in everything that comes across our desk. We're going to invest in the good ones with the operators that we believe we can establish long-term partnerships with. It's not just about a deal for us. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I was hoping you guys could just talk a little bit about your relationships with PSP and more broadly with pension funds for PSP. Are there other opportunities to invest alongside some of the investments they have made. And are you having more broader discussions with other sort of long-term capital partners like a PSP, where you could see opportunities to invest in joint ventures, and if you could just speak a little bit to that? Scott M. Brinker: Sure, Juan, this is Scott. PSP became a partner of ours last year through the Revera portfolio in Canada, 47 private [indiscernible] assets. We own, let's see, 75% interest in that portfolio and PSP owns the balance. We're also joint venture partners in the Sunrise management company where we have 24% and they have the balance. And we're now partners with them in this SRG portfolio that we talked about where we each have roughly a 47% interest. That said, the dialogue is active and ongoing. I would think that all 3 of those joint ventures are going to grow, Revera, Sunrise and SRG. And we may look to do other things with them. One thing that became apparent to us over the last 2 years is that getting direct access to these pension funds instead of doing things via private equity companies was maybe a better route for a company like us as a long-term partnership focused company. Thomas J. DeRosa: Juan, just picking up on what Scott just said, I think that PSP is an example of the value of investing directly with an HCN versus accessing our type of investments through the private equity funds. And I want to make -- I want to mention that this is an area that I have a lot of experience with. In other businesses that I have been involved with, I have relationships with a lot of the large sovereign wealth and pension funds around the world. I will tell you that I've got a lot of calls. They're all interested in talking about healthcare. So I think you should look at PSP as a model for how we will establish financial partnerships with the best quality financial partners in the world. Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Just on the G&A front, can you just walk us through what the expectation is for costs related to the change in CEO, and would that include the payments to George to stay on as an adviser and what those are? Scott A. Estes: Juan, this is Scott Estes. I think -- we don't have any specific comments ready on the number as we're still finalizing some items, but I can say, it will be expensed in the second quarter. And the details will be made available, generally, in the retirement and consulting agreement as well as the employment contracts that will need to be filed with the SEC. So we will have the full detailed results. Those are all a part of it, and we'll provide that in the second quarter. Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And just lastly on the financing front, what's assumed -- is there any equity other than what you guys talked about via the distribution reinvestment plan assumed in guidance, and is there anything assumed with regards to putting in place long-term debt, or is it basically the balance sheet as is on a go-forward basis for the guidance that was revised? Scott A. Estes: Yes, it's per our usual, it's essentially the balance sheet as is at any one point in time. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Manny Korchman on the phone with me as well. Tom, I'm just wondering if you can sort of share a little bit on the board process and the decision on your appointment, and whether that was always a plan from a succession perspective. There's a couple of analogous situations recently in REIT land. You had HCP, which terminated their CEO and put a board member in place. You had Digital, which the CEO effectively was asked to leave, and they put an interim CEO in, who is the current CIO and CFO, and they're going through a search firm and a process. You had Equity One where the CEO announced that he was going to go off and take a new job and the board went through a process and ended up bringing in external candidate. And I'm just curious sort of what the board went through. I've known you for a long time. I understand and clearly you have the background and the history of the company. I'm just trying to understand the process that, that went through. Thomas J. DeRosa: Well, appreciate the question, Michael. Just understand that we've been talking about succession planning at HCN for a number of years. And while the timing of the announcement might have caught the people by surprise, I just -- you should know that there was not a decision made on a Friday that was announced on a Monday. This had been an open discussion with George, and I think, many of you have heard George publicly talk about succession planning. I think my appointment has a lot to do with the fact that I've known this company for so long, and I know the management team very well. I know the business very well. And I think it's unusual when you have someone who can step into the CEO role who is supported by the retiring CEO of the board and, most importantly, the management team. I think that's a unique situation, so while I can't comment on the other scenarios that you've raised, I think you have to look at what are the unique aspects that allowed this transition to happen so seamlessly here. If you came here, Michael, the day after the announcement -- or actually the afternoon of the announcement, it was business as usual. Everyone was doing what they do best here, and it's all -- I sometimes feel like I've been here forever. It's a strange feeling. But I think what I'm saying is this is very different than you normally find in a -- when a quasi outsider comes in as the CEO. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Right. I guess to that point, you talked about it was ongoing open, I guess this has happened almost 1 month ago. Why don't you have the costs and things nailed down or agreements nailed down? I'm just -- it's just strange not to have that detail to be able to share with us. Thomas J. DeRosa: The agreements are nailed down. There are some moving pieces that we wouldn't be quoting numbers to you on this call today, but rest assured that everything is nailed down to everyone's satisfaction here. It's just that we're not prepared yet to be putting numbers on a conference call related to that. But when we can, you'll know all the details. But also assume that George's departure was very much in -- along the lines of what his contract was, which is disclosed, and assume that there is additional compensation because he is staying on as an adviser to the company. Unknown Executive : It may be worth noting that those contracts will be filed with our 10-Q this evening. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Right. So you'll get -- you're saying he's going to get some amount of severance or other payments, and I guess you're saying that there's some inducement package to you, Tom, that will come, that this could -- I mean, could HCP cost, I don't know, it was like $50 million or $75 million, something that crazy. I mean, what are we looking at in terms of -- just by -- ballpark it for us in terms of cash or stock that will be given here. Thomas J. DeRosa: Given to George? Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just between both. I assume you're going to be induced with some contract to take the CEO job, and I assume George is owed a certain amount of money, and I think we're just trying to get a perspective of what does the CEO transition cost shareholders. Scott A. Estes: Mike, it's Scott Estes. I think it's an important issue, philosophically, seeing Tom come in. I think you'll see in the document Tom got a very small stock grant, it was $1 million. Thomas J. DeRosa: Yes, $1 million stock grant that is totally based on performance in the future. Scott A. Estes: And his long-term incentive opportunity is essentially that of a high-performing CEO in the sector. George's package and the only variability why we don't share a number is, effectively, he is an employee technically until June 30 and a few of the performance measures need to be determined at the time. So there's still some work to be done. But in essence, it's largely contractual plus the long-term incentives and plans that have been in place that are part of the calculation. So it's nowhere outlandish in terms of a number. Thomas J. DeRosa: Michael, you'll see that my compensation structure is very ISS-friendly. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Now are you going to step off the other public company boards to free up your time to be full-time CEO? Thomas J. DeRosa: At the moment, no. If those responsibilities became overbearing, both companies know that I may have to. But at the moment, I think it is an advantage to this company and to -- that I sit on the boards of those companies. Those are very -- the businesses are relative to what we do, both of them are real estate companies today. And I think there are numerous synergies that -- and knowledge that I learn from sitting on the boards of those companies that are relevant to HCN and vice versa. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And just last one from me. Would George have a non-compete after he has a certain advisory relationship with the company? Unknown Executive : The arrangement does include a noncompetition arrangement, yes. That's all detailed in the agreements to be filed. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : To be filed? Unknown Executive : Yes. Michael Bilerman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And how long does that last for, just out of curiosity? Unknown Executive : It's a 3-year consulting arrangement, but each party has some rights to terminate along the way. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : It's Ross here with Nick. I've got 2 questions. The first is back on Genesis. Maybe I'm just not understanding it, but Genesis is a big boy. You're a big boy. You entered into a lease, just because inflation is lower than, perhaps, some expected, I guess, I'm missing why they'd feel so generous as to say \"Hey, we're just going to pay you some more rent out of the goodness of our heart without expecting,\" and I think, Scott, you used the word some favor in return. It would seem to me, that that's an awfully generous thing to do all else being equal. Scott M. Brinker: Yes, Ross, it's not that really unusual. There's a catch-up provision in the lease. So they would have repaid us at some point. It's just a matter of when do we get the cash rent, and we prefer to get it now rather than later. So, I mean there's really nothing to this other than Genesis and HCN are partners in this portfolio, and we're growing the business together. There's no -- there's nothing else to read into this. Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Got it. No, but that catch-up point is an important one because I don't think that was stated before, so that now actually makes sense. Okay, second question I have for you is on the disclosure front with respect to the senior housing RIDEA portfolio. Can you guys break out of the 4.5% rate growth that I think you cited in the same-store pool, how much was the renewal rate growth and how much was the rate growth on new leases? Scott M. Brinker: I'm not sure offhand, Ross... Ross T. Nussbaum - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And this I guess speaks to sort of the question I was going for, which is, if we think about the multifamily REITs, and you guys own a portfolio that's bigger than many of the multifamily REITs, those guys do provide renewal rents, new lease rents, they provide all of their metrics by state, and I would just sort of think about trying to provide a little more color around those kinds of topics going forward because I think it's something that investors are going to want to focus on. Scott M. Brinker: Okay. We'll do it. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : This is Nick Yulico here. Just a question on acquisition pricing. It seems like it's now getting a lot more aggressive out there in the market, whether it's big diversified portfolios in the U.S. or even in the U.K., seems like a lot. A lot of people are trying to be buying in the U.K. right now, and so what I'm wondering is how do you think about -- what's your minimal acceptable initial yield that you would do deals at that you think would be accretive for you guys today? Scott M. Brinker: Well, Nick, we don't make investments unless we think we're going to make money at it. And we prefer to make money on Day 1 and over time. I'd say the SRG portfolio is sort of the low bar, and that's the highest-quality portfolio we've seen -- our private pay, the markets are exceptional and that was a 6% Year 1 yield. That's moderately accretive. Not in a major way, but at our cost of capital today, we make money today. More important, over time, it's really strong growth rate in that portfolio. So we think that, over the long term, that's the type of investment that will make our shareholders a lot of money. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Well, I guess what I'm wondering is 6% is sort of as the low end of cap rates for higher-quality operating senior housing. Does it make any sense to pay fixed cap rate for anything else, so even below a fixed cap rate for medical office, for U.K. going overseas and taking more currency and other risk? I mean, should we think about this as the pricing of senior housing operating in the U.S. that you've done over the past couple of years is -- that's still is going to be lowest cap rate that you guys are going to pay for this -- any kind of real estate? Scott M. Brinker: I mean, Nick, it's hard to predict the future. It's interesting though, what we see is that senior housing medical office has been an extremely strong performer over the past decade. It's been outperformer in up cycles and down cycles, and it's finally attracting the interest from institutional investors that it should. So we've seen the cap rate spread for healthcare versus other asset classes compressed, but there's a still a big gap. And I think there's still room for that gap to narrow. So 6% seems low. We can make money at 6%, but it's still substantially higher than the cap rates that people are paying for other asset classes that to us have lower growth expectations and less resiliency from year-to-year. Nicholas Yulico - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Right. I guess, just for the final question. I guess my point was, I think we've all sort of understood that senior housing, we've got our hands around it, senior housing operating cap rates could be 6%, but does it really make sense to pay below 6% for medical office? It seems like a lot of the incremental sort of -- do you think about maybe a larger portfolio, that there were people trying to push pricing, they're pushing it on skilled nursing, they're pushing it on medical office, and they're trying to drive down cap rates with that? So that's what I'm wondering -- is why -- what's so attractive about those other asset class? Are they at all similar to the senior housing? Or should we think about senior housing as just this isolated lower cap rate investment within healthcare? Scott M. Brinker: Nick, I think they're all potentially attractive asset classes for us. And I wouldn't just focus on the initial yield. I mean that's important, but there's a lot more to it from our perspective, including the growth rate over time, most importantly, but also the relationship, and is it one that's going to grow? Or is it a static one-off investment? SRG is an example. It's a best-in-class portfolio, but we're also going to grow with SRG. They're an active developer. They're actually into turnarounds, so they're going to grow that business, and we're going to be their capital partner. So that impacts our thinking, too, when we talk about what's an acceptable initial yield on an investment. Thomas J. DeRosa: Nick, we don't feel the need to throw around money at low cap rates just to demonstrate that we can do a deal. That's not the way we do business. And that money -- there's a lot of that money out there, let him go do it. We're looking -- if you're to see us go into opportunities that are -- that you may determine are a lower cap rate, assume that there is, as Scott said, it's part of perhaps an initial relationship. There's an opportunity to really grow with that operator or healthcare system, if it weren't in a, for instance, in a medical office situation. If it were an initial opportunity to get in with one of the largest health systems in the country and we saw an opportunity to do more with that health system, that might be a reason to do that 6% deal. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Theiler with Green Street Advisors. Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : On your senior housing operating portfolio, I think you mentioned that you saw particularly strong performance in London. Can you put some numbers around -- just kind of what the NOI growth rates were for the U.S. versus Canada versus the U.K. and whether you see any difference in longer-term NOI growth rates for those different geographies. Scott M. Brinker: Jeff, it's Scott. The U.K. was right around 10%. U.S. was right around 8%, and then Canada was more like 5%. And I would say the longer-term difference, especially in Canada, is that our portfolio has very low acuity. It's like senior apartments, so a lot less care services being provided. So if you were going to rank them by long-term NOI growth, I'd probably put Canada at the lower end of that range and the U.S. and U.K. at the high end. The tradeoff with Canada is that it's a very, very stable stream of income. I mean, it really functions more like an apartment building with very long lease terms. I mean, there's very little turnover. So we look at this as a diversified portfolio, and it's a combination of resiliency and strong growth. But does that answer your question? Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Yes, that does. And then lastly, one of your peers just made a significant investment in entrance-fee CCRCs. I know you've had some experience with those assets in the past. Do you share their view that this is a good time in the cycle to get into that product? And is this something that you might consider increasing your investment exposure to over time? Scott M. Brinker: Yes, Jeff, it's Scott. We do have a small portfolio of CCRCs. I think it's about 1% of our portfolio. They're performing fine. Brookdale is a great operator, so that's a positive for the investment. I don't know what kind of yield they got on it. But traditionally, entry-fee CCRCs would command a much higher cap rate. So that would impact my response, and I just don't know what the purchase price was. So it's hard to say much beyond that. Jeff Theiler - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : But this doesn't -- you haven't thought of this as a particularly good time to get into that product, is that fair to say? Scott M. Brinker: Yes, I wouldn't say that we're looking to substantially grow that asset class, Jeff. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your next question will come from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I want to start with the RIDEA performance. Obviously, really good in the quarter. I guess my question is, maybe around the weather, do you see any sort of downward pressure from that? Was it on the occupancy line or operating expense. And did you try and parse that what that could be? Scott M. Brinker: Yes, Jack, it's Scott again. We took a best guess. We do have a large portfolio in New England that was heavily impacted by the harsh winter. And just looking at utilities alone, they dragged down our NOI growth for the whole portfolio by over 100 basis points. So it did have an impact. Had the weather been normal, I think our NOI growth rate would have been closer to 10% rather than 8%. But there's always something that's happening. It's a hurricane or it's the flu or it's winter weather, so we try not to get to into that. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Yes, difficult to predict the weather. And on the moving side, I guess, one of the things we've been thinking about is, is it possible that, somebody was planning a move-in in the first quarter, maybe it gets pushed into the second quarter. Did you see any change in move-ins maybe in the New England market, and then has that changed as you go into April and now into May? Scott M. Brinker: Well, occupancy was surprisingly strong in first quarter. It was ahead of our expectations. And the traditional seasonality in the business is that occupancy increases from the first to the second, and then also the third quarter. So I would expect, our centers to continue increasing. But we didn't necessarily hear people saying that the weather caused occupancy to be challenged in the first quarter. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, good to hear. And the last one, obviously there's been a lot of talk around international market, both one in where you're already at, and then Australia, which I think is a little bit new. I was wondering, maybe if you could just walk through some of the criteria you think about when you're trying to pick new markets that you would enter? Scott M. Brinker: Well, the most important thing for us other than the risk-adjusted return is whether we can pick the right partners and buy the best real estate. I mean, that's how we've established a competitive advantage in the U.S. And that means, being deeply connected into the healthcare markets. And that's why when we approach the U.K., we hired what we think are the 2 best investment professionals that are tightly networked into the senior housing operators, the medical office developers and operators, and the best health systems. They can help us pick the best partners and the best assets. So that -- that's really the starting point for us, is knowing the market. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Rob Mains with Stifel. Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Since the door is open for me there, I'm going to ask a weather question as well. Some of the other healthcare REITs with medical office building investments have talked about some reimbursements that might come back to them in the second quarter from the utility storm or [ph] that sort of thing. Is there anything that -- like that that's going to affect MOB performance in the current quarter? Scott M. Brinker: Yes, Rob, it's Scott speaking. Our MOB NOI growth rate last quarter was 1.5%. And we true-up the operating expenses at the end of each quarter. So there's no catch-up concept. But similar to my comment about the weather impacting the senior housing performance, we think, likewise, it impacted the medical office portfolio by about 50 basis points. So again, we would have done a little bit better had the weather been more normal. Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, fair enough. And then when we look at the SRG investment. Since that's primarily independent living, is that going to reduce consolidated RevPAR in -- going forward? Scott M. Brinker: It might by a bit. It's about 55%, 60% independent, and the rest is assisted, Rob, but the markets that these asset are in are so affluent that it's still a very high number despite being mostly independent living. Robert M. Mains - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : And then my last question, staying on the independent living theme, you're not developing anything in independent living, and I know that the [indiscernible] data suggests that that's the one asset class where clearly there's a favorable demand/supply relationship. Just curious about your thoughts about IL as a development opportunity. Scott M. Brinker: Yes, we're not doing anything directly, Rob, but indirectly, we're doing still a fair amount of new construction in IL. Merrill Gardens is an example. They're actively building 3, 4, 5 new projects a year, and we've got the right to buy those if and when they seek to sell, which they certainly will when they stabilize. So we're doing a lot of that type of thing, Rob, with development even if we're not funding it directly. A lot of that stuff will end up within our portfolio. Operator : And your next question is a follow-up question from Michael Bilerman. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : It's actually Manny Korchman here. When you look at sort of the press reports that were out end of last year, beginning of this year, there was reports out there that you and Ventas were in discussions to potentially merge the companies. Was that a part of sort of the succession process, or was that something else and sort of -- did that have any influence on the fact that now the CEO has transitioned to a new person? Thomas J. DeRosa: I can't comment on those rumors about conversations between Ventas and Health Care REIT. I would say that has nothing to do with a process that has been under discussion here for many years. This is something that -- these were discussions between -- as I told you between George Chapman, the management team and the board, regarding what was the right way to put a good succession planning program in place because George was going to retire. At a certain point, and as I said earlier, I think the stars lined up pretty well here. It's very different than what you find with some of the other situations that are out there. So, there's always people speculating -- in an industry like we're in where there's so much runway for growth and you're delivering every quarter for your shareholders, why would we even consider that at this point, any kind of a combination. That makes no sense to me. Emmanuel Korchman - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : So M&A was not one of the options that the board explored? Thomas J. DeRosa: Absolutely not. Operator : And at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to Tom DeRosa for some closing comments. Thomas J. DeRosa: Well, I thank you, for all your participation today. I hope we answered all your questions. And I hope you're as excited about HCN as we are, and I look forward to getting a chance now that I could get on the road now that we've released earnings, I look forward to the chance to get to see all of you over the next couple of weeks. All the best. Thanks. Unknown Executive : Thanks. Operator : And at this time, we would like to thank you for your participation in today's first quarter 2014 Health Care REIT Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

Rob Mains \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2014 Health Care REIT Earnings Conference Call. My name is Holy, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President- Operations & General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir Jeffery H. Miller: Thank you, Holy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for HCN's second quarter 2014 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at hcreit.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although the company believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company's filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Tom DeRosa, our CEO. Tom? Thomas J. DeRosa: Thank you, Jeff, and good morning everyone. We\u2019ve been talking to you for sometime about the unique and powerful position that HCN has built in the Health Care real estate's base. We believe that our strategy of partnering with the best-in-class seniors housing and post-acute operators as well as strong regional health systems, we deliver the best sustainable growth to our shareholders. I\u2019m quite pleased to tell you that this quarter once again we can backup those words with results. Overall our operating portfolio generated 7.7% same store NOI growth, and the entire HCN portfolio had same store NOI growth of 4.4%. Now you don\u2019t get that kind of growth from passive asset management, low cap rate asset aggregating, and solely relying on fixed increasers. You get these results for being a value added partner in the healthcare delivery equation. Through our partners, we generated nearly $600 million in new investments in the quarter, and as you will hear from Scott Estes, record high FFO and FAD per share that is tracking above Street estimates. And you can\u2019t deliver the kind of internal growth numbers that we announced this quarter without owning the best real estate. When I say partnering with the best operators, it should be given that our real estate is in the best markets. Scott Brinker will elaborate on that. It\u2019s not such a surprise that the best real estate in the best markets will enable you to charge the best rent. Layer on that, the best quality services and the cost savings and other operating efficiencies that HCN delivers, and you\u2019ve built a powerful machine to deliver superior internal growth. I\u2019m particularly proud of the operating and performance enhancing initiatives that Chuck Herman and his team sphere head with our operators. HCN\u2019s executive form brings together the leadership teams of top senior\u2019s housing and post-acute operators to share in best practices and explore areas where this group can work together to drive down operating costs. For example, our group food and furniture purchasing, as well group insurance purchasing is translating to real cost savings. These savings are showing up in that 7.7% same-store NOI growth for our RIDEA portfolio that I mentioned earlier. Again, so much of our external growth is driven by the strategic growth plans of our existing operating partners. Our relationship management professionals work directly with our operators to identify acquisitions as well as plan new developments. Of the nearly $600 million in new investment activity in the quarter, 83% came from these operators. The best-in-class operators want to be on the HCN team. They see our unique value proposition. HCN brings operating efficiencies, big picture vision, and expertise to the table; that\u2019s a true differentiator from any other investor in healthcare real estate. And it\u2019s why we are the partner of choice. These relationships are incredibly valuable, and have been forged over many years. Healthcare industry leaders like George Hager at Genesis; Chris Winkle at Sunrise, Patricia Will of Belmont, Tom Grape of Benchmark, Brenda Bacon of Brandywine, and the list goes on on our team and help to find our company in culture. Simply put you can\u2019t find a group of best-in-class operators like these anywhere else. The success of our model extends far beyond the investment platform. Our capital partnerships are similarly outstanding. During the second quarter, we completed an ambitious $1 billion equity offering and earlier this week we announced the closing of our new $3.23 billion credit facility. We have unparalleled and for some time now uninterrupted access to capital. This is our covenant with our operating partners to deliver the most flexible capital to help grow their businesses. Other than becoming the CEO of HCN in April, which I think I covered on our Q1 call and in numerous meeting with investors and analysts, we\u2019ve had a few other noteworthy milestones in the second quarter. Our Board elected Jeff Mayer as the director. Jeff is the former CFO of HCR Manor Care, and serves as the Director of HCA, one of the world\u2019s leading operators of hospitals. Our ability to attract directors of this caliber speaks directly to the quality of our company and being a corporate governance leader. We are proud and delighted to welcome Jeff to our board. On our last call, I mentioned that that we would be expanding our London office and John Goodey, who joined the company during the quarter to run our London office is on the call with us today here in Toledo. I worked with John in London and we\u2019ve been colleagues for two decades. John will offer some brief thoughts about our global investment platform. But first, I\u2019ll turn the mike over to Scott Brinker for more detail on our outstanding operating and new investment result this quarter. Scott? Scott A. Estes: Okay, thanks, Tom, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m excited to share with you how (indiscernible) is building on its momentum. Our class-A portfolio is leading the way with another quarter of fantastic growth. Same store NOI grew 4.4% marking fifteen consecutive quarters above 3%. We complimented that growth with just under $600 million of new investments, nearly all with existing partners. We have more than 30 partners out looking for opportunities in their core markets. When they find something attractive, they come to us for the capital, it\u2019s a tremendous model. Our relationships drive consistent to deal flow and better pricing. Let\u2019s turn to the portfolio review starting with seniors housing. The demographic supporting this business are powerful. The target market is the age 80 plus population which will double in size over the next two decades. The near term outlook is also favorable. Demand is growing faster than supply in a vast majority of our markets. As a result, same-store NOI in the operating portfolio grew 7.7%. Occupancy, rate and margin all moved higher. Success in seniors housing requires two things; good real estate and a good operator. We\u2019ve been exceptionally disciplined about bold points. Quarter-after-quarter you\u2019re seeing the benefits of that discipline. In organic growth rate that exceeds our benchmarks, often by a wide margin. Here are two numbers that demonstrate the quality of the portfolio. Our monthly rents are 50% higher than the national average, and housing values in our local markets are 75% above the national average. The Sunrise Investment has been a tremendous success. When we announced the merger in late 2012, we told the market to expect a 6% initial yield. Just 18 months later our initial yield \u2013 our yield on investment is 7%. Half of the improvement is from NOI growth and the balance is from attractive prices that we negotiated on joint venture buy-outs. The current market value of our $4.3 billion Sunrise investment is about $6 billion. Turning to triple-net seniors housing, the portfolio is all about predictable growth. Same-store NOI increased 3%, right in line with guidance. Payment coverage remains at comfortable levels and is at the high-end of the peer group. Moving to skilled nursing, our rental income is well secured and growing consistently. Same-store NOI increased 2.9% in line with expectations. For public reporting we\u2019ll soon separate our skilled nursing portfolio into two segments, post-acute and long-term care. Although they shared the same skilled nursing licensure, these are two very different businesses. They have different payers, patients and cap rates. Post-acute trades in the sevens while long-term care trade in the eights and nines. We like the post acute business outlook because it helps reduce healthcare spending by getting patients out of the hospital. We continue to invest into this sector with top quality providers like Genesis. Medical office, we own and manage nearly 15 million square feet of outpatient medical space. This is a highly predictable income stream for HCN due to the high tenant retention. Our in-house property management team is doing a great job keeping the buildings full. As a result, same-store NOI increased 2.1% last quarter at the high end of guidance. Investments, the market continues to be active. Capital is flowing into this sector because of attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our relationships are more important than ever, allowing us to find opportunity in a crowded market. Our partners help us generate nearly $600 million of investments last quarter. The initial cash yield was 6.8%, very profitable given that our spot cost of capital is in the low fives. Our activity included follow-on acquisition with Revera, Genesis and Senior Lifestyles. Follow-on business at attractive yield is our best measure of success, a forward-looking measure that our strategy is working. Why do the industry\u2019s leading operators choose HCN? One, consistent low cost access to the capital markets. Two, a shared vision of making the industry better. It sounds soft, but it\u2019s incredibly important. Remember that the best healthcare providers have a mission beyond profits. Three, scale, which is important for group purchasing. Four, analytics an example is our expense benchmarking tool that leverages our 700 plus senior housing assets to give our partners new insight into their business. And five, strategic advice, by sitting on the Board of many of our partners, these make HCN unique. We are playing on a different field than other capital providers. Dispositions, we raised $141 million of capital last quarter by selling non-core assets for a $13 million gain. We continue to be proactive in selling the bottom tier of our portfolio, this helps us maintain the highest quality income stream in this sector. Our investments so far have been concentrated domestically. The pipeline includes activity outside the U.S., John Goodey who now runs our London office is going to comment on international. John? John Goodey : Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m excited to joined HCN at such a strong time for us. Our international investment plan will follow HCN\u2019s well proven investment and partnering strategy, and is highly focused and foolproof. We see it as a logical progressive extension to our U.S. investment platform. With the opening of our expanded international office in London, we believe HCN is in an advantage position and able to develop sustainable leadership in our chosen international markets. HCN has already build a number one position in the attractive UK prime elderly market, which is essentially the same as the U.S. assisted living industry. Importantly, we are seeing strong same-store NOI and rental coverage increases across our UK portfolio. Working with our existing UK partners and beyond, we have a pipeline of high quality developments and investment opportunities; and as Scott said, we believe we will be active in the near term. Hopefully in the future, we will have the opportunity to host some of you in our new London office and tell you more about our investment opportunities. With that, I'll hand over to Scott Estes, our CFO. Scott A. Estes: Great. Thanks John and good morning everyone. My remarks today will focus on the three themes that have emerged over the last several quarters. First, our second quarter financial and operating performance exceeded expectations and exemplify our platform's earnings power. Second, we support our financial performance with the prudent balance sheet management and a significantly improved our credit metrics and capital availability as of June 30. And third we were increasing our 2014, guidance for the second time this year to reflect the strength of our second quarter results. I will begin my more detailed comments by taking a look at our second quarter financial performance. Our platform continues to generate superior earnings growth. Normalized FFO increased to a record $1.06 per share for the second quarter. While normalized FAD came in at $0.94 per share representing a strong 14% and 15% year-over-year increase respectively. Results were primarily driven by the same-store cash NOI increase and $2.7 billion of investments completed over the prior 12 months. G&A for the second quarter excluding expenses related to our CEO transition came in at $32 million in line with our expectations. We will pay our 173rd consecutive quarterly cash dividends on August 20 of $0.795 per share or $3.18 annually representing a current dividend yield of 5%. I note that our FFO and FAD payout ratio through the second quarter declined to 75% and 85% respectively. As we continue to strive to enhance our disclosure, I note that we\u2019ve added pictures of every U.S. based asset in our RIDEA portfolio this quarter to the portfolio map on our website, as well as some photos of our most recent MOBs acquired during the quarter. And we will continue to add photos from our portfolio, as they become available. Turning now to our liquidity picture in balance sheet in terms of capital markets activity the highlight of the second quarter was our secondary equity offering, which settled in early June. We completed the sale of 6.1 million shares of common equity at $62.35 per share, generating $1 billion in gross proceeds. This was the largest overnight offering completed not just by any REITs, but by any company and any industry in 2014, based on total gross proceeds, which speaks to the capital markets continued support of our strategy. In addition to the secondary offering, we issued 1 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program during the quarter generating $62 million in proceeds. We also repaid approximately $75 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.8% during the quarter and assumes $12 million of secured debt associated with an acquisition at 4.1% rate. On the bank capital front, this past Monday we were pleased to announce that we closed on a new $3.23 billion unsecured credit facility consisting of a revolving line of credit, U.S. term loan and Canadian term loan. This is the largest credit facility in the Health Care REIT sector and among the largest in the entire REIT industry providing us with considerable flexibility in financing our future growth. We have an option to up size the facility by an addition of $1 billion through an accordion feature and can borrow up to $500 million in alternate currencies. Broadly speaking our new line enhances our liquidity and financial flexibility by increasing the capacity in a revolver by $250 million, lowering the average cost by more than 15 basis points and extending the duration through October of 2018 with an option to extend by an additional year at our discretion. This is an excellent outcome for the company and we\u2019re appreciative of the outstanding support provided by the 28 banks that comprise our new syndicate. As a result of our capital activity in line renewal, we\u2019re in an outstanding liquidity position at quarter end. More specifically, we have the full $2.5 billion line of credit available and $207 million in cash and additional $318 million of pending dispositions throughout the remainder of 2014 and are generating an additional $60 million of equity per quarter through our dividend reinvestment program. We have limited near term debt maturities with only $123 million of debt maturing through year end 2014. Our balance sheet and financial metrics at quarter end improved across the board as a result of our successful equity offering, all of which are now in line with our strategic target levels. As of June 30, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization was 39.8%, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined to 5.7 times, while our adjusted interest in fixed charge coverage improved nicely to 3.7 times and 2.9 times respectively. As a result of the secured debt paid off during the second quarter, secured debt as a percentage of total assets declined 50 basis point to 12.1%. I\u2019ll conclude my comments today with an update on 2014 guidance and our supporting assumptions. I\u2019ll begin with our same store cash NOI growth outlook. Given our strong second quarter results, we are increasing our 2014 forecast from the previous level of 3.5% to a range of 3.5% to 4%. The increase is largely based on the strength of the seniors housing operating portfolio as our same-store cash NOI forecasts for the remaining components of our portfolio remain unchanged. In terms of our investment expectations, there are no acquisitions included in our guidance beyond what we\u2019ve announced through the second quarter. Our guidance does include $69 million of additional development conversions throughout the remainder of the year at a blended projected yield upon conversion of 8.1%. Our forecast now includes $450 million of dispositions at a blended yield on sale of 9.5% representing an increase from the previous expectation of $250 million. The increase is primarily related to the potential sales of an additional acute care hospital asset later this year as we capitalize on another source of liquidity and wind down the disposition of non-strategic assets. There is no change to our annual capital expenditure forecast of $66 million for 2014 comprised of approximately $46 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio, and the remaining $20 million from the medical facilities portfolio. Our 2014 CapEx as a percentage of NOI for both segments is still expected to run in the 7% to 9% range, which we believe is an appropriate level to maintain the quality of our portfolio. In terms of G&A, there is no change to our annual forecast of approximately $125 million for the full year, excluding the impact of our CEO transition expenses. And finally, we\u2019ve increased our normalized FFO and FAD per share guidance for the full year as a result of our strong second quarter operating results and investment activity. I think it\u2019s important to note that the strength of our quarterly results allowed us to increase both FFO and FAD guidance by $0.02 per share, despite a $200 million increase in our disposition guidance and the additional shares issued through our June equity offering. As a result, we are increasing our normalized 2014 FFO guidance to a range of $4.05 to $4.15 per diluted share, and our FAD guidance to $3.57 to $3.67 per diluted share, both of which now represent a strong year-over-year increase of 6% to 9%. That concludes my prepared remarks, but I would finish by saying, we feel great about our financial results. Our enhanced credit metrics and the improved financial flexibility provided by our new line of credit heading into the second half of the year. And at this point in time, I will turn it back to you for some closing comments. Thomas J. DeRosa: Thanks, Scott. I want to close by thanking everyone on our call for your support by awarding HCN the highest multiple among our peers. You recognize the unique value in our platform, a platform that can deliver the type of strong predictable results we\u2019re sharing today, quarter-after-quarter. HCN\u2019s business is different, we\u2019re deeply engaged in the healthcare industry, not just as a source of capital. We are unique in establishing a setup quantitative metrics and qualitative initiatives to help drive the seniors housing, skilled nursing and post-acute, MOB and acute care delivery systems forward. Together with our partners, we are developing the most of effective environments to improve healthcare outcomes. Here\u2019s a simple message; we are keeping people out of acute care hospital beds, that\u2019s the key to driving down healthcare costs and living within the Affordable Healthcare Act. It\u2019s a big and important job, and HCN is uniquely qualified to do it. Holy, please open up the line for questions. Operator :  (Operator instruction) And your first question will come from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citi. Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, Tom, maybe we can tell your last comment to \u2013 a comment that Scott made, with the hospital sale, I think Scott mentioned that you\u2019re capitalizing on the opportunity, how much of that is overlaid with sort of your view for the Affordable Care Act, and sort of other ships in the medical landscape, and is that \u2013 is the hospital business one that you just don\u2019t want to be in, in general? Thomas J. DeRosa:  I\u2019d say, Emmanuel, right now, I would say the hospital business is not a prime focus of ours, but what we want to do is, align ourselves with the best hospital systems to work with them to develop the best outpatient facilities, that\u2019s really what our focus is, and also creating links with our other sectors like seniors housing and post-acute. We think there are some powerful \u2013 there\u2019s some very powerful connectivity that can be created between top-quality health systems, top-quality seniors housing, top-quality post-acute. So that\u2019s really where we\u2019re focused, but owning hospitals is not really priority for us today. Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  And then, John, welcome to call. A couple of quick questions for you, do you see yourselves focusing on acquisitions or development or both and maybe within what types of assets as we look sort of globally? John Goodey :  Sure. So I think firstly we are following the same model we have in the U.S., so our partners are brining us opportunities both in the developments and in the acquisitions, and you know obviously our sort of near $2 billion investment in the UK will give you an idea of where those opportunities in the short term will lie. Yeah I think beyond that obviously we\u2019ve titled it international as opposed to UK. So I think we do look over time to clearly look internationally. But I think again we\u2019ll follow the same sort of strategy that we\u2019ve used here in the U.S. and in the UK, and do that in a measured way, and do it only in the best markets and with the best operators. I think it\u2019s probably a little bit premature right now to say, we see this or this country as the absolute preferred country within Europe or beyond. But I think as we go forward we\u2019ll be able to give a little bit more guidance on that, but right now, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got a great pipeline of opportunity with our existing operators and within our existing country the UK. Emmanuel Korchman \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Great. Thanks guys. Thomas J. DeRosa: Thanks, Emm. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Otayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Omotayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Hi, good morning. First of all congrats on the really, really solid quarter that was good to see. Two questions from our end, first of all the, could you just give an update on Genesis there in regards to portfolio performance? Scott M. Brinker: Otayo, its Scott speaking, Genesis is performing right on plan. So they continue to have solid payment coverage. Direct payment is well secured for gaining market share occupancy and quality mix are trending higher recently, so we are very comfortable with. Genesis has an operator we made a big investment with them three years ago, and our thesis was that they\u2019ve best pet persecute provider in the space, and it done nothing to suggest otherwise in a three year sense. Omotayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Okay. Our patient volume trends improving in general are you starting to see more of that or its still kind of somewhat weak? Scott M. Brinker: I would say it\u2019s more flat, I mean it bounces around quarter-to-quarter depending upon the season, but overall it\u2019s pretty flat. Omotayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC : Great. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then second of \u2013 could you just talk a little bit, the environment in general for doing big acquisitions, I mean, on each quarter you guys continue to do very well with the original operators, but the world of billion dollar deals whether its seniors housing or MOB or what have you. What that were looks like \u2013 there will be a lot of transactions out there, what cap rates look like, who is bidding for this stuff responsibly winning some other stuff that kind of color would be helpful. Scott M. Brinker: Otayo, its Scott speaking again. I\u2019d say we are as capable as anyone of doing a big transaction structure and creativity access to capital standpoint, but that\u2019s not the primary way that we\u2019ve grown our business, the pricing there tends to be a lot tighter. We tend to buy big portfolios with similar quality assets, and our model has trend to be back our existing partners selective aquisition and development. So it\u2019s much more disciplined, but there are times when it makes sense to buy a big portfolio. So you\u2019ll see us look at all of that, we\u2019ll just be more selective than some others. Yeah, just echoing what Scott just said, Tyler, I think that, again our business model is different from others in this sector. We work very closely with the best operators, and look at acquisition with them, and work on their development plans together, and that\u2019s why we like to say, we offer predicable new investment growth, because the fact is, there is going to be more and more demand for top quality seniors housing and post-acute particularly, just based on the demographic trends. So we will continue to build those businesses with the operators, and will occasionally bring in other new operators, you\u2019ve seen us to do that, we did in the first quarter, and where we don\u2019t have visibility, necessarily is on the bigger deals, now you should assume that, there is no big deal that will be done that we won\u2019t take a look at, and sometimes we\u2019ll do them, and they make strategic sense for us, but you will never see us growing for the sake of just putting numbers on the board, that\u2019s not how we run our business. Omotayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC :  That\u2019s helpful. Just diving in a little deeper on that, could you give us a sense of just what cap rates look like for some of the bigger deals in the marker for some of the major property type? Scott A. Estes:  Well, we didn\u2019t participate in the last two, and they reported a yield around 6% or assets that at least in our mind were not of the quality of things that we\u2019re buying. So that gives you a sense of where our bigger portfolios are trading at least for senior housing? Omotayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC :  Okay Scott A. Estes:  Thank you. Omotayo T. Okusanya \u2013 Jefferies LLC :  Sure, thanks. Operator :  And your next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  And the question, can you give us a bit more color on the MOB acquisitions you did, kind of where were they, what are seeing in the market today specifically in terms of competition, and just may be you gave some interesting stats on the quality of the portfolio as well, how does brand retention compared to what you\u2019ve seen over the last year or so? Scott A. Estes:  Yeah, this is Scott speaking. We did $260 million of medical office acquisition in the quarter, and yield was just below 6.5% , 10 buildings; all of then affiliated with the health system, our examples of HCA, since Eurohealth showed big quality systems, the types that we want to be sponsoring our outpatient medical buildings. And the average age was 2010, so these are very modern buildings without much meat to roll, highly occupied, 95% plus on average; and so hopefully that gives you a sense of, the types of assets that we\u2019re buying. Vikram Malhotra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And just overall, in terms of the retention that you\u2019ve reported in terms of tenant retention, is that pretty comparable to what you\u2019ve seen over the last year or so? Scott A. Estes:  Yeah, it\u2019s been pretty steady right around 80% for really several years in a row. Now Mike Noto and his team at our Internal Property Management Group do a terrific job of building relationships with tenants, and keeping them in our buildings, it\u2019s a much cheaper way to maintain occupancies and trying to find a new tenant building out the space again. So it is clearly our preferred way to maintain occupancy. Vikram Malhotra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And Tom, one thing, I mean now, obviously you\u2019ve talked quite a bit to us over the last few months, and ever since you joined. But just as you\u2019ve spent more time going over things, any incremental kind of thoughts, positives, negatives in terms what you either learned or what you, where you feel you can take things? Thomas J. DeRosa:  I would say that, no negatives come to mind. I think the surprise for me was how deeply connected the management team here is to the operators. That was something that, as a former director of the company, I can honestly say, I didn\u2019t have a strong and appreciation for. And now actually having met all of our operators and spent time with them, it\u2019s really a \u2013 it\u2019s such a differentiator for this company, and something that I want to make sure that is really appreciated by everyone on this call. And those are not on this call, because that is what is allowing this company really to deliver the kind of results that we delivered today. Vikram Malhotra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks guys, and congrats on the strong results. Thomas J. DeRosa: Thank you. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho. Richard Charles Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Thanks, and good morning. Thomas J. DeRosa: Hey, Rich. Richard Charles Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: So a couple of questions, in terms of the International, can you, John, can you give us a sense of the, kind of the acquisition or investment pipeline that you\u2019re seeing today, I mean what\u2019s the level of deal volume that\u2019s out there, and I think you\u2019ll close on all of it, but that you may looking at. John Goodey :  I think, as we do in the U.S. we maintain a watchful eye over everything that educates us, even if we don\u2019t wish to proceed on particular acquisitions. And I\u2019d say the last six months, we\u2019ve seen a tick up across Europe in assets that are coming to market both on HoldCo basis, but also on property basis as well. And also companies looking to recapitalize themselves both in the financial markets as well as through potential property sales. So, I think the overall volume is good and as I noted before, I think we are going to be highly selective, so a lot of what there \u2013 there is not going to be a HCN style transaction. And clearly, we have confident in the certain area in the UK, that area has been active in the past. We see it being active in the future as well. And but I think beyond that I would say that we are \u2013 we have a very watchful and detailed eye over a number of sectors in a number of countries. So we can educate ourselves and we are working exactly where we wish to place our investments going forward. So the answer is, is the market is liquid? There is opportunity out there, much of it won't be for healthcare REITs, but some of it will be eventually. Richard Charles Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Okay. And maybe said a different way to Tom, US is 88% of the portfolio today. What do you think it could be five years from now? Thomas J. DeRosa: John you give your view and then I will\u2026 John Goodey : Sure. I think clearly and mathematically clearly the opportunity for us to grow the percentage because of the leverage of percentage Europe international and the U.S portfolio. I would say there is enough opportunity for us to, significantly change that if we wish, but we will be judicious in working out, and working on only the best transactions for us, but I would think mathematically, I would hope it will increase over time. Thomas J. DeRosa: Rich. I will tell you that, that we still see such tremendous opportunities for growth in the U.S, so it\u2019s very likely well, our non-U.S portfolio, when I include Canada in that, obviously will be growing. I think you are going to see the U.S. growing tremendously as well. One of the same comments I will make about the UK that I find so interesting. John and I were working with a \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call it a prime elderly, because their assets weren't very prime, but it was a seniors housing company back in the late, mid to late 90s and we travelled all around the UK looking at a product that did not exist in the U.S. we didn\u2019t have really government provided seniors housing in the U.S. We had long term nursing home beds that people were in, but we didn\u2019t \u2013 the government was not providing seniors housing in the U.S, in the late 90s. As you know, the private pay seniors housing business emerged in the 90s. What\u2019s happened - so the U.K understand this product and it is available from the NHS, but as the UK has gotten more affluent particularly London and the southern part of England. There is a recognition that one needs to be, that this \u2013 that one will be in this product when they get into their mid-80s, but there\u2019s also a recognition that, I may have to pay for it. It\u2019s not just a \u2013 my unalienable right that the government, the NHS will provide me long-term housing. And that\u2019s what\u2019s interesting about the UK. So we are together with our operating partners, they are really helping to offer a product that is actually early days. I think we\u2019re seeing the UK start to embrace the fact that, the NHS is not going to take care of my long-term care needs, that I need to do that myself. And we\u2019ve had dialog with people around the UK government, and they\u2019re seeing us as really coming in there and helping to take pressure off the government. The NHS cannot be opting to all people for their healthcare needs, and we\u2019re helping develop the whole notion that there\u2019s a private pay option. And I think that\u2019s really exciting. Richard Charles Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.:  Okay. Another question, and it\u2019s kind of big picture, it\u2019s \u2013 the concept of \u2013 will the day ever come when you\u2019ll think about breaking up the company a little bit in the sense that, may be this \u2013 the parts are more valuable than the whole, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re there yet, but when I think about the medical office side of the ledger, I think those are more capital partners as opposed to your relationships that you have in seniors housing and post-acute. So do you think the day may come where you might look at a large portfolio that have \u2013 you have under the big umbrella and think about a SpinCo type of scenario? Thomas J. DeRosa: : And if you spoke to any component in that physical network we\u2019ve created there, they\u2019re all performing well above where they thought they would be. And at the end of the day, they\u2019re providing a better outcome. And that\u2019s what we need to do, and that\u2019s how hospitals, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t take hospitals out of mix, because they\u2019re going to be penalized if they keep getting back Mr. Jones with the same issue back in that hospital bed. There are negative financial repercussions to seeing an individual keep coming back to that same bed. They need to get them out of the hospital, they need to improve the outcome, and I think the connectivity is one of the ways we\u2019re going to make that happen. Richard Charles Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: So, on the topic of SpinCo, the answer is basically no at this point? Thomas J. DeRosa: I never say never, Rich, but the way I see the world today, I would say that\u2019s not something that we are spending anytime thinking about. And I understand that whole SpinCo world, because as you know, I used to run a mall company. Richard Charles Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Right. Last from me and real quick, maybe to Brinker or somebody else, but when you look at, you look at your portfolio of 60% some odd seniors housing, another 15% medical office, some hot property sectors, cap rates going down. If you look at the whole portfolio, could you hazard a guess on what you think a cap rate should be applied to your full NOI stream? Do you have any thought on that? Scott M. Brinker: This is Scott Brinker speaking. I mean based on comparable transaction we\u2019ve seen recently, and adjusting for the quality of our portfolio, I\u2019d put senior housing little higher than 6%, same for medical office and skilled nursing is an interesting one. It\u2019s\u2026 Richard Charles Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Careful Scott, I got my NAV model open here. So I\u2019m just ready for the cap rate number. Scott M. Brinker: We\u2019re in the low-60s, so let\u2019s see where you can come up. Skilled nursing is an interesting one. It\u2019s about 15% of our NOI, and we really think of that as two separate businesses. There\u2019s a post-acute business. Richard Charles Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: Right. Thomas J. DeRosa: It\u2019s highly focused on Medicare, a much shorter stay, typically a much higher quality building, and then there is a long-term care model that most people associate with skilled nursing. Most of our skilled portfolio is post-acute, and we feel like that business has a tremendous outlook, hence you trade in the 7s, whereas long-term care has. I won\u2019t call a bad outlook, but not as favorable. And those assets tend to trade in 8s and 9s. So before long, we are going to separate those two categories so that you can hopefully value differently the way we do. But again, so I would post-acute in the low 7s and\u2026 Richard Charles Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.: I guess 6.5 type number aggregating it all up? Thomas J. DeRosa: At most. It\u2019s probably lower than that given how much of the play is senior housing, and medical office. Richard Charles Anderson \u2013 Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.:  Okay. So I got, thank you. Thomas J. DeRosa: Sure. Scott A. Estes:  Thanks, Rich. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good afternoon or good morning, sorry. Just hoping you could speak a little bit about the post-acute space again, differences in coverage levels between the two different styles of businesses you highlighted. And I don't know if it's too early, but if you could talk about the split within your overall exposure there between those two types of different assets? Scott M. Brinker:  Yeah, Juan, it\u2019s Scott speaking. The payment coverages are pretty similar, we underwrite newer investments to a coverage in the 1.4 times range after management fee, so close to 1.7 and 1.8, and we do that, because reimbursement can be cyclical and we don\u2019t want to take any risk on the income stream. So we\u2019re perfectly comfortable at that type of a level. And then your second question was, if you can repeat it? Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Just a split, I guess the percentage of investments or NOI between two different types short-term, long-term stay? Scott M. Brinker:  Yeah, we\u2019re still trying to figure out exactly how to segregate the two businesses, but roughly of our skilled nursing portfolio, two thirds would be post-acute, and one-third would be long-term care. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then on the RIDEA side of the business, can you talk at all the about any signs of cost pressures currently in the pipeline or in the foreseeable future either on food, labor, or insurance that may present more of a headwind for further margin expansion? Thomas J. DeRosa:  Food and utilities \u2013 well food and insurance are very flat, may be up slightly in part because of our group purchasing program, really no significant pressure on wages, so we still see rates exceeding the growth and expenses, so our margin was up 100 basis points year-over-year, and there should still be some opportunity. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. And just lastly, you\u2019ve provided, I think, on the last call, not sure if it was in the Q&A or in the sort of organized statements ahead of time, the RIDEA growth by region on a same-store basis if you wouldn't mind? Thomas J. DeRosa:  Sure, Juan, it was 7.7 for the whole portfolio. The U.S. was pretty much in line with number, and then the UK was higher and Canada was lower, so similar trends till last quarter. Juan Sanabria \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, that\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Thomas J. DeRosa: Sure. Operator :  And your next question will come from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital :  First question, just back on the dispositions, I just want to make sure, I understand the increase in the dispositions this year. Is it just solely that one hospital at $200 million, and then maybe a little more as to the catalyst for that sale, if it wasn't previously expected, is it just pricing has gotten a little bit better, if volumes or ACA have kicked in? Or were you proactively shopping? I'm just curious what the catalyst was there? Scott A. Estes: Josh, how are you doing? It\u2019s Scott Estes, I\u2019ll start with our, the mix of the $450 million approximately for the year. So, within that $450 million projection overall about 70% of that is hospital assets that 15% skilled nursing 10% MOB and maybe 5% seniors housing. And yes the specific increase there is one potential sale that we think we\u2019re could get among this year that was the driver of the increase, but Scott Brinker, any color you'd add to that. Scott A. Estes: No Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital : Was that hospital \u2013 was that just a one off or are there some medical office buildings or anything else attached to it. Thomas J. DeRosa: We do own the medical office building that\u2019s attach to it. It\u2019s a hospital in California that was expensive to build, and the lease rate was maybe just higher than the hospital wants to pay. So it\u2019s a mutually good outcome, we\u2019ll continue to own the outpatient medical building that\u2019s attached, and the hospital is essentially buying the real estate back from us. Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay. So you're keeping the MOB. And the second question is just on the senior housing operating portfolio, I think last quarter you guys talked about weather, and a couple of things impacting, and you thought maybe the same-store NOI might have been closer to 10%. I'm certainly not scoffing at a 7.7% number in the quarter. But I'm curious if there was any pent-up demand on move-ins, or any sort of reversal of what you saw in the first quarter, in terms of those pressures. I mean did the second quarter benefit at all a little bit, or do you think this was a more of a pretty good run rate number? Thomas J. DeRosa: Well, we hope it's a good run rate number. It's kind of hard to exceed, one thing that we are on into as even though the business is doing fantastic and occupancy is trending up, compared to quarters are just getting higher and higher as a threshold. So, we hope we can grow 8% rather that seems unlikely, despite the quality of the real estate, what we\u2019ve told people though, and we continue to believe is that, we think we\u2019ll outperform this sector consistently, because of the quality of the real estate and the operators. Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital : Got you. Okay. And then last question, maybe as you guys are seeing the CEO transition, and obviously you've done a lot of investments with your existing partners, your existing relationships, are you guys working on any new relationships, I don't know if it's bringing any sort of additional partners into the mix? Are you guys seeing any increase in external parties will call and that are interested in working with you guys? Scott M. Brinker: Hi, Josh, it\u2019s Scott speaking. I would say there is a handful of operators in the U.S., UK and Canada that we\u2019d like to add to the portfolio, but its not a huge number most of our growth is going to be with existing partners. And I think that tells you another thing which is its very difficult to reproduce the market position that we are in. We feel strongly that the high quality operators are a scarce asset. And the investment majority of them have chosen to partner with HCN. So anyone hoping to partner with the caliber of partners that we have, we\u2019ll be looking for a long time because they\u2019re just not out there. Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital :  Okay, thanks. Operator :  The next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets :  Thanks. On your comments you said that, senior housing demand is growing faster than supply in most of your markets. Can you give us some examples of what markets where our supply is the concern, and if that\u2019s just a near term or long-term concern. Thomas J. DeRosa: Sure, Michael. It\u2019s mostly markets where there are low barriers to entry. So think of Dallas and Houston and Denver where there\u2019s a lot of ground and relatively easy entitlements. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing most of the new construction. I guess the good news is there\u2019s huge population growth in all those markets. So for the most part, occupancies are trending up in virtually all of our markets despite some new supply. But if you look at markets like New York City where many of you are on the call, if you\u2019ve ever had to deal with placing a parent or grand parent in a senior\u2019s housing facility, your options are quite limited. There is clearly in that market, which is the market that we have considerable assets in, there is tremendous demand that\u2019s just growing. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s going to be an issue, because there it is very difficult to find good quality places for all of the elderly Americans that will need to be in whether be independent or assisted living in the future. So we are working very closely with our operators, many of them who are the leading names in let\u2019s say the New York City Metropolitan area. We\u2019re working very closely with them to try and figure this out. Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets :  Okay. And then can you guys give us some color on the \u2013 I guess the transaction activity, it looks like you had a lot of good deals, that\u2019s a pretty attractive yields. I mean are you seeing pressure on those yields or do you expect that you can continue to acquire assets around the mid-six range? Thomas J. DeRosa: Our market is definitely competitive. That\u2019s not surprising to us. The risk adjusted cap ratio is really strong against alternatives in the real estate space. So it isn\u2019t surprising to us to see new capital coming to the space. With yields in the mid-6s like last quarter, we can still make a pretty strong spread or profit. Hopefully that continues. We do have a pretty significant pipeline. We\u2019ll see if it closes. So I think that\u2019s a reasonable estimate for where we\u2019re trying to place deals, Michael. Michael Carroll \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay, great. Thanks. Thomas J. DeRosa: Sure. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Nicholas Yulico \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : A couple of questions. Scott, the same store guidance change for the senior housing operating segment I think it was closer to 6% last quarter? Scott A. Estes: It is, we didn\u2019t give a specific number. Obviously it\u2019s been trending a little bit higher. We had advertised 6% last quarter. Our guess would be at least 6% to 6.5% given the start we have to the year in the senior housing operating portfolio. Nicholas Yulico \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : Okay. And you\u2019ve done about 8% year-to-date in that segment. I assume the year-over-year in the second half maybe gets tougher due to tougher occupancy comps. Can you remind us of the occupancy comps for the remainder of the year since we don\u2019t have that data with the same store pool changing this year? Scott A. Estes: I am trying to think about that. We don\u2019t have specific numbers in front of us. Obviously in the supplements, you can see where the same store occupancy was trending in the third and fourth quarter of the year. It was only about 88.8%, 89.2% in the third and fourth quarter of last year were up to 89.3% as of this quarter. So the point is that it\u2019s a reasonably high number but if it does well we can still enhance occupancy. Nicholas Yulico \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : Okay. One way or another it seems like the third quarter and fourth quarter year-over-year same store numbers, you reported that segment December unlike the 4% to 5% range. That sound alright? I mean if you\u2019ve already 8% year-to-date. Scott A. Estes: Yeah, we would help to do better than that, we will see it\u2019s possible. I mean (indiscernible) to say if we end up getting in 5% to 6% that should keep to you a great number and I stand by Scott Brinker\u2019s comments that we still think that our relative portfolio performance will be great vis-\u00e0-vis the other assets in that category. Nicholas Yulico \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : Yeah I mean that's what I was asking about the occupancy because it seems like in this quarter, you had the occupancy is going up, you had rate went up 3%. So whether those trends \u2013 it seems like the occupancy \u2013 unless there's a tough occupancy comp in the second half, it seems like your guidance here seems very doable for senior housing, and operating. And it's probably going to exceed that. Unless there's some occupancy issue we don't know about. Scott A. Estes: No, occupancy is trending higher. So hopefully we\u2019ll continue to beat the guidance. Nicholas Yulico \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : Okay, got it. And then Scott, you talked about Sunrise now being worth about $6 billion of market value today. What yield are you using on that? Like an after CapEx type of cap rate? Scott A. Estes: After CapEx, it generally hasn\u2019t helped people think about cap rates, but something in the mid-5s given the scale and quality, locations, high quality operator, I think that\u2019s being conservative given some of the pricing we\u2019ve seen on big deals recently. Nicholas Yulico \u2013 UBS Investment Bank :  So it\u2019s about, you said a mid-5 would that would assume, that would include maintenance CapEx, but it\u2019s closer to six if it\u2019s without maintenance CapEx? Thomas J. DeRosa:  I\u2019m just giving you an NOI figure, so no CapEx deduction, which is typically all, the market report cap rates. Nicholas Yulico \u2013 UBS Investment Bank :  Okay. So mid-5 cap rate for Sunrise for the $6 billion. Thomas J. DeRosa:  Yeah. And that\u2019s being conservative, we certainly wouldn\u2019t sell it for that. Nicholas Yulico \u2013 UBS Investment Bank :  Got you. And if I go back to \u2013 it looks like you own, in the supplemental, you own about 10,000 units at Sunrise. That would imply that the per-bed valuation of Sunrise is somewhere around $600,000 a bed. And you bought it in the $400,000 a bed. I mean, at what point, for those of us also looking at multi-family, where per-bed valuations of $600,000 tend to be only in cities or coastal California, and you can actually build for that or cheaper today. I mean at what point \u2013 is there a ceiling in senior housing valuations, when your per bed gets up to these levels, that are now on par or even maybe exceeding the best multi-family across the country? Thomas J. DeRosa:  Yeah. It\u2019s not that far above replacement costs, we\u2019re building some assets with Sunrise right now. You have to keep in mind the locations. These aren\u2019t market in suburban markets in Dallas, these are in infill markets in Los Angeles, and Long Island and London. And the cost of construction in those markets today is at least $400,000 per unit, that\u2019s without any of the working capital or the five years it takes to get entitled. So I know those numbers sound high, but that\u2019s what it costs, and that\u2019s the timeline to get something built in the markets where Sunrise portfolio is locate, so it\u2019s a big number at 600,000 unit, I agreed, but it\u2019s also very indicative of what it would cost to replace those building. Nicholas Yulico \u2013 UBS Investment Bank :  All right. And then I guess, just to follow-up, does that end point to in those markets, if there is a piece of land that could go for senior housing or multi-family, the yield to develop multi-family is going to be a lot higher at a similar per bed, which we point to it being that much more difficult to build senior housing than multi-family in some of these coastal markets, which benefits you guys? Thomas J. DeRosa:  Yeah. I think that\u2019s true. And I think it goes to what I was, the point I was making before, Nick about just the New York City metropolitan area how difficult it is, for instance you\u2019d be hard for us to find good quality seniors housing beds on the island of Manhattan. So, it\u2019s \u2013 these markets are, they are toughs. But they need to have seniors housing alternatives. Nicholas Yulico \u2013 UBS Investment Bank : All right. Thanks everyone. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Karin Ford with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Hi, good morning, just a question on the development pipeline. You don't have any conversions after 2015, 2016, and 2017. There are zero right now. Is that by design, or do you hope to backfill that pipeline, and how are the prospects for it, if so? Scott A. Estes: Yeah Karin, we are doing a fair amount of construction, not all of it is fully on balance sheet there are certain operators like Silverado and Brandywine where we do essentially a development lease and provide all the real estate capital. But we are also doing a number of programs with other partners in our portfolio that it\u2019s more like a mezzanine program, where we\u2019ve got a small amount of money to help them get the project funded or built, and then we have a purchase option, not an obligation, but in option generally at a predetermined price or formulate cap rate that allows us to buy the property either once it opens or wanted to stabilizes, and that price is typically below fair market value. And there\u2019s a fairly large number of those that should result in some substantial acquisition volume and 2015, 2016 and beyond. Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay. That's helpful, and that's the preferred method of investment in development from here? Scott A. Estes: We do a fair amount of it. Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay. And then just another question on the international investment side, what would you say is your required risk premium for investing in the UK, on an apples-to-apples basis? And do you see those premier going higher as you looking at additional countries around the world? Scott A. Estes: It depends on the location. So we talk about the UK, but we really have to talk about specific markets within the UK and most of our assets are in London and there is no risk premium there, if anything it\u2019s the reverse, given the dynamism of that market and depth of demand. The south of England is comparable, very high quality locations, fantastic demographics the further north you get, the higher the risk premium. Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay. So no risk premium investing in London, versus say investing in a like product in the New York City area for example? Scott A. Estes: Not today. I mean one would argue that London and New York are probably the best comps for each other and one could also argue that the growth characteristics of the London market would even outstrip New York. Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay. And then just last question, the CMS ruling last night, the 2% rate growth for skilled nursing, what impact do you think that'll have on your Genesis coverage from here? Scott A. Estes: No material impact, so its inline with expectations, it\u2019s better than we\u2019ve seen in certain recent year. So, that should allow them to maintain coverage. Karin Ford \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets : Okay. Thank you. Scott A. Estes: Thanks Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Hi guys, question on senior housing operating. Just curious your thoughts, when you look ahead, what's your thought on the mix of top line growth that you're thinking about between say pricing power versus occupancy gains? Scott A. Estes: Michael it\u2019s Scott speaking, it\u2019s really a location specific trade-off and an operator specific trade-off. Either one is fine with us, as long as they generate the revenue growth and the NOI growth, it\u2019s been in the 4% to 5% range the last few quarters that seems to be the right trend looking forward. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors : And what's a full occupancy rate that you would strive for? Scott A. Estes: The portfolio in the 89% range today its possible to get into the 92%, 93% range that would be really strong I don\u2019t see that happen in next year, but you think about what\u2019s possible I think that\u2019s the high end. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Okay, thanks. And then it looked like this quarter you did more senior housing triple net investments on the RIDEA side. I'm just curious if that's representative of a shift in thinking or risk appetite, or just how the deals shook out? Scott A. Estes: Yeah, it\u2019s the latter, we like to invest using goal structures and this quarter it just happen the two of our big triple net operators came to us with opportunities. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Okay. And then sort of along those lines, when you're thinking about perspective investment activity, how much do you think about or consider target portfolio weightings? Is that a governor in some cases or an objective? Scott A. Estes: Yeah, there is definitely a framework that we think about that guides all decisions. But we have to be opportunistic at some level and take what's available. But the important piece for us is that always buy a highest quality assets in back the top quality providers. That\u2019s the most important decision, but we do think about the portfolio allocation in a strategic way and we don\u2019t want to get too far out of balance. Thomas J. DeRosa: All right. We just in fact presented that to our Board yesterday, just they are very interested in understanding the \u2013 our portfolio management metrics. So this something we talk about a lot. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Okay, thanks. And then just thinking about your investment activity going forward, I guess you don't include each acquisition in your guidance. So just more conceptually, when you think about investments over the back half of the year, how is the pipeline looking? You've been fairly consistent so far this year, $500 million, $600 million a quarter. Just curious, any thoughts on what we might expect to see? Scott A. Estes: I think that, we are looking at a number of interesting opportunities in the \u2013 generally from the way that we source our opportunity, that\u2019s we\u2019ve talked a lot about on the call today Michael. And so I think our past performance is no indication of future performance I think you have been seeing us generate a similar level of new investment volume from our relationship machine. So I think that\u2019s probably the best indication I could give you of where will be through the later part of the year. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Okay, and then a question, I guess this would be for Tom or maybe Scott Estes. But Tom, in your closing remarks, you mentioned that HCN trades with the highest multiple in the sector. And that essentially the equity market has re-rated HCN over time. As you think about ways to grow into that multiple in the future and to continue to attract investors, obviously you have internal growth, external growth. But curious how much time you guys spend thinking about the opportunity to get re-rated in the debt market over time, and is that another way to continue to grow your cash flow over time? Thomas J. DeRosa:  So, Michael I think about that all the time. It actually wakes me up at night. I would tell you, I think one of the things that I am really focused on making sure people understand is our internal growth capabilities. I think that\u2019s a differentiator. I had one large investor say to me who invests in other sectors of healthcare including med tech, med device, biotech and said gee. I have a hard time finding names in those sectors that can grow internally north of 7% and they traded multiples two to three times higher than you. So that\u2019s one of the things I think about all the time Scott you got a thought on that? Scott A. Estes: The only perspective I would add is that we think about maximizing value all the time for both our equity and our debt holders and actually within our evaluation and compensation structure we have both relative, equity multiple components as well as the balance sheet and credit metrics and cost of debt components, so how we think about how we are doing successfully. So it\u2019s definitely part of everything and we think we are doing well but want to do better on both fronts. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors : I guess just more specifically on the debt side, it seems like that could be an opportunity over time, right? Thomas J. DeRosa: Sure. We clearly deserve a better rating. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Okay, that\u2019s it from me. Thanks. Thomas J. DeRosa: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Hi, thanks. Just about everything has been answered so far. Except I guess we\u2019re thinking about the international investments one more time, and looking out over the next year or two, what do you think the split will be between the UK prime elderly and any other product type in the UK or just elsewhere in the continent or some other place? Thomas J. DeRosa: Yeah, I think from a \u2013 we are well invested in our relationship in UK environment, so we have extremely good contact with all of the providers there on the prime elderly side as well as in the other sub sectors there. I think given our footprint a bit like the U.S. for sure given our capability of generating investment opportunities from within our existing portfolio, it\u2019s clearly going to be lead of what we do in the next 12 to 18 months. We\u2019ll come out of the UK prime elderly just because of the backdrop which we found ourselves in. I think we clearly want to grow outside of that, that\u2019s our plan. As we\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times before, some of these will be opportunistic as well as that\u2019s trying to deliver proprietary transactions. That\u2019s very hard to give you a balanced sense to say we envisage 50%, prime elderly of 50% other things or 25% in the consent extra. But I think we will continue to place our model over the opportunities we see in the marketplace to see what they fits us and working on that basis, we drive the absolute potentials that we deliver. Michael Mueller \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay, that\u2019s it. Thanks. Thomas J. DeRosa: Thanks. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And your next question will come from the line of Rob Mains with Stifel Nicolaus. Rob Mains \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Thanks, Scott. The de modification we talked between post-acute and long-term care, is this going to be the do you envision this being building by building or will it be kind of more portfolio or operator specific. Thomas J. DeRosa: Probably building by building. Rob Mains \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. But don't you have a continuum that you got to draw a line of demarcation in the middle of? Thomas J. DeRosa: Yes, well any building will be in one category or the others and some to our point will be purely post-acute and some will be almost purely posted long-term care. So we haven\u2019t quite determined exactly what that dividing line will be but that\u2019s the concept. Rob Mains \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus :  Okay. And then I do have one, since it's late, kind of in the weeds numbers question. In the quarter, you had a pretty significant increase in the FFO contribution from equity income of unconsolidated JVs, and included in that number was a $4.5 million true-up. I just wanted to know whether given that, we should use the current quarter as a run rate or something more akin to what we saw in Q1? And if you don't have that detail in front of you, I can call you back later. Scott A. Estes:  I do have it, Rob. In short that number should go down a bit more to a first quarter levels in the second half of the year, and with that line is \u2013 where HCN is a minority owner, so if there\u2019s a thing such as transaction cost around the Sunrise management company deal or SRG acquisition where we\u2019re a minority owner, there\u2019s accelerated amortization of intangibles. So that number is a little bit higher by that $4.5 million this quarter, but it should essentially not be there next quarter. Rob Mains \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus :  Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks, that's all I had. Operator :  The next question will come from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC:  Hi, good morning, guys. Just going back quickly to new development. Your construction yields remained fairly elevated at 8% plus despite acquisition cap rates that continue to head lower. How to you categorize pressure, if any on development yields? Just particularly are the arbitrage between building yields and market yields remains so wide? Scott M. Brinker:  Sure, Todd, this is Scott speaking. The capital that\u2019s entering this space is looking at acquisition and development. So I think both are being impacted in similar ways, so there has been some acquisition cap rate pressure over the past 12 months, and the same is true development yields, we try to maintain a much larger spread whenever we fund development, just because of the internet risk. Both the lease-up as well as time, value and money. So generally we\u2019ve been able to get in the neighborhood of 150 to 200 basis points of premium for development. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to regard. Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Yeah. That seems like a longstanding spread. Has that come in a little bit recently? Scott M. Brinker:  No. I don\u2019t think so. We have intentionally made these specific transactions, Todd. Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay. And just in the past, I would say your development exposure, broadly speaking, weighed on your valuation, but really not anymore. Is that a fair assessment? Tom, you talked about valuation before. But have investors either have a higher comfort in your development, or just represented by a smaller percentage of the overall portfolio? Scott M. Brinker:  I think a little above there. I do think people have grown comfortable with our development capabilities. So overtime look about they come from again, they come from relationships. Todd Stender \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Great, thank you. Thomas J. DeRosa:  Thanks. Operator : And your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Hey, guys let\u2019s just come back to the pricing power question on senior housing and operating. Can you help me understand the pricing power that you have or you think have with respect of rates or service income? When we look at your average RevPAR being so high so far above the national average, just curious your sense of perspective of residence start to push back or it is some understand the pricing dynamic there and the power you have. Thomas J. DeRosa: I am sure some has in its push back (indiscernible) on the equvalibrum and we hear about that from variety of sources occasionally. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors :  But Michael for the last three or four years, the average rate growth in the operating portfolio is in the 3.5% to 4% as an average. And that\u2019s roughly twice the national average that is reported by NIC. It\u2019s also got twice the rate of inflation. You know part of that is the fact that occupancy has which is moved higher more but more importantly just where the bills are located. And afterwards sounded them in the higher quarterly. The buildings are provided a service that people are going to pay right. Michael, I think you\u2019ve recently toured some of our LA area properties? Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors :  Yeah that\u2019s right. Scott A. Estes:  Yeah so you understand that for instance the Belmont property on (indiscernible). If you are lucky enough to have \u2013 to be able to live there, I think because \u2013 Belmont will have tremendous pricing power because of that location, because of the quality service and I think that it has community of residence that for most part are fairly resilient financially, and while they may not like the increases that will be pushed on to them they are not going to move out because of that and they are getting superior service in a superior location. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Right and I understand Scott your comments as well about how strong it\u2019s been past years I guess just looking forward do you expect that type of above inflation pricing power will continue? Scott A. Estes: No, we hope so, not sure that it\u2019s going to be twice as high as inflation like it has been. But we would expect a premium. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Okay thanks, and then on the disposition side I think you guys have now sold $2 billion or $2.5 billion if I recall over the past couple of years including this year in that total. And just curious when you think about \u201915 and beyond, should we continue thinking of some dispositions when we think about where your earnings are going to come in or you mostly done? Scott A. Estes:  I think we\u2019ll always recycle some level of assets and look to be proactive in managing the portfolio but my guess would be and it feels like the strategic disposition effort is winding down. So I think it would be a lower number than you\u2019ve seen on average over the last two or three years. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Okay. And then on the balance sheet, Tom, we were all pleased to see the equity offering and see that leverage come down a little bit. Just curious your sense or Scott, your sense of how much more improvement you anticipate over the next couple of years with respect to your leverage and sort of turning to the last recent question that I asked about cost of debt and balance sheet. Thomas J. DeRosa: Michael, I\u2019m quite comfortable with the range that we are at and I think as I mentioned on may be the prior question or two, I think we deserve an upgrade. I think we are very focused on liquidity here and the quality of our balance sheet. I think we have a very good quality balance sheet. Our metrics are where they should be. I don\u2019t think I would be in favor of raising equity just to pay down debt beyond where we are today. I think we have a comfortable band that we\u2019ve operated in with respect to the balance sheet over the last couple of years and I would expect it\u2019s going to stay there, but another thing that wakes me up at night is our rating. And so I\u2019m going to be spending some time with the rating agencies trying to get them to understand our business a little better and hopefully awarding us a higher debt rating. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors : Even if you don\u2019t want to distrait the lever, what about continuing to just fund additional investment activity with greater proportion of new equity like you did this last quarter as a way to further improve the balance sheet? Scott A. Estes: Yeah. We look at all possibilities Michael and I think that is what\u2019s important to us is having as many ores in the capital waters as possible and we\u2019ll always do \u2013 every decision we make is based on what\u2019s in the best interest of the shareholder and that\u2019s how we manage our balance sheet. And again, we are exploring lots of different ways to attract capital here knowing that the capital markets may not always be accommodating as they\u2019ve been in the last few years. So again, flexibility is most \u2013 is paramount here. Michael Knott \u2013 Green Street Advisors :  Okay. Thanks for answering all the questions. We\u2019d like to see even lower leverage. Thank you. Thomas J. DeRosa:  Okay, Michael. Thank you. Operator :  And that will conclude the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s conference call. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for their participation, and this will conclude today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although HCN believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company's filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Tom DeRosa. Tom? Thomas J. DeRosa: Thanks, Jeff. The strong third quarter financial results we announced this morning are a tribute to HCN's people, partners and industry-leading business model, a model that has been built not over years, but decades. Our unique model provides strong and predictable cash flow growth, new investment growth, dividend and debt coverage and access to capital that is delivering for our shareholders on all fronts. Here are a few highlights of the quarter. Same store NOI for the entire portfolio grew 4.3%, and our seniors housing operating portfolio posted an outstanding 7.6% growth. I'll let Scott Brinker provide you with more detail about how we achieved these industry-leading results. But as I've said in the past, it's about partnering with the top operators in health systems who own the best health care real estate in the best markets. We were happy to welcome HealthLease and Gracewell to the HCN family during the quarter. With HealthLease, we will acquire an excellent portfolio of seniors housing and Class A post-acute assets for a blended cap rate of approximately 7%. This acquisition also gives us a development pipeline with Zeke Turner's Mainstreet development business to acquire $1.4 billion of their state-of-the-art, next-gen, post-acute facilities. Our Gracewell acquisition in the U.K. provides us with another senior housing brand and develop a pipeline in the more affluent London and Southern England markets. I would also note that Sunrise U.K. will manage the Gracewell assets for us, which is a value add that we were able to deliver to our largest operating partner, Sunrise Assisted Living. Also in the quarter, we were pleased with the announcement that Genesis HealthCare agreed to combine with Skilled Healthcare. This gives HCN's second largest operator access to public capital, further improving the credit quality of our portfolio. We're also happy to see our friend, George Hager, back in the public markets, and we're excited about what this means for the future of our relationship with Genesis. We generated $757 million of accretive investments in the quarter, of which $558 million was generated from our existing team of operators. We've been speaking to this every quarter, as it's another example of the predictability and unique transparency of the external growth component of the HCN model. Our financial results also reflect our history of financial and strategic discipline, whether it's the discipline to dispose of over $2 billion of non-core assets over the past 4 years or the discipline to have raised over $2 billion in equity in the last 6 months to further enhance the strength of our balance sheet. We believe that these prudent actions are what enables us to deliver strong earnings growth over the long term. As Scott Estes will speak to later, despite the enormous growth in our business, our balance sheet and financial metrics have never been better. With that, I'm now going to turn the mic over to Scott Brinker, our Chief Investment Officer. Scott M. Brinker: Thanks, Tom. I have a lot of good news to share today. The HCN team delivered another outstanding quarter. Our investment activity and proactive asset management are driving best-in-class internal growth. We've averaged 4% same store growth over the past 4 years. I'm going to start with outpatient medical office. This portfolio has been completely transformed in the 8 years since we entered the business. Today, on every important metric, our outpatient medical office portfolio is at or near the top of the peer group. We've added a slide to our corporate presentation showing how we stack up to our peers. Operating results in this portfolio are very steady. Same store NOI grew 3.3% over the comparable quarter. Looking forward, we see strong demand for space. The shift to outpatient care is a fundamental change in health care delivery that greatly benefits our portfolio. Let's turn to seniors housing. Same store NOI in the operating portfolio grew 7.6%, extending our history of superior results. Performance continues to be exceptional in the U.K., strong in the U.S. and steady in Canada. This portfolio has averaged 8% NOI growth since inception 4 years ago, substantially above all benchmarks. The outperformance is driven by the quality of our real estate and operating partners. We were highly selective in picking both our partners and our acquisition targets. The consistency is driven by purposeful diversification by operator, geography and service type. Our well-diversified triple net senior housing business continues to generate steady growth. Same store NOI increased 2.7%, continuing a nice history of inflation plus growth. Moving to post-acute. Our rental income is well secured and growing consistently. Same store NOI increased 3% over the comparable quarter. The big news last quarter was Genesis agreeing to combine with Skilled Healthcare. This is a big win for HCN. Genesis will become a public company with improved liquidity and higher payment coverage. You might remember that we received warrants in Genesis as part of the sale-leaseback in 2011. We'll convert those warrants into common stock at closing, giving us ownership in the public company that's worth about $40 million. With a cost basis of 0, we'll make a nice return on that investment. A small note on Life Science, which represents just 1% of our income. This Class A portfolio sits in an irreplaceable location at the doorstep to MIT. NOI declined last quarter due to a large anticipated lease expiration. We'll soon recapture the lost income. More than half the space has already been released, with a 2Q '15 commencement date. Term sheets are outstanding for much of the remaining vacant space on the campus. Turning to investments. Our partners helped us generate more than $750 million of new investments last quarter. Consistent with our long-time strategy, the lion's share of the activity was with existing partners. For example, we expanded our relationship with Sunrise through a $250 million acquisition in the U.K. that also comes with a large pipeline of to-be-developed communities. Looking forward, we secured partnerships with the leading private pay operators in the U.K. and Canada. These partners will help us deliver significant internal and external growth. This is the same blueprint we've used so successfully here in the U.S. In sports terms, if you held a draft and gave me the first 20 picks, there are only a handful of operators I'd pick that aren't already in our portfolio. That's a competitive advantage that cannot be replicated. These are the operators who are best positioned to consolidate what remains a fragmented market. The $950 million HealthLease acquisition is on target to close this quarter. The assets are primarily seniors housing and Class A post-acute, with a blended cap rate of 7%. We like to get more than just a collection of assets when we do a big deal. HealthLease is a good example. We received a $1.4 billion pipeline of brand-new assets being developed by Mainstreet. The cap rate on the pipeline is nearly 7.7%, highly attractive given the Class A building quality and 100% Q-Mix. The pipeline beyond HealthLease is exceptionally strong and dominated by off-market deals with existing partners. We get lots of questions about selling assets. The transaction market is strong, so why not take advantage? It's a good question, and it's exactly what we've been doing. We raised more than $2 billion over the past 4 years by selling non-core assets. We Got rid of our bottom 5%. This allows us to feel even more confident about the future. In summary, our portfolio, people and relationships position HCN for continued outperformance. I'll now turn the call to Scott Estes to discuss our financial results. Scott A. Estes: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. From a financial perspective, we sit in a great position entering the final 3 months of the year. My remarks today will focus on our financial results, balance sheet and guidance. First, our continued success on the acquisition front and strong portfolio performance drove another quarter of meaningful earnings growth. Second, we have strategically positioned the balance sheet to produce the strongest financial metrics that I can remember, which includes sitting on $1 billion in cash as of September 30, effectively prefunding all acquisitions announced to date. And third, the strength of our results have allowed us to maintain the midpoint of our 2014 guidance despite increasing our annual disposition forecast by $175 million and raising over $1 billion of additional equity in the quarter. So I'll begin my more detailed comments by taking a look at our third quarter financial performance. Our platform continues to generate consistently strong earnings growth. Normalized FFO increased to $1.04 per share for the third quarter, while normalized FAD came in at $0.91 per share, representing solid 7% and 6% year-over-year increases, respectively. Results were primarily driven by the same store cash NOI increase and the $2.3 billion of investments completed over the prior 12 months. In terms of operating expenses, our G&A for the third quarter came in at $31 million, in line with expectations. Regarding our dividends, as we move into 2015, our confidence in our portfolios' internal and external growth has allowed us to announce a 4% increase in our 2015 dividend payment rate. Our Board of Directors has approved a 2015 quarterly dividend payment rate of $0.825 per share or $3.30 annually beginning with the February 2015 dividend. And in terms of our disclosure, I would note we added pictures of our MOB portfolio to the website today, which I believe is a nice addition. Turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. In terms of third quarter capital markets activity, the highlight was our secondary equity offering, which settled in mid-September. We completed the sale of 17.825 million shares of common equity at $63.75 per share, generating $1.1 billion in gross proceeds. We have now completed the 2 largest overnight offerings by any New York Stock Exchange company in 2014 based on total gross proceeds. In addition, we issued 982,000 common shares under our dividend reinvestment program, generating $62 million in proceeds and generated $376 million of proceeds through the sale of nonstrategic assets and loan payoffs. We also repaid approximately $54 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.4% and assumed $51 million of secured debt associated with acquisitions at a 2.9% rate. As a result of our third quarter capital activity and new line of credit, we're in an outstanding liquidity position at quarter end and have raised the capital to finance all acquisitions announced to date. More specifically, as of September 30, we have our full $2.5 billion line of credit available and $1 billion in cash, an additional $152 million of pending disposition throughout the remainder of 2014, and are generating an additional $60 million of equity per quarter through our dividend reinvestment program. We have limited near-term debt maturities, with only $51 million of debt maturing through year-end 2014. Our balance sheet and financial metrics at quarter end improved to the strongest levels in recent memory as a result of our improving portfolio performance and capital markets activities. As of September 30, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization was 36%, and net debt to enterprise value was 30%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined to just below 5x, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage improved to 3.9x and 3.1x, respectively. Our secured debt as a percentage of total assets declined 30 basis points to 11.8%. All of the preceding credit metrics are now comfortably inside our targeted levels. I'll conclude my comments today with an update on 2014 guidance and our supporting assumptions. I'll begin with our same store cash NOI growth outlook. Given our strong third quarter results, we're increasing our 2014 forecast from the previous range of 3.5% to 4% to approximately 4%. The increase is largely based on the strength of the seniors housing operating portfolio as our same store cash NOI forecast for the remaining components of our portfolio remain unchanged. In terms of our investment expectations, there are no acquisitions included in our guidance beyond what we've announced through the third quarter. We do continue to expect an additional $1.05 billion of previously announced acquisitions to close in the fourth quarter, which are included in our guidance. Our forecast now includes $625 million of dispositions at a blended yield on sale of 9.5%, representing an increase from the previous expectation of $450 million. Finally, we have narrowed our normalized FFO and FAD per share guidance ranges for the full year around the midpoint of previous guidance. I believe this is a positive result, given the additional $1.1 billion of equity raised in the third quarter to significantly strengthen our balance sheet and the incremental $175 million increase in our disposition expectations for the year. As a result, we're narrowing our normalized 2014 FFO guidance to a range of $4.07 to $4.13 per diluted share, representing a 7% to 8% annual increase, and our FAD guidance to $3.59 to $3.65 per diluted share, representing a strong 7% to 9% increase. That concludes my prepared remarks. But I will conclude by saying we're very well positioned to execute on our growth pipeline, given the strength of our balance sheet and cash available to close all investments announced year-to-date. So at this point, Tom, I'll turn it back to you for some closing comments. Thomas J. DeRosa: Thanks, Scott. So as you've heard, our third quarter results underscore the power of the HCN model. We continue to deliver strong, predictable growth and financial performance through our unique, diversified, global operating partner network as well as embracing a disciplined and conservative approach to managing our capital position. Our external growth is equally disciplined and conservative. The fact that I can tell you that $1.2 billion of our total year-to-date new investment growth of $1.8 billion has come from our existing operating partners truly demonstrates the transparency and predictability of our external growth model. I'm proud to say that HCN is now the fourth largest publicly-traded real estate company and is truly a global business. We know that investing outside the U.S. requires dedicated knowledge, skill and feet on the street in order to properly manage the opportunities and risks in these markets. I'm delighted to tell you that last month, HCN moved into its new London offices on Cornhill in the city of London, just a few paces away from where John Goodey, our SVP International, and I worked together in the 1990s. I invite all of you to visit John and the team when your travels take you to London. During the quarter, we welcomed Serge Rivera, President of The Americas for Starwood Hotels & Resorts, to our board, which adds additional bench strength and lodging and hospitality industry knowledge to an already outstanding group of directors. Finally, I want to acknowledge the recent passing of a great friend of HCN, Mary Wolf, wife of our founder, Fritz Wolf. For over 40 years, Mary was a strong supporter of our company. She was a passionate patron of the arts here in Toledo and in Palm Beach, Florida. Mary's intellect, kindness and humor were an inspiration to all of us. We will miss you, Mary. Now Holly, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : A question for you, Tom or Scott, on your thoughts on the cost of capital environment. And Scott talked about the forward pipeline being strong. Just curious if you want to add any more color to those comments, what we might expect to see you guys do over the next 6, 9, 12 months. Scott A. Estes: Let me just kick it off on the investment pipeline. We'll talk about cost of capital... Thomas J. DeRosa: I can talk about the investment pipeline. Michael, it's consistent with our history, so you're going to see us be active in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, high-quality assets, major metro markets, mostly private pay, and importantly, the lion's share of it will be with existing partners. And this is referring to the pipeline beyond HealthLease. So some of it will close in the fourth quarter, the rest might spill over to the first, but it's definitely an active time for us. Scott A. Estes: And from a cost of capital perspective, we obviously are sitting on a nice bit of cash today. But given the solid stock price performance and debt markets performing pretty well, I think we can absolutely continue to invest accretively. Thomas J. DeRosa: I would support that, and look -- because of our cost of capital and access to capital really be opportunistic when we think about the business going forward. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then a question on the operating portfolio senior housing. It sounds like you're increasing your guidance. I think before it was 6% to 6.5%. And it seems like you guys could hit 7% for the year if you can finish it maybe 4%, 5% or better in 4Q. I was just curious if you want to comment on operating guidance. Thomas J. DeRosa: Yes. Michael, the fourth quarter is usually a little bit lower, so it's hard to say for sure, but I'm not sure that we'll get to the high 7s, low 8s like we have over the past few quarters. We won't know for sure for a couple of more months, but our best guess is that it will be a bit below that. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay. So just to clarify, what then is the new bogey for the full year? Scott A. Estes: We would hope it would range 6.5% to 7%, if not toward the higher end of that range, depending on Scott's comment on the fourth quarter performance. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then last question for me. Tom or Scott, when you look at Life Science and you see kind of an ugly NOI print like you had this quarter, and then also you maybe think it -- maybe it doesn't quite fit your passion for improving health care delivery like your other business lines, do you sort of say to yourself, I've got some really valuable Cambridge properties, like you noted on the call and maybe, think about maybe time to recycle that and focus on your other business lines? Is that a thought that you guys have? Thomas J. DeRosa: Michael, that's an asset that we're quite proud of, and I think the decision to invest in that asset a number of years ago has really proved to be a very good one. As you look at the Life Sciences market, we think that's probably, in the United States, among the very best locations you could find. So we think owning the best-in-class asset in the best market kind of fits our strategy, and we don't worry about that asset at all. As Scott mentioned already, we'll see very -- we're seeing very good lease-up of that available space. And that being said, you know that we always actively manage our portfolio, and we look -- we know that's a very valuable asset. We know it's an asset that -- where we have a very large gain in. And there may be an opportunity at some point in the future where we would consider doing something with that asset. But today, we're very happy to own it, and we feel very good about how it's being managed. And we like seeing it in the portfolio. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Joshua Raskin with Barclays. Rachana Fellinger - Barclays Capital, Research Division : This is Racha Fellinger on behalf of Josh. Just a couple of quick ones. Do you have any plans around pub development in England in the RIDEA portfolio in the near future? Scott M. Brinker: We do. This is Scott Brinker speaking. And we've been actively developing in that market for over 3 years now. It's interesting, if you go do some site visits, the quality of the stock in the U.K. is quite low on average, so we feel like there's a real opportunity as that market transitions away from government pay and towards private pay to build high-quality assets that people will actually want to be in and want to pay for. And that's what we own. So we've got 60-or-so communities in the U.K. right now, and these are all very new purpose-built private pay assets, and that's not typical in the U.K. So we've been very purposeful about what we bought. But frankly, there's not a whole lot left to acquire. There certainly are portfolios we're looking at, but there's really a development opportunity. So we're actively developing with Signature, Sunrise and Avery, all 3 of our partners. So you could easily see us do 10-plus projects a year going forward. And they've been extremely successful to date, with yield on cost in the high single digits or low double digits. Rachana Fellinger - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, great. Just one other question. Are you seeing anything particular in terms of demographics of individuals that are moving in and out of your RIDEA portfolio? Are they younger, living longer, utilizing more ancillary services? Scott M. Brinker: No, we haven't seen a material change there. They continue to be in the mid-80s. They're still staying 2 to 3 years on average, so these aren't -- I wouldn't say that the demographic profile of our communities has changed materially over the past few years. Thomas J. DeRosa: It's just that demographic trends are going to mean there are going to be more people attracted to these assets in the future, so we just see more demand coming. And I think we see that across the U.S., we see it in Canada and we see it in the U.K. And just to add to Scott's comment on the U.K., you're seeing a real change in the U.K., a societal change there. Elder care has been in existence there for a long time and offered by the National Health Service. You're seeing a change in the U.K. in that people are now willing to pay for their elderly care. There is a more affluent market, and so the product that's being developed is really being developed to meet the demands of that market. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Emmanuel Korchman with Citigroup. Archena Alagappan : This is Archena for Manny. In early September, there was a press release regarding the acquisition pipeline being around $1.7 billion for the second half of 2014, including $535 million of expected future acquisitions. So we were hoping that you could give us maybe some color on the composition of those remaining deals. Scott M. Brinker: This is Scott Brinker. I'll try to answer that. The press release in August included the HealthLease portfolio, which was the lion's share of the $1.7 billion. That accounts for about $1 billion of it. And then most of the balance is what we just announced for this quarter. So it's the Sunrise deal; there's a big private pay senior housing acquisition in the U.K. with Avery Healthcare, an existing client; and then we did some MOB acquisitions. So the third quarter activity plus HealthLease will -- should total to $1.7 billion. Archena Alagappan : Okay, great. And in terms of like the international pipeline, could you give us a sense of the acquisition or investment pipeline that you're seeing today? You just made some recent comments about like U.K. being a little difficult in terms of acquisitions, and it's going to be more development focused. Are you looking at any other additional markets? So maybe some color there might be helpful. Thomas J. DeRosa: Well, I'd say we continue to see good opportunities in the U.K. As Scott did mention, a lot of it is development-oriented, but there may be some additional acquisition opportunity there as well. So I will tell you, as I've said in the past, we see tremendous opportunities in the U.S., number one. And then we are also seeing good opportunities in Canada and the U.K. I'd say our plate is quite full today with those markets. So we're not spending a tremendous time looking outside of those markets, but I can assure you that we're on top of where there may be opportunities in the future outside of those markets. I think having a strong team on the ground in Europe helps us understand those opportunities and gives us a competitive advantage at seizing whatever opportunities may come out of the existing markets we're in -- the existing market we're in, in Europe and other markets that we may choose to go into in the future. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : Pretty good. All right. So I've heard -- Tom, I've heard that you might be more upbeat or sanguine on Life Science than your predecessor and maybe even willing to increase your exposure in that business over time. Is that a fair characterization? Thomas J. DeRosa: Rich, when I've talked about Life Sciences in the past, it's been Life Sciences that are related to academic medical centers. And we still believe at some point in the future, there are tremendous real estate investments for us that may come out of those large academic medical centers that lead many of the Life Science efforts in this country. So to the extent that there are Life Science assets that may provide a connection to one of those or a few of those institutions, that's where I'm interested. We don't see it as a leading business for us going forward, but it may be a bridge into the type of business that you -- or the type of assets that you like to see us invest in. Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : Okay, good stuff. In the U.K., first a big-picture question. A lot of talk of deflationary pressures in Europe, and U.K. being kind of close proximity, do you worry at all about that in terms of expanding your platform there? Or are you just going to kind of plow through at this point? Thomas J. DeRosa: Rich, so much of our portfolio is concentrated in the greater London, MSA and southern England, so I think that there are issues in England as you go throughout the country. We are very deliberate about where we own and develop assets. So -- and I can't underscore that enough, because we know the U.K. market quite well. We -- our assets, again, are largely around London. We see London as perhaps the most resilient market in the world. The amount of wealth that continues to consolidate into London is extraordinary. So we feel that being there is very important. And when you look across any property type owning assets in the U.K., I think investors should want to see a focus on the greater London markets, southern England and the other market, where there -- which is attractive because it's the second-largest market at England is around Birmingham, England, which is the middle level of the country. I think as you get above Birmingham we pause,, because we worry about some of the demographic issues from the mid- to northern England markets. So I think, like a lot of markets, Rich, if you're with the best operators who own the best real estate, generally you've got -- you create a bit of a strong competitive advantage. I could say that about certain markets in the United States, too, that -- where people will say might be overbuilt, but if you're in the best submarkets in those larger markets with the best operators, we think we're in a great position to capture growth in the future. Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : Okay. And specifically, the Gracewell deal, if that company is winning awards for managing their assets, why replace them with Sunrise? Or did they want that? Scott M. Brinker: Yes, Rich. It's Scott speaking. I wouldn't call it a replacement. It's more like an addition to Sunrise's already strong team. So Tim and Danny, the 2 principals at Gracewell, really have a development expertise. They're real estate guys, and they're going to continue in that function going forward. They're going to deliver this pipeline of assets in London and southern England. And then the best of the operating team from Gracewell is joining Sunrise. So to me, we're just combining 2 good platforms. Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : Okay, fair enough. Scott, maybe a question for you. The 7.6% same store NOI growth this quarter for RIDEA, when you think about sustainability of that number -- Ventas is producing a number lower than that. Do you think the number is more like in the 5% to 6% range when you kind of get through some of the occupancy lift? Or do you think a long-term number is close to 7% for now? Scott A. Estes: Rich, I hope it's 7%. We've said, when we started doing RIDEA 4 years ago, that 4% to 5% long term in a static environment was probably realistic. I don't think our view has changed. I mean, we are confident that because of the assets and the operators, we'll outperform the industry. But in terms of continuing at our current pace of 8% per year, that would be very difficult. It's just the comparable quarter becomes so difficult to see. Thomas J. DeRosa: Rich, you've heard us talk about the operating initiatives that we lead for our operating partners. That's real stuff. That's not made up. And so we'd like to think that because of our relationship and the skill set that we bring to the operator that we have a direct role in driving that same store sales growth, and I think that's just a unique aspect of our business model. Richard C. Anderson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then I don't know if anyone has asked you about this, but with the problems that Ventas had with their Sunrise in Canada, do you have any comment about why that might have happened since you're a part owner of the management company? Scott M. Brinker: Yes, Rich. We're a minority investor. We have 0 input on what Sunrise does operationally, and there is a strict Chinese wall. So I couldn't even begin to comment on it if I wanted to. We have nothing to do with their portfolio. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Stifel. Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : I actually wanted to start on entrance fee properties. Some of your peers have been making investments in that space, and I'm not -- I don't feel like you've done a whole lot since development a few years ago. If you can talk a little bit about how your entrance fee portfolio is performing and maybe how you feel about increasing investments again in entrance fee CCRCs. Scott A. Estes: Dan, I can comment on the existing portfolio performance. It's obviously very small. We have only 8 properties at about $390 million investment balance, but they actually continue to fill pretty well. Right now, the overall occupancy is in the mid-80s. It's about 86%. And the entrance fee community component of those properties are filling up. They're over 80%, and the rental part is in the low 90s. So I think they're doing fine. We just have chosen not to make additional investments in that portfolio. Scott M. Brinker: Yes, Dan. It's less than 2% of our income today. And we've been in that business for over a decade, and we've just found that the cash flows are too volatile. Not saying that we would sell this portfolio that we have. It's performing well, but that's not an industry that we're looking to expand in. Just we like the consistency of our results, and it's very difficult in that business to generate any level of predictability. Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then I was thinking about your dividend growth was a little bit -- is coming in a little bit below your FAD growth. Can you talk a little bit about goals for the FAD payout ratio or however you're thinking about the payout ratio for the dividend going forward? Scott A. Estes: Yes. We like to be in a position where we can increase the dividend meaningfully but still push the payout ratios down pending earnings growth. So where we're at today I think we can get our FFO payout ratio down into the mid-70s or below and FAD in the mid-80s or below over the next several years pending our rate of earnings growth. Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then in terms of -- I'm trying to think about -- a lot of investors I think have been concerned in the Health Care REIT space about investment spreads over cost of capital. You addressed a little bit about your strength in your cost and your capital availability earlier in the call, but can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about investment spreads today versus where you've seen them in the last couple of years? Just want to hear how you're thinking about your ability to invest accretively. Scott M. Brinker: Yes, Dan. We've spent a lot of time looking at that. This is Scott Brinker. The spreads haven't changed that much. It's important that we're doing the vast majority of our investments off-market with existing clients. And the yields are pretty good if you compare that to what people are paying in auctions. So if we were generating all of our volume through large public auctions, it would be difficult to maintain a positive spread, but we feel like we've continued to do that. And it's still in the 50 to 150 basis points, given our current cost of capital, which, for us, is plenty of cushion to make a profit. I think what you are seeing, though, is just the company's getting bigger, so it's more difficult to, on a percentage basis, grow the company through external growth. But we knew that was coming, and that's why we're so focused on the performance of the existing portfolio and have these systems in place to improve NOI growth. Thomas J. DeRosa: Yes, and I -- Dan, on the external growth, I think, again, our operators, who we say we're aligned with the best national operators and the best regional operators, these operators are seeing tremendous demand and need to grow their businesses. And we are at the table with them and working with them to deliver the capital to realize their business plans. And I think that's where, largely, you've heard us say that over the last few quarters, and we said it strongly today, that's where our external growth is coming from. So again, we think we're -- and as Scott said, these are not opportunities that are being put out to auction. They're opportunities that are coming directly to us, and we think that we're still able, as you've heard today, generating plenty of accretive investment opportunities for our shareholders here. Daniel M. Bernstein - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division : Given what you said about marketed transactions, does this also suggest that you're going to pick up more development as we go forward in the next couple of years? It looked like your development picked up a little bit. Are you -- I think you're running CIP to gross book below 1%. Do you see that increasing significantly over the next few years, given where cap rates are for marketed transactions? Thomas J. DeRosa: Dan, you've heard us today, for instance, talk about the $1.4 billion development pipeline with HealthLease. Here's a situation where we're developing with them the next generation of post-acute care. These assets need to be brought to the market in order to have a health care delivery system that will lower costs and improve outcomes. So there is development that needs to be done in health care in the U.S. today because the product just doesn't exist. You don't see us investing a lot in old -- what we would say, our old-model SNFs because we think they're -- that business will be challenged in the future. But we are very bullish on what we call post-acute and the next-generation post-acute, things that you've seen in our portfolio with the Genesis PowerBack facilities and what you will see more of through Mainstreet and its next-gen, post-acute facilities. Scott M. Brinker: Dan, the other thing I'd mention, this is Scott speaking, is that a lot of the development that we're involved with right now is really not our capital. I think we've been -- we've tried to be smarter about this round of development so that we're not taking as much risk if 2 or 3 years from now when these projects open, the market is not conducive to new supply. So Mainstreet is an example, and we have an option to buy those assets once they're built. So we're not putting out the $1.4 billion of capital. They build it, and then we have the option to buy it when it's complete. And that's the case with a pretty large number of our development projects right now. So the dollars you see on our balance sheet and in our supplement are actually a lot lower than what the potential pipeline could be. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I was just hoping you could give specific numbers on the RIDEA portfolio's growth by geography. Scott M. Brinker: Sure, Juan. This is Scott. The U.K. led the pack at about 11%. The U.S. was right in line with the overall portfolio, about 8%. And then Canada was right around 4%. Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, great. And then on the previous question on the developments. With Gracewell, are those options to acquire those assets upon completion? Or are those -- or do you have to take those out upon stabilization? Scott M. Brinker: The Gracewell assets are set up as more of a guaranteed takeout at a slight premium to their build cost. So we underwrite the project alongside Sunrise, take -- they take all the predevelopment risk, being the developer, so we're not involved there. They find the land. They get it approved. Sunrise and HCN agree to the project, and then they build it. And 12 months later, we buy it at a fixed price. Juan C. Sanabria - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, great. And just in terms of quantifying that potential pipeline of opportunities that we don't necessarily see. I mean, is there a way to -- for you to quantify kind of what your funding may be off-balance sheet, preferred or mezz lending, that maybe it's not as apparent just on some of your disclosure that would help us get a sense of that? Scott M. Brinker: Yes. If you include the Mainstreet pipeline, Juan, the potential pipeline of new development projects is in the range of $1 billion a year. But again, most of those are set up where we have the option to buy, not an obligation. Operator : And your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : I just wanted to clarify on the operating expenses for the senior housing operating portfolio. I think they were about 6% higher this quarter, and I think they were about 3% higher year-over-year last quarter. And I just wanted to see if you could give some color on why that ticked up so much. And then also, just can you talk about, to the extent that most of your operating costs there are variable to some extent, which I think is the case, just maybe chat about -- if the top line growth were to slow a little bit, you would be able to sort of reign in that operating expense increase, is my understanding. Scott M. Brinker: Yes, Michael. It's Scott Brinker. It's tough, with just 3 months of data, to draw any conclusion. So operating expenses were a bit higher this quarter, but there is nothing dramatically out of line and nothing that we view as a long-term issue to be concerned about. Occupancy was up substantially year-over-year, 180 basis points, so that certainly impacted expenses a bit. But again, hopefully there is room for improvement if at some point in the future revenue growth is a little bit slower. And in terms of your last question, it's an important one. The vast majority of the expenses at these communities is variable, so when occupancy declines at some point in the future, we do think that there's a real opportunity to reduce costs and maintain NOI growth. And we saw that happen during the recession. And that's really a difference in seniors housing versus some of the other real estate asset classes. People talk about our operating margins being in the mid-30s rather than 70% like multi-family, and that's true. But it's also true that most of our expenses are variable. So when you have issues with revenue or occupancy, you can adjust and maintain NOI. So we've seen that happen in the past, and we think it could happen in the future if revenue growth ever slows. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then can you just talk about the pricing power in your top line revenue growth that you reported this quarter and what you're sort of seeing looking forward? It seemed like it was mostly occupancy And maybe on the rate or services revenue side it was maybe in the mid-3% type range? Can you just talk about any change or maybe no change that you see on the pricing power side? Scott M. Brinker: Yes, the pricing power is huge, Michael. That's been the main driver of our outperformance over the past few years. The same store rate growth this quarter was 4.6%. It's a little different than the supplement because I'm giving you a same store number. The supplement is the whole portfolio. So that's roughly 2x what the industry is achieving. And we've tracked that over a number of years. And we've been about 2x the national average consistently, and that's driving most of the substantial NOI growth that you see. Michael Knott - Green Street Advisors, Inc., Research Division : And then last question is on the U.K. You mentioned the NOI growth there in that portfolio is double digits. Can you remind us where that has been in the last few quarters and then kind of what's driving that substantial rate of growth? Is it occupancy pick-up? Or is it the pricing power? Scott M. Brinker: Yes, it's been double digits for a year now, and it's a combination of occupancy and rate growth. So all the numbers that I just gave you, which is our entire same store portfolio, the U.K. is even better. Operator : And that will conclude today's conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect. Scott M. Brinker: Thank you.",

My name is Espalane, and I will be your operator today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Espalane. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for HCN\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at hcreit.com. We are holding a live webcast of today\u2019s call, which may be accessed through the company\u2019s website. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although, HCN believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Tom DeRosa, the CEO of HCN. Tom? Tom DeRosa : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning from Toledo, Ohio, where it is minus 12 degrees and we are on emergency generator power. So if we cut out at any time through this call just stand by because we will be back. By all measures, 2014 was an outstanding year for HCN. Our 48.5% total return made us the top-performing large cap REIT in the S&P 500. Simply put, the best portfolio of health care real estate in the top markets in the U.S., UK, and Canada, occupied by best-in-class operators in health systems provides our shareholders with consistent resilient portfolio on earnings growth. Our 2014 results demonstrate just how our shareholders benefit from our unique position in the health care real estate space. We completed $3.7 billion in new investments of which $2 billion were generated from our existing operators. The quality and transparency of that investment growth is unparallel than our industry. Our normalized FFO per share increased 8% over 2013, and if you follow the NAREIT definition of FFO that was a 15% increase. This earnings performance was generated by industry-leading 4.2% same store NOI growth across the portfolio and a remarkable 7.3% same store NOI growth in our operating portfolio. But that my friends is the old news. Why are we so optimistic about our business? We\u2019ve been telling you for some time that we have a differentiated model that is driven by our unique alignment with the best senior housing and post-acute operators in the U.S., UK and Canada, as well as top health systems. We are relentless real estate asset and portfolio managers. Keep in mind that our FFO growth has occurred while we have sold over $2.5 billion in assets over the last five years. We have always believed that a strategic disposition program is in the best near-term and long-term interest of our shareholders. Hence, we enter 2015 with perhaps the most modern, best located and relevant real estate portfolio in the health care real estate industry. A portfolio that is increasingly concentrated in markets with superior demographic and economic drivers that are attracting global wealth like New York, London, and Washington D.C. And because we have sold older non-strategic assets, we can focus on driving the performance of our A quality health care real estate in 2015 and beyond. Having raised over $3 billion in capital last year, we are in one of the strongest credit and liquidity positions in our 45-year history. This will enable HCN to continue to meet the capital needs of our partners as they drive the future of health care delivery. Further, 2015 will benefit from the dominant position we have built in high-end seniors housing in London and the innovative post-acute platforms we are building with Genesis and Mainstreet. When you combine this with our deep engagement with our operators to drive growth through best practices, innovative transaction structuring, our focus on technological innovation and good old-fashioned Toledo-style hard work, all the pieces are in place to deliver the quality of growth that you\u2019ve come to expect from HCN. Scott Brinker, our Chief Investment Officer, will give you a closer look at our portfolio performance and growth, including details on the fourth quarter. He will be followed by Scott Estes, who will do a deeper dive on our full year 2014 results as well as our fourth quarter financial performance. Over to you, Scott. Scott Brinker : Okay, thanks, Tom. Our positive momentum continues to our very good results this year. Strong demand for our real estate through a 3.5% same store growth last quarter and 4% average growth over the past four years. The sector leading quality of our real estate and operating partners is the main driver of our outperformance. I\u2019ll provide some color on each business segments, starting with seniors housing. Same store NOI in the operating portfolio grew 5.7% last quarter, occupancy was up 1.6% and rate was up 3.6%. Importantly, we\u2019re getting these results without pouring money into the buildings. We own Class A assets that need relatively little CapEx. Performance continues to be exceptional in the global wealth centers where we purposely have a large footprint. This includes markets like London, New York, and Los Angeles. Just under 60% of the operating portfolio is located in the 10 largest MSAs in the U.S., UK, and Canada. Our decision to concentrate in these markets is paying off. Moving to triple net seniors housing, same store NOI grew 2.6% last quarter. We don\u2019t include any one-time fees or CapEx funding, so our triple net growth is very consistent and predictable. We do triple net as a nice complement to our operating portfolio. Next up is medical office. Our platform delivered sector-leading rental rates and occupancy. Same store NOI increased 2.5% last quarter as expected. The outlook for this segment is continued steady growth, driven by our modern assets, a larger ensured population and the shift to outpatient care. Turning to post-acute and long-term care, our rental income is well secured and growing consistently. Same store NOI increased 3.1% last quarter. We had a big win two weeks ago when Genesis completed its combination with Skilled Healthcare. Genesis became a publicly traded company within improved access to capital. Payment coverage is solid at the corporate and facility level and we are excited by the likelihood of improvement over time. In particular, Genesis is projecting higher coverage from expense initiatives, synergies, new development, debt pay-downs and re-financings. We continue to grow the relationship with brand new rehab focus buildings that are highly demanded by patients and payers. Importantly, all of our Genesis properties are in a single master lease that matures 17 years from now. This gives our rental income long-term visibility. Beginning this quarter, we moved our nursing homes and post-acute hospitals into a single reporting segment for our long-term and post-acute care. This better reflects the services provided and the moment toward site-neutral payments. We also added a table in the supplement that details our quality mix, which will improve over time as we acquire the Mainstreet development projects. In our experience, payer mix impact value. Hopefully, this information helps your analysis. Turning to investments, we had a fantastic quarter. Our partners helped us generate $1.8 billion in new investments. Initial cash yield was 7.2%, substantially above our cost of capital. We completed the acquisition of HealthLease and we\u2019ve already begun acquiring properties from the Mainstreet pipeline. As usual, we completed follow-on investments with several existing partners, including industry leaders like Sunrise, Genesis, Silverado, Avery, SRG and Kelsey-Seybold. Expanding with known trusted partners is our primary avenue for growth, leads to better execution and higher returns. Bigger picture, our investment strategy is to lock arms with premier operators and grow along side them. We bring them opportunities and they bring us opportunities. Both parties benefit. Over time, these strategic partnerships between capital and operations will capture market share and outperform. This strategy is far removed from growth fueled by paying the highest price in an auction. When we do make an investment there is always a longer-term plan. Here is an example. The initial investment with our top ten operators totaled $6.5 billion, it\u2019s a big number, but we\u2019ve more than doubled that amount in follow-on investments with those same ten operators and there is a lot more to come. We are actively growing with more than 30 of our partners. It\u2019s the breadth and depth of these partnerships that differentiates HCN. It leads to superior internal and external growth. We\u2019ll add to this foundation in 2015 with a handful of new partners, who\u2019s long been on our wish list. We actively manage the portfolio and always looking to maximize value. Sometimes the best answer is to sell assets. Last quarter, we sold an entry fee portfolio for $441 million; which was a mid-5% cap rate on the rent. Entry fee assets tend to struggle during downturns and this portfolio was no exception. The $94 million gain on sale highlights our ability to work with operators through up and down cycles to maximize value. This sale was a fantastic outcome for all parties. In summary, last year finished strongly and we are ready to build on that success for 2015. Scott Estes will now discuss our financial results and guidance. Scott Estes : Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. The performance of our portfolio and the success of our partnership-based investment strategy translated into another year of strong financial results. My specific remarks today focus on our recent financial performance, our current balance sheet and liquidity, and the key assumptions driving our 2015 guidance. I\u2019ll begin by taking a look at our fourth quarter and calendar 2014 financial results. Normalized FFO increased to $1.03 per share for the fourth quarter, while FAD came in at $0.91 per share, representing solid 4% and 6% increases year-over-year, respectively. More importantly, for the full year, our normalized FFO increased 8% to $4.13 per share and FAD increased 9% to $3.66 per share. Results were driven by the strong same store cash NOI increase and the $2.7 billion of net investments completed during 2014. In terms of dividends, today we will pay our 175th consecutive quarterly cash dividends of $0.825 per share, a rate of $3.30 annually. This represents a 3.8% increase over the dividends paid last year and represents a current dividend yield of 4.3%. We finished 2014 with our most significant investment quarter of the year totaling $1.8 billion for the period. As Scott mentioned, approximately half of our fourth quarter investments came from our existing operators with the remainder as a result of our HealthLease acquisition. Turning now to the liquidity picture and balance sheet in terms of fourth quarter capital markets activity, the highlights clearly was our second successful UK unsecured debt offering completed in mid-November, when we issued \u00a3500 million of 20 year notes priced to yield just over 4.5%. Based on exchange rates at the time, this translated into approximately $783 million. These offerings fit nicely into our maturity schedule and have extended our average unsecured debt maturity to nearly 10 years at a blended rate of 4.4%. In addition, we had a number of other capital activities during the fourth quarter. We issued just over 1 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program generating $70 million in proceeds. We generated $558 million of proceeds through the sale of non-strategic assets and loan payoff, including $111 million gains on sale, resulting in a blended yield on total proceeds of 5.5%. We repaid approximately $39 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.7% and assumed $142 million of secured debt associated with acquisitions at a blended 5.5% rate. And last, we repaid the $250 million of 5.875 senior notes that were to mature in May of 2015. So as a result of these activities, we have no unsecured debt maturing in 2015. We ended the year with no borrowings on our $2.5 billion line of credit and we had $474 million of cash, leaving us in an excellent liquidity position entering the new year. As a result of our recent financing activity and portfolio performance, our balance sheet and financial metrics at year-end remain at or slightly better than our targeted level. Our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization was 38.6% as of December 31, and net debt to enterprise value was 28.3%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 5.5 times while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the fourth quarter were a solid 3.8 times and 3.0 times respectively. Our secured debt as a percentage of total assets is 11.9%. In light of the recent strength in the U.S. dollar against both the pound sterling and Canadian dollar, I\u2019d like to take a minute to provide an update on our hedging strategy and positions entering 2015. We have minimized any material risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. Through a combination of unsecured and property level debt denominated in local currencies and other currency hedges in place, our international investments are approximately 97% hedged from a balance sheet perspective and 75% hedged from an earnings perspective. So, as a result, the significant strength of the U.S. dollar versus both the pound and Canadian dollar earlier this year is only expected to negatively impact our 2015 earnings results by $0.02 per share and is already reflected in the earnings guidance provided today. In terms of future sensitivity, it would take a meaningful 10% move in both currencies from current levels versus the U.S. dollar to move our annual earnings either up or down by an additional $0.02 per share. I conclude my comments today with an overview of the key assumptions driving our 2015 guidance. In terms of same store cash NOI growth, we\u2019re forecasting a blended growth rate of 3% to 3.5% in 2015. This is again based on the combination of higher growth expected out of our operating portfolio and the more stable growth predicted for a longer term net lease portfolio. To breakdown this forecast by asset type, for our seniors housing operating portfolio, we are projecting growth of approximately 5%, as we remain confident in the operating environment and our operator\u2019s performance. This forecast includes projected revenue growth in the mid-4% range and operating expense increases of roughly 4%. Due to the more severe flu season and harsh winter conditions experienced in much of the Northeast and Midwest this year, we are anticipating that our first quarter growth is likely to be slightly lower than the average for the year. For our seniors housing triple-net portfolio, we are anticipating growth of approximately 2.5%. For our long-term care post-acute portfolio, we\u2019re projecting an increase of 2.5% to 3%. For MOB\u2019s, we project an increase of approximately 2.25% which is driven primarily by annual rate increases, stable occupancy, low turnover and a retention rate of approximately 80%. And last, for our life science portfolio, we expect overall growth for the year of approximately positive 10% which is driven by more significant increases during the second half of the year and signed leases to backfill the vacancy at our 88 Sydney property take occupancy during the first half of the year, which should bring aggregate portfolio occupancy to over 97%. In terms of our investment expectations, there are no acquisitions beyond what we\u2019ve announced today in our formal guidance. As a result, the only acquisitions included in our guidance are the approximate $250 million of investments through our Mainstreet partnership, at an initial cash yield of approximately 7.5%. Our 2015 guidance also includes $196 million of development conversions at a blended projected yield of 8.4% and approximately $400 million of dispositions at a blended yield on sale based on book value of 10%. When potential gains on sale are included, we believe that the blended yield on sale, based on total proceeds will be closer to 8.5%. All of these assets sales are expected to occur during the first half of the year and are primarily composed of the final government reimbursed acute care hospital in our portfolio, a long term care portfolio in Texas that we\u2019ve held for over 12 years and the non-strategic seniors housing portfolio. In terms of CapEx, our capital expenditure forecast is about $63 million for 2015 comprised of approximately $40 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio with the remaining $23 million coming from our medical facilities portfolio. These amounts continue to represent a relatively modest 6% to 7% of anticipated NOI in both asset categories, as we have a newer portfolio that is almost entirely been acquired within the last five years. Our G&A forecast is approximately $145 million for 2015. We continue to build our organization into a global healthcare leader and we\u2019ll continue to invest in the appropriate people and infrastructure to support our premier portfolio. During 2015, we will enhance our efforts on the marketing and branding fronts, improve our information technology platform and continue to invest in the training and education of our employees. We have expanded our sector-leading presence in the UK with an office that is staffed with seven professionals and are excited to be opening a new office in Toronto, Canada around the middle of the year. We\u2019re confident these expenditures will protect and expand our market leading franchise while longer-term, we remain focused on running the organization with expense ratios that are in line with the best-in-class REITs in our industry. So finally as a result of these assumptions, we expect to report 2015 FFO in the range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share representing 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2014 results, while our 2015 FAD expectation is the range of $3.83 to $3.93 per diluted share representing a solid increase of 5% to 7%. So, I conclude by prepared remarks by saying that we remain focused on maintaining the access to capital and consistent financial performance that you\u2019ve come to expect from us in supporting our market leading platforms. So at this point, I\u2019ll turn it back to you Tom for some closing remarks. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Scott. I think as you\u2019ve heard from both Scott\u2019s, we\u2019re quite optimistic about where we sit at this point in 2015 and we\u2019re looking forward to a great year \u2013 this year and beyond. And with that I\u2019m going to ask Espalane to please open up the line for Q&A. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Tom DeRosa : Good morning, Juan. Operator : Juan, if your line is muted, please un-mute your phone. Juan Sanabria : Hello, can you hear me? Tom DeRosa : We can now. Scott Brinker : Can hear you, Juan. Juan Sanabria : Sorry about that. Just wondering if you guys could give some color on the acquisition pipeline in terms of the make-up of the asset types you\u2019re looking at. Is there any change in mix? Had a few of your peers talk maybe a little bit more about going towards the skilled nursing assets, either the old model or the new short-term post-acute, and kind of what you\u2019re seeing on the CapEx front by asset classes. We\u2019ve seen some anecdotal evidence at senior housing assets trading sort of sub-6%. Are you seeing that or do you expect to transact with those types of price points? Scott Brinker : Hey Juan, this is Scott Brinker, I think it\u2019s fair to say senior housing cap rates are in the mid-5%s to mid-6%s. medical office is just probably a bit below that, and then post-acute is more in the 7% to 8% range. There is a lot of activity, a number of large, medium and small-sized auctions. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be very active in any of those. Again, our pipeline is as full as it has ever been. We\u2019re growing with so many of our existing partners, they bring us deals. So it\u2019s seniors housing, it\u2019s medical office, it\u2019s a select number of post-acute, it\u2019s Canada, it\u2019s U.S., it\u2019s UK. The investment team is as busy as ever. Juan Sanabria : Thanks and if maybe you could share just a little bit of color on the expectation by geography on the RIDEA platform? Scott Brinker : Yeah, Juan, we made a very purposeful decision four or five years ago when we first started doing RIDEA to really only put class A assets \u2013 class A operators into that portfolio and there is a heavy concentration in major Metros. So we don\u2019t have any major concentration in any one market, but where we do have some concentration it\u2019s exactly where you\u2019d wanted to be in terms of the affluence in growth. So cities like London, New York, Los Angeles and they have continued quarter after quarter to outperform the other markets in our portfolio. Tom DeRosa : Juan, let me just add to that. We look at healthcare real estate like many of other REITs look at healthcare real estate. We wanted to be in the best markets and we\u2019re very focused on markets like a New York, like a London where there is a concentration of global wealth and where there is a trend towards increasing urbanization, people moving in from the outer rings towards the urban core. We like those markets and frankly many of those markets are unreserved in senior housing assets and modern outpatient medical. You\u2019re probably aware we\u2019re in the process of developing an outpatient medical facility adjacent to Maimonides hospital in Brooklyn, New York, which is one of the most vibrant urban markets in the country. So we feel that we want to always manage our portfolio to be in the best markets and when we think about adding new assets we\u2019ll also be in the best markets around the U.S., Canada and the UK. Juan Sanabria : But do you still expect the UK to be like a 2X number or whatever it is of the U.S. growth, particularly on the RIDEA portfolio? Tom DeRosa : Not indefinitely, but it continues to outperform our expectations for 2015, I think it will still be at the high end, but by a small number, not twice as high, like it has been in the last two year\u2019s. Scott Brinker : Yeah, what\u2019s happening in the UK is you have a growing affluent population that will opt out of NHS senior housing and opt into private pay senior housing assets. And so that market has been at the upper end, has been supply constrained and we\u2019re focused on meeting the natural demand we see growing in that market. Juan Sanabria : Great, and just one last question. You mentioned 5% expense growth on RIDEA. Could you just comment on kind of what\u2019s driving that? Are you seeing any increased level of competition for employees given the labor market and the new supply that \u2013 as to staff up? Tom DeRosa : Yeah, Juan, it was just over 5% in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s higher than our expectations in 2015. I think low 4%'s is more in line with what we expect. The primary driver is staffing of course, and wage growth continues to be in the 2% to 3% range. Food and electric is in the 2% to 3% range as well. And then a bit higher would be things like insurance, workers' comp and things like that. So, blended, about 4% is our expectation. Juan Sanabria : Okay, great, thanks. Stay warm guys. Tom DeRosa : Yeah, thanks Juan. Scott Brinker : You too. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you. Just sticking to the RIDEA portfolio, maybe can you just talk about expect \u2013within the same store revenue growth, what are you baking in for occupancy? And just maybe longer term, given kind of the locations of your assets, what do you view as kind of structure of peak occupancy? Scott Brinker : Yeah, Vik, it's Scott Brinker. I can see today is in the low 90s; so we do think there is maybe 100 basis points to 200 basis points of upside, best case. And it\u2019s trending in that direction. So I think you could see us get in the 92%, 93% range over the next 12 months to 24 months. In terms of the mix of revenue growth between occupancy and rental rates, it\u2019s always hard to predict, but our expectation for total revenue growth next year is in the 5% range and that\u2019s a blend of rate growth and occupancy growth; is probably the fairest way to break it down. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, and then just on the CapEx in the shop portfolio, I'm assuming just most of that is general maintenance given the age of the portfolio. But just wanted to clarify, is there any kind of revenue enhancing, any investments within the portfolio that you\u2019re making, or it\u2019s all just maintenance stuff? Scott Brinker : Yeah, it\u2019s mostly maintenance. Five years and 10 years or 15 years from now we might be having a different discussion, but our assets are extremely young, modern; they don\u2019t need major structural enhancements or renovations. That\u2019s an important distinction when you look at the NOI growth. We\u2019re generating that performance without pouring money into the buildings. And I think people really need to think about that. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao. Vincent Chao : Good morning, everyone. Scott, you did a nice job talking about the limited FX impact at the FFO level. I was just curious for your same store NOI guidance for the full year, is there much of an impact at that level since you don\u2019t have the natural hedging in place with the debt? And just curious what the SHOP same-store NOI outlook would be \u2013 I guess, absent FX impacts. Scott Estes : The same-store NOI growth forecast is on a constant currency basis. And if you did look back, I think we\u2019re not going to predict forward; but if you think about maybe what happened last year, what was the impact -- I think it was like 50 basis points or 60 basis points. Our same store NOI growth would have been a little bit lower by about that level, due to the currency changes that occurred last year. So we\u2019re generally, again, we\u2019re trying to minimize taking any currency risk, as much as we can. Vincent Chao : Okay, thanks. And then in terms of guidance, specifically calling it out as NAREIT guidance, and I know there\u2019s a big push from NAREIT to kind of have everybody report on that basis. Is that the idea going forward, is that that will be the way you present guidance? Or will we still get the normalizing items, and normalized guidance, going forward? Tom DeRosa : We have always in our financials had the NAREIT FFO, but we'll be giving guidance on a normalized basis. We think it provides a clearer picture of the performance of the company. Vincent Chao : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Josh Raskin : Hi, thanks. Tom DeRosa : Hey, Josh. Josh Raskin : Hi, good morning. On the theme I guess, the RIDEA portfolio, the 5.7% in the fourth quarter obviously very healthy above what you expecting in the future and above the normalized portfolio, the triple net portfolio. I mean you guys have outperformed that number pretty significantly last couple of years. I guess there has been a little bit of a slowdown in the growth more recently. So I\u2019m just trying to understand what drove sort of that excess growth historically and what\u2019s not included going forward? Scott Brinker : Yeah, we\u2019ve had four years of outperformance, so the treadmill keeps spinning faster. But yeah, the 5% is something to be excited about. So we are very pleased with it. Our expectation next year is for the 5% range which is still outstanding. I think a couple of things drove the, if you want to call it a slowdown. One, the occupancy growth this year was a little bit less than in prior years and the rate growth was at more the lower end of what we have been able to achieve. And at least in the fourth quarter you had higher expenses. So it\u2019s a combination of all those things. Josh Raskin : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then you mentioned first quarter you\u2019d expect a little bit of weakness relative to the full year number based on weather and flu. Any sense in the magnitude, I mean, is that 100 basis points lower or is this going to be a more significant impact, understanding that we are only halfway through the quarter. Scott Brinker : I think you are talking about the magnitude that we would see. You're right; we are only halfway through the quarter, but we are not seeing a major change. I think some of the early results, there is \u2013 yeah, there has been some occupancy pressure in January as a result of those factors. So we just wanted to alert people. We are comfortable with a 5% range for the year, but it looks like, I would probably say 100 basis points is about a fair estimate that gets at this point, so call it 4'ish in the first quarter if we had to peg a number right now. Josh Raskin : Okay. Thanks, Scott. And then just a last question on post-acute. You talked about cap rates coming down a little bit there. Should we think of \u2013 I guess I\u2019m just curious to get your perspective on external new partners, et cetera, versus just continuing to grow with your existing partners. Has that dynamic changed, as cap rates have come down? Or do you still think that there\u2019s opportunities with new partners in post-acute? Scott Brinker : Josh, most of the growth will continue to be with Genesis. We think the most about their platform and their position in evolving healthcare landscape, but we did pick up a number of new partners through the Mainstreet partnership and we'd except to continue to grow with them as well. So there is a list of three to five, like Ensign and Trilogy that we expect to be growth partners going forward. Josh Raskin : Okay, thanks Scott. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Smedes Rose : Hi, it's Smedes. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about supply in the U.S. for senior housing overall. It sounds like you are pretty protected in the MSAs where your \u2013 the bulk of your portfolio is, but do you see an uptick in supply kind of nationwide? Scott Brinker : The new supply continues to be at really a local level, so some markets do have a high amount of new supply like Houston and there are a number of markets that have virtually none. Now if you look at it at a national level, we think supply and demand are roughly in line. If anything, demand is growing faster than supply, which is why you see our occupancy increasing year-over-year, the NIC National occupancy is increasing year-over-year and is predicted to do so again in 2015. So we still feel like the dynamics are positive for occupancy, but for sure there are certain markets where you should be more concerned than others. In terms of the change, if anything it's slowing down, so there certainly is still projects; our new project's been put under construction, but there is an uptick from what we\u2019ve seen over the past few years. Tom DeRosa : And Smedes, we are very focused on working with our national and top-quality regional operators to bring supply into markets where there is very little supply. Think about a market like Washington D.C. - in Central Washington D.C. we have a Sunrise asset on Connecticut avenue very close to the National Zoo, which is a great example of an urban senior housing property where there needs to be more of \u2013 this is in a market that is very densely populated. The population is getting older, and people want to stay where they lived prior to entering senior housing. So that\u2019s an area that we are very focused on and working with our operators to be able to bring that supply to the market and we are very optimistic that that will be very well received. Smedes Rose : Thanks. And the other thing I just wanted to ask you, it looks like you've pretty much exited your investment in hospitals and I was just wondering, is that an area that you would see returning to at some point or\u2026? Scott Brinker : With respect to hospitals, historically, our hospital portfolio did not mirror the quality of our seniors housing and post-acute portfolio. If in the future there were opportunities to buy high quality hospitals, we would consider that. Smedes Rose : Okay, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Hi, good morning, everybody. Scott Brinker : Hi, Rich. Rich Anderson : So anybody in the room there, would you be as comfortable being twice the size the company you are now or less comfortable or are you kind of neutral on that topic? Tom DeRosa : Rich, this is Tom. We \u2013 you know Scott mentioned the investment we\u2019re making in people and infrastructure. We are attracting very talented people from the industry to come work with us because they see we\u2019re an outstanding company that really invests in its people. And as you think about growing our business \u2013 think about how we've grown in the last five years. It\u2019s all about people. So, we are always thinking about where we will be in the future, and do we have the right team, do we have the right infrastructure. And so, I\u2019m confident that we have the right human capital strategy in place to take this company wherever opportunities may take us in the future. Rich Anderson : Do you think the issue with the HCP and HCR ManorCare and that whole subpoena issue, is that something we should be worried about generally, or what is your thought about just looking at the kind of the post-acute business and how it might be exposed to issues like that as a general rule of thumb? Tom DeRosa : I can\u2019t comment on HCP and ManorCare. What I can comment on is Genesis and we are \u2013 and Mainstreet, as Scott was discussing as well. We are very bullish about the future of post-acute in this country. And we are investing with Genesis and we\u2019re investing with Mainstreet. We\u2019re very excited that Genesis is now public. We are big believers in George Hager. We think it\u2019s terrific that there is a public post-acute company now and we have every confidence in George and the Genesis team that they are going to take that business to where it needs to go. We need a strong, vibrant, post-acute product in the healthcare delivery system in this country. And we are betting that Genesis is going to bring that product \u2013 continue to bring that product to the market. Rich Anderson : Okay. Turning to the SHOP, or the Senior Housing Operating Portfolio, so in 2013 \u2013 I think I have these numbers right \u2013 you produced 6.2% same store NOI growth. In 2014, I did the average, I think it was 7.3%. I don\u2019t think you disclosed that number in your supplemental, the full year, do you? Tom DeRosa : No, we hit the same, just averaging the quarter. Rich Anderson : Okay. So average in the quarter is about 7.3% and it trended down from 8.1% in the first quarter to 5.7 % in the fourth quarter but compared well to your original guidance which was 5% or better for 2014, that\u2019s what you said a year ago. And now you are saying 5% \u2013 you took out the 'or better' comment, not to be nitpicky. So, it went from 6% to 7.3% to now expectation of 5%. Do you think that we are kind of in that sort of other side of the bell shaped curve or is it flattening out? What is your view about the business vis-\u00e0-vis its historical same store growth pattern? Tom DeRosa : I\u2019m not sure about the bell shaped curve, but we think a lot about the portfolio and operators that we've put together and think that the 5% for next year is achievable despite some very difficult comps in a relatively slow economy. And longer term, our expectation, our guidance has always been 4% to 5% is our best guess. Rich Anderson : Okay. Tom DeRosa : If that changes materially, we will definitely let everybody know. Scott Brinker : But we are always looking for ways to improve on that. That\u2019s one of the things that differentiates us, Rich, is that we have a lot more oars in the water than a typical owner of healthcare real estate to try and move that number forward. And we talk about that and we actually see real results from that. So I think we are as well positioned as anybody to drive same store sales growth from our RIDEA portfolio. Rich Anderson : Okay. Tom DeRosa : [indiscernible], Rich, just a quick comment from Scott Estes here. We initially went into RIDEA and we\u2019re talking about 4% to 5% long-term growth and we had a lot of debate about how you are going to outpace inflation and we've put out probably like you said, 6%, 7%. 8% numbers for four years now. So I think we just to need to get perception is if we can generate outpaced growth and we are adding value at the property level and we are outperforming our sector, I mean that\u2019s really the things we can control. Rich Anderson : Okay. How often do you look at your ownership in Sunrise OpCo vis-\u00e0-vis your \u2013 how you book it and what\u2019s valued on your financials right now? I mean in terms of potential \u2013 I don't know, impairment I don't \u2013 not discussing that's coming, but is that an annual event or ongoing or how does that take place. Tom DeRosa : We look at it \u2013 I mean we have a 24% approximate ownership in the management company and that investment is in our investments in unconsolidated entities and we haven't really talked more about it. I don't think it's meaningful from an aggregate balance sheet perspective. Scott Brinker : It\u2019s a small investment. Rich Anderson : Small, and more a canary in the coal mine type stuff, but just curious. And then the last question from me is what would you say \u2013 how would you think the history would look like if you were to compare the share account \u2013 the growth in your share count versus the growth in your FFO, over an extended period of time? What do you think that would look like? Would it be greater share count, or greater FFO growth? Scott Brinker : We could probably sit here and think about that. I think the most important thing you need to think of is looking at what type of total return and shareholder value creation we've had by \u2013 the reason why if FFO ever was slower is because of the dramatic portfolio enhancements we've made over the last five years. I mean, we had about $5 billion of assets five years or six years ago and we sold $2.5 billion to $3 billion of those and we've bought the best assets in the industry. And now we are trading at the highest multiple in that great return. So you can focus on a little bit of the tinkering about how we financed it and what results. But we have been able to grow our dividend nicely and get great total shareholder returns. So I think that\u2019s what we are supposed to do. Tom DeRosa : Yeah, I can underscore enough what Scott just said about the fact that we've disposed of $2.5 billion in assets over the last five years. That is difficult when you are trying to grow FFO when you are selling assets of that magnitude, but that\u2019s why we feel so good about the future and that\u2019s what you should be expecting any company in the real estate sector should be doing. And you know what? They don\u2019t do it. So, look across the real estate sector, and the companies that have active asset disposition in asset management programs should be trading at a premium and those that continue to hold on to assets because they don\u2019t want to jeopardize their FFO growth should be trading at a discount. Rich Anderson : Okay. I\u2019ve taken too long. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Scott Brinker : Thanks, Rich. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ross Nussbaum with UBS. Scott Brinker : Hi, Ross. Ross Nussbaum : I\u2019m \u2013 clarify the same store NOI guidance. So I think your guidance for 2015 is 3% to 3.5% and I think I heard you say that the shop portfolio or the RIDEA portfolio is going to do 5% is your guidance or do I have the... Scott Brinker : Yes, that's correct. Yes. Ross Nussbaum : So that would imply for the medical office, the triple-net, the life science, it would imply I think 2% to 2.5% same store NOI growth? Is that about right? Scott Brinker : That\u2019s the way the math works. We already gave you the guidance for each of the subcomponents; the MOBs was 2.25%, the rest were around 2.5%. Yep, long term care [indiscernible]. Ross Nussbaum : Wondering why \u2013 maybe I missed this, but why the slowdown on the triple-net side at least from where it was in the fourth quarter? Scott Brinker : It may be a couple of basis points below the fourth quarter but it\u2019s in line with historical averages. I mean the triple-net business is a 2.5% plus or minus growth business and its all contractual rent increases so there are no one-time fees in that number or anything like that. So it\u2019s very predictable but it\u2019s not a super-high growth part of the business. Ross Nussbaum : Great. I can follow-up with you guys afterwards. That\u2019s sort of where I was going, which is saw the 3.1% number for the fourth quarter. I said, wow, that looked good, but it felt like there might be something one-time-ish in there. Scott Brinker : Yeah, there may be. The 3.1% was for the post-acute long term care portfolio, and that's still primarily Genesis is two-thirds of that category. And our increases of course are still on the 3.3% range, so that drives it. Then we do have the CPI catch up language on number of these leases where the escalators are not fixed and that can create some noise from quarter-to-quarter. Ross Nussbaum : Yeah, that\u2019s helpful. On the disposition front \u2013 I might have missed this earlier, the $400 million of sales that you guys have planned for the first half of this year at 10 caps, what do you guys have in the portfolio that would sell at double this cap? Scott Brinker : I did mention that Ross in the comments, but just to say again, one, there is one acute care hospital in there and a nursing portfolio that we\u2019ve had in our overall portfolio for over 12 years that are more than half of that aggregate total. Tom DeRosa : And a big part of it is \u2013 that yield is based on the book value and we\u2019ve owned these assets for quite a while, so if you do the yield on the actual sale proceeds, the cap rate is a lot lower than 10%. Scott Brinker : I mentioned that. So, it should be more closer to 8.5% roughly depending upon how the final prices come in. Ross Nussbaum : Last question, can you talk a little bit strategically about the life science business? It feels like it hasn\u2019t been much of a focus for you guys. There have been some assets that have been coming up for sale that the Alexandrias and BioMeds of the world have bought. Where are you guys with respect to strategically expanding the portfolio in that segment? Scott Brinker : Ross, we made a very good investment when we bought this \u2013 the Cambridge portfolio with Forest City, it\u2019s turned out to be an outstanding asset for us to own. We\u2019ve looked around, we see things in that space, there has been nothing to date that has really captured our attention. We have found that we have better places to invest our capital. Ross Nussbaum : So that makes sense to monetize the seven properties you have in that segment or \u2013? Tom DeRosa : Ross, to my point earlier, we are active portfolio managers and we look at any asset, we are not in love with any asset over the long-term in a way if there is a good opportunity that makes sense to sell an asset. So we will always evaluate it, reevaluate the assets in our portfolio and that\u2019s one of them. Ross Nussbaum : Okay. If I could sneak in one last one, what do you guys thinking at this point in terms diminishing reimbursement of Medicare front in terms of what CMS is going to come out with this year? Scott Brinker : Yeah, for the first time in a while, it\u2019s pretty steady. So we are expecting any big news. I guess the biggest question mark would be whether Congress or CMS does anything with the physician reimbursement system. That seems unlikely. They haven\u2019t done anything for 10 years now other than do temporary extension. So I guess our best guess is more of the same. But that would be the only uncertainty on the horizon, but we are expecting flat to slightly positive reimbursement increases for the foreseeable future. Ross Nussbaum : Thank you. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Ross. Scott Brinker : Thanks, Ross. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of George Hoglund with Jefferies. George Hoglund : Yeah. Just want to get a little more color behind the thought process of combining the hospital portfolio with the SNF portfolio from a reporting perspective, I mean, given 3Q, there is still \u2013 there was pretty much a significant difference between occupancy levels, EBITDAR coverage levels and then also sort of facility revenue mix? Scott Brinker : Yeah, there are a couple of factors. I mean the ones I mentioned on the call, I think, are the most relevant. When you look at the actual buildings and the patients that are served, those three product types look a lot of like, skilled nursing, rehab hospitals LTACs. They don\u2019t look like hospitals. And in fact that we are now selling out of our remaining inpatient hospitals, we just thought it made more sense to have this post-acute category. Because over time, we really feel like these artificial distinctions will become even less important. So that was really the driver. We are thinking about maybe going forward providing specific information on the Genesis portfolio, which is the lion\u2019s share of the skilled nursing business anyway. And then you can have very detailed information on payment coverage and payer mix and occupancy. So hopefully \u2013 I mean, the goal here is to make things more transparent and give you better data. So if that\u2019s not the case, definitely let us know. But I think that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re heading. George Hoglund : Okay, thanks. And all my other questions were answered. Thanks. Scott Brinker : Thanks, George. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC. Michael Carroll : Hey, can you guys give us some color on the potential coverage improvement at Genesis? Does this improvement mainly stem from the corporate fixed charge coverage ratio? Or do you also expect this facility coverage to improve? Scott Brinker : Yeah, Michael, it\u2019s Scott Brinker. I think most of the improvement will be at the corporate level. The facility level coverage fluctuates in the 1.2 to 1.3 times range, after management fee. And there may be some slight improvement there as they bring on new development with better coverage, the expense initiatives that they are working on. But the real movement is going to be at the corporate level with a better balance sheet, debt refinancing, corporate synergies. So I think that\u2019s where you are going to see the material 10 basis point to 20 basis point type improvement. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. And then Scott, do you also find large portfolio transactions attractive in today\u2019s market, or has pricing gotten a little too ahead of itself? Scott Brinker : Well, we still look at everything. And at least the deals that we\u2019ve been able to execute, there\u2019s still a material spread between our cost of capital and our return on capital. So it still feels like a good time to be in the marketplace. That being said, there are some bigger portfolios that are being shopped and looked at by a lot of people and I think it does become a bit more challenging to grow the company that way. The spreads get tighter. The execution risk increases. So, say we\u2019re more likely to pass on the vast majority of those unless for some reason we find it really strategic. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Yeah. Hi. Just skipping the 2014 disposition volumes and the comments you made about 2015, I mean what should we be expecting if we\u2019re looking out to 2016 and beyond for normalized disposition volumes? Would it be significantly below this $400 million for this year? Scott Estes : Tough to say. I mean, my gut would be, yes, it would be, other than if you see something that would be strategic that would make sense. And it feels like we have great assets. I think the portfolio quality is the best it\u2019s ever been. So if you\u2019re just talking about a general sense for incremental dispositions, it feels good about where we\u2019re at. But like Tom said, we\u2019ll always do something. Tom DeRosa : Right. Because there is something that looks really good today in the portfolio that in three years there may be something that\u2019s happened beyond our control that may make us not like that asset as much. And we will \u2013 I think we\u2019ve demonstrated we will take a very proactive approach towards making sure our portfolio is always in the best quality \u2013 best position that it can be. Scott Estes : And even some of the dynamics around those, we call, strategic. We sold $900-plus-million of assets this year and still had 9% FAD per share growth. So that was an example of being opportunistic and generating some capital that I think is prudent. And that\u2019s the type of thing we\u2019ll do. So I still think we are focused on earnings, earnings, dividend growth, the whole package. Tom DeRosa : Exactly. Mike Carroll : So a base case of 250 to 500 a year may not be unreasonable just to assume, because you will probably have something going on. Scott Estes : That\u2019s as good a guess as ours, Mike. Mike Carroll : Got it, okay. And then going back to life science just for one second. The building that\u2019s vacant that was hitting the same-store NOI comps, can you talk about the leasing prospects for that? Scott Brinker : Yes, so it\u2019s been fully released, so occupancy is temporarily down. But we\u2019ll be back at 97% by mid-year, and potentially 100% by the end of the year. But just because of the timing of that releasing report negative NOI growth again in the first quarter, then it will be roughly flat in the second quarter and then a huge increase in the third and fourth quarter. Mike Carroll : Okay. That was it, thank you. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Mike. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Stifel. Daniel Bernstein : Hi, good morning, everyone. Scott Estes : Hi, Dan. Tom DeRosa : Hi, Dan. Daniel Bernstein : Hi, on the SHOP portfolio, I think some of your operators are starting to develop a little bit more. Are they coming to you for financing, or are they going elsewhere? And then also if you could remind us, what right do you have to buy assets that they develop? Scott Brinker : Yeah, Dan, it\u2019s Scott Brinker. There are 10, maybe as many as 15 operators in our portfolio that hey are active developers and we participate in one form or another in virtually all of their development. And it takes a range of structures. Sometimes we partner with them 100% from day one. So we\u2019re doing that with Sunrise in the UK. We are doing that with Merrill Gardens. Sometimes we do a triple-net lease development. Examples of that would be Brandywine on the East Coast, and then Avery in the UK, or Silverado on the West Coast. And then sometimes we have purchase options when the building stabilizes. So, in all events, the assets end up in the Health Care REIT joint venture, it\u2019s just a matter of timing. Tom DeRosa : Yeah, I mean, Dan, whether it\u2019s contractual or not contractual, I think if you polled the top operators, they\u2019d say they like working with us, and will continue to direct their \u2013 look to us to direct their \u2013 to work with them on their growth programs. So it\u2019s just the way we\u2019ve organized the business. It\u2019s the quality of the relationships. It\u2019s the value-add that we provide keeps them coming back to us. Daniel Bernstein : Okay, okay. And then in terms of overall development of your portfolio, just given some of the previous comments on the call about maybe your pricing competition getting a little bit tough, do you see yourselves increasing development over the next couple of years, relative to where you are now? Thinking like CIP to book or our overall development to book. Do you see a little bit of a maybe shift at some point into more development versus acquisitions? Scott Estes : As it relates to the on balance sheet development, I think you\u2019ll still see it be a relatively small number. We are bigger company but it\u2019s still a meaningful number and we\u2019re growing across different asset classes; and as Scott said, programs with all of our best operators. So, you can also look at that as just from the \u2013 if I have to think about what percentage of our growth roughly each year could come from development or acquiring assets as they\u2019re stabilized, I think it\u2019s a nice supplement that\u2019s meaningful could be 20%, 30% of the total growth could be brand new assets at attractive yield. Daniel Bernstein : And I might have missed this earlier. You have your generator out; we had a false fire alarm here in Baltimore. Not quite as cold as you guys, though. Scott Estes : No. Daniel Bernstein : But on Genesis, what was the fixed charge coverage for the quarter, if you gave that out? And then also, is that normalized in any way for any \u2013 or has there been any impact from, say, non-normal costs of the integration between Genesis and Skilled in that fixed charge number, so that it \u2013 I think about how it might progress through 2015, those integration costs come out. I\u2019m just trying to understand, what are the drivers that are going to move the fixed charge coverage up? Scott Brinker : Daniel, it will be a little confusing, because Genesis is now publically traded, of course, and result \u2013 reports their results in real-time. And we always report one quarter in arrears so\u2026 Daniel Bernstein : Okay. Scott Brinker : \u2026so they are never going to perfectly match up. It\u2019s fair to say that Genesis ended the year, at the corporate and facility level in the low to mid 1.2s. And our expectation is that at the corporate level, they\u2019ll be in the high 1.3s by the end of 2015. Daniel Bernstein : Okay, okay. Was there any \u2013 again, was there any like integration costs, or unusual costs that might be in that? Or is that kind of a normalized number, that 1.2s? Scott Brinker : I wouldn\u2019t call it normalized. They did have a number of expenses in the fourth quarter, that were unusual by their standards. Daniel Bernstein : Okay. Scott Brinker : And that drives some of the improvement next year is just\u2026 Daniel Bernstein : Okay. Scott Brinker : \u2026adjusting those expenses that were outsized in the fourth quarter. Daniel Bernstein : Okay, okay. We\u2019re getting late in the call. I\u2019ll hop off, and take anything else offline. Thanks. Scott Brinker : Thanks, Dan. Scott Estes : Thanks, Dan. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And you next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hey, guys. The cap rate you acquired, four senior housing operating properties in Q4, was definitely done at a pretty compelling cap rate of 7.9%. What\u2019s represented in those properties? What kind of growth rate is baked into that? Scott Brinker : Yeah, Todd, those are all brand-new properties. One is with Silverado that they developed in Texas. And then we had essentially a purchase option on that building, so that drives a very favorable cap rate than what would be paid in, say, an auction. And then we did three acquisitions of essentially brand-new private-pay homes in the UK yet compelling cap rates. So all four of those buildings are with existing partners, brand-new buildings, major metros, off-market. It\u2019s all the things that you would want to do to drive a premium yield. It\u2019s not like we bought low-quality government reimbursement homes. These are premier, brand-new assets with our best operators. Todd Stender : And a market cap rate would be closer to 6%. Is that fair? It\u2019s pretty good value creation. Scott Brinker : Yeah, exactly, if not lower. But exactly, I mean that\u2019s how we like to do investments. So they bring us those deals, and we are more than happy to help them grow their business by being their capital partner. Tom DeRosa : Yeah, you don\u2019t get that from a broadly marketed auction, Todd. Todd Stender : And then just kind of sticking I guess in the development theme. Memory care is represented in all of your senior housing triple net development projects, but only a handful have independent living. You really should have exposure to memory care, insulate these projects from any threat of new supply. Is that kind of how you think about kind of weighing the risk and reward about building at this point in the cycle? Tom DeRosa : Memory care is distinct competence of a number of our operators, most notably Silverado. Todd, you know that dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s is going to be an epidemic in this country, and we need to have a greater supply of memory care communities to house, people who cannot live in their traditional homes. So we see that as a market that is undersupplied, with a growing demand that is going to be a challenge for our country, and some of the other countries where we operate, and countries where we don\u2019t operate. Managing that growing population is probably the biggest challenge to healthcare delivery. And so we feel very well positioned there, and are focused more in the senior housing with memory care space than we are in independent living. Todd Stender : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Tom. And just quickly, last questions for Scott Estes. Thanks for the details on your CapEx budget. As we kind of look out for the next couple of years, what are some good numbers to use for CapEx per unit, for your senior housing operating units, and then when you look at medical office on a price per square foot basis? Scott Estes : Yes, Todd, medical office is in the $1.50 per square foot range, which reflects the young age of our properties. It\u2019s about 12 years average age, same is true in senior housing. Scott Brinker : $1,700-ish [ph] probably. Scott Estes : Yeah. We really look at it, and I think everyone should look at it, more on a percentage of NOI basis, because that\u2019s where you really benefit from having properties in the major metros that have really high NOI per unit. Because it ends up being a very small percentage of your NOI. And that\u2019s ultimately what you care about, is the cash returns. So if you got a low-quality independent living building that generates very little NOI, $1,000 per unit of CapEx is a huge [indiscernible]. If you\u2019ve got a Sunrise building in London, that\u2019s charging $10,000 a month. $1,000 per unit of CapEx is nothing. That\u2019s how we look at it as a percentage of NOI. That number tends to be in 6% to 7% range for our operating portfolio. Todd Stender : Very helpful. thanks, Scott. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Michael Knott : Hey, guys. Tom DeRosa : Mike, good morning. Scott Brinker : Good morning, Mike. Michael Knott : A question for you. Given how mega is valued in the public market, have you thought about spinning out your skilled nursing post-acute portfolio? Tom DeRosa : We like our skilled nursing post-acute portfolio, Michael. We see it\u2019s an important part of our business, and we think we\u2019re clearly aligned in the right piece of that sector. And one of the areas that we are seeing is the increasing connectivity between seniors housing, post-acute, and acute care. We as a company are driving that connectivity. So it\u2019s very important for us to be in that space. It\u2019s not important for us to be in low-quality mix skilled nursing homes. Scott Estes : And we have kind of spun that out arguably over the last five years, via selling, I think, a lot of the older skilled nursing assets in our portfolio. I bet if you aggregated that, what would it be, guys? $1 billion plus, at least, $1 billion, $1.5 billion, would be my guess. Michael Knott : Okay. And then from an investment standpoint, I don\u2019t think you guys talked about investments you\u2019ve done so far this year. And there\u2019s been some media reports and such about a large deal you did with Benchmark. Just curious what you guys have done so far this year, and may be what \u2013 any color on that. Scott Brinker : Well we don\u2019t talk about investments until quarter-end. But given that the Benchmark news was public, I\u2019ll go ahead and comment on it. That wasn\u2019t our decision, but we\u2019re more than happy to talk about it because it\u2019s exactly the type of portfolio that we want to own, and that you would want us to own. So Benchmark has been a partner of our since 2010, they\u2019ve done a fantastic job. I mean, they have outperformed quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter. Based completely in New England, so primarily Massachusetts and Connecticut, which is where this portfolio is, particularly in Boston. And they have managed it for a long time. Their joint venture partner was at the end of its life, and was looking to exit, and we were more than happy to step in. So Benchmark will continue to operate. They\u2019ll be our 5% JV partner. The cap rate\u2019s in the high 5s, which for these assets in this market feels like a really good deal, especially given what I\u2019m seeing for much lower quality buildings in rural markets throughout the U.S. Michael Knott : Okay, thanks for that color. And then last one for me, I\u2019m just curious \u2013 maybe any color you guys have on how crowded auction tents are today. I know you said you look at everything, even though you\u2019re not necessarily always winning auctions. But just curious how crowded those might be, and if you are seeing any new types of capital with interest, or even preliminary interest in healthcare real estate. Scott Brinker : It least in the auction intent, it\u2019s dominated by the REIT\u2019s \u2013 the public REIT\u2019s, the non-traded REIT\u2019s. We\u2019re not seeing any new sources of capital, at least in the auction tent but what we are seeing is the major pension funds wanting to partner with us on particular portfolios or asset classes. So, at least in our experience, they are bidding on their own for this stuff, but they see the value of healthcare real estate, and they want to partner with us to enter this space. Tom DeRosa : Michael, it kind of fits with something we\u2019ve talked a bit about on this call today, which is our growing concentration in the key urban markets in the U.S., Canada and the UK. That is where the global pension funds like to invest across real estate classes. If they\u2019re going to make an investment in healthcare, it\u2019s going to be in one of those markets. So I will echo something that Scott just said. We know all these players, they want to work with us, because they understand the quality of the real estate that we own. And they have historically not invested in this sector, so they need a partner. And we continue to look at opportunities that may be of interest to that new group of capital providers. Michael Knott : Thanks for that color. And just how recent is that change that you are seeing? Or those expressions of interest? Tom DeRosa : I think this has happened over the last nine months. Michael Knott : Okay. All right, thanks a lot. Tom DeRosa : All right, Michael. Take care. Operator : And there are no further questions. This does conclude today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect. Tom DeRosa : Thank you.",

Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the First Quarter 2015 Health Care REIT Earnings Conference Call. My name is Holly, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for HCN\u2019s first quarter 2015 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at hcreit.com. We are holding a live webcast of today\u2019s call, which may be accessed through the company\u2019s website. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although, HCN believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Tom DeRosa, CEO of Health Care REIT. Tom. Thomas DeRosa : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. Resiliency is a word too often used by CEO\u2019s to describe their financial performance, but I cannot think of a better word to describe out quarter. It\u2019s no secret that Snowmageddon in New England and an epic flu season presented severe headwinds to many of our operating partners. Nevertheless we are right on target at $1.04 per share normalized FFO and same-store NOI growth for the entire portfolio of 3.1% in line with our 3% to 3.5% forecasted for 2015. If we were a passive owner of real estate, we would have watched these negative events from the side lines and they may have caused us to deliver some very disappoint results. HCN, however, has invested significantly in state-of-the-art asset management systems that give us timely data on operations and allow us and our operating partners to make timely adjustments for unforeseen or unexpected negative events. We take a unique hands-on approach to this business here in the U.S. and with teamed professionals on the ground in London and Toronto. That\u2019s how you build a resilient operating business. These results were also delivered in a quarter were we successfully priced a $1.5 billion equity offering, the largest in our history. Consistent operating performance driven by our best in class operators combined with industry leading new investment volume has resulted in strong earnings growth that is significantly driving down our leverage. As a result in March, we were awarded a BBB+ rating by Fitch, Scott Estes will provide additional commentary on our improving leverage position. As for industry leading new investment growth this was a tremendous quarter, our relationship investment strategy resulted in $2.2 billion in new investments, $1.8 billion of that from our existing operators like Benchmark, Genesis and Avery. Our strategy is to invest in the best quality healthcare real estate across the healthcare continuum. We have sold over $3 billion in lower quality long term care SNFs and other non-strategic assets and reinvested the cash in the best quality healthcare real estate in the best markets. A great example of this is the new investment we made in Aspen Hospitals for acute care private pay hospitals in London this quarter. These top performing and modern hospitals are located in some of the most affluent neighborhoods in the world like Wimbledon and Highgate. Aspen is under contract to be purchased by Tenet Healthcare and we expect as of the third quarter these hospitals would be operated by Tenet. These hospitals are approximately 90% private pay and 70% of revenue is from outpatient services, they will be an anchor to our London portfolio 40 senior housing assets by Sunrise, Avery and Signature. 15 of our elder care communities are within the catchment area of these hospitals. I know many of you are familiar with our HealthCare Village as we call it in Voorhees, New Jersey, in London we expect to drive similar operating synergies to those that have been captured in Voorhees between Virtual Hospital, Brandywine and Genesis. With respect to asset sales we just announced the sale of our Life Science\u2019s portfolio this week, this investment was our homerun for our shareholders returning 15% unlevered IRR. This opportunistic sale for HCN is a strategic acquisition for Forest City as this asset will become core income producing asset for Forest City going forward. Forest City has been a great partner and we wish them continued success. We celebrated the opening of our new Toronto office last week. Our Canada business will be run by Colin Catherwood a tremendous addition to the HCN team as he has a long history in the Canadian healthcare market from his years at Brookfield. He is joined in Toronto by Connor MacLennan a top performing member of the Toledo Investment team. I'm also pleased to announce that Barbara Montresor will join us next week as Senior Vice President for Media and Communications, Barbra comes to us from Johnson & Johnson and brings a wealth of global healthcare communications experience that will benefit both HCN as well as our operators as we strive to position seniors housing post acute and outpatient medical real estate as key elements in driving down costs and yielding better outcomes in healthcare delivery. Scott Brinker will now provide you with greater detail on our new investments and operating performance in the quarter. Scott? Scott Brinker : Thank you, Tom. I may kick off with investment activity. Our deep relationships drove $2.2 billion of carefully selected investments last quarter. The vast majority was follow-on activity with our existing partners and was sourced in private negotiations. As a result the blended initial yield has a healthy 6.9% well above our cost of capital. The list of repeat clients was long and included Revera, Benchmark, Avery, Belmont Village, Cascade, Brandywine, Mainstreet, Genesis, Signature, Kelsey-Seybold, and Merrill Gardens. We have a simple but highly disciplined investment strategy, high quality real estate, trusted operating partners and aligned interest. Our partners continue to bring us opportunities that meet these criteria. What is equally exciting is that our network of partners is growing, last quarter we added two new relationships, the first is Oakmont, who develops and operates Class A senior housing properties in California. We acquired two of the new developments which achieved stabilized occupancy and just for in nine months respectively. The second is Aspen, a leading private pay hospital provider in the UK We completed a sale lease back on their four crown jewels, there is a nice presentation about the Aspen investment on our website. The properties are located in extremely affluent densely populated sub markets in London, which is now our number three market. London is joined by New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Los Angles in our top five. We listen to your feedback and included lots of detail about our investments and dispositions in the earnings release. All assets are not created equal; the cap rate tells only part of the story so we're making a major push to tell you more about our investments and our existing portfolio. Our experience is that higher quality real estate reached a superior, more resilient growth. And by virtually any metric and against any benchmark we compare very favorably and a wide growth rental rates, building age, local income and housing values. Scott Estes will you more about our enhanced disclosure. Speaking of high quality real estate earlier this week we agreed to sell our life science interest back to Forest City or $574 million which is a five cap on forward NOI that pricing underscores inherent value of only class A real estate. We will recycle the capital just as we've done one roughly $3 billion of asset sales in the past five years. We saw the benefit last quarter of having built the diversified portfolio; we posted 3% same-store growth in the operating portfolio despite of flu season that significantly impacted occupancy in many of our core markets such as the U.K., Canada, New England and Mid Atlantic. The National Health Departments report that flu related hospitalizations increased over last year by roughly 90% in the U.S., 70% in UK and 50% in Canada. The flu caused in unusual despite and move outs that we estimate reduced occupancy by 100 basis points and reduced NOI growth by at least 150 basis points. Importantly, the spike in move out is a temporary issue. The demand remains strong across the portfolio, moving activity continues to be excellent and rental rates were up 3% versus last year. The Flu season was long this year, so occupancy hit a trough in mid to late April and only recently begin to improve. As a result same-store growth in the operating portfolio will likely to be low single-digit in 2Q then move higher to the second half of the year as occupancy gather momentum. Looking through the unusual circumstances this winter, the fundamentals of the business remains strong. Our operating partners are universally positive about the outlook. Moving to triple net seniors housing, same-store NOI grew 3.4% last quarter. It\u2019s an excellent result that is once again well above inflation. As a reminder we don\u2019t include any fee related income in any of same-store metrics. We think this provide a more accurate picture of underlying performance. Turning to post-acute and long-term care, our rental income is well secured and growing consistently. Same-store NOI grew 3.1% last quarter. Genesis just reported an excellent first quarter particularly in our portfolio with solid expense control and improved occupancy and queue mix. They expect to be headed towards 1.4 times corporate level payment coverage by year end with upside thereafter. Next up is outpatient medical; this business segment continues to turn out predictable steady growth. Same-store NOI increased 2.8% last quarter, a convenience and low cost of outpatient care at in great demand from consumers, payers and providers and our platform is well positioned to capitalize. In summary. our deep relationships best-in-class portfolio continued to deliver shareholder value. Scott Estes will now discuss our financial results. Scott Estes : Thanks Scott and good morning everybody. The one message that I would like all of you to take away from my comments today is that HCN has made tremendous strides in strengthening our balance sheet over the last five quarters. We remain committed to maintaining more conservative credit profile. This should allow us to continue reducing our cost of capital, enhancing our valuation and providing future financial flexibility. My specific remarks today focus on our recent financial performance, the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity and will provide an update on the key assumptions driving our 2015 guidance. So I begin by taking a look at our first quarter financial performance. Normalized FFO for the quarter increased to $1.04 per share, our normalized FAD came in at $0.92 per share. All-in-all, we view this as a solid quarterly performance in light of the harsh winter and flu season, as well as raising nearly 1.5 billion in equity in the middle of the quarter to finance the portion of our first quarter acquisition that weren\u2019t completed until the end of the quarter. We\u2019re right in line with where we need to be at this point in year, and have maintained our earnings forecast at previously level, which I\u2019ll discuss later in my comments. More importantly, we strengthened our balance sheet enhanced our liquidity and set ourselves up for an even stronger second half of the year. We had two notable revenue line items this quarter that I\u2019d like to take a moment to explain. First interest income increased by about $6 million sequentially in the quarter to 17 million, that was largely as a result of the $360 million loan to Genesis disclosed in our earnings release and second our other income line came in higher than usual at $5.1 million this quarter, as it includes 2.1 million in loan prepayment fees from an operator that paid off a loan during the quarter to be clear level, Scott Brinker mentioned we did not include fees such as this, neither our normalized earnings results or in our same-store portfolio of NOI metrics. In terms of dividends we will pay our 176th consecutive of quarterly cash dividend on May 20 of 82.50 per share, a rate of 3.30 annually, this represents the 3.8% increase over the dividends paid last year and represents a current dividend yield of 4.7%. In addition to the new disclosure provided in our earnings release as Scott Brinker discussed, we were similarly proactive enhancing both our supplement and interactive portfolio on our website this quarter. I think we probably made more changes and I can review on the call today, but a few of the most significant enhancements include the following items.\u2019 First, where ever applicable within the supplement we provided portfolio information on a pro rata NOI basis as opposed to depreciated investment balance. I think Page 6, is a good example of this where you can see we now disclose portfolio diversification by NOI. Next on Page 4 and 5, we provide the operator and address of every property acquired during the quarter. On page 8, we added specific information about Genesis portfolio performance which includes trailing 12 month facility level and corporate fixed charge coverage. Page 9 provides new quality indicator disclosure which compares our portfolio to various industry benchmarks to provided additional insight into the relative quality of our assets. Page 10 provides new detail regarding the five largest expense items in our same-store RIDEA portfolio, and last if you take a look at the portfolio map on our website we added visualizations allowing the user to see how our portfolio is strategically positioned in major urban wealth centers in areas with above average senior population growth. We also created a visualization which allows you to our top market by NOI as identified in our supplement. Turing now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The highlight of our first quarter capital markets activity with the largest secondary equity offering in company history which settled in late February. We completed the sale of 19.55 million shares of common equity at $75.50 per share generating nearly $1.5 billion in gross proceeds. In addition, we issued 766,000 common shares under our dividend reinvestment program generating 59 million in proceeds. We generated 188 million of proceeds to the sale of non-strategic assets and loan payoffs which included $59 million of gains and loan fees representing a blended yield on total proceeds of 8.3%. And last we repaid approximately 208 million secured debts at a blended rate of 4.1% and assumed to refinance 289 million of secured debt at a blended 3.5% rate. So as result of these activities we ended the quarter in a very strong liquidity position with $2.1 billion available on our - an additional $202 million in cash, and anticipated net cash proceeds of approximately 630 million from dispositions forecast throughout the remainder of the year. As a result of our recent financing activity and portfolio performance our balance sheet and financial metrics as of March 31 we are in the strongest position in quite sometimes. We are pleased to have received the recent upgrade in our corporate credit to BBB+ from Fitch in early March, this rating increases our already providing a direct benefit for our shareholders in the form of a 12.5 basis point reduction in the cost of our line of credit and a five basis point reduction in our annual credit facility fees. I think the commitment to strengthen our balance sheet is best exemplified by the fact that we have issued nearly 4 billion of equity over the last 15 months. We have made such huge strides in enhancing our balance sheet recently that I would like to highlight a specific improvements we have made during just the last five quarters alone. If you look between December 31 of 2013 and March 31 of 2015 our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization improved by over five full percentage points to 37.3%, net debt to enterprise value declined nearly 11 full percentage points to 27.4%, net debt to EBITDA improved 60 basis points from 6.1 times to 5.5 times, interest coverage improved 50 basis points from 3.4 times to 3.9 times, fixed charge coverage improved 40 basis points from 2.7 times to 3.1 times and secured debt as a percentage of total assets declined nearly 2% from 13.2% to 11.3%. I think it\u2019s important that we have made these balance sheet improvements while generating a significant 9% increase in normalized per share during calendar 2014 and continue to forecast 5% to 7% normalized debt for share growth in 2015. I do think it is interesting to note that if we chose to raise a 1.5 million of 10 year debt in February instead of a 1.5 billion in equity our book leverage would be flat over the last five quarters instead of improving 5% by 2015 FFO and FAD would be about $0.09 higher than our forecast today. So clearly we have emphasized the strength of the balance sheet and long term financial flexibility over short term earnings growth. So I will conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2015 guidance, in terms of same-store NOI growth we continue to forecast blended same-store growth of 3% to 3.5% for the total portfolio in 2015. Our forecast are generally unchanged for the respective portfolio components but as Scott mentioned we\u2019re forecasting slightly slower growth during the first half of the year in our seniors housing operating portfolio that is expected to pick up during the second half of the year. In terms of our investment expectations, the only acquisitions in our forecast or what we closed in the first quarter and the approximate 200 million of investments expected through our Mainstreet partnership throughout the remainder of the year. Our 2015 guidance also includes a little over 200 million of development conversions at a blended projected yield of 8.2%. In terms of our disposition forecast we now expect to receive proceeds of approximately $1 billion for the full year including the anticipated sale of the interest in our Life Science portfolio which brings our expected yield on total disposition proceeds for the year down to approximately 7%. Our capital expenditure forecast is now approximately 58 million for 2015 which is comprised of approximately 39 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio with the remaining 19 million coming from our medical facilities portfolio. This represents a slight reduction from our original expectations but it is largely due to timing. These amounts continue to represent a relatively modest 7% of anticipated NOI in both asset categories. Our G&A forecast remains approximately $145 million for 2015 which is right in line with our previous forecast and finally we\u2019re pleased to be in a position to maintain our 2015 earnings guidance in light of the significantly tougher operating environment earlier this year while adding the sale of our Life Science investment to our forecast. So as a result we continue to forecast normalized FFO in a range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share representing 3% to 5% growth, while on normalized 2015 FAD expectation remains in a range of 383 to 393 per diluted share representing a solid increase of 5% to 7%. So I will conclude my remarks today by reemphasizing the great strides we\u2019ve made in enhancing our balance sheet, lowering our cost of capital and retaining the significant liquidity to execute our business plan which is continuing to drive the consistent financial performance you expect from HCN. So at this point, I will turn it back to you Tom for any closing comments or to open it up for questions. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks Scott. Holly, if you please open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Nicholas Yulico with UBS. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. First off I appreciate all the expanded disclosures in the supplemental. It's great to have that info. On the senior housing operating portfolio, can you -- I think you said, Scott, low single digit for second quarter. And I wasn't sure if that was same-store NOI... Scott Estes : Yes, that\u2019s right Nick. It should be in the same neighborhood as the first quarter just because of the dip in occupancy. It took a while to bounce back this year. , move outs great; unfortunately, move outs continue to be way above normal until late April. Nicholas Yulico : And then just going back to the guidance you gave for that segment last quarter, I think you said 5% same-store NOI growth, about mid 4% same-store revenue, and 4% same-store expense growth. Are you still targeting something similar for that? What are -- how do you get back up closer to 5% if you're going to have the first half of the year close to 3% it sounds like on same-store NOI growth Thomas DeRosa : Yes, I think that\u2019s right Nick. It could end up being a bit below 5% for the full year just because of the weak first half of the year. The run rate, I think, we remain confident is in that 5% range. So, there\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on. The operators are very positive about what they\u2019re seeing in the facility level. We just had a [Indiscernible]. Scott Estes : Yes, well, I mean what we saw, Nick, in the first quarter was unprecedented in terms of the flu season particularly in the UK was something that we would have never anticipated and, I think, the fact that we were able to report what we\u2019ve reported is a tribute to our operating model because it could have been worse. Nicholas Yulico : Right. Then Tom, just a bigger-picture question. Your senior housing operating pool is now about 35% of what you own. It's sort of on the higher-end historically; it's been that way for the past year. How are you viewing that segment in relation to the total Company size? Historically it's not the equity investors who are going to push back on that getting bigger; it's the rating agencies who have looked at the segment differently than, I think, equity investors, who are more positive on it. Are you able to get that bigger, or are the rating agencies going to push back on that? Thomas DeRosa : You know Nick, I think that\u2019s it\u2019s important for both the equity and debt investors to understand that these RIDEA investments have been made associated with operating investments, asset management investments, technology investments on our end. This is not a passive investment for us and I think that when people see how we manage that business and the amount of people and resources we devote to it, I think that they get comfortable with it. They get comfortable that we can drive the upside that you believe that we can generate from having that percentage of RIDEA in our business model. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. So you think you could take it higher and the rating agencies would be fine with that? Thomas DeRosa : I think the rating agencies, as they spend more time with us will get as comfortable with it as you are. Nicholas Yulico : Alright. Thanks Tom. Thomas DeRosa : All right, Nick. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Thanks. Can you guys give us some color on why you like the private hospital market in the UK? Why do these investments warrant such a low cap rate, that's in line with the senior housing community? Thomas DeRosa : Well, I\u2019ll start off. We think that private pay hospital business in the UK is tremendous and when I say UK I\u2019m talking about London. There is a long developed private pay healthcare market in London and given the issues in the National Health Service there, we see these assets having tremendous growth in the future and you also need to understand that the assets that we\u2019ve bought are in some of the best locations for any kind of real estate on the planet. I mean the residential market that surrounds Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon and Highgate, in north London, these are markets where residential home prices, start somewhere in the equivalent of $7 million U.S. So these are very affluent markets with strong positions providing largely outpatient medical services to very affluent communities and what we are excited about is our ability to connect these hospitals to our elder care communities as I mentioned 15 of our assets in London are in the immediate catchment area of this hospital portfolio so we\u2019re bullish on this business. Scott? Scott Estes : Yes, Mike, I would also just pointed that public company evaluations because it really is a different business, the hospital provided in the U.S. tend to trade it seven or eight times even a very best ones, where as in the UK there was multiplies and more like 10 or 11, 12 times, because it\u2019s just a different business. Tom mentioned how much of the revenues from an outpatient, from outpatient services, which just needs the better pricing power, more stable demand. So I think if their label is hospitals but it\u2019s important to think about them is different business and there is a pretty long history of the propco-opco structure in this sector and the lease yields have been very low overtimes. We actually feel like the yield we got is remarkably high given the locations and now credit quality from Tenet, these are $5 billion equity market company with $2 billion of EBITDA. Michael Carroll : Then are you only focused on the hospital investments around London and not the rest of UK. Thomas DeRosa : I think, here are some other good markets in the UK and if there, again, we\u2019re generally focused on investing in private pay assets in affluent markets. That\u2019s our strategy. So there maybe assets that will become available in some of the better markets outside of London, and we\u2019d certainly consider them. Michael Carroll : Great. Thank you. Scott Estes : Thanks. Operator : And our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Good morning. I just wanted to ask you, big picture, it seems like your transaction activity over the past couple of quarters has been running considerably higher than in prior quarters. I just was wondering if there any particular factors in play that you could cite, whether it's pricing, or just available product coming to market, or opportunities that your partners are finding. Then I had a follow-up question on your hospital investment in the UK afterwards if I could. Scott Brinker : It\u2019s Scott Brinker responding. The last two quarters were really below our quarters from an investment standpoint, an average of 2 billion per quarter, that\u2019s not the right run rate. Those were unusually high; it was just opportunistic, the consistent theme now is our partners are bringing us these opportunities. And that does lead to more consistent and higher volume of deal flows and I think most of our peers would see. So the outlook is strong, the underlying thesis I think is fantastic, but 2 billion per quarter is definitely at the high end of what we would expect. Smedes Rose : Then on your hospital investment, you mentioned that UK it's really -- you mean London. I'm just wondering -- maybe this is out to nutsy, but is it a function of -- there a lot of foreign folks that live in London and bypass the UK healthcare system and are pretty well-heeled. Is that a big piece of the patient population at those hospitals? Or are these really UK citizens that are using these services? Thomas DeRosa : Well, Smedes, you know that London has a very international population, I mean I lived there and was not able to use the National Health Service, we had to use private healthcare. So I would say the ex-pack community has grown exponentially since I lived there in the early 2000. So there is a strong market there, there has always been a market of people that travel to London for healthcare, and then you have many people that are opting out of the NHS because of the fact that they don\u2019t want to wait for certain types of surgeries. And the NHS is plagued by the dreaded queue as they call it for surgical procedures. So many people will opt to bypass the NHS, the other piece of this is that the NHS will often look to the hospitals that we bought as places to put patients in where they cannot treat them properly in their system, they may not have beds available. So often times any empty beds are filled by NHS by people covered by the NHS. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thanks. Do you think that that trend is something that you should see another major European cities or is it something that is kind of right now peculiar to the UK or particularly UK? Scott Estes : London always had a very well developed private acute care hospital system. You don\u2019t see that to the same extent in other countries in Europe but there are some. Spain has a private pay acute care hospital systems and very good hospitals. You see them in few other countries, but I would say no country in Europe has developed what the UK is developed over many years. Smedes Rose : Okay. Thank you. Scott Estes : Sure. Smedes Rose : Your next question comes from Joshua Raskin from Barclays Capital. Joshua Raskin : Hi thanks. Thomas DeRosa : Hey Josh. Joshua Raskin : Hi how are you guys. Just wanted to start on the Genesis loan, and how did that come about? Was this just you guys being good partners in a long-term relationship? Or do you think there's more opportunity to start thinking about loans? Scott Brinker : It was not part of it overall strategy to start doing more loans, when we do a loan it is with a important partner and Genesis certainly qualifies. This skilled health portfolio include a lot of owned assets and there was a big loan secured by those assets, it couldn\u2019t be assumed by Genesis as part of the merger. To get the deal done, they asked us to help out and we were happy to do that. It is really a transformative deal for Genesis, materially changes their operating platform as well as their financial statements in a positive way. So this loan will be outstanding for roughly a year, we will make a nice return and Genesis will end up being a substantially stronger company today but also a year from now. So it was really one time in nature and this is not a change in strategy where we\u2019re going to move away from doing high end private pay, high end locations that will remain our investment strategy. Thomas DeRosa : Josh we like to own real estate, we are not looking to use our low cost of capital to book some high yield loans. In this case for Genesis it makes - this loan makes is a bridge for Genesis to owning real estate, makes them a stronger company, but that is not an area that we are focused on for new investment volume. We want to own real estate. Joshua Raskin : Okay, that makes sense. Obviously it looks like a good deal for them, so I certainly understand the partnership mentality on that. The second question just on initial yields and investment relationships versus new partners, I'm just curious. Do you guys think about required returns differently for a new partner in terms of what is the opportunity, and longer-term is that a part of the calculus? Thomas DeRosa : The more important part of the calculus is who is the partner, where is the assets, we tend not to get too worked up about 10 or 20 basis points on the yield, the real question to us is whether this is a partner that really meets our standards and Oakmont and Aspen did, they own the types of assets that we want to own, they continually grow their business, your acquisition in development and we think they will come to us to help and do that and that is really the important part of our calculus not whether the yield is 6.1 or 5.9 over time much more focused on partnering with the right providers and owning the right real estate. Joshua Raskin : Makes sense. Then I'll just sneak one last one in. The balance sheet flexibility that Scott Estes was talking about, has that changed? Or that preference for delevering after significant investments is that a function of what you think is coming in the future? I.e. do you think that the environment is right for larger acquisitions and you need to be more prepared today? Or is that just simplistically we want to maintain lowest cost of capital under any environment? Scott Estes : Hey Josh, really more of the latter, I think we feel great about where the balance sheet it today, I think the other way you could ask that question is do you think leverage goes back up from here and I think no, I don\u2019t think we need to push it down a lot more but I think there is a noticeable difference from where we were and it gives us the flexibility to access really both equity or debt market in the future when new volumes play out. Thomas DeRosa : Yes, it\u2019s all about passing on the lowest cost of capital to our operating partners. That\u2019s our covenant with them. So, we really pay close attention to our balance sheet and we want to make it as strong as possible, so it gives us the most flexibility. Joshua Raskin : Okay, thanks guys. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks Josh. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBank Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Good morning! Thomas DeRosa : Good morning! Jordan Sadler : I wanted to ask you a question about the sale of the life sciences portfolio back to Forest City. I\u2019m curious what the motivation behind that sale was be it the structure of the investment, or the small exposure there, and just interest level in life science longer-term? Thomas DeRosa : You know, this was an opportunistic acquisition for us. When we made it, it was a time when capital was quite constrained and Forest City approached us and it was an outstanding asset; we made the investment. Today, as I said, it was an opportunistic sale for us. We think it\u2019s a tremendous return. It\u2019s a great strategic asset for Forest City to own as a change their business platform a bit and I would caution anybody to not read into it as we\u2019re not interested in the life sciences sector. It\u2019s just that this asset was an opportunistic acquisition and an opportunistic sale. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Just as a follow-up there, so it sounds like you do have longer-term interest in the life science market. I'm just curious. When I looked at it and I'm reading some of your commentary in the release even vis-a-vis the Aspen deal it's just greater connectivity across the continuum of care. Thomas DeRosa : We view life sciences as being in an asset class that would be important to certain academic medical centers that we endeavor to do business with at some point in our history. So, as you establish a relationship with one of the major academic medical centers in the country, there may be life sciences assets that they may need for a partner to own, manage, finance. So, we keep ourselves open in that respect. We\u2019re not interested in broadly going out and building a portfolio in life sciences really outside of what we might do with an academic medical system. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Then separately to Scott on the balance sheet, I'm curious. What's the target ultimately in terms of cost of capital, credit rating? I know you guys are - I think you are BBB; S&P Baa2. Is there a stronger target ultimately there to continue to drive that cost down Thomas DeRosa : Sure. I think we\u2019re moving in the right direction and there are opportunities and it\u2019s important to us to make sure that agencies take time to come to Toledo and learn how we run the company and they\u2019ve been doing that, which is great. So, we\u2019re optimistic. We can hope moving in the right direction and I think maintaining the leveraged and credit metrics where they are right now combined with the quality of the portfolio and our ability to watch it and monitor it and have great people in place. I think, we have great potential to move up another notch or two. Jordan Sadler : Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Kim with BMO Capital Market. John Kim : Good morning, thank you. Thomas DeRosa : Hey John. Scott Estes : John. John Kim : A couple questions on dispositions. In the past six months you have completely exited CCRC and life-sciences and have also reduced your Medicaid-related exposure. Can you just update us on what your current view is on skilled nursing facilities? Scott Estes : I think we all might have a comment on this. I would say that our view on skilled nursing is, you know, we have really tried to exit the long-term care, low quality mix skilled nursing business. We think that the risks associated with that business may not reward one for the marginally higher cap rate that you could acquire assets in that space. So, given the way we run our business we just don\u2019t see that as being a critical component of what we do. And where we\u2019re focused is in the high-quality mix private pay Medicare post acute market, which we think is the future of rehabilitative care, residential rehabilitative care in the U.S. So that\u2019s we\u2019ve gotten rid of most of those assets over the last five years that were in our portfolio. Scott? Scott Brinker : The only thing I would add is that the modern post acute buildings are still generating about $400 million of investment volume a year for us, through the Mainstreet partnership, those are all acquisition of brand new buildings with providers that we want to do business with like Genesis and Ensign, so we like that business, the yields are good, and I think the fundamentals of the business are good. John Kim : But as far as exiting some of the older assets in skilled nursing, it sounds like it's going to be more piecemeal? Or would you take a bigger swing as far as the spinoff of this portfolio? Thomas DeRosa : We\u2019ve already done it. We\u2019ve accomplished that and there are some of those assets that makes sense for us that we have in our portfolio today. And it\u2019s not a big number. So there is no reason for us to be thinking of doing any kind of larger portfolios so. John Kim : Okay. You've also reduced the average age of your portfolio by about one year in just the last three months, which is not an easy feat given the size of your portfolio. Is there a particular range that you are comfortable managing this figure? Thomas DeRosa : No. I mean, younger is always better to less CapEx, we tend to have a one modern floor but a key question for us, is always who is the prior honor and how much money did they invest, so that\u2019s an important question that maybe age of the building doesn\u2019t always reflect and equally important is where is the building located. If you are in a high quality location in Toronto or London, it\u2019s okay to own an old building, it\u2019s almost a replaceable real estate as long as it\u2019s been maintained, that can be a very profitable building and we have a lot of those. But it\u2019s different if you are in newer world secondary market with a 30 year old building; those are the types that I think are really challenging to own. John Kim : Okay, that makes sense. Then finally you probably didn't have time to listen to it this morning, but Genesis HealthCare discussed a new initiative, entering China. Can you just remind us what your appetite is for Asia? And if some of your partners venture out there; does that make it more appealing to you to potentially work with them out there? Thomas DeRosa : We have so much on our plates in the U.S., Canada, and the UK that\u2019s hard for us to really be thinking about places as far away as Asia. So I would say Asia today just not fit prominently no our radar screen. But we pay attention to what\u2019s happening over there, I\u2019ve been over to Asia, and I can tell you that although even healthcare REITs in Japan. So there is a need for what we do there. But today is it where we\u2019re focused I\u2019d say now. John Kim : Got it. Thank you. Thomas DeRosa : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Thomas DeRosa : Good morning Tayo. George Hoglund : Yes hi, This is actually George on for Tayo. Just wanted to get your view on the recent CMS proposed changes for reimbursement in 2016 across the board. Was there anything that was vastly different from your expectations, and what you think the impact on operators will be? Thomas DeRosa : On balance, we think it\u2019s positive but because we are largely a private pay company it doesn\u2019t dramatically affect our business. George Hoglund : Then just on the acquisition environment in terms of what you are seeing out there from potential larger deals, or everyone talks about the potential Brookdale portfolios coming on or being available. What you seeing in terms of larger portfolios out there Scott Estes : Well, there is plenty of activity and we passed on at least $10 billion of acquisitions in the last couple of quarters. We were fortunate have the lowest cost of capital inter-sector which means that if you want the deal we can get it. But we passed on a lot of them. They continue to be available, there are lots of people looking and make there is investments. We\u2019re focused on our partners in a high quality asset they tend to be off market. So we look all the big strategic things and everyone once in a while, one makes and we have the ability to win those. George Hoglund : And once you pass on, has it been more in asset quality or a pricing issue? Scott Estes : Yes it\u2019s more, it\u2019s both. But it is primarily asset quality. I mean I guess at the right price you consider owning the lower quality assets but that is really not our model. George Hoglund : Okay, thanks guys. Thomas DeRosa : Sure, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you. Just on the RIDEA portfolio, for the guidance or the estimate in the second quarter, would you expect the US to trend similarly -- I think it was 5% or so in the first quarter -- and there to be maybe a downtick in the UK? Or is the mix going to be different? Thomas DeRosa : Yes the U.S. was strong in the first quarter despite a challenging winter in New England in the Mid-Atlantic, so it is 5% plus growth in the RIDEA portfolio nationwide U.S., UK was down almost 4% and that\u2019s because debt related move outs were up more than 125% and being it was highly unusual and that is starting to bounce back. Movement continues to be really strong in the UK and the move out activity fortunately have stabilized. So you will start to see that pick up again that the first quarter was unusually bad in the UK. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. Then any interesting differences that you may have seen between IL and AL in the RIDEA portfolio? I remember you give us a statistic a while ago on just the growth in markets where you are seeing construction. Do you have that statistic? Thomas DeRosa : I think there are two questions there, we haven\u2019t seen a material change between IL and AL and our portfolio is pretty equally balanced between the two. I think that was your first question and then the second one in terms of new supply in our markets, it hasn\u2019t really changed in the past two years, it has been pretty flat. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. And then just last one on the medical office side, I guess in prior conversations it seems like there is a nice mix between on campus and then off campus affiliated, just and it seems like kind of you sort of prefer the off campus affiliated maybe a bit more than some of your peers, I am just wondering kind of how do you see that model evolving is there a much more of a move towards off campus whereas and the off campus affiliated and therefore the economics in terms of pricing just maybe very similar today? Thomas DeRosa : We like both. What we don\u2019t like is off campus that is not affiliated with the health system, those are the MOBs that really don\u2019t pursue it all, they make up a very, very small percentage of our total portfolio but we are happy, on campus properties as long you get health system in the hospitals where you are gaining market share but you\u2019re right, a lot of the new construction today is off campus and that is because that is where the people live. People want convenience, they want low cost, that means building new properties in the suburbs where the wealthy people live, it is where there is job growth and people are moving. So when you look at the newer asset that we are either buying or developing they tend to be located off campus just because that is where healthcare is moving, that is where these hospitals are increasingly delivering care. Scott Estes : And Vik a lot of it goes to the whole hub and spoke strategy that many of the premier hospitals are trying to build now, so how do you drive population to the core acute care hospital there is often in urban location. So many of the major hospital systems in the country are focused on developing good quality outpatient medical outside of the core market in order to drive traffic, drive population into the beds in the core. And we want to be part of that. Vikram Malhotra : That is great. Thank you guys. Scott Estes : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Stifel. Daniel Bernstein : Good morning. I guess I have a question on -- we haven't heard in a long time you talking about maybe vertical integration between --collaboration between your operators. We've seen a lot of assisted-living companies buy skilled nursing, and skilled nursing buy assisted living, and even some vertical integration now in the post-acute and hospital sector, people moving up and down acuity. So one, what do you think about the opportunities for consolidation in healthcare in terms of vertical integration, how that might bring you some real estate? Then two, if you can go back over how your operators might be collaborating together to improve their operating performance. Thomas DeRosa : Maybe, I\u2019ll start with the last one. I think we\u2019re in early days of operators collaborating. we always point people to Voorhees New Jersey because it\u2019s an example. If you speak to Genesis, you speak to Virtua, you speak to Brandywine, they will all say that their performance is better because of their location, adjacent to each other, and the communication that they\u2019ve established. We think connectivity is the future of healthcare delivery and it\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re excited by the hospital acquisition we made in London. We have a big investment in London. We think it\u2019s among the very best markets in the world where you could have the concentration of real estate assets and we believe that creating connectivity between our elder care network and those acute-care hospitals is going to drive better performance. We\u2019ve seen it in - we\u2019ve seen it here in the US, but Dan, it is early days in this. Typically, hospitals saw themselves as the beginning and end of healthcare delivery, and we are encouraged by the dialogues we have with major hospital systems that they are moving away from that view. That they know they have to work with the post acute and senior housing operators in their catchment areas, but it\u2019s early days, and Scott you want to comment on any kind of merger activity you think or combinations in the space, even though we never comment on a M&A. Daniel Bernstein : I didn't want to comment on specific merger, but just the idea of vertical integration. Scott Estes : No, Dan, I think that\u2019s the right summary, the important point is that we\u2019ve partnered with the leading providers across the continuum and it makes a great deal of sense for them to work together because no one company is going to be able to do everything. That\u2019s just the reality of the way the health system is evolving, is it\u2019s going to be critical to form partnerships among providers to deliver great care. That is why healthcare is going and that\u2019s how we\u2019re shaping our investment strategy. Thomas DeRosa : Yes, we\u2019re not aware of anybody thinking about a move towards vertical integration that they should be. I think it\u2019s really the opposite of that, Dan. Daniel Bernstein : Okay. Then in terms of - going back to that hospital acquisition the Aspen in the UK, were you interested in that property before Tenet was going to acquire that? Or knowing that Tenet was going to be one of the Tenets or new - I don't know if they're already in the portfolio, but a bigger relationship for you, was that part of the attractiveness of your portfolio? And do you think there's any additional opportunities with Tenet, whether it's domestic or foreign, to partner up with them? Thomas DeRosa : Dan, John Goody, who runs our London office, has had a long relationship with the Aspen hospital group in London. So, he\u2019s been speaking - he\u2019s had a relationship with Mark Hopser who ran that for many, many years. So, this has been on our radar screen for a long time. We have - HCN has a close relationship with Welsh Carson, so this is something we have been circling long before we ever knew Tenet was going to be involved here and we think that\u2019s a positive. We already have - what is it Scott, about a billion dollars of\u2026 Scott Estes : It\u2019s the sponsoring health system on 19 of our medical office properties in the U.S. Its a million square feet. Thomas DeRosa : A million square feet, not a billion dollars. A million square feet with Tenet and today, and we\u2019d like to think that this is going to draw us closer together with Tenet and we see Tenet as a growing acute care hospital company and, , I would hope that there are lots of things we can do together in the future. Daniel Bernstein : Okay. Then I really haven't heard anybody ask you about cap rates, where that's heading for the different asset classes. My impression has been that cap rates have been decreasing through the year so far. Is that the same impression you are getting when you are bidding for assets and buying assets at this point? Thomas DeRosa : Yes. That\u2019s been the trend in the last six months, Dan, for sure. Maybe that slows down, now that the treasury is up a bit, and some other healthcare REIT stock prices have come down a bit. But what my counter balance that is that the big institutions that have a historically look at our space are starting to look pretty closely and I\u2019m talking about foreign pension funds in insurance companies in particular that have a lot of money and are scared away by low yields, healthcare real estate still looked really attractive by comparison, and those are the world\u2019s biggest investors, not to our lot of the wealth resides if they start coming into our business in a major way. You are going to see property values escalate. Daniel Bernstein : That's great color. I appreciate it. I will get back in the queue. Thanks. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Thanks. Just back to the Aspen deal, how much of the 6.3% initial lease yield that you are getting on the deal already reflects that Tenet is going likely going to be the new operator in a few months? Just trying to see how much yield compression could be expected the minute Tenet takes over. Thomas DeRosa : Not sure I understand the question, Todd, could you restate it? Todd Stender : Sure. You are locking in a 6.3% initial lease yield I think on the Aspen Hospital deal. Thomas DeRosa : Yes. Todd Stender : Does that already reflect that Tenet is going to be the new operator in a few months? I mean, would it have been a 7% yield if it was just Aspen with no projected acquisition Thomas DeRosa : I got to tell you that, the cap rate with - Aspen is a great operator and Tenets is a great operator and this is extraordinary real estate. So the cap rate was set independent of Tenet. When we negotiated this transaction Tenet was not in the picture, it happened later and had it come to market today with Tenet being operator perhaps people might have put a premium on it. But understand these have been extremely well run and there\u2019s been lots of investment on Aspin, Welsh Carson has invested lots of money in these assets. When you go see them Todd, you will be impressed. You would be very happy, to spend to either have a day surgery at one of these hospitals or spend a night if you had to in one of these hospitals, they are really extraordinary assets at extraordinary locations. The cap rate reflects that. Todd Stender : Okay, and thank you, Tom. It was to see if once Tenet takes over, should we expect this to be in your balance sheet - or call it a market cap rate of a 6%? I mean is there value creation here the minute Tenet takes over? Thomas DeRosa : I\u2019d say that we haven\u2019t really thought about it like that we think that we think we paid a good price for these assets. And I think they will become more valuable as we connect them to our other healthcare assets in London. I think that will make that more valuable certainly. Todd Stender : Okay, that's helpful. Then Scott Estes, just to focus on your comments from the improving balance sheet metrics, is there any mortgage debt that is going to come off the balance sheet because of the $1 billion in dispositions? And was any -- did the Fitch upgrade, the BBB+ factor in the $1 billion of acquisitions? Scott Estes : First question is, secured debt is part of the payoffs, what is it guys, $174 million in secured debt that will come off as a part of the far city disposition. Thomas DeRosa : Yes. Scott Estes : And second, what\u2019s the second again, Todd. Todd Stender : Did the Fitch upgrade factor in this level of dispositions? Scott Estes : As Tom said, that was really a opportunistic decision in terms of to vacate the Forest City and we\u2019re always looking at the balance sheet from a bigger picture perspective. We like to keep secured debt low on the 10% range and when we acquire assets and have some debt on it we like to have that availability and the try to pay it off and its we are able to. Todd Stender : Great. Thank you. Scott Estes : Sure. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Juan Sanabria : Thanks for the time. Just wondering if you could speak to any opportunities you guys may see to partner with sovereign, pension, or insurance companies, noting that they are significantly more interested in the space than they have been historically, and what kind of fees you may be able to generate, and maybe what kind of assets they are most interested in Thomas DeRosa : Juan we have greatly expanded dialogs and established some relationships with some of the sovereign wealth larger pension funds in the usual suspects you would expect us to and we made great headway there, many of them have visited us here in Toledo and they have done significant due diligence about investing with HealthCare REIT and I think they\u2019ve all been very happy, they\u2019ve seen as you can imagine they would be most interested in the types of assets that we\u2019re interested in which are often in major metropolitan markets and I would say that outpatient medical is the most easy asset class for them to get their hands around. So if work, if you were to see any kind of joint venture investments with those types of names it would likely be in the outpatient medical space. Juan Sanabria : Okay. What kind of fees do you think you could generate? What value do you provide them, for them to.. Thomas DeRosa : Juan that remains to be seen, I think that where we would be helpful to them because as you know they\u2019re not invested in the space. So they would be leveraging our expertise whereas they don\u2019t need if they are investing in simple business district office with a REIT, they would perhaps need less of their expertise because they\u2019ve been invested in that asset class for many for decades. So we expect that there is some level of fees that we would be able to capture and but mostly associated with if we were in the outpatient medical space with the fact that we have a medical office management company. So that is an area that is a value component that we bring to the mix when we enter into such a joint venture. Juan Sanabria : Great; thanks. Then just one more for me on the hospital side. Obviously you guys seem to be very focused on the gateway global cities. But do you have any interest in dominant hospitals in other top CBD or maybe even secondary markets outside of UK, London, New York Thomas DeRosa : Historically, Juan those hospitals that we would be interested in have very low cost access to capital, what we\u2019re hoping with some of those systems is that at some point they may look to partner with us and there are other real estate assets not necessarily their hospitals but perhaps their outpatient assets which most of them continue to own and manage internally. So I would say that is where we are more focused on, if we could own some of those hospitals that certainly something we might be interested in. But again any interest we have in acute care would be in line of what we\u2019re in be in line with what we\u2019re articulating which is we want to be in the major markets in the U.S., Canada and the UK. We\u2019re not really interested in secondary cities in tertiary markets particularly to own acute care in those types of markets. Juan Sanabria : Thanks. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Richard Anderson : Thanks and good morning. When a new movie comes out and Angelina Jolie is asked to talk about it, it has usually happened like two or three years ago, and so she has to remember everything about the movie. Is that -- sorry for the weird analogy, but is that how it works with you? Like how long does it typically take to start a conversation to something actually getting closed? And is that time frame extending lately? Thomas DeRosa : Are you asking with relation to Aspen Hospitals? Richard Anderson : Aspen is the one that comes to mind but generally. Thomas DeRosa : I would say that discussions with Aspen Hospitals started to move along probably seven months ago. Yet you got to understand Rich, John has had a continuing dialogue with Aspen - with the London team for Aspen for a lot of years. So, you know, this was not something that happened overnight. This is not something that came through a broker. This was something that came out of a relationship. You also have to know that Scott Estes has a very close relationship with Welsh Carson. So, you know, the reasons why this - you know, why we wind up owning this. This is something that everyone in healthcare real estate would have loved to have owned these assets, but we own them. Richard Anderson : Okay, as a general statement though, would you say it\u2019s taking longer to - when you start circling something for and ultimately to get it done or is this just, you know, that not so? Thomas DeRosa : I\u2019d say no. I\u2019d say no. I\u2019d say that remember that so many of our operators - again, you have to come back to - so much of our new investment growth is coming from our existing operators and eight is a matter of when it makes sense for them, essentially to transfer that ownership to us. Scott Estes : Rich, that\u2019s right. When I look at, say the Riviera portfolio that we bought, it\u2019s a $650 million joint-venture, and we own 75% and we\u2019ve been talking to them since early 2012 and we knew the assets were coming. The benchmark investment in New England, $360 million, a similar timeline; four years of discussion. So, it\u2019s this - there are a lot of other properties out there that we know will come at some point and as Tom mention it\u2019s a matter of the right timing. You know, we\u2019re happy to be patient. Thomas DeRosa : Rich, if Angelina Jolie or anyone of her children got sick when she was making a movie in London, I can assure you she\u2019d be very happy to bring them to Parkside Hospital. Richard Anderson : Well, you\u2019ve got me all pumped up. I\u2019m going to London and break my arm and have surgery. So, on the topic of vantage which I enjoyed the presentation when I was able to see it firsthand, you know, Archstone Smith at multifamily REIT from a long time ago developed revenue management LRO with a partner and then they ended up selling it to their competition on the view that rising tides lift all boats. Have you given any thought to that or are you going to keep that to yourself? Scott Estes : Yes, Rich, I would say that senior housing is still in the early days of its evolution and professionalization at that level. They are excellent at providing care, which is why the businesses of successful and there is great demand for the product, but in terms of sophistication in things like revenue management, it\u2019s still very, very early. We think these great opportunity. Its one thing that makes the business so exciting is that it\u2019s doing well even though we think there\u2019s a lot of room for improvement. Richard Anderson : Okay, and then lastly, how expensive is eight and time-consuming to change the company\u2019s name? I know we\u2019ve talked about it in the past, but, you know, you\u2019re so much more than healthcare REIT in the minds of, I think, of most people and have you given that any thought? Thomas DeRosa : We have, Rich; and it\u2019s actually built into our G&A for this year and we are - you know, stay tuned on that. Richard Anderson : All right, great. It sounds good. Thomas DeRosa : But I\u2019m going to tell you one thing Rich, it\u2019s not going to be called Health Connections Network. Richard Anderson : It\u2019s okay. That\u2019s your loss. Thank you. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks Rich. Operator : Thank you and that will conclude today\u2019s Health Care REIT First Quarter 2015 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect. Thomas DeRosa : Thank you.",

My name is Holly, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for HCN\u2019s second quarter 2015 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at hcreit.com. We are holding a live webcast of today\u2019s call, which may be accessed through the company\u2019s website. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although, HCN believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Tom DeRosa, CEO of Health Care REIT. Tom? Tom DeRosa : Thank you, Jeff, and good morning. One of the things I guess me and the team here excited to come to work every day is that HCN is part of a solution to a big problem. Today, healthcare delivery is faced with a mandate to drive down costs and deliver better outcomes. Sounds like a great idea, right? As they say, easier said than done, this mandate cannot be met unless we can drive patients from acute care hospitals into lower acuity settings. You may have seen Mount Sinai hospital\u2019s ad in last week\u2019s New York Times that stated, if our beds are filled, it means we fail. What does that mean? It means that one of the top hospital systems in the world recognizes that their old business model is not sustainable. If they, like many hospitals, continue to low acuity uninsured and cognitively impaired elderly patients, their historic business models simply won\u2019t work. Better real-estate solutions are needed.  In many of the metro markets of the U.S., the UK and Canada where our company is concentrated, we simply do not have adequate post-acute and outpatient care for the broader population and senior care communities to keep our ageing population well and avoid unnecessary hospital stays. HCN has established itself as the preeminent capital partner to drive the most effective healthcare real-estate solutions and I\u2019m proud to announce to you this morning, that one of the largest and certainly most respected real-estate investors in the world has chosen HCN as its partner to establish its initial investment position in healthcare real-estate. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board commonly known as CPP, has entered into a joint venture partnership with HCN to acquire a superb portfolio, a medical office building largely located in the famous Golden Triangle of Beverly Hills, California, one of the most priced locations in the world to hold any category of real-estate.  While nearly all of our new investment volume this outstanding opportunity was sourced not from a broker-led auction, but from an existing relationship that was looking for liquidity and saw the benefits of taking HCN shares. CPP\u2019s decision to co-invest in this portfolio underscores the high institutional investment grade quality of the real-estate and further validates the unique investment proposition that HCN offers to our shareholders. We are excited to welcome CPP to the HCN family. Scott Brinker and Scott Estes will take you through more of the details of our Q2 asset and financial performance, but I\u2019m pleased to say that our results have exceeded your expectations. Given the hangover of issues posed by weather and flu from Q1, 5.2% same-store NOI growth from our U.S. senior housing portfolio at 3.2% same-store cash NOI growth from the entire portfolio was noteworthy. I am also pleased to report FFO per share of $1.09 for the quarter versus $1.06 for the same quarter last year. Keep in mind that we have pre-funded our capital needs for the nearly 3 billion in new investments made in the first half of this year as well as continuing to drive down leverage. These efforts awarded us positive outlooks by Moody\u2019s and S&P this past quarter. Hence, while providing you with outstanding growth and new investment opportunities, we have not taken you out on the risk spectrum and will not compromise capital structure, asset quality, market or asset class in order to chase yield or manufacture short-term earnings growth. This is a core value of HCN and a clear differentiator. We stick to our partnership model and work hard to maintain the value proposition that the top senior care and post-acute operators and health systems derive from HCN. It\u2019s what you are shareholders and partners can count on.  Now, Scott Brinker will provide you with a closer look at our operating performance and new investments made during the quarter. Scott?  Scott Brinker \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer  Thank you, Tom. I\u2019m pleased to report accelerating internal growth with same store earnings up 3.2%. The operating portfolio in the U.S. led the way with outstanding 5.2% same-store growth in the second consecutive quarter. Our footprint is pain off. For years, we target large metros that have superior growth and population, jobs and housing values. Today we have 8% market share in the top 10 MSAs, that compares to less than 4% share in all other markets, clear evidence of our concentration in large markets. The big metros are more transparent, more liquid and deliver better results. Our same-store growth in large markets continues to be substantially higher than our smaller markets. Modern physical plans and premium operating partners further differentiates us. Shifting to the operating portfolio in the UK, until this year it\u2019s been a tremendous growth -- with double-digit same store growth. The severe flu season this year caused the big spike in move outs and a decline in earnings. Census is moving back up and we expect strong results in the UK to resume within a few quarters. Same store earnings in the overall operating portfolio with 3.3%. Rental rates were up 3.2% and occupancy increased 10 basis points. Move-ins continues to be strong and move-outs have normalized, setting a stage for census to move higher. To that point, occupancy is up 60 basis points since our earlier May earnings call. Triple net senior living continued its excellent performance. Same-store earnings were up 3.4%. The superior growth was driven by active asset management. In particular, the Merrill Gardens properties that we converted to a lease with large escalators and the CCRCs that we converted from entry fee to rental.  Moving to development, we\u2019ve opened 22 properties in the past two years. They are 700 basis points ahead of underwriting on occupancy and 7 million ahead on NOI. Meanwhile, new supply in our local markets measured as a percentage of existing inventory is less than half the number provided by NSG[ph]. We\u2019re also seeing and hearing about 10 plus percent increases in development costs since beginning of the year. This should help put a governor on new supply.  Turning to post-acute long term care, our rental income is growing consistently. Same store earnings were up 3.1%, payment coverage was flat and remains at secure levels. Next up is outpatient medical where again the takeaway is steady, predictable growth. Same store earnings increased 2.6%. We\u2019re seeing minimal new supply and growing demand for outpatient services. Digging deeper, our asset benchmarks favorably on key indicators like occupancy, age, hospital affiliation, lease roll over and NOI per flip[ph]. These assets are poised to deliver steady earnings growth for years to come.  Turning to transactions, we continue to pass on or be outbid on nearly every auction. The vast majority of our 600 plus million of investments was privately negotiated by follow-on activity within our existing partners. That list included Brandywine, Avery, Senior Star, Legend, Cascade, Mainstreet and Genesis, the blended initial yield is 6.7%, which is a healthy spread to our cost of our capital. And we funded much of it through the sale of our Life Science portfolio at a 5% yield on sale. Our stable of operating partners is a massive competitive advantage and that gap is growing.  The leading operators want to be part of our team. In the first quarter, we added Aspen and Oakmont and in the second quarter, we added EPAC[ph], who develops and operates Class A senior living properties in New England. We added three other new development projects, all located in high barrier-to-entry markets in Boston, one of our core markets. We also agree to acquire a publicly traded senior living company called Regal. The properties are heavily concentrated in our core Canadian markets, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver. Revera, an existing JV partner will co-invest 25%. HCN will receive a 6.1% unlevered preferred return that grows by 4% each year until year six. This is another signature HCN investment, existing partner, strong alignment, major metro locations and an accretive return. The headline investment last quarter was an outpatient medical portfolio that we acquired from an existing relationship. The assets are concentrated in the Golden Triangle in Beverly Hills, one of the world\u2019s most coveted real-estate markets. Beverly Hills has a moratorium on medical space, which creates a major supplies range. Rental rates in these buildings have increased by 6% per year over the past decade. As the owner of half the medical space in the city, we stand the benefit for years to come. We should [indiscernible] these units to the seller at $78 per share for much of the consideration, that\u2019s a double digit premium to our current share price. The key strategic element here is that we established a partnership with CPP. They join PSP on our team of pension fund partners. Their capital in-flows are large and steady through all market cycles. When the capital markets are choppy, these partnerships will be a huge differentiator. Our CFO Scott Estes will now discuss the financial results. Scott Estes : Thanks, Scott and good morning everyone. You just heard Tom and Scott talk about our recent investment success, in an environment where there is greater uncertainty about our cost of capital due to recent pressures on our stock price and the future direction of interest rates. So from a financial perspective, how do we think about balancing your desire for us to be more prudent in the current environment, with the hope that we continue to invest accretively to grow our portfolio and future earnings? And the answer is, that you should expect us to do the following; to emphasize investing with our existing partners and off market transactions, to maintain the strength of our balance sheet and to maximize our financial flexibility by accrete funding investments and leveraging additional sources of capital such as JV partnerships and dispositions when appropriate. We successfully adhere to these principles so I\u2019d like to lead you with three specific takeaways this quarter. First, we preemptively raised the capital needed to fund the investments completed year-to-date. Second, we\u2019ve done so while further strengthening our balance sheet and credit metrics, resulting a nice momentum with the rating agencies and third, we moderated our pace of investments and retained significant liquidity which will allow us to selectively capitalize on acquisition opportunities moving into the second half of the year. I\u2019ll begin with my detailed remarks with some perspective on our second quarter financial performance and enhancements to our disclosure.  Normalized FFO came in at $1.09 and normalized FAD with $0.95 for the second quarter, representing sequential increases of $0.05 and $0.03 respectively. These are solid sequential improvements in the light of raising 3.1 billion of capital year-to-date through a combination of equity, debt and disposition proceeds, which were used to fund the 2.9 billion in growth investments completed during the first half of the year. I think our most important financial message this quarter ties directly to something Tom talked about in his earlier remarks that is, we will not sacrifice the balance sheet in an effort to drive short term earnings growth. More specifically, our net debt to book capitalization has now declined nearly 5 full percentage points over the last five quarters to the current 38%.  In terms of dividends, we will pay our 177th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on August 20th of $0.825 per share, an annual rate of $3.30. This represents a 3.8% increases over the dividends paid last year and a current dividend yield of 4.7%. In terms of our supplemental package, we made a few noticeable enhancements this quarter in response to investor and analyst feedback. First, on page 13, we\u2019ve added back disclosure in our unstable portfolio around the time of projected future development fundings and growth investment balances. On page 14, you can see that we have provided our pro rata share of beds, units and square footage data to allow you to more accurately calculate those numbers on an NOI basis. And last on page of 22 and 24, we have added our Canadian portfolio performance to both the [indiscernible] and NOI reconciliations.  Turning to our liquidity picture and balance sheet, the significant highlight of our second quarter capital markets activity was the largest, single tranche U.S. debt offering in the company\u2019s history. In late May, we completed the sale of 750 million of 10 year senior unsecured notes, priced to yield just over 4%. In addition, we issued 1 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program, generating 70 million in proceeds. We generated 596 million of proceeds due to sale of our Life Science portfolio interest and loan pay-offs, which included 190 million of gains and represented a blended yield of our total proceeds of 5.3%. We completed several debt pay-offs during the quarter, the most significant of which was the discharge of our 300 million of 6.2% senior unsecured notes which was scheduled to mature in June of 2016. And finally, we repaid approximately 99 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.5% and soon to refinance 166 million of secured debt at a blended 2.4% rate. As a result of these activities, there were two important outcomes for HCN; first, the blended costs of debt on our senior notes declined a 4.3%, while our average senior note maturity was extended to 9.3 years. And even more importantly, we ended the quarter with over 2.6 billion of liquidity, including 2.15 billion available on our line of credits, an additional 218 million in cash and an anticipated cash proceed of approximately 216 million from dispositions forecast throughout the remainder of the year.  Our balance sheet and financial metrics at quarter end remain in great shape. As of June 30th, our net debt to underappreciated book capitalization with 38.1% which as I mentioned previously has declined 5% over the last five quarters alone. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined slightly to 5.46 times, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter improved nicely to 4.15 times and 2.37 times respectively. Our secured debt levels declined 10 basis points to only 11.2% of total assets to quarter end.  It\u2019s important to us that the continuously improving strength of our balance sheet was recognized by the rating agencies during the quarter as well, as both Moody\u2019s and S&P recently improved our ratings outlook positive from stable. I\u2019ll conclude my comments today with a brief update on guidance and our key assumptions. In terms of same-store cash NOI growth, we continue to forecast blended same store growth of 3% to 3.5% for the total portfolio in 2015. Our forecasts are generally changed for the respective portfolio components but as Scott mentioned, we are forecasting more moderate pace of growth at our senior housing operating portfolio until the performance accelerates in the UK.  In terms of our investment expectations, in addition to investments completed through the second quarter, our guidance include the Regal lifestyle communities and Genesis investments detailed in our earnings release expected to close late in the year, plus approximately 160 million of investments to our Mainstreet partnership and 170 million of development funding. Our 2015 guidance also includes 63 million of development conversions at a blended projected yield of 9% and we continue to expect to receive disposition proceeds of approximately 1 billion for the full year and an expected yield of total proceeds of approximately 7%.  Our capital expenditure forecast is now approximately 50 million for 2015, comprised of 30 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio with the remaining 20 million coming from our medical facility portfolio. These amounts continue to represent only 6% to 7% of NOI in both asset categories. Our G&A forecast is now approximately 147 million for 2015, which is generally in line with our previous estimates. And finally in terms of earnings guidance, we are in a position to maintain our 2015 estimates today despite raising 750 million of new capital in the quarter and accelerating the disposition of our Life Science portfolio and trends considerably earlier than previously planned.  So as a result, we continue to forecast normalized FFO in a range of $4.25 to $4.35 per diluted share, representing 3% to 5% growth. Our normalized FAD 2015 expectation remains in the range of $3.83 to $3.93 per diluted share, representing a solid increase of 5% to 7%. In conclusion, we are pleased to preemptively funded the investments completed year-to-date, to have significantly strengthened our balance sheet and maximize our financial flexibility by retaining a significant liquidity position entering the second half of the year. So that concludes my remarks. I think operator at this point, we\u2019d like to open the call up for questions please. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from the line of Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Paul Morgan : Hi. Good morning. Tom DeRosa : Good morning. Paul Morgan : Just in terms of the famous guidance \u2013 you held the guidance \u2013 and if I read right, it sounded like the UK operating portfolio isn\u2019t set to accelerate, starts playing at the second half of the year, if I read your comments correctly. So where are you seeing offsetting upside in the portfolio that\u2019s kind of keeping you in the range? Scott Brinker : I\u2019m Scott Brinker, I\u2019ll start. The U.S. continues to be really strong, so five plus percent growth in the first two quarters and that\u2019s roughly three quarters of the operating portfolios so that\u2019s by far the most significant driver. And I would say that UK actually is improving, census is definitely moving back up, it\u2019s just that we need to climb out of a pretty big hole, because of the flu from the first quarter that extended into April.  So, we\u2019re going into the right direction each quarter moving forward is going to improve. It already is, it\u2019s just will take a while with that growth rate to turn positive, but I would say 2016 is the latest based on current trends. I\u2019ll say for our U.S. same store growth is quite encouraging and I think again speaks to some of the concerns about supply coming into the markets, we maintain that in the markets where our portfolio is concentrated there is not a supply issue. And I think that now five plus percent same store sales growth in the U.S. portfolio which obviously is the overwhelming majority of our asset portfolio I think should help to direct some of those concerns. Tom DeRosa : The same is true in UK, two thirds of our operating income comes from the greater market, which I think is the most favorable supply demand market of any in our entire portfolio. We own very modern assets so there is no question that he will be happy we own these assets over time, they just had a really bad flu season. Paul Morgan : Okay, great. My follow up just on Regal may be, could you offer any color in terms of how you see the growth upside in that relative to the rest of your Canadian asset? Scott Brinker : It\u2019s Scott Brinker, I\u2019ll take that. First, we\u2019re doing within our existing partner in Revera, it\u2019s the second biggest senior living provider in Canada, so there should be some economies of scale. On the expense side, Regal is a relatively small company with plus or minus 25 homes. So we are expecting some upside there. And the way we structured the deal is that, while we will maintain our pro rata shares of all the upside, we will have a fixed 4% increase in NOI through this preferred return for the first five years and that starts at a 6.1% yield.  So it\u2019s a very attractive initial yield plus growth at a minimum and then we do capture the upside as well. I also think that Regal portfolio is in the top markets in Canada. Again, you have to -- we are creating critical mass in the major metro areas in the Canadian market, I think that\u2019s something that we feel very good about for the long term growth prospects for this portfolio, based on those markets. Paul Morgan : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Tom DeRosa : Hi, Rich. Richard Anderson : Good morning. So, on the MOB deal with CPC, how would you characterize those assets being in Beverly Hills, are they kind of like cosmetic type surgery, just thinking of the demographic there in Beverly Hills? Tom DeRosa : Well, good question, Rich. As you might imagine, lots of plastic surgeons and dermatologists to the stars. Richard Anderson : Okay. And to the CEOs of the companies? Tom DeRosa : Well, we can all use a little refreshment sometimes. Richard Anderson : But the bigger question is, do you think that having the CPP is not to speak for them this may be their first investment in healthcare, do you think this is kind of a first solvo for them in terms of medical office? Do you see them being a partner and having this relationship grow specifically in medical office or outside of medical office and other healthcare areas? Tom DeRosa : Rich, the way I\u2019d answer that question is, I would say they -- we first met them over a year ago. It was I believe July of last year, early July, and I would say they have spent may be more time underwriting HCN than they actually spent underwriting this investment opportunity. This is not a one time find a joint venture partner to finance a deal. This is all about HCN being CPP\u2019s partner to enter a new class of real-estate investment for which they prior to last year when we first met them said they never really could get their hands around. So a lot of diligence went into this process, both with respect to HCN as well as the assets. I can tell you, this is an asset portfolio that anyone would invest in. It is -- the locations are outstanding, and we actually see some upside even in the some of the retail -- first floor retail that\u2019s associated with these assets can over time be upgraded and be more in character with the luxury retailers that are one block away or on the corner. So, it\u2019s -- this is very significant. This announcement is very significant because I think it also says that the most sophisticated real-estate investor in the world is now looking to healthcare real-estate. I think it validates what we do. Richard Anderson : Yeah. But do you see more in the way of transaction activity in medical office specifically vis-\u00e0-vis this relationship or just generally \u2013 is this a signal that we should be expecting more to come? Tom DeRosa : I think \u2013 so one of the things that we\u2019ve talked about Rich is that I think \u2013 I made in my comments -- I think the outpatient medical infrastructure in the major metro areas in this country is inadequate to meet the needs of driving patient population out of the hospital. So, when you think about the scale of capital that will be needed to address that issue, having a partner like CPP is very important for us. And I will also tell you that, they would consider other investments other than medical office in healthcare. I think -- this we\u2019ll see play out over time but, their decision was more of a broad decision to enter this space with us. Richard Anderson : Okay. And then last question, may be just a comment on the Canadian economy, I know we\u2019re talking about the UK performance, but just in terms of natural resources down and may be oversupply of housing in some areas. I just wondered what your read is on the Canadian economy being that you\u2019ve positioned yourself pretty substantially up there in the senior housing space. Scott Brinker : This is Scott Brinker speaking. We don\u2019t have a ton in those areas like sort of the middle part of the country that are heavily depended on natural resources. So, Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver those cities are not as impacted by natural resources. That being said, the Canadian economy is very much tied with what happens in the U.S. and I would say it\u2019s more stable than the U.S. just given how they finance things, and the way their banks work. But as a general comment, we like the Canadian market because we own very, very low acuity and mostly senior apartments in Canada. This is a very independent living portfolio, it\u2019s a nice compliment to what we do elsewhere and it\u2019s very stable. So long life \u2013 stay, very high occupancies, very high margins but it\u2019s not going to grow 5% 6% year, it\u2019s more in the 3% to 4%, very steady, stable. And we use significant opportunity over time to then add services, particularly assisted by memory care, because just think about the fact that they are really two businesses or two sectors in Canada, there is independent living where we have a major -- and there is long term care that\u2019s funded by the government and there is this huge area in between that\u2019s unmet today, the same thing that existed in the U.S. 20 years ago. Now over time, that\u2019s going to change and we think with [indiscernible] and Revera, by far the biggest players in that market will be well positioned to capitalize. Richard Anderson : Great. Scott Estes : Reminder Rich, just from a financial perspective, we very much hedge the currency rates, obviously the Canadian dollar spin is late against the US dollar but it\u2019s a reminder really for everybody, 90% of our balance sheet risks is hedged in that 75% of our earnings is hedged. So we are not really in the business of taking any currency risks. Richard Anderson : Got you. Thanks, Scott. Thank you. Scott Brinker : Thanks, Rich. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Tom DeRosa : Hey, John. John Kim : Good morning, Tom. Had a follow up question on the CPPIP joint venture, can you discuss what the fees paid to you by them are, either for asset management leasing or transaction related fees? Tom DeRosa : We\u2019ve agreed not to disclose fees with our partner. I would say that we\u2019re taking advantage of our platform and it improves the return profile for us, but it is still a very attractive way for CPP to enter the space, because it takes a lot of expertise to do what we do. John Kim : But they will be paying some kind of fees to you? Tom DeRosa : They will. Yes. John Kim : Okay. And as far as sourcing new MOB acquisitions, do they have any right of first offers? Tom DeRosa : They do in Southern California. So it\u2019s limited by time or investment amount, but I would say separate from what\u2019s in the legal contracts we have every intention to substantially grow our partnership with CPP. Scott Estes : But at the same time, John, we\u2019ll be also looking to grow with PSP as well. So there are two major joint venture partners now and they both \u2013 the institutions have a good relationship and we\u2019ll be looking for ways to grow with both of them. Tom DeRosa : Yeah, PSP is a good precedent, it took us a year of working with them before they chose us as their partner on the Revera portfolio which is a company that they wholly own. That was three years ago, and in the interim three years we\u2019ve now closed on three separate projects with them. We brought them into the Sunrise Management company, we brought them into the [indiscernible] portfolio in the UK and they\u2019ve brought us into the SRG portfolio on the West Coast. So I think it\u2019s evidenced that even when it comes to capital partners, we never just do one portfolio, it\u2019s always establishing a partner and then doing things together. John Kim : Okay. Then moving on to development, I appreciate your additional disclosure on page 13, but I have to ask you question. Why are the [indiscernible] developments projecting a much higher yielder and the triple net lease senior housing? Just wanted to make sure this is apples-to-apples deals comparisons. Tom DeRosa : The difference is that when we do a triple net senior housing, there is some residual cash flow that benefits the operator. And the triple net lease, the tenant pays a lease or rent amount and keeps all the upside, okay? So if you look at the Revera properties, the unlevered return on cost is around 10%, plus or minus and our return on cost for the triple net assets are more like 8%. And the difference is the payment properties which means that we are underwriting triple net leases for 1.25 or 1.3 plus or minus payment coverage, that\u2019s the difference. John Kim : And then outside the Revera[ph], are these a 100% pre-leased development? Tom DeRosa : The triple net leases are pre-leased from our standpoint, but from the tenant standpoint they have to lease the properties. But on day one of triple net leases, we receive the full contractual lease payment. John Kim : Okay. And the MOB as well? Tom DeRosa : Yeah, MOB we generally don\u2019t break around and that\u2019s really 75% pre-leased and you can see in the supplement the average pre-leasing for the current price under construction is currently at 91% pre-leased. John Kim : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street. Kevin Tyler : Hi, guys. Good morning, it\u2019s Kevin Tyler here with Michael. Tom DeRosa : Hey, Kevin. Kevin Tyler : I wanted to ask you, it was asked earlier, and I didn\u2019t hear it or I may have missed it, but did you provide the exact annual figure for senior housing operating same store NOI growth you\u2019re targeting? Scott Estes : No, we didn\u2019t provide guidance for the operating portfolio for the second half of the year, Kevin, we just provided sort of reaffirmed the expectations for the whole portfolio into 3% to 3.5% range. Kevin Tyler : Okay. And then I guess going back to MOB deal, given the large size of the premier location, we might have expected an even lower cap rate. I think you said it was somewhere in the high fives, but was that exceptionally high cap rate a result potentially \u2013 was there a floor on the cap rate as a result of the high price per foot? Scott Estes : No, it\u2019s more of a benefit of fees that help the return from our standpoint, Kevin. Kevin Tyler : Okay. And then I guess, -- Tom DeRosa : I guess Kevin, you have to remember this was on a marketed deal. This was a relationship we have, this is \u2013 we knew these assets before they were considered for sale. And the sellers saw great value in taking HCN shares.  Q - Michael Knott Hey guys, this is Michael. Was this above replacement costs and was that also part of the reason the cap rate was not lower? Scott Brinker : I don\u2019t know it\u2019s hard to say \u2013 I don\u2019t anything \u2013 decades from a medical office standpoint. Remember you can\u2019t though in Beverly Hills, you can\u2019t even repurpose existing assets. So replacement costs is really irrelevant at this case. But we\u2019re around I think $1,000 a foot, I doubt Tom DeRosa : I mean this is one of the top five locations probably in the world to own real-estate and any kind of real-estate can sit on the dirt that these medical office buildings are positioned and I think that Scott\u2019s point it\u2019s really hard to say what replacement cost would be \u2013sufficed to say it\u2019s a five star prime location.  Q - Michael Knott Thanks for the color. The last one I had just on the Avery acquisition in the UK, I saw that you did add some capital there on the real-estate side. But I recall seeing an article that talked about potentially upping a stake that you guys have in the operator itself. Is there any validity of that? Scott Brinker : Yeah, occasionally we say an equity stake in [indiscernible] Partners, Avery is one that we had targeted on day one of entering the UK three years ago, was a premier provider and they have lived up for that expectation. We did a big sell with them to start the relationship and then we have done a number of follow-ons both acquisition and development. And we thought they sensed actually take a stake in the operating company in itself. A small stake I think 8% 9%, it costs a few million pounds but it aligns us with a really important partner in the UK. Michael Knott : Okay, thanks. Hey guys this is Michael, I just have one more, obviously your senior housing operating portfolio is very high quality, but I\u2019m just still trying to understand how the increasingly discouraging net data and also Brookdale\u2019s struggles here, don\u2019t have any effect on your portfolio and your validity to operate and garner the types of growth that you\u2019re talking about. Tom DeRosa : I\u2019ll start that off and I think we\u2019ll all probably have a comment to add. Mike, I think that we are in the right markets where there is not oversupply. There are oversupply in many markets in the United States and those are places we do not choose to own real-estate. So, I think that\u2019s not the one where I think we differ from the data. So, Scott? Scott Estes : Also as the business continues to evolve and mature you\u2019re starting to see differentiation. So, 10 years ago from the standpoint of the outside world, everybody owned the same assets. And the asset in the middle Oklahoma that was 20 years old is viewed the same way as a building in the \u2013 or Beverly Hills. And as you know the real estate classes as they mature, I think people start to understand that performance over time and asset quality does matter, does matter where you\u2019re located is the modern physical \u2013 invested and importantly in healthcare, do you have the best operating partner. And that\u2019s the piece I don\u2019t think again people fully understand but they are starting to. So now that we are entering this period where may be operations are a bit more challenged, it\u2019s a bit choppy, I think the quality of our real-estate will increasingly standout and differentiate itself. Tom DeRosa : And what we\u2019re saying is we have understood other sectors of real-estate. In early days, I think in that you are being you are being embraced by people underwriting healthcare real-estate. And the fact is, medical office buildings sitting in the Golden Triangle of Beverly Hills, have better prospects than medical office buildings in Lovett, Texas. Just the way real-estate works, it\u2019s why you like [indiscernible] in Simon malls and you don\u2019t like other mall companies that don\u2019t have those same irreplaceable locations. Let me tell you, these medical office buildings in Beverly Hills or our senior housing assets on Connecticut Avenue in Washington D.C. or on Wilshire Boulevard in Westwood are irreplaceable locations. Michael Knott : Right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you. Hi. Just a question on for the start off on the medical office side, it seems from some of your peers that there\u2019s probably more conference from tenants may be some longer lease terms being signed, there\u2019s also more interest from this newer investor that you\u2019ve highlighted. I\u2019m just kind of wondering can you give us sense of where your cap rates could go for the next call it six months as more people might get interest in the MOB space? Tom DeRosa : For high quality medical office portfolios today it\u2019s probably in the mid-fives plus or minus, I would say at least in senior housing and post-acute, the REITs are still the dominant funding source for M&A. So our cost of capital has increased a bit in the last few months and I think that will over time, be reflected in cap rates. So may be they will start to move up a bit, that\u2019s certainly the way we are positioning ourselves in discussion to sellers. I don\u2019t know that we have as much pricing power in medical office. That is also a rapid pretty substantial interest from the investment community at large.  So REITs did not constitute the majority of the buyers in that market place so I think we have less ability to influence pricing. But importantly, we approach that space the same way we approach senior housing and post-acute which is doing things off market and that does lead to better pricing. I think you\u2019ll see perhaps some other institutions entering the space, but I also think we may see some of the marginal players \u2013 I think we\u2019re already starting to see marginal players that were circling this sector 12 months ago, have flown away a bit. So, I think those may be two factors are in play here in terms of cap rate. But I think there is some recognition that this is a good sector to invest in. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, thanks. And then just on the acquisition front, you talked about potentially being a more selective focusing with your existing partners. So, assuming kind of the prices remain where they are today in terms of stocks, what are you looking at sectors and would you consider given where the balance sheet is may be changing the way you fund these? And I know you\u2019re not looking for near-term benefit but given what you\u2019ve done with the balance sheet is there a way you could may be change the funding of additional acquisition? Scott Brinker : We\u2019re not going to compromise our capital structure to \u2013 in terms of making new investments I think one of the benefits of bringing CPP in and along with PSP is we have now, a huge pool of capital to access for the right types of investments. Understand that they are very aligned with how HCN invests and manages real-estate assets across the spectrum of what we own, which starts in independent living and goes up to the front door at least in the U.S. of the acute care hospital, but doesn\u2019t go inside those doors. We are in the outpatient, we want to do outpatient with the best help systems and we want to bring state-of-the-art post-acute care as well as build infrastructure of senior communities in the markets that need to have it. And they are aligned with that and we are going to continue to grow this business and we are going to continue to strengthen the balance sheet which I think takes a lot of risk, out of this whole equation for our shareholders. Vikram Malhotra : And then just last to clarify on the Ridea side I guess, you had kind of talked about 5% at the start of the year and it\u2019s lower now given the ongoing issues in the UK but near term improvement. But would it be safe to say that in the U.S. you are still kind of expecting that five plus percent growth for the year? Scott Brinker : Yeah, I think it should be in that ballpark \u2013 by the end of the year I think we\u2019ll get back there for the whole portfolio as the UK bounces back. It will take a little time. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. Thank you. Scott Brinker : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good afternoon or good morning guys. Just a quick question with regards to the U.S. portfolio, could you just give us a snapshot of where the portfolio is from an occupancy perspective and kind of how you think about that evolving going forward upside or if it\u2019s more sort of steady stay from here and all about rate growth? Tom DeRosa : Well it should be rate growth, given our locations but occupancy today for RIDEA portfolio is around 90%. So again, that\u2019s up 60 basis points from when we last talked, when we met, so it\u2019s moving in the right direction. But by no means, we consider 90% a fully stabilized number, we expect that to increase at least through August, September, October which are really strong months and then probably start to flatten out again in November and December. Juan Sanabria : And longer term, where do you see portfolio stabilize too? Tom DeRosa : Probably low 90s, 92%-93%, I think is a reasonable number, now that can be higher for certain sub portfolios. A number of our independent living portfolios like Merrill Gardens, SRT or Revera would have higher occupancy just because the turnover is so much lower. But for the higher acuity say like Silverado is hard to maintain 95% occupancy across the portfolio. Juan Sanabria : Great. Thanks. And just following up on Vik\u2019s question, kind of noted that you\u2019d expect it to slow down given somewhat dislocations in the capital markets. Do you kind of see that continuing into sort of the fall as people are expecting to see eventually high grades or is this sort of a second quarter phenomenon and you are back to the races\u2026 Tom DeRosa : Yeah, I\u2019ll say that the whole interest rate talk creates an overhang, over this factor and particularly over the healthcare REITs. And I think that we need to \u2013 I think we need some clarity there in order to kind of the life the lid that has seemed to have appeared over our stock prices. So, that\u2019s my \u2013 Scott you got any\u2026 Scott Brinker : I think when we really get may be more introspective making sure we really you\u2019re going to wagon \u2013 circle the wagon a bit, you\u2019ll always emphasize the investments with the existing partners. And you can see almost 80% of this quarter\u2019s 627 million is with existing partners. So we\u2019ll always have a similar dateline level of investments off market transactions. We want to make sure that we have the financial flexibility no matter what happens in the capital markets to finance those and support our partners growth.  So I believe we have many avenues for financing that growth. So we essentially available, we have an ATM that\u2019s in place, we get about 280 million a year through our dividend reinvestment program, obviously joint venture partners. We actually added potential call it 100 million medical office portfolio to our health for sale assets this quarter that will probably happen early next year. So we\u2019ll be looking at all the different avenues to make sure that we can continue to grow with our partners first and foremost. Juan Sanabria : Just last quick one for me, I\u2019m not sure if you guys looked at the Omega[ph] senior house development, they put together in Manhattan. But any thoughts or color on that would be appreciative? Tom DeRosa : We think that Manhattan needs senior housing assets, it\u2019s a market that we circle in terms of what we own with our operators but we\u2019re not in Manhattan and I think that this is something that is needed in Manhattan. I don\u2019t know a lot of the details of what they bought. It struck me that this is a fairly like all Manhattan real-estate deals feels very complicated. So, it\u2019s something we\u2019ll probably take a closer look at, so we understand what was underwritten here. Juan Sanabria : Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Tom DeRosa : Good morning, Smedes. Smedes Rose : I wanted to ask, you mentioned in your press release that you have a new relationship with EPAC, just wondering how may be that came about and what sort of future investing could you do with them? And you mentioned that classic senior housing into the high fives is that kind of what you are seeing for senior housing in kind of good core markets in general at this point? Tom DeRosa : Yeah, I think high fives for classic senior housing is in the right zipcode, if not, a little bit lower. EPAC is a regional provider, they are concentrated entirely in the New England market, primarily Boston. They mostly develop and operate and we bought three of their newly developed properties in towns like Wellesley, so we\u2019re happy to have a new partner as they continue to grow their new development and hopefully we\u2019ll be a big part of that growth. Smedes Rose : Okay. But you don\u2019t have any sort of agreements with them or write a first refusal as they bring properties to market for stakeholder? Tom DeRosa : We don\u2019t \u2013 of our 30 plus operator relationships, there is a handful of it do not have contractual rights, they are handful who have exclusivity but in any of that, we have historically found a way to grow pretty substantially with everyone on the list and I would expect EPAC to be part of that team. Every member they have co-invested in this portfolio, so it\u2019s not like they are just passive third party manager, they are a joint venture partner, with money at the stake. Whether we have a contractual obligation or not, you asked our partners, they would say they see a much broader value proposition in terms of working with us than just money. And that\u2019s what drives that new investment flow to us, versus other sources of capital. Smedes Rose : Okay, thank you. And then, you mentioned on your last call that same store NOI, the UK portfolio I think was down 4%. Did you provide that for the second quarter or could you? Tom DeRosa : Yeah, it was down, I believe it was 3.7% in this first quarter and then this second quarter was down 5.7%. Smedes Rose : Okay. Okay. Thank you. Tom DeRosa : Sure. Thanks. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Just coming back to the joint venture with CPP, can you offer a little bit more color may be in terms of what this might look like over time? Is this going to be focused \u2013 I think you said it would be beyond outpatient, but how broad ranging could it be and what\u2019s \u2013 and is there an initial sizing investment? Tom DeRosa : It\u2019s all based on investments that we will source that fit CPP and PSP\u2019s broader investment parameters. So there\u2019s no specific size or numerical mandate. I think they will believe \u2013 they believe in our business platform and how that platform will source very high institutional grade investment opportunities. So, it remains to be see what that will generate over time, but we are very optimistic as they are \u2013 that given a number of things that we have in process, that there will be interesting investment opportunities for that to call it best Jordan Sadler : And just to clarify there, was it your $125 million pro rata share or investment that was done in [indiscernible] units? Scott Brinker : That was the cash portion, the accounting gets really confusing. So if you have very technical questions, we should follow up, but the units are actually not included in the 124 million because technically that isn\u2019t owned real-estate yet for us. Clearly these units are convertible in the cash or stock at which point it will be own real estate from our standpoint but the 124 you see is really the cash portion of the purchase. Jordan Sadler : I guess I can follow up after. I was just trying to see the number of units. And then I just noticed and had a question on dispositions obviously you had success with Life Science portfolio sale and I noticed that the health for sale bumped up sequentially, despite that sale closing in the quarter. Can you may be speak to the prospects for dispositions as you see them and what sort of the outlook might look like? Scott Brinker : I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think we big picture always looking calling the portfolio and being proactive and thinking about dispositions. This quarter sequential change, the Life Science portfolio was a minority investments so that number was not on that line and as I just mentioned, we did add about a 117 million, medical office portfolio this quarter for the health for sale bucket. So I would think even though I think the majority is strategic dispositions in terms of the asset that are less desirable have been called out of the portfolio really over the last three to five years will look to be opportunistic and probably have a few 100 million of asset sales per going forward. Jordan Sadler : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Nick Yulico with UBS. Tom DeRosa : Hey, Nick. Nicholas Yulico : Good morning, guys. Just going back to the California medical office portfolio, was this purchased from Jean[ph] L realty? Tom DeRosa : Yeah. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. And then did you guys have to assume any debt on this? And if so, what was the terms on that? Tom DeRosa : We did assume a small amount of debt, Nick three year term at pretty low interest rates, I think it was in the 2.5% range. So attractive debt and not much of it. Nicholas Yulico : Okay. And then, what is the \u2013 what is like the net rents today for the medical office component of those buildings and other typical lease escalators? Tom DeRosa : Yeah, the net rents for the medical office sections of the buildings Nick, are in the high 50s and the retail portion of the portfolio is closer to $100 a foot. And they do have escalators, 3% to 4% per year, but we\u2019ve been able to \u2013 historical seller now has been able to get much higher escalators upon renewal as I mentioned rate growth over the last decade in this portfolio has been 6% per year on average. Nicholas Yulico : Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one question on the UK, you gave I guess some numbers on where the growth was down in the second quarter versus the first quarter. How much is that portfolio NOI right now, sort of off its peak, after going through a couple of quarters of tough flu season? Tom DeRosa : The peak was last year. And it\u2019s down 5.7%, so we\u2019re working with a very tough cop, 2014 Nick. Nicholas Yulico : Right. Yeah. I\u2019m just trying to \u2013 I\u2019m just thinking about how to think about over time if you have this situation where I know it was an unusually cold winter and you have a flue season. You face a period of time \u2013 you\u2019re going to face these issues where is this going to be think the most where you\u2019re down almost 6%, when that situation happens? Tom DeRosa : Nick, we hope it is, but this is something completely outside of our control. So, on the last call we talked about lesson learned and it\u2019s why having a very deep bench on the ground on the UK will help mitigate some of the issues that was old when you have these very much unexpected events that can occur in our business. So, I hope it\u2019s the worst but over time, we just never know. Scott Brinker : Yeah, Nick, the other thing is in the three years we\u2019ve know the assets, the NOI have been double digits to-date. So there\u2019s been huge appreciation, it\u2019s been a huge a tailwind for our whole portfolio. The last two quarters weren\u2019t as good, but also remember that the UK operating portfolio is like 4% of our total portfolio. We are very well diversified, this has a very strong impact on our end net results, and that\u2019s why you see us grow 3.2% same store last quarter despite being down almost 6% in the UK. Scott Estes : You can see the NOI on the back of the supplement, the effect of this quarter is down only $3 million so that\u2019s about quarter of a penny. Nicholas Yulico : Right. Okay. Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Market. Michael Carroll : Hey Scott, regards to your construction activity comment, how competitive are AL development your community that you have? Scott Brinker : I don\u2019t know Michael, I would say the line is often times a bit blurry, but from a license standpoint independent living facilities cannot have provide a number of services that most the system facilities provide. So the average age is very similar but the resonance look a lot different. So I would not consider them direct competitors they are more often complementary to one another. But on occasion, they may compete a bit. Michael Carroll : That helps. But in your stats you said that construction activity your market is half of that as the big data, are you looking at the total senior housings, I guess construction activity or are you breaking it out by service type only comparing the AL developments versus your AL communities and the same thing with the IO? Scott Brinker : Yeah, we\u2019re just looking at all of the supply, local markets Michael, there is no distinction. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then my last question little bit about the flu season in the UK, was it more severe in the UK I guess, why the flu season is being impacting your UK portfolio more than it appears that it\u2019s impacting the U.S. portfolio. I guess that\u2019s based on your recent quarter. Scott Brinker : It was bad in both locations, but it was particularly bad in the UK, so our debt related move outs in the first quarter were 130% above seasonal norms, imagine the enormous number. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s driven the occupancy decline. Move in activity is right in mind with our budget and with history, we continue to have pricing power. It\u2019s not a demand issue. It\u2019s just that people got sick and unfortunately passed away and the stats bear that out. So, we\u2019re confident that things will bounce back. We are already seeing that happen. Michael Carroll : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Stifel. Daniel Bernstein : Good morning. So I wanted to follow up on construction cost comments of 10%, we can take this offline but we can\u2019t, does that really change the equation for operators and capitals expanding for them or \u2013 I\u2019m sure when you\u2019re saying that covered for construction something for getting your operators or is that your management? Scott Brinker : No, we are seated directly. The projects we\u2019re funding our balance sheeting that we\u2019re involved with, for example all the Mainstreet properties, probably have exposure at one level or to 100 projects at various levels of construction in the U.S. and the UK. So we have a huge view into what\u2019s happening in the development market place. Costs are up, labor is up, materials are up, that doesn\u2019t mean that no one is going to build, that\u2019s not what we are trying to say. But if it costs 10% more today than it did six months ago, that probably does impact the number of new projects that are put under construction. Daniel Bernstein : Okay. That\u2019s good color. And also follow up on that, does that impact all seniors housing equally or say does it impact urban development projects versus secondary markets does it impact living more than a bit independent living? Just trying to understand, is it across the board impacts or is there going to be more specific impact that we \u2013 Tom DeRosa : The most acute increase we have seen Dan, is in the bigger metros where senior housing and healthcare developers are competing with multi-family, in other real-estate developers for land, for labor and for materials. Daniel Bernstein : Okay. And then on the capitals of the structure size of the business you did this joint venture for medical office, should we be expecting to see some more joint venture shouldn\u2019t you or are you using that as a structure to reduce your capital leads given the back up in capital costs until the market correct itself in terms of cap rates or capital rates go back down? Is it a one-off transaction for you in terms of structure or are you thinking, you might use the JV structure a little bit more given where\u2026 Tom DeRosa : Clearly, it is another horn in the capital water for us. And we think that this is an arrangement that was not readily available to a healthcare REIT historically and we\u2019ve worked hard to bring in two of the most sophisticated investors to help educate them about investing in this sector. So, you should expect that it is one of the ways we will finance the growth of our business in the future. Scott Brinker : Remember Dan, the Regal transaction that we announced 770 million Canadian the Revera will co-invest 25%, they are owned by PSP and they brought us into that deal. So it\u2019s not just CPP this PSP relationship has been really a game changer for us in the last three years and continues to be \u2013 it\u2019s tapering us out opportunities as well. Daniel Bernstein : You think there are opportunities like that with the U.S. investors or is this \u2013 is it something just not isolated I would assume that something that you could use investors around \u2013 you probably may be seeing some more joint venture opportunity with those partners? Tom DeRosa : Yes, I would say that the institutional investment world and the real-estate looks to the Canadians, I think. I think that CPP and PSP I think go a long way in validating the asset class and certainly go a long way in validating HCN as an industry. We have many discussions with other potential large pension fund types of investors that are getting interested and looking to be educated in investing in this sector, but I think we feel good about that. We\u2019ve aligned ourselves with the Gold standards of that community and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you saw some others of similar \u2013 caliber get on the HCN team. Daniel Bernstein : I\u2019ll hop off, it\u2019s going to be a long call. Thank you for taking. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Dan. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one for Scott and Scott on the financing side, if you were to try to do your bond deal, I\u2019m assuming that you don\u2019t have a bond deal today, what kind of REIT would you get on that same deal? And does that have any real impact on how you\u2019re underwriting acquisitions? Scott Estes : In the capital part, today it would probably be in the 4.3% range to call it about an increase of 30 basis points. And I think Scott can address the fact that we are thinking about our cost of capital every day on the investment side. Scott you want to address that how to think about pricing deals in the current environment? Scott Brinker : Yeah, Tayo we would definitely try to push pricing a bit. It\u2019s easier in private negotiations than it is in auctions. But that is definitely our thought process right now. Omotayo Okusanya : But that would kind of change \u2013 it\u2019s not that what\u2019s happening with you is very consistent across all the \u2013 that has an impacted cap rate, cap rates haven\u2019t started backing up yet? Scott Brinker : Well it takes a while, so our cost of capital has really increased in the past few months and anyone with certain \u2013 how long it would last? Would it get worse or better? I think it\u2019s been long enough now that we\u2019re starting to think cap rates should need to move up a bit, for us to continue to be as aggressive as we have been. Omotayo Okusanya : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Scott Brinker : Thanks, Tayo. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. We would like to thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Tom DeRosa : Thank you.",

My name is Holly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Welltower\u2019s third quarter 2015 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at welltower.com. We are holding a live webcast of today\u2019s call, which may be accessed through the company\u2019s website. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Tom DeRosa, the CEO of Welltower. Tom? Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Jeff and good morning. I am pleased to tell you that our financial results for the third quarter were the strongest we have reported this year, an 8% increase in FFO per share overall Q3 2014. The performance as well as our confidence in future earnings potential allows us to increase our 2015 guidance and announced a 4.2% increase in our dividend for 2016, the largest dividend increase in a number of years.  I'm also pleased to be speaking to you for the first time as Welltower, a name that speaks to the promise of the extraordinary business model that we've built over decades, a model that will continue to lead the evolution of healthcare delivery infrastructure.  Now I know that you are all trying to understand the impact of new supply on our Q3 same-store results. So let me hit that for you right upfront.  First, our Q3 same-store results for our entire portfolio are in line with what we expected and our guidance for 2015 remains unchanged at 3% to 3.5%. In the US, we have seen new supply impact some but not all of our markets. Scott Brinker will give you more detail here.  We are encouraged by the 60 basis point occupancy improvement in our same-store operating portfolio from Q2 to Q3, and we continue to benefit from pricing power as our best-in-class operators command premium rates over the competition. So going forward we feel that our portfolio is positioned to grow.  As in the prior two quarters, our same-store operating growth continued to be negatively impacted by a historic flu season that crushed the occupancy rate of our UK portfolio. As you will see in our supplement, if you exclude the UK from our same-store operating results, the year-over-year Q3 increase would've been 3.4% versus 2.7%. I hope this helps put the growth of supply issue into perspective. If you want to know more about supply in the markets where Welltower operates, see our new disclosure in our supplement. It will give you greater insight into our major and sub markets. Hopefully you'll see why we are bullish about the performance of our senior housing portfolio going forward.  Scott Estes will provide you more information on our financial performance. Our great operating results were generated from our best-in-class real estate portfolio enhanced by over $20 billion of accretive investments and approximately $4 billion in dispositions made in the last five years. Our operating results also greatly benefit from our strong balance sheet which gives us great financial flexibility as we prepare for a potential increase in interest rates. Remember we\u2019ve raised $4 billion in equity in the last 18 months and our leverage has been reduced by over 5%, no easy feat for a $35 billion plus enterprise. Frankly given the schizophrenic rhetoric coming from Janet Yellen and company, I'm very glad delevering is behind us. As Scott Estes will tell you, now it\u2019s our time to drive earnings growth.  Let me say that transparency has always been a hallmark of Welltower and our financials should provide a good clear roadmap to understanding our third-quarter performance and where we are headed.  Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Scott Brinker, our Chief Investment Officer. Scott Brinker : Thank you, Tom and good morning to everyone. I want to start with the themes that drive our investment strategy. They provide a framework to think about how our portfolio has performed to date and how it should perform going forward. One, align with best-in-class operators and buildings, because our building, our business is driven by real estate and operations. Two, concentrate in large metro markets that have superior demographics and higher entry barriers. Three, diversify by geography, operator and lease maturity and fourth, actively manage the portfolio.  The payoff is visible in our results. The long-duration triple net portfolio contributes half of our earnings and is a steady strong performer. Same-store seniors housing NOI increased 3.3% while post-acute increased 3.4%. That's awfully attractive with inflation at or below 2%. Payment coverages were flat and remained at secure levels.  The median duration outpatient medical portfolio is 15% of our earnings. We hit all time highs in occupancy and tenant retention. This led to a solid quarter with 2.5% same-store growth which is right in the range we expected.  The final segment is a short duration operating portfolio. Same-store NOI grew 2.7% last quarter. That number requires some color and context. One, we own a modern portfolio that allows us to drive NOI growth with very modest capital expenditures. This is a really important point when comparing same-store results across companies. Less CapEx means more free cash flow to grow the dividend and acquire new properties. Two, and as expected, the UK dragged down results for the entire operating portfolio. This is a finite-12 month issue and we are now three quarters of the way through it. A record flu season wiped out more than 300 basis points of occupancy in the UK earlier this year.  But we are turning things around. Occupancy is up 110 basis points sequentially and the momentum has continued in October. The UK was a same-store growth engine for us in 2013 and \u201814 and we think it will be again in 2016.  Three, the US is strong. That represents 70% of the operating portfolio. Our core markets like Southern California, New York and Washington DC are thriving. The US portfolio is on target year-to-date with 4.7% same-store growth and a positive outlook in 4Q. Four, we were up against the tough comp. And finally new supply. This is the time to use a sharp pencil not a broad brush. We\u2019ve added a huge amount of information in the reporting package. We included color commentary to give you context to all the numbers. The color is important because not all new supply is equally competitive due to services offered and price point.  As you do a deep dive, the data will confirm that on a relative basis our markets have less new supply, better job growth and superior demographics. That doesn't mean we\u2019re immune from new supply but we\u2019re entering a period in which dispersion is going to widen. This is the time to align with the best real estate and operations and that\u2019s exactly what we are.  That takes me to our outlook for the overall operating portfolio. And as a reminder, we don\u2019t update NOI guidance throughout the year for each segment only for the aggregate portfolio. But the question has come up quite a bit and we want to be responsive.  So looking forward. Occupancy was up 60 basis points sequentially with solid growth in all three countries. Occupancy has continued to move higher in October. We have pricing power in the vast majority of our markets. So from where we sit today, despite one more week quarter coming from the UK, we\u2019re optimistic that NOI growth for the overall operating portfolio will move higher sequentially in 4Q. We\u2019re in the middle of the budgeting process with our partners and we\u2019ll provide 2016 outlook in February.  Turning to investments. Our model is privately negotiated high quality real estate with existing partners. It\u2019s simple and perhaps a bit boring but it works. The initial cash yield on our third-quarter investments was a very strong 7.2% and we expanded our relationships with both Sunrise and Genesis, two industry leaders.  That brings me to a critical point of differentiation : our deep relationships with best-in-class operators. We\u2019re extending that advantage in a highly targeted way. So far this year we\u2019ve formed new relationships with Aspen, Oakmont, EPIC and most recently Leisure Care, one of the 20 largest operators in the US. These relationships extend our leading market share in London, California and New England. And all four partners will be a source of future growth.  We\u2019re off to a strong start in 4Q. Alongside our partner Revera, we just completed the acquisition of Regal Communities. The assets are concentrated in our core Canadian markets, including Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa and Vancouver. We will receive a 6.1% preferred return that escalates over time, which is highly attractive in comparison to recent public auction M&A in Canada. The opportunity set is never a problem. We have active dialogue with 30 plus existing partners and a long list of operators who want to be part of the Welltower family. We expect this will remain a unique way to create incremental shareholder value.  In summary, we\u2019re looking to end the year with momentum heading into 2016. And Scott Estes will now discuss our financial results. Scott Estes : Thank you, Scott and good morning everyone. From a financial perspective, our message over the last several quarters had focused on strengthening the balance sheet. Importantly, as Tom discussed, we took the opportunity to consistently raise equity over the past 18 months that we are currently in a position of strength and flexibility.  More specifically, our leverage and balance sheet metrics have continued to improve, give excellent liquidity with our entire line of credit available and approximately $100 million in cash, we are not reliant upon the equity markets over the near term and our multiple pension fund partners provide flexibility in financing new investments. So as a result, the key financial message today is that we've shifted our focus from improving our balance sheet and credit metrics to one where we are driving more meaningful earnings growth for the remainder of 2015 and 2016.  I will begin my more detailed remarks with some perspective on our third-quarter financial performance and changes in our supplemental disclosure.  Normalized FFO came in at a record $1.12 per share and normalized FAD was $0.99 for the third quarter, representing strong 8% and 9% increases year-over-year respectively. Our results were driven primarily by the solid same-store cash NOI increase and the $3.6 billion of net investment completed over the past 12 months.  There was one notable expense item in our numbers this quarter that I'd like to take a moment to clarify. You'll note on our income statement that we recognized a tax benefit of about $3.3 million. You would typically see an expense on this line but we recognized approximately $5.4 million of tax repayments this quarter for amounts overpaid in previous periods. Importantly, we did not take this benefit to normalize earnings this quarter. I think this is another good example of the financial transparency Tom mentioned in his opening remarks. We arguably could have taken these repayments to normalize earnings this quarter since we did include the overpayments in previous periods but we are excluding them in an effort to show a more true operating result. And you can see where we exclude these repayments in our normalizing items on page 8 of our earnings release.  In terms of dividends, we will pay our 178th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on November 20 of $0.825 per share representing an annual rate of $3.30 and a current dividend yield of 5%. I'd note that our FFO and FAD payout ratios for the third quarter declined to 74% and 83% respectively. And as we move into 2016 our confidence in our internal and external growth has allowed us to announce a 4.2% increase in our 2016 dividend payment rate today, representing our highest dividend growth rate in four years.  In terms of our supplemental package, we continue to enhance our disclosure in response to investor and analyst feedback. A few items of note \u2013 first on Page 1, we added a footnote regarding our hospital portfolio. This is notable because you'll see that our London hospital portfolio derived 80% of its revenue from outpatient services and 93% of revenue from private pay sources.  Next on Page 9, we added new disclosure comparing our Canadian seniors housing operating portfolio to benchmarks in the country. And on Pages 10 through 14 as Scott Brinker discussed, we've added significant new disclosure detailing new supply related to our seniors housing operating portfolio on a 3 and 5 mile radius, including detailed descriptions of the local market dynamics for a significant number of properties.  Turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. As the third quarter was relatively quiet from a capital raising perspective, we did issue 1.2 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program, generating $78 million in proceeds which was the most we've ever raised in a quarter through the program.  We also generated $171 million of proceeds through the sale of non-strategic assets and loan payoffs which included about $2 million of gains and represented a blended yield on total proceeds of 5.7%. The remaining $57 million of our 2029 convertible debt either converted or was redeemed during the quarter, which eliminated the final convertible debt instrument on our balance sheet. And finally we\u2019ve repaid approximately $130 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.4% and assumed to refinance $108 million of secured debt at a blended 3.1% rate.  Subsequent to quarter end, we did complete several additional capital transactions. In early October, we completed our first significant capital raise under the Welltower flag when we reopened our 4% senior unsecured debt through June 2025 through the sale of 500 million of notes priced to yield just under 4.3%. And also in early October, we utilize our ATM program for the first time since 2011 by issuing 696,000 shares at a gross price of $69.23 which generated $47 million in proceeds.  So as a result, pro forma for both our October capital raising activities and financing the Regal transaction earlier this week, we are in an excellent liquidity position today with our entire $2.5 billion line of credit available and approximately $100 million in cash.  Our balance sheet and financial metrics at quarter end continued to strengthen. As of September 30, net debt to un-depreciated book capitalization was 37% and net debt to enterprise value was 30%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined to 5.2 times while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter improved nicely to 4.5 times and 3.5 times respectively. Our secured debt level also declined by 40 basis points to only 10.8% of total assets at quarter end.  I will conclude my comments today with an update on guidance and our key assumptions. In terms of same-store cash NOI growth, as Tom and Scott discussed, we continue to forecast blended same-store growth of 3% to 3.5% for the total portfolio in 2015. We can't stress enough the consistency and lack of volatility in our same store NOI results over the longer term. Specifically if you look over the last 16 quarters, our total portfolio same store NOI growth has only varied between 3.0% and 4.4%, and I think this number becomes more impressive considering the low-inflation environment we've seen over the same period.  In terms of our 2015 investment expectations, in addition to investments completed through the third quarter, our $4.1 billion guidance does include the Regal Lifestyle communities transaction that closed earlier this week, the Genesis acquisition and loan expected to close late in the year, approximately $50 million of investments through our Mainstreet partnership and $73 million of development funding. I would also note that we increased our disposition proceeds expectation for the full year to a total of $1.1 billion and an expected average yield on total proceeds of approximately 6%.  Our CapEx forecast is now approximately $60 million for 2015 which is comprised of $40 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio with the remaining $20 million coming from our outpatient medical portfolio. These amounts continue to represent approximately 6% to 7% of anticipated NOI in both asset categories. Our G&A forecast is now approximately $145 million for 2015 which is about $2 million below our previous estimate. And finally in terms of earnings guidance, we\u2019re in position to increase our normalized FFO forecast to a range of $4.32 to $4.37 per diluted share and tightening our FAD estimate to a range of $3.84 to $3.89 per diluted share which both represent a solid increase of 5% to 6%.  In conclusion, we feel very positive about our overall results today. We are on pace on complete over $4 billion in investments this year. We've enhanced our leverage and credit metrics. Our total same-store NOI growth forecast is unchanged at 3% to 3.5%. We delivered quarterly FFO and FAD growth of 8% to 9%. We raised our FFO guidance for the year and our confidence in our future earnings growth potential allowed us to increase our dividend at the highest rate in four years.  So with that, that concludes my comments. I will turn it back to you, Tom, for some closing remarks. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Scott. Before we open the line for questions, I just want to speak for a moment about the compelling long-term investment and growth opportunity we see before us.  This past Tuesday, the front page of the New York Times reported on a study that concluded that the money to treat a person suffering from dementia in their final five years of life is 80% greater than the cost of treating someone with heart disease or cancer. Dementia is a disease where there is no cure. Dementia patients need constant care for years but these costs are not covered by insurance, Medicare or Medicaid. This is a crisis for families impacted by this disease today and will become an enormous crisis for society at large in the future.  Welltower offers a solution. We are focused on providing the capital necessary for our operating partners to build the infrastructure needed to deliver wellness and a healthy and safe quality of life to our cognitively impaired seniors. And we are focused on providing capital to the most prominent health systems as they exit their old outmoded acute-care hospital buildings in favor of more modern efficient outpatient focused settings that can work effectively with post-acute and senior housing to manage the challenges of healthcare delivery in the future. We, with our shareholders, are the catalysts of capital to make this all happen. Now Holly, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Juan Sanabria : My first question is for Scott Estes. I think you mentioned shifting of the balance sheet to more meaningfully driving growth as we look towards \u201916. Does that mean any change in how you're looking to financings going forward, is the plan to lever up or to maintain sort of a leveraged mutual approach? Scott Estes : Hey Juan, the short answer is leverage neutral approach. We don't intend to increase leverage. I think it's more of a comment that we\u2019re happy with the general levels we are in now, so you\u2019d expect us to maintain our typical 50%-ish equity, 40% debt capital raising ratio from these levels but we don't intend to increase leverage. Juan Sanabria : And then just on RIDEA, I appreciate the comments to the new disclosure around supply but for the US specifically what\u2019s the view on kinds of levers with occupancy, kind of rate and expenses as you look forward and how should we be thinking about sort of a steady-state growth from here for the US? Scott Brinker : Juan, it\u2019s Scott Brinker. The major drivers of NOI growth for the business are occupancy rate and staffing. So if you understand those three components you\u2019d I think underwritten 90 plus percent of NOI growth and we can't see too far into the future but from what we do see the trend is very positive. So occupancy across our portfolio is moving higher since June and that\u2019s continued into the fourth quarter. Rate growth continues to be 3 plus percent in most of our markets and that's generally in line with compensation. So things bounce around a bit from quarter to quarter, 90 days is just a very small amount of time and unusual items can have a big impact. So don't read too much in any particular quarter but over time we see rate growth generally in line with wages. Juan Sanabria : And then just one last quick one from me on the RIDEA business, can you give us any sense of what the typical turnover at the senior management level, executive director et cetera is and if that's changed at all with new supply? Scott Brinker : We haven't seen a major change, Juan but you raised an interesting question because that position drives performance at these properties. And one of the things we've done with our executive forum is really dig into employee turnover at all levels, including the executive director, so that for the first time all of our operating partners can compare how they perform against their peers. And we talked about that report at our last meeting about a month ago and that was a real eye-opener for 12 of the leading operating companies in the country, because they had not seen to date how they compared on that very important metric. And that's the type of thing that we\u2019re doing in our portfolio that's totally different than the typical capital partner and helps explain why we have such close relationships with the best operators in the country. Tom DeRosa : Juan, I will just add to that, at the NIC conference where we brought together a number of the operators in our forum that Scott was referring to. We brought in a senior executive from the Ritz Carlton Company to meet with these executives and talk to them about building a positive culture in an organization. So these types of efforts -- which these individual operators couldn\u2019t do on their own, because of the scale we offer we can bring in someone like this executive from Ritz Carlton and expose them to best practices which they might not otherwise be able to take advantage of. Juan Sanabria : And just what is the actual average turnover you guys are seeing at the level? Scott Brinker : Juan, it varies because buildings are at different ages. But if you were to take just a pool of typical buildings that have been opened for 10 to 20 years in our portfolio, it tends to be in the five-year range. So there is turnover at that position but the higher turnover is really at the line staff level, like the direct care giver level, that tends to be more in the 30% to 40% range, so a bit higher for the lower wage employees. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Joshua Raskin with Barclays Capital. Nihal Shah : This is actually Nihal Shah filling in for Josh Raskin. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to kind of go into the 2.7 growth that you guys had. I appreciate the comments on the UK portfolio. But I was wondering if there was any particular operators that might be driving this, to the positive or the negative? Scott Brinker : The only operator that I would think about in the U.S. and it's not by name, but just by region is New England because like the UK they had a devastating flu season in the first quarter. So occupancy is quite depressed and as I mentioned in the UK comments, it takes a full year to get out of that, because it's in the current year's numbers for 12 entire months and until you do a lap a year later it's a drag. So even though our New England portfolio is building back occupancy, it's starting \u2013 or you\u2019re comparing against a big hole and that is an issue. And the other one is just a couple of outliers drive huge variance. So in the US we had five properties that if you were to take them out of the pool, the same-store growth rate would've been more than 100 basis points higher than we reported. So remember, we have 250 plus properties in the US. So a very small number of properties can drive a huge variance from any one quarter and that's why it\u2019s just tough to look at only 90 days. Focus on a longer period of time. Scott Estes : Yes, I think that\u2019s important that we don\u2019t take facilities in and out of the portfolio. We will give you that -- that information we can and a lot of times it does get to you. Tom DeRosa : So please we ask you to look at the consistency of what's in our same-store portfolio because it would be very easy to manipulate the number by -- when you see a problem taking it out of the portfolio but we don't do that. We maintain a very transparent approach to this calculation. Nihal Shah : And one more question if I may. We\u2019ve been seeing a lot of activity in the hospital space both on the REIT side as well as the operating side. Are you seeing any increased opportunities in that space given all the action? Tom DeRosa : Well the opportunities we\u2019re seeing are to help the major systems build out much-needed modern outpatient infrastructures. You\u2019ve heard me say many times we stop at the front door of the hospital. In fact, I think we\u2019re about to see the last of our US hospitals out of our portfolio this year. So we do not believe that investing in acute care in the US makes sense for our shareholders. Now we do like the private hospital market in the UK. You saw us make a significant investment there that continues \u2013 we\u2019re very bullish on that business. But we don't care for the reimbursement paradigm of acute care in the United States and we\u2019ve been watching the results of the public hospital companies recently and I think our thesis is being supported by some of the results that were reported this past quarter. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Stifel. Daniel Bernstein : I just also want to go back into the same-store seniors housing NOI growth. Is that on a constant currency and how did the currency impact that number? Just trying to think about how it compared to peers? Scott Estes : Yes, it\u2019s on a constant currency basis, Dan. Daniel Bernstein : Did currency impact that number at all or \u2013 Scott Estes : No. Daniel Bernstein : And then also I was just thinking about the development opportunities that are out there, are you getting any opportunities to do something more of like what you\u2019ve done at 4Qs where you had the Surgery Center, MOB and hospital coordinate with the skilled nursing, coordinate with the assisted-living, are you getting any kind of more opportunities where you\u2019re able to do that thinking about where the future of healthcare is going. It seems like that you might have that opportunity. I just want to think about \u2013 a little bit more in depth about what kind of construction development you are doing out there? Tom DeRosa : Yes, Dan, we are very focused on that. And I will tell you that the dialogues with health systems about the very subject you bring up have increased dramatically. So we are very focused on creating connectivity between acute-care, postacute and seniors housing and I would -- and we are -- as we think about the future we\u2019re thinking that's an area that we will commit scale capital to. It\u2019s early days, I am not saying that -- and again these are development opportunities, these are not acquisition opportunities. This is where we will be doing new development. But we are very excited about that. We think that\u2019s the future of an important part of the growth profile of Welltower in the future. Daniel Bernstein : If you look back at the last couple of weeks, maybe more than couple of weeks ago, you had an expansion of the bundled payment into 75 MSAs. Are you getting any \u2013 do you have any thoughts on whether and how the construction might head in the postacute sector, are we going to see more \u2013 the silos are going to go away \u2013 are we going to see more construction that\u2019s simply rehab and have you had any inquiries or thoughts about what kind of construction or development properties you need to invest in going forward in the post acute space? Scott Brinker : Dan, it's early days in that but our view is that it supports our thesis which is to back to support the best in class scale operators like Genesis. We think that they are best positioned to live in that kind of a world where they're negotiating with huge health systems, huge managed-care payers. There is massive infrastructure needed to do that effectively, technology and these small companies in our view cannot live in that world effectively. So our view is that in the skilled nursing business people are very focused on reimbursement rates and whether that means that the outlook is good, bad or benign and we think that is a small piece of the story, because underneath all of that is a massive change to how that business is going to work going forward. And I don't think people fully understand that. So we\u2019re not focused on next quarter or two quarters from now. It\u2019s what is that business going to look like in five years and in 10 years and it's a lot different than what it looks like today. Tom DeRosa : And the other piece of this, Dan, is the aging of the population which has really got to drive a profound change in healthcare delivery. I was struck this morning watching Squawk Box where you had the CEOs of the Mayo Clinic, the Cleveland Clinic and NYU Langone and they really didn't touch on that. And I sat there in amazement because that is one of the biggest looming problems for the healthcare delivery sector is how you\u2019re going to manage this aging population and it has to be reinvented and it's not going to happen in the traditional brick-and-mortar that exists today. You will get a lot of hospitals in America, they were built in the 1930s and those are hospitals of many brand-name -- that are belonged to many brand-name health systems. That\u2019s going to be a challenge in the future and that's one of the reasons why we get up every morning here and work so hard to tell our story and attract new sources of capital to invest in making it all happen. Daniel Bernstein : We want to take that conversation offline because it sounds like it could be a very long conversation but we tend to agree that there's going to be a pretty big upheaval. I want to understand more how the operators are trying to deal with it. The last question I have is going back to the wage pressures, it sounds like you think your wages are about in line with revenues. But when we think about -- what we hear on the wage pressures are some minimum-wage, there\u2019s poaching of executive directors maybe in seniors housing and then maybe on the operator side, it seems like there's -- if you listen to most of the post-acute and hospital calls, there\u2019s some increased contract labor maybe in therapy and skilled nursing. So if you could talk a little bit about more in detail about where you are seeing wage pressure and how concerned you are about that, even if your rates are keeping up with that, how concerned are you about wage pressure going forward here? Scott Brinker : Dan, it\u2019s Scott. I will take that. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re very focused on. As I mentioned it's one of the three primary drivers of performance but my comments reflect our view that rate growth is generally in line with compensation. So there are some markets where there's a shortage and that may drive labor costs higher, it may require a bit more contract labor which is more expensive. But there are an equal number of markets offsetting that so that the average is in the 3% range. And we haven't seen any material change in turnover in any of the positions. But this report or study that we have underway I think will start to chip away that. So we\u2019re optimistic that turnover can actually go down rather than go up. Tom DeRosa : And we just need to attract more people to this industry, to work in this industry. I think that's an issue. We are not at the top of everyone's list as the most glamorous businesses to build a career in. But that has to change because there's huge opportunities for people to come into this either the seniors housing or the post-acute sectors, and that's something we work very closely with our operators on as how they can work towards in recruiting and attracting people who are looking to change careers or people that are looking for encore careers. We\u2019re going to live a lot longer, so the idea that you\u2019re going to retire at 60 and then start collecting government benefits and live a happy life is probably a bit a thing of the past. I think there are lot of 55 to 60-year-olds that are going to need jobs because they are living to a 100 and you know what I hope they come calling us and work in the senior housing industry. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi Research. Smedes Rose : Hi thanks. I wanted to ask you just as you look at the acquisition opportunities going forward, would you expect to sort of go with maybe more joint ventures and bringing in pension funds or other institutional investors? I think you said in the past they were looking more seriously at this asset class and I'm just thinking that in the context of you\u2019ve said you want to remain leverage neutral and just kind of presumably a higher cost of equity here. Is that \u2013 would that be a way to continue the pace of acquisition activity in line with what you would like to be? Tom DeRosa : Definitely Smedes. Scott and I will both comment on that but that's not an area that we\u2019re spending a lot of time in and CCP becoming one of our joint venture partners was very noticed by the large sovereign funds around the world and we\u2019ve been in significant discussions with many of them as they try and understand an investment class that they've had no exposure to in the past. And as we told people and I think they recognized the Canadian pension plan spent more time underwriting Welltower than they spent underwriting the investment in the Beverly Hills portfolio. And I think that has not gone unnoticed. Scott? Scott Brinker : Yes, I would add that we were ahead of the game on this. So we established a partnership with PSP almost 3 years ago and have significantly grown that partnership in the interim. And if you look at the recent track record of investments, including the big one we closed this week in Canada where Revera is a 25% owner, remember Revera is owned by PSP, and think about the Beverly Hills portfolio and stay tuned for other things that we\u2019re working on. A large percentage of them have a joint venture partner and we think that's really important because as a public company our stock price is a little bit volatile and yet we see fantastic opportunities that strategically will be really important for us to own, whether their assets or operators as we look into the future and to be able to tie up those opportunities without spending 100% of the capital, sometimes can be really helpful. And it's nice to have friends to call on when you're in one of those periods of time. Smedes Rose : I just wanted to ask you too, in the UK, I mean adjusting for the flu issue that you\u2019ve talked about, it seems like it\u2019s obviously a market with compelling demographics, are you seeing a lot of or more elevated supply coming into that market or if not, what kind of the governor that\u2019s stopping new capital coming in to build more senior housing? Scott Brinker : Yes, the UK is a fascinating market. I wish we could spend the whole day on it because it's so intriguing to us. But the bed supply in the UK for the most part is declining and if you do site visits in two or 95% of the homes there you would not want to stay there. They are obsolete and they need to be replaced. And what we own in the UK is literally the top 1% of the estate. So these are modern properties, private pay not government pay and there is virtually no new supply other than what we\u2019re building with our partners. So we picked Sunrise, Signature and Avery, the three leading private pay operators in that entire country and we\u2019re building out there development pipeline. And with a concentration in London which is the hardest market we have exposure to, to build in. It\u2019s remarkably difficult. Tom DeRosa : So London, it's so important to know that our UK business is concentrated in London and it would be -- as Scott said we are bringing the new supply to the market, it will be very difficult for anyone else to come into that market and bring new supply in any scale. And I think London serves as a good example of the type of market that we want to be in over the long term. And again it\u2019s like any sector of real estate, if you're in places where it\u2019s easy to bring new supply and financing is available, new supply will come. But when you're in the very densely populated centers of urban markets where there is job growth, there is population growth, it's very difficult to bring supply into those markets. So that's why the bump that you see in our same-store results in this quarter is really not an indicator of the future performance. I think you have to go look more deeply at our portfolio and see that London is not an outlier, that London is basically characteristic of where we have placed our shareholders\u2019 capital. And because we\u2019ve sold so much over the years, we've been able to redeploy that capital in those -- in the most attractive markets in the US, Canada and the UK. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : I guess my first question is a little bit of a follow-up in terms of new supply in sort of protected markets vis-\u00e0-vis your commentary with London, Tom. I really appreciate the new disclosure. Can you guys maybe give us a sense as to why the 3 mile or five-mile rings are appropriate and versus maybe a seven or 10 mile ring around some of these properties, in these MSAs? And then separately I know on the five-mile ring at least you\u2019ve identified this 4% of NOI, of your potential NOI being impacted. I'm just -- maybe you could hone in on that and maybe we could expand on that as it relates to sort of widening the ring a little bit. Scott Brinker : Yes, it\u2019s Scott Brinker. I will take that. And we chose 3 miles because we've done a lot of work about historical referral patterns in drawing networks for our portfolio in terms of where did the residents actually come from. And we characterize the entire portfolio into really three categories : urban, suburban and rural. The vast majority of what we own fell into the urban category. We had virtually nothing in the rural category and in general the median drawing area for these urban markets is about three miles and for suburban assets it's more like five. So for our portfolio 3 miles make sense. When I think about a 7 mile radius that's 150 square miles in London or Boston or Los Angeles. And frankly as developers are using the 7 mile radius there's going to be a lot more new development but that is not an appropriate drawing radius. When you get some people from 7 miles, sure but the vast majority in these densely populated markets are coming from a much smaller radius. Jordan Sadler : And then as sort of a follow-up on capital allocation, I noticed the dividend increase, larger dividend increase this coming \u201816 and I guess when I look at \u201915 versus \u201814 it's going to be more than an 8% increase. But at the same time I see that you guys were issuing on the ATM post quarter end and using the DRIP during the quarter. Can you guys talk a little bit about dividend policy and sort of capital allocation vis-\u00e0-vis sort of equity versus the dividend? Scott Estes : Scott Estes, how are you doing, Jordan? We review the policy once a year. Over the last three or four years we\u2019d increased the dividend at a rate of about 3.5% and we agree in what we actually do, we wanted to both acknowledge our confidence in our growth potential looking to next year but also acknowledging retained earnings as one of the best sources of capital. So we didn\u2019t go with a more significant pace of increase. So we\u2019re trying to balance the two, I think and thinking about what our shareholders would want, whether they be income oriented funds or more focused on the earnings growth. Jordan Sadler : So it would be something less than your AFFO growth, some portion of that, is that sort of how you are thinking about it? Scott Estes : You can\u2019t hold me to any numbers, we don\u2019t have guidance out there but we've been driving down our payout ratios pretty consistently and I still think there's an opportunity to do that from current levels. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Paul Morgan : Just to get back to the -- you cited that there were just five properties that if you excluded them from the same store pool, it would have been 100 basis points higher. That's a pretty big \u2013 that\u2019s just a pretty big double-digit decline in those. Do you have any more color about those \u2013 those five specifics and I mean is that kind of typical that you\u2019d have that or when you talk about maybe seeing higher same-store numbers in the fourth quarter, could that be one of the drivers? Scott Brinker : We think so, because there are specific issues at each of those five buildings that can be fixed. And the exact number was 130 basis points. So that takes our growth rate all the way down to 3.6, would have been 4.9 if you take out those just five properties, and it's a combination of flu, it\u2019s a combination of new supply in certain markets and there was some turnover at the ED level at one. So it's a mix of things but in each case I think an identifiable issue that can be fixed. The one subject to new supply maybe it takes a bit more time for those but it shows you that with a portfolio of 250 plus properties in the US, 245 plus did very well growing right at the 5% mark and we had five that we needed to fix. Scott Estes : And if I could add to, I think it's important because everyone is so focused on the rate of growth and the actual percentage change and to me from a financial perspective to put the supply issue in some context, a 1% variance in our overall same store operating portfolio NOI in a quarter is actually less than $2 million or half a penny per share, it\u2019s less than half a percent really to our total earnings. So we obviously acknowledge we\u2019re all focused on it but financially I still think it\u2019s important for everyone to remember it\u2019s not a big impact. Paul Morgan : I mean I think I heard you right where you said that it looked like the same-store could move higher in the fourth quarter. I mean is some of that also just the comps getting marginally easier in some of the subsectors or some of these specific issues, could you just give me color sort of kind of what would be the driver of moving higher? Scott Brinker : Yes, the comps really get easier next year, 4Q is still a pretty difficult comp for us. So we\u2019re not giving specific guidance for 4Q but from what we see today we feel like the US in particular will continue to be strong. It\u2019s grown in the high 4% range year-to-date and it looks like it could be in that range in 4Q as well. Paul Morgan : And then I mean you commented on your focus on kind of the structural changes in the post-acute reimbursement setting and there has been kind of a lot of angst in the industry I guess over the past few months about the Medicare\u2019s joint replacement program and the implementation next year and the potential profitability for SNFs in the postacute space. How do you think of that as a risk factor sort of in the near-term and everything you do about in terms of your appetite for development or investment in that segment? Scott Brinker : It\u2019s just a reason to be even more discipline about which properties we acquire or develop, which markets, which operator. It's definitely a business that\u2019s going to have some challenges. I think there are a lot of obsolete buildings that will be taken out of service. Tom DeRosa : And it\u2019s why we don't own a lot of SNFs. Our capital is being invested in state-of-the-art postacute, we\u2019re not going after portfolios of SNFs. We've been selling portfolios of SNFs. So we do think that's an area \u2013 that while cap rates might look attractive for acquisitions, it\u2019s not an asset class that we would feel comfortable owning long term. Scott Brinker : And also underwriting really high payment coverages, so the development that we\u2019re doing generally can be comfortably underwritten to a 2 plus times payment coverage before a management fee. And leaves a lot of cushion for any deterioration in margin and that makes us a lot more comfortable to invest into that sector. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Just on the UK, there is -- at least in the budget, there's a plan to increase minimum wages by 10% next year. Just wondering how much of an issue or specific issue is that for the staff [ph] portfolio there, and if it is, kind of what percent of the employee base do you think could get impacted? Scott Brinker : I will take that, Vik. It\u2019s one of many reasons that we chose to focus on the private pay side of the business in the UK because if you are in the government reimbursement business the rates there are increasing at 1% to 2% at best and if your wages are going up 5%, 10% that's a really challenging situation. And in the private pay business we have a much better shot of increasing rates and pointing to the minimum wage is a reason why. And that is definitely part of the plan and a lot of businesses are proactively raising their wages and increasing their prices because of it. So that\u2019s happening in the UK and again ahead of time, so we\u2019re already seeing some of that because Sunrise and others have been proactive about what they need to do to continue to attract staff but also continue to drive profitability. Tom DeRosa : And remember there's still very limited supply of high-end private senior housing in and around London, which is again where we are focused. So as Scott said, obviously it's always a concern when you\u2019re seeing the government edict for wage increases but I think our operators are very on top of it and prepared. Vikram Malhotra : And so if they do go up say 10% and I'm assuming wage or staffing costs are what 40%, 50% of the operating expenses, then if you have sort of 4%, 5% increase, I am assuming that, that minimum wage doesn\u2019t impact all the staff you have, is there like a proportion that's more and probably they are more kind of not at the ED level but just like what proportion of the staff could get impacted or where we could see price increases? Tom DeRosa : One of the things \u2013 Vik, in the UK what\u2019s different about the model there is that they don't have -- for instance much of the staff are what we would call registered nurse, so they don't have for instance the LPN category which is what you largely would find in the US. So the staffing model is a bit different in the UK. Vikram Malhotra : So it would be a broad-based increases is what you are saying? Scott Brinker : Not necessarily, Vik. I mean very few of the actual employees are being paid at the minimum wage but you do have people like housekeepers, dietary, some of the direct caregivers, maybe they are not at a huge premium to the minimum wage. So if you increase the minimum wage they probably will have some pressure on those positions, just to maintain that parity. But it's not all of the staff. Tom DeRosa : It\u2019s a small percentage actually. We are thinking it somewhere around 10%. Vikram Malhotra : And then just on the pricing model in the UK, there is a sort of a tiered pricing. At least when I was visiting some of your assets, it seemed like there was this tiered pricing where some of the additional services are rolled into one price, and it's maybe four or five tiers. Do you think there's some -- in the US there could be some changes to the pricing model that may impact when we look at the average RevPAR, that may impact that number going forward? Scott Brinker : No, Vik, I wouldn\u2019t say that, each operator does its pricing a little bit differently, whether it's tiers, some closer to an all in rate, and some are very specific about amount of care use to drive their pricing. But each operator has their preference and seems to work for them in their local market. I don't see that changing or driving RevPAR in any material way. Vikram Malhotra : And then just last one, you talked about the potential pricing power, given the markets and the quality of assets that you guys have. But given sort of the broader -- just the challenges we've seen more widespread, have you seen any peers or competitors cutting prices to get occupancy up? Scott Brinker : Not any meaningful trend or change, Vik. There are specific markets that are bit more challenged but where we\u2019ve seen the price discounting tends to be more at the unit level, so particular rooms in a particular building that have been more challenging to lease and people being I think a lot more intelligent and specific about, hey, this is a difficult unit to lease for whatever reason and maybe we do need to make a price adjustment. That\u2019s I\u2019d say more of what we've seen rather than across the board rental concessions. The occupancy drop that we saw was really impacted by the weather not so much supply and demand. So there was really no reason to cut rate to drive back the occupancy. Vikram Malhotra : And just one last quick clarification : The Chartwell options to buy some of the assets, when does that expire? Scott Brinker : It lasts through the life of the joint venture, Vik, where we have certain non-compete rings that you draw around each of our 40 or so joint venture properties and if there's an opportunity inside any of those rings, we work together on it, or at least have the option to work together on it. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : I guess in terms of postacute, I mean this wasn't a big deal, but it looks like during the quarter, you bought something, Genesis, at a 9 cap. You also put some capital to work with the Mainstreet properties at about 7.5 yields going in. Can you talk a little bit about the differences, why one was 7 -- 7.5 like held for 7.5, why it was held at Genesis printed 9, and then just a little bit bigger picture about where you see skilled nursing cap rates? Scott Brinker : Yes, Michael, it\u2019s Scott. A lot of that differential is because when we negotiated the 2011 sale-leaseback with Genesis we secured future rights to do all their new acquisitions and developments in it, included a pricing grid for acquisitions at specific rates of return and increases that are driving I think the higher yield on that acquisition, whereas our arrangement with Mainstreet is again contractual but it\u2019s at a lower cap. So it\u2019s 7.5 for some of them, 7.7% for others and there is a difference in the building itself as well. The Genesis assets are in core markets in New Jersey that we like but they are not brand-new whereas the Mainstreet property I think you\u2019ve seen them a brand-new, 30% of the building is private pay senior housing. And so that drives some of the difference too. Mike Mueller : And then if you're just thinking about, generically, postacute cap rates, I mean where do you put the band today for the different parts of it? Scott Brinker : Postacute is still in the 7.5 range plus or minus and skilled nursing seems to be in the 8.5 plus range. We\u2019re not very active in the second category though. So and probably not the best source of information on that business but that's \u2013 I read the same press release as you do and that seems to be the general market. Mike Mueller : And then going back to Page 10 in the sup, looking at the three-mile ring that you talked about, looks like about 10% of the portfolio has some impact, some new direct supply impact. And can you -- I know you touched on this a little bit before, but just talk about what you are seeing there specifically in terms of occupancy and pricing trends in those markets, if there's any difference from the other markets, where there is not impact, just what you're seeing at this point? Scott Brinker : Michael, it\u2019s Scott again. I will try to respond and we did look at historical results when a new building opened over the past couple of years just to try to see what happened in the past, not that that's necessarily an indication of what will happen going forward. But there were 21 of our same-store properties that over the past few years have had a new competitor open inside the competitive ring and we looked at NOI 12 months before the competitor opened and then 12 months after to see how NOI changed. And in the aggregate occupancy was flat on average and NOI was up more than 4% on average. So were some buildings down? Yes but on average the buildings were remarkably resilient in the face of new competition. So it's another more context that new supply is not necessarily a doomsday scenario, especially if you're in markets that have a lot of affluence density and you have differentiated operations which in a lot of cases we do, I think about Silverado. So in the supplemental we give you some color commentary behind each of the properties that is impacted by new supply. And Silverado shows up on a number of this range, because they have buildings that are impacted by new supply. But the reality is that their operating model is vastly different than what anyone else does and more often than not, a competitor is more like a referral source. So it's more than numbers on a page and it's hard to get that across, we try to provide some color in the supplement to help do that. I guess the takeaway is we do have some new supply, it's less than others, it\u2019s less than the industry and we have a very differentiated platform in terms of which operators we\u2019re doing business with and markets that have a lot of people, lot of job growth, a lot of affluence and they are just -- I think better equipped to deal with new supply. Tom DeRosa : Not so different than other sectors of real estate Mike. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Michael Mont [ph] with Peachtree Advisors. Kevin Tyler : It's Kevin Tyler here. I just wanted to check with you in terms of flu season. What are you hearing currently from operators about the outlook for flu in the US and the UK for next year? I guess we are into it already or at the start of it, but how does it look to be shaping up? Scott Brinker : Kevin, I don't have any indication on that yet unfortunately. Tom DeRosa : I can tell you everybody here in Toledo has had it. And I am the one who hasn\u2019t had it, and I'm trying to stay away from all of them. Kevin Tyler : And then, we spent a lot of time on new supply, appreciate the disclosure, guys. One question to make sure I'm understanding correctly. The analysis excludes properties that have been recently opened, correct? It's only new construction? Scott Brinker : Right, these are projects that are currently under construction, Kevin. Kevin Tyler : And it sounds like you did some of the historical analysis, that was my second question, in terms of seeing how sensitive it would be in the past. But as we look forward, if construction levels head higher, it sounds like, from what you're saying, you don't forecast this changing all that much. Tom DeRosa : Well, we will see, I mean we hope like others that new supply slows down a bit. It\u2019s at a level right now that is a concerning which was lower. I like the markets that we\u2019re in, I like the operators that we've chosen but all things being equal more new supply would not be helpful. Kevin Tyler : And then last question on capital allocation, you've been able to capture some pretty healthy pricing on the sales front. Just wondering if that will continue to be a focus for \u201816, and what's really the right balance for dispositions versus acquisitions as we look forward into next year? Scott Estes : I think it\u2019s maybe a more balanced expectation for both. We had a big year for investments this year and a big year for dispositions. My estimation is we\u2019d probably see a similar ratio, we will make more acquisitions and dispositions but I think the pace on both, it obviously depends on both. So I guess maybe to put more granularity around your disposition amount question, we talked a bit about our Genesis alone, those would be included in the disposition number next year. So excluding those, you probably assume another $300 million to $400 million of dispositions in addition to those and you all know we have a great deal of success on the investment front just focusing on our existing partners that\u2019s averaged $600 million or $700 million per quarter. So those are probably the way I would think about those numbers. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : So, Scott or whomever, you said just a few properties had the effect of driving down same-store by 100 basis points. I don't know that that registers as a risk to me, not a good thing, if it only takes a handful to disrupt the entire group. How would you respond to that? Scott Brinker : That is just as likely to go the other way. Rich Anderson : That\u2019s true, high data type stuff right? Scott Brinker : Yes, which is why we built an overall diversified portfolio. RIDEA is 35% of what we do, so despite the volatility that you're referencing our same-store results for the whole portfolio have been remarkably consistent quarter to quarter. Rich Anderson : And long term, we understand this is a great organization. But in the here and now, to Scott Estes' point, the impact of supply is minimal when you look at the broader story. But I guess it isn't what's happening now, it's where is it going, right? I think the uncertainty is having a lack of visibility of what the bottom is in terms of same-store growth out of your senior housing operating portfolio. We know in 2000-ish or whenever that was, it really nosedived before RIDEA even was a glimmer in NAREIT's eyes. But what do you think about the downside of all this? If we are at 2.7% this quarter, is there a risk it can go negative? Do you have any color at all that you could share on that topic? Tom DeRosa : If we went into a deflationary environment maybe it could go negative and if wages continue to increase in a deflationary environment, that doesn\u2019t make any sense but that\u2019s kind of what I hear from the Fed. So anybody\u2019s guess what might happen, I think as Scott said we have a diversified portfolio. We\u2019re located in the best markets and we have the best operators, that's how you protect yourself from these types of phenomenon and I think that -- so I think we\u2019re well-positioned there Rich. Scott Brinker : Rich, the other thing I\u2019d add is we did share with the rating agencies a couple of years ago. It wasn\u2019t too long ago, six or seven years ago that the world was coming to an end financially. I mean the decline in late \u201908 and \u201809 was pretty devastating and our senior housing portfolio at the property level NOI was remarkably resilient, basically flat and I think about the other real estate sectors that had drastic declines in NOI, occupancy, rental rates, in a lot of ways they are restoring what they lost over the past years rather than actually growing whereas our base stayed absolutely flat during what was really a remarkable downturn in the financial markets. And it just I think underscores that this is not just a real estate business. Tom DeRosa : The other thing, Rich, you have to keep in mind this is an industry sector, the senior housing industry sector is still largely unknown. It is still a early stage industry. It is just starting to be recognized as a solution to an enormous problem that's coming down the road. So when I look at the past it's hard to say what happened 5, 7 years ago is a good indication of what\u2019s happening in the future, because five or seven years ago was a much smaller industry than it is today and in a way I think you see some new supply coming into the markets, I think that's a good thing because every year more and more people are going to embrace that keeping your 88-year-old mother in her apartment with your wife or a niece as a part-time caregiver is not a solution to keeping her safe and healthy. And that is -- that's why I raised that article that was on the cover of the Times this week because people have to wake up, hospitals need to wake up, everybody needs to wake up that we have a crisis occurring and we offer the best near and long-term solution to manage this problem. So I guess that's why we're less troubled by our same-store sales number this quarter because we\u2019re looking to the future and we believe there is going to be -- there may be ways of absorption that we can anticipate today because there's still such a small level of penetration in our population of this asset class. So I think you got to stay tuned and I think what we're doing as a company is making sure we have \u2013 we\u2019re in the strongest position, that we have the best access to capital, diversified access to capital, a clean balance sheet to perhaps weather any short-term dislocations and allow us to keep our eye on the big prize of the future. Rich Anderson : Yes, no one is debating the quality of your organization. There's just times for the stock and times not for it. And so that's really the debate. Someone brought up the issue of bundling. Do you have any concerns about how that could impact Genesis's business platform in the next couple of years, should that pivot from being pilot programs to real law? Scott Brinker : Rich, our general view is that there probably will be a few years of challenges with margins declining but taking a longer-term view I think it's going to really shake up the industry and result in the exit of a lot of companies and a lot of buildings. So longer term I think Genesis, companies like it, capture market share and are able to be successful just in a different way, probably at a lower margin in reality but again very successful because they play such an important role in managing the post hospital discharge in these elderly residents. Tom DeRosa : And Rich, I want to leave you with one thing. Given what's happened in our stock since last Friday, I think there's never been a better time to buy our stock, Welltower. Rich Anderson : Last question, and it's really more a statement, but you can respond to it. I think you got halfway there. You have this fortress balance sheet. Kudos to you for the deleveraging that you've done. Now we are faced with potential higher interest rates. Now there are some question marks in the industry, whether it's senior housing supply or bundling in postacute or the risks going on in the hospital sector. Maybe the second part of the strategy should be, you know what? We're going to stop right here, and we're going to protect our portfolio and our balance sheet, and we're not going to continue to push forward with an investment platform in the billions per year. What do you think about that in terms of just acknowledging what's out there? Tom DeRosa : Well I think you\u2019ve seen, if you just look at this quarter, our investment activity was lower than you\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. We have passed on lots of things because we saw cap rates going to levels that just made no sense to us and it\u2019s the whole argument now that everyone's talking about that public market valuations are below the private market valuations. Well we were seeing that, we\u2019re seeing a lot of crazy prices and we\u2019ve stood on the sidelines but I can think of one large opportunity that was taken down and at a very high price and from what we're hearing that transaction unravelled. So because and maybe that's a sign that the bubble might have burst. But I think that look, we are the major player in the sector and I've actually told our operators don\u2019t bring us low cap rate deals because you want us to have a high stock price, you want us to have growth because if we can't raise capital you can't grow your business, so simple as that. So I am going to tell you, Rich, we have been very judicious and we will continue to be. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : First of all, thank you for all the additional disclosure around the senior housing operating platform. As we try to figure all this stuff out, I think information like that, you guys being so responsive, is definitely a move in the right direction. My question is specifically on skilled nursing. Just following up on some of what Rich said, a few weeks ago, saw Genesis stock and some of the other skilled nursing stocks go crazy on this Office of the Inspector General news about them looking very closely at overbilling issues on the therapy side. Just kind of wondering what Genesis at this point thinks about that and how you guys think that could potentially impact the outlook of the company? Tom DeRosa : Are you talking about the billing issues, maybe you could provide a little more on that \u2013 Tayo Okusanya : Yes, this was the news that came out just around NIC, when the Office of the Inspector General was actively calling for CMS to reduce reimbursement rates to skilled nursing, because they felt or they were concerned there were overbilling issues, especially as it pertained to therapy, over the past few years. Scott Brinker : Tayo, I didn\u2019t see this specific article, that\u2019s certainly a conversation that has been ongoing for years. I don\u2019t think anyone believes that the current reimbursement system across the board is a good one, whether it\u2019s skilled nursing, hospitals, LTACs or inpatient rehab and you're going to see a significantly different payment system as you look forward that's based on value, not services provided. And we think that's a great thing and that includes companies like Genesis in particular that are low-cost option and help save the system money. So they live within the current reimbursement rules today and I think you\u2019ve seen a very good track record of performance within the rules for Genesis. Tom DeRosa : And other than that, we can\u2019t say anything because they haven\u2019t reported. Tayo Okusanya : But do you see any risk around us given we're still working within the confines of the current system that we go through what we went through in 2011, where CMS has a big knee-jerk reaction and just makes a big cut to reimbursement? Scott Brinker : Tayo, I tried to refer to it but maybe to indirectly in the prior response. We\u2019re less focused on the reimbursement rate risk. I don't see that happening but there is a lot of risk in that the system is changing in a very significant way. And we do think that a lot of buildings and operators are going to have a real challenge as we look out 5 to 10 years in that business. So our overall view is that the marketplace is underestimating the risk profile in that business but also not giving enough credit to the higher-quality scale providers like Genesis because I think over time they will survive and they will capture market share. Tayo Okusanya : Okay, that's fair. You've made some very pointed comments about the UK. Could you talk a little bit about Canada and what you're seeing out there at this point? Scott Brinker : Yes, be happy to. So Canada is 15% of our operating portfolio, it's a different portfolio in that it's very much independent living and senior housing, so very little healthcare provided. But what's consistent common theme is that we\u2019re focused on the big markets. So a huge percentage of the NOI comes from Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, markets that you want to be in long term because of population density, affluence, job growth but it's a lower \u2013 I\u2019d say lower risk, lower growth portfolio. So residents tend to stay for much longer than you would find in the senior housing business in the US or UK just because they're moving it at a young age and they have a lot fewer health issues. So much lower turnover, therefore higher occupancy and much higher operating margins because a lot of these buildings look more like an apartment building for seniors than they do a high acuity assisted-living facility.  Now the challenge we\u2019ve had in Canada is that inflation is really low the past few years. So the GDP, CPI are hovering around zero to 1% to 2% and as a result our business has been in that 2% to 3% range for the past few years, now it bounces around a little bit quarter to quarter but we\u2019ve generally been a bit slower in Canada just because that marketplace overall has had very low growth and low-inflation. End of Q& A Operator : And at this time there are no further questions. I will turn the conference call over to Tom DeRosa for closing remarks. Tom DeRosa : Thanks very much, Holly and we will sign off now. Operator : Thank you for participating on today\u2019s Welltower third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Colia, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Colia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Welltower\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at welltower.com. We are holding a live webcast of today\u2019s call, which may be accessed through the company\u2019s website. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Tom DeRosa. Tom? Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Jeff. I'm pleased that we finished 2015 with our strongest quarterly performance of the year. These results are driven by solid fundamentals, a disciplined investment thesis and the unique operating platform that we have developed and employed at Welltower over many years. Today I want to highlight three topics that are top of mind; capital allocation, Genesis and seniors housing supply. On to the first topic; capital allocation. This is the most important exercise of any management team and how I spend most of my time. We think about this as a framework for how we maximize shareholder returns. Essentially every public company has five primary ways to deploy capital; acquisitions, investing in the existing business, paying down debt, paying dividends and buying back stock, and four ways to raise capital; internal cash flow, issuing debt, issuing equity and disposing of assets. So, when the equity capital markets were favorable we took full advantage and built the industry leading healthcare real-estate portfolio. For us it was not about winning a pie eating contest but building unmatched, local scale in major metro markets with the best operators in the business. Simply put we've created a real operating platform, not a passive collection of assets in which success is measured only by year one FFO accretion. The good news for our shareholders is we don't take access to the capital markets for granted and we don't gamble with our shareholder capital. Hence we took advantage of the strong equity market to significantly delever our balance sheet. Now in a less than accommodating public capital market we are sitting in an enviable position. We are also proud that in 2015 the Canadian Pension Plan; one of the largest investors in commercial real-estate in the world chose Welltower to be its joint venture partner to make its first investments in healthcare real-estate. Scott Brinker will talk about our most recent venture with CPP as well as our ongoing successful partnership with PSP. Welltower has always seen targeted dispositions as an important component of our capital allocation strategy and 2015 was no exception. We sold less strategic assets such as our last U.S. hospital asset realizing an 11% unlevered IRR. And we took advantage of robust pricing and sold our life science portfolio at a 5% yield realizing an unlevered IRR of 15%. May I remind you that we have sold $4 billion in assets over the last five years for cash and used that cash to buy better quality real-estate and delever the balance sheet. Over the medium-term we still see opportunity for targeted acquisitions to go deeper into markets where we have local scale in our senior housing business and we also see enormous opportunity to grow our outpatient medical business, but only with the best health systems in this country. I talked about our desire to develop relationships with the leading academic medical centers on my very first investor call in May 2014. I told you that this would not happen overnight, as institutions like Johns Hopkins and Cleveland Clinic really don't need our capital. However, increasingly what they do realize they need from Welltower is our expertise in seniors housing, residential Alzheimer's care and read my lips post-acute-care and the connectivity the best-in-class operators that we bring to the table. I'm happy to tell you that these discussions are now starting to bear fruit and for example we now own three facilities with Johns Hopkins, which is the number one rated health system in the United States. So, let's talk about Genesis, I want to make it very clear we believe in Genesis and the value that post-acute operators like Genesis bring to lowering health care costs and improving our comps. The challenges facing the post-acute industry as it transitions to a value-based care system are well known. If you sit with the CEOs of the leading non-profit health systems in the U.S., like we do at Welltower, they realize that they need to connect to this expertise more than ever as they move to the reality of bundled payments. Have you seen the performance of the for-profit acute-care hospital sector lately? After a brief benefit from the HCA that peaked in the second quarter of 2015, the cold reality is that higher co-pays are translating to a drop in hospital visits. This is why Welltower as of year-end 2015 no longer owns acute-care hospitals in the U.S. We believe operating and margin pressures will push acute-care operators to move patients to lower-cost outpatients and post-acute settings. We are optimistic that operators like Genesis that are delivering next-generation post-acute care will become the preferred providers to the top end health systems and have a large inventory of low Q mix SNFs get taken out of service. We understand the market as a voting machine in the short run and the votes are in. While the market has implied a disruption of the majority of the equity value in our investment in Genesis, I can assure you that there is significant value in this relationship and in this investment. Scott Brinker is going to talk more about that in detail. Finally, to the topic of seniors housing supply, you may recall we had a long discussion about this topic on the third quarter call. We continue to believe the fear of supply in the U.S. is overblown. There's no doubt that certain markets are oversupplied, but we are primarily in markets where it is difficult to build and hence believe our performance will be resilient. You can look at the portfolio performance this quarter as evidence of this resiliency. As seniors housing operating occupancy has rebounded sequentially up 80 basis points and same-store NOI was up 4.3% in the U.S. Like most companies in healthcare and I know you're seeing this in the retail sector as well, we're seeing wage pressure in some parts of the U.S., due to increases in the minimum wage and we're seeing it in the U.K., due to the imposition of the national living wage. Increased supply where it has impact will most likely exacerbate that problem. We are working with our operating partners to capture new labor efficiencies and identify opportunities for enhanced pricing power. In conclusion we believe we have a superior portfolio in superior markets, best in class operating and capital partners and a seasoned team to execute across all markets. With the right assets in the right markets we will prove the thesis that healthcare real estate has lower downside and better upside over a cycle. Now I'll turn it over to Scott Brinker. Scott Brinker : Okay, thank you, Tom. We took full advantage of the up cycle, we now have unmatched scale in the markets where you want to own real estate; 77 properties in Southern California, 47 in Greater London and 281 on the eastern seaboard from Boston to D.C. Our history in the business tells us these markets will produce superior results. We're entering a period of increased separation among companies. Our real estate quality will stand out more than ever. Each business segment turned in a strong fourth quarter. The results show that our capital allocation is paying off. The operating portfolio trended higher with 3.3% same store NOI growth, fundamentals are solid, occupancy was up 20 basis points and rates increased 3.2%. Importantly we're not buying the growth, as CapEx remains at very modest levels. The age of our properties is a material competitive advantage. Performance in the U.S. continues to be strong with 4.3% same-store NOI growth. Large metro markets once again outperformed, validating our capital allocation. Same-store NOI in Canada grew 4.6% despite an economy with near zero inflation, highlighting the resiliency of our business. The U.K. portfolio is poised for a rebound this year based on recent revenue trends. Several Wall Street analysts recently ranked our outpatient medical portfolio as number one in asset quality. The impact can be seen in our results. We hit all time highs in occupancy and tenant retention last year, leading to another solid quarter with 3.1% same-store NOI growth. Visibility is the key word here and there are three drivers; one, very little lease rollover; two, when leases do roll we typically renew more than 80% of them; and three, nearly all of our buildings are sponsored by a health system. That's important because they act as a magnet for other tenants. The space leased directly to a health system is climbing and now sits at 60%. We see that number moving even higher as hospitals transition more and more services to outpatient settings. I'll move to Triple Net, a highly visible income stream that contributes half of our earnings. Same-store seniors housing NOI increased 3.3%, while post-acute long term care increased 3.1%. We've been eagerly anticipating a chance to talk about the next topic, which is Genesis. Dramatic underperformance by ManorCare who is not in our portfolio is unfairly implicating Genesis if not an entire industry. Industry headwinds clearly exist but they are not new. In fact we've been preparing for years including selling nearly $1 billion of last generation skilled nursing assets. And rather than focusing exclusively on the short term headwinds we also considered a bigger picture. According to Avalere, a highly regarded research firm, the dramatic increase in the Medicare population will more than offset the decline in length of stay and per capita utilization. As a result the number of skilled nursing Medicare days is expected to increase by more than 10% over the next five years. That data reminds us that skilled nursing plays an important role in cost effective healthcare delivery. There's a reason we haven't suffered any lease rejections or rent reductions like other skilled nursing landlords. One, strong payment coverage. The cash flow from the Genesis properties that we own fully supports the rent payment to Genesis and so to ourselves. Our Genesis properties generate nearly $1.60 of operating income for every $1 of rent. Given the profitability inside the walls of our buildings, the parent guarantee is simply an additional security blanket. And that parent guarantee does have value. Parent company's fixed charge coverage increased last year and Genesis expects further improvement this year to north of 1.3 times. Two we've been actively managing the portfolio since the day we closed the sale leaseback five years ago. That includes selling underperforming buildings, funding new development in acquisitions with strong coverage and facilitating mergers that generate synergies. And three Genesis is a superior operator. Despite the challenging environment our property level Genesis payment coverage is only 1 basis point lower than it was four years ago, 1 basis point. Property level EBITDAR increased a healthy 2.5% per year during that period and remember that we own the legacy Genesis portfolio, which is concentrated in the Mid-Atlantic and New England. These are hands down, their absolute core assets. Final comment here is that we expect Genesis to refinance our mortgage loans with significant pay downs coming this year in line with the business plan. Turning to 4Q investments, we closed $1.5 billion at a 6.8% initial yield. It\u2019s fair to say that 2016 investment volume will look much different than previous years. Capital allocation helped drive our historical outperformance and remains a top priority. Every day we look at the relationship between cap rates and our cost of capital. Discrepancies plus or minus provide an opportunity to create value. We have the luxury of not needing to make any rash decisions but if buyers have an aggressive view of asset value we'll be happy to crystallize value in select properties. By design our investment pipeline is quite limited today and we can fully fund it with operating cash flow and in process asset sales. I want to share color on a new relationship, it's a curb operator called Discovery Senior Living. Last quarter we acquired six high performing independent living communities in Florida that Discovery built and will continue to co-own and manage. The properties are typically 100% full with a waiting list. Significant renovations are nearly complete which will allow Discovery to market the properties at a higher price point generating strong earnings growth. To fund the acquisition we partnered with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board or CPP. This marks their first investment in U.S. seniors housing, again highlighting the confidence in our platform by one of the world's leading investors. The other major acquisition last quarter was with Revera where we parted with PSP a long time and important pension fund partner of ours. The acquisition deepens our large Metro market footprint. Welltower will receive a 6.1% preferred return that grows by 4% per year through 2020. We sold our final U.S. inpatient hospital last quarter. The number of hospital beds has been nearly cut in half in the past few decades. And there are more closures coming. The old physical plans require massive CapEx and even [indiscernible] the buildings are often unprepared for advances in technology. We also see an adverse selection problem. The hospitals looking for sale leasebacks are too often the ones you don't want to do business with. I'll wrap up with our excitement about the current environment. The last down cycle laid the foundation for what Welltower has become. The next few years will be the ideal environment to take another leap forward. Now to Scott Estes. Scott Estes : Thanks, Scott and good morning, everyone. My financial message today echoes the capital allocation team that has been essential to our long-term successes and organization. Calendar 2015 was an important year for HCN and that we positioned the balance sheet for the current period of volatility by opportunistically raising equity in response to the strength of our investment pipeline. 90% of the investment closed in the fourth quarter of 2015 were negotiated during the first half of the year. And while there's always an urge to perfectly time the equity market, we're glad that we chose to pre fund the majority of this activity allowing us to end the year with essentially the same conservative leverage ratios that we started with in 2015. While we're poised to generate another year of solid financial results and dividend growth in 2016, our net asset stellar message and public guidance for the upcoming year reflects our current mindset of remaining both disciplined and opportunistic while protecting our downside. More specifically our ability to utilize dispositions as a source of capital in the current environment should provide multiple benefits. It should allow us to maintain our further reduced leverage. We can enhance our asset quality and try to tame it and we can maintain adequate liquidity and execute our 2016 capital plan within a self funded framework. Given the recent uncertainty surrounding the macro economic backdrop our conservative approach leaves us well positioned to wait out the current storm as we continue to appropriately allocate capital to maximize shareholder value. I'll begin my more detailed remarks with perspective on our fourth quarter financial performance and changes in our supplemental disclosure. As Tom said, we had a great fourth quarter as normalized FFO came in at $1.13 per share and normalized FAD was $0.99 per share representing strong 10% and 9% year-over-year increases, respectively. Results were driven primarily by the solid same-store cash NOI increase averaging 3.1% for the full year and the $3.6 billion of net investments completed over the last 12 months. I note that our FFO and FAD payout ratios for the fourth quarter declined to 73% and 83%, respectively. There were two noteworthy items on our income statement this quarter that I'd like to take a moment to explain. First we incurred $35.6 million in other expenses this quarter, which represented a non-cash charge related to marking the value of our Genesis stockholding the market at yearend. And as a reminder we essentially received our initial $58.5 million in stock for free, as it represented the amount of purchased options for 9.9% of Genesis within the money is the time they went public. Conversely on the positive side of the ledger we realized a gain on the sale of assets of $31.4 million in the quarter, which is largely due to the profitable disposition of our final U.S. acute-care hospital during the period. In terms of dividends, we will pay our 179th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on February 22nd of $0.86 per share. As this new annualized rate of $3.44 per share represents a 4.2% increase over our 2015 dividend level and a current yield of 6.1%. In terms of our supplement this quarter the only notable change is on Page 2 where we did add a table providing detail on the number and dollar value of the individual acquisitions and joint ventures complete each year. Turning next to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. The fourth quarter was an active one in terms of capital raising activity for the company. In October we completed the sale of $500 million of unsecured debt price to yield just under 4.3% through our reopening of our 10 year notes through June 2025. And in November we successfully tapped the Canadian senior note market for the first time in our history, completing the sale of C$300 million of 5 year notes price to yield just over 3.4%. In terms of equity, we issued 1.1 million common shares under our dividend reinvestment program generating $66 million in proceeds and we tapped our ATM program for the first time since 2012 issuing 696,000 shares at an average price of $69.23, raising another $47 million. We also generated $225 million of proceeds through the sale of non strategic assets and loan pay offs and finally we repaid approximately $104 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.9% and assumed to issue $674 million of secured debt at a blended 3.3% rate. So importantly as a result we have over $2 billion of liquidity entering 2016 with only $350 million of line borrowings net of the $361 million in cash on balance sheet and the $124 million of cash receive from CPP's Discovery portfolio buy-in subsequent to year end. Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of 2015 remain in excellent shape. As of December 31st, our net debt to un-depreciated book capitalization was 39.9% and net debt to enterprise value of 32.7%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA stood at 5.6 times, while our adjusted interest in fixed charge coverage for the quarter was strong at 4.3 times and 3.4 times respectively. Our secured debt level remained at only 12% of total assets at quarter end. In light of the recent strength of the U.S. dollar against both the pound sterling and the Canadian dollar I would like to remind you of our hedging strategy entering 2016. We have minimized any material risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. Through a combination of unsecured and property level debt denominated in local currencies and other currency hedges in place, our international investments are approximately 87% hedged from a balance sheet perspective and 83% hedged from an earnings perspective. So as a result the sensitivity of both currencies moving 10% in relation to the U.S. dollar from current levels would impact our earnings either up or down by only $0.01 per share this year. Finally I'll conclude my comments today with an overview of the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. In terms of same-store cash NOI growth we are forecasting blended growth of 2.5% to 3% in 2016, as we continue to project solid predictable internal growth across our portfolio. To further breakdown this forecast by asset type, first for our seniors housing operating portfolio we are projecting growth in the 2% to 3% range as we remain confident in the operating environment and our operator's relative performance. For our seniors housing Triple Net portfolio we anticipate growth of approximately 2.5% to 3%. For our long-term care post acute portfolio we are projecting an increase of approximately 3%. And last for our outpatient medical portfolio we project an increase of approximately 2% to 2.5% driven primarily by annual rate increases, continued strong occupancy, very low turnover and a retention rate of approximately 80%. In terms of our investment expectations there are no acquisitions beyond what we've announced today in our formal guidance. As a result the only acquisitions included in our 2016 guidance are the approximate $163 million of investments through our Mainstreet partnership at an initial cash yield of approximately 7.5%. Our 2016 guidance also includes $419 million of development conversions at a blended projected yield of 8.2%. In terms of dispositions we have included $1 billion of dispositions in our forecast. This is comprised of $178 million of proceeds from assets currently held for sale at a blended yield on sales of 7.2% with the remainder representing loan pay offs and other potential property sales. Although we prefer to avoid any specifics of what we might sell this year, as Tom said earlier, we have a successful history of selling not only non-strategic assets, but also more opportunistic asset sales to lock-in attractive values. My point here is that we have multiple options in our approach to sales this year and believe there are no pools of assets that are off limit as we evaluate asset sales to most efficiently allocate capital. Our capital expenditure forecast this year is $83 million which is comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio with the remaining $28 million coming from our medical facilities portfolio. As Scott mentioned these amounts continue to represent a relatively modest 7% to 8% of anticipated NOI in both asset categories due to our generally more modern portfolio. Our G&A forecast is approximately $160 million to $165 million for 2016, as the majority of growth on a year-over-year basis is due to the annualized 2016 impact of hires and infrastructure investments made during 2015. We remain very comfortable with these spending levels to support the continued growth of the organization. I would also note that we expect first quarter G&A to be slightly higher than the average for the year as it typically includes accelerated expensing of stock based compensation for certain employees and directors. We anticipate incurring income tax expense of approximately $16 million to $18 million in 2016, based on our latest estimation of taxable income that is largely generated by our seniors housing operating portfolio. And finally as a result of all these assumptions we expect to report 2016 FFO in a range of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share and FAD in a range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share both of which represent 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results. So, in conclusion our focus on capital allocation entering 2016 prioritizes enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix, maintaining a strong balance sheet and low leverage and retaining ample liquidity until the broader capital markets environment improves. At this point Tom, I'll turn it back to you for you for your closing remarks. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Scott. I want to leave you with the message that we are confident in our ability to create shareholder value in 2016 and beyond. Let me remind you that when senior housing was in disarray because of lack of capital post financial crisis or because of the oversupply in the early part of the century, our shareholders benefitted tremendously and we grew exponentially by recapitalizing the industry. Today we are in the strongest position we have every been with our leading balance sheet, long-term institutional capital partners, like CPP and PSP, our portfolio of best-in-class operators, significant local scale in top markets and a deep understanding of how all these work together as a real operating platform, not a financially engineered yield portfolio. I cannot be more excited about what lies ahead for Welltower. So, for the Q&A we have a few other folks in the room here. We've got two that are well-known to you, Paul Nungester and Steve Schroeder and two that are new on the Q&A but who I think are well-know to lots of people on the phone, Tim Lordan and Shankh Mitra. So, now Colia, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Josh Raskin of Barclays. Josh Raskin : Good morning and appreciate the time you guys hitting all of the hot topics in the prepared remarks. One, a question about this shop same-store cash NOI the 2% to 3% in 2016 and want to understand sort of what the buildup is there and how you think about that sort of long-term sustainable -- I know you guys have talked about a range, maybe slightly higher than that and obviously you've operated a lot higher than that. And then I guess as part of that I know last quarter you talked about these five facilities in the Northeast that have some flu issues that were a 130 basis point drag, any update on those specifics and I'm assuming the flu is a little bit more helpful now? Jeff Miller : Yes, that's for sure. Less flu and less snow this year in the markets that kind of crushed us last year with snow removal costs and labor costs because of difficulty in getting to and from the facilities. Scott Brinker : Great, so, Josh I'm happy to answer that, Scott Brinker. There're a couple of questions I'll try to remember them one at a time, the first I think was the 2% to 3% growth outlook and how did we get there? And from where we sit today our same-store occupancy is slightly above last year, so that's a good starting point. I've said on a number of occasions that 90% plus of NOI in the seniors housing space can be explained in three variables; occupancy, rate and labor. So I just talked about one of them, occupancy looks good, but we've been conservative in our guidance and assume essentially no change in occupancy through the year just given what's happened in the economy and there's some new supply, now hopefully will be better than that but that's what's within our guidance. And then on rate, we continue to grow in the 3% to 3.5% range and that's generally what we expect in 2016. And the third component is labor, and that's probably the one where, I wouldn't say we're worried but it could be a bit higher this year than it has been recently. A number of states and cities have increases in their minimum wage and certainly the new supply in certain markets does impact the labor pool. So we're expecting compensation expense to be a bit higher than rate growth this year in our budget and that's what leads into the 2% to 3% projection for the year. Now longer term what I'd tell you is we projected in the 4% to 5% range when we made our first RIDEA investment more than five years ago, obviously we've done better than that on average. There will be fluctuations, we also probably didn't expect that inflation would be virtually zero. When we made that projection which is where it's at today in a lot of our core markets and yet we're still drilling in the low 3s. So what we feel confident in is that we'll continue to outperform the sector which we've done year after year after year. And that we'll outperform our peers. And that's probably a better way to answer the long term growth outlook Josh. It's so hard to say for sure what the overall economy is going to look like. And the only thing I'd add to that is you have to really look at the markets where our assets are located. These major metro markets are very difficult to bring new supply. You know we're very focused on major metro markets where we already have assets and where we're looking to bring additional supply. And I -- if you look at the aging of the population there's going to be more and more demand and limited options particularly for people who have dementia and Alzheimer's disease. So that's one of the reasons why we're still pretty bullish on at least our portfolio and how it will perform over the long term. Josh Raskin : Got you, that's particularly good. And then just one quick follow up on Genesis and I think the answer to this is no just based on your prepared comments. But will you guys think about sort of joint marketing a few assets or I know you talk about dispositions as part of the strategy, I don't know if it's in that $1 billion but is that something within the relationship that you guys are talking about? Scott Brinker : Yes, we talk a lot about -- we're close with the Genesis management team and also with their financial partner Formation Capital and so we have lots of discussions about how do we best position Genesis and how we best position Welltower. So all options are considered, Josh. Josh Raskin : Okay that's fair. Operator : Your next question's from the line of Ross Nussbaum of UBS. Ross Nussbaum : Hey guys, good morning. Couple of different questions. The first is Genesis related, they obviously reported Q4 numbers back on January 25th. Is -- why are you still reporting the September 30 coverage, is there any hope that we can get that sort of reported up on a real time basis and is there anything you can say anecdotally I guess about how the coverage changed in Q4 based on that result? Scott Brinker : Yes Ross I'm happy to answer that, it's Scott Brinker. So they announced -- pre-announced their corporate just a couple of weeks ago but you will probably remember it was quite limited on what they talked about. And until they announce their full earnings next week we're just unfortunately not in a position to really say much more. It's just we have the data we'd like to talk about it, we can't. Ross Nussbaum : That makes sense. Number two, Scott can you talk a little bit about those loan advances you made in the fourth quarter, you guys lent out a $183 million or as to the full year total up to over a $700 million. Can you talk a little bit about what type of loans were these? Were these construction loans, bridge loans, term financing and then maybe talk about the underwriting? What were the LTVs, interest coverage, can you give us some color on all that? Thanks. Scott Brinker : Be happy to Ross. These are mortgage loans that are very similar to what we did to help them finance the Skilled Health acquisition in early 2015. So when they closed on the portfolio acquisition with Revera in the fourth quarter we provided some short term fully secured mortgage financing to help them accomplish that transaction. Now the long term plan in both cases is that they will bring these properties to HUD, and replace our, I'll call it high cost financing at 8% plus with very high escalators with lower cost in the 4% range HUD financing that's non-recourse and has a 30 year term. So that's what the majority, the vast majority of the loan volume in the fourth quarter represents, Ross, it is just a mortgage loan to help them finance that Revera acquisition and we expect it to be repaid over the next call it 12 months. Ross Nussbaum : Okay, and then last question from me, just based on kind of sources and uses of capital, if I look at the remaining development spend it looks like you've got just a little over, maybe $550 million something for 2016 and '17 to fund in the development side. So if I think about match funding and capital recycling of call it a $1 billion, that just in rough numbers would leave another call it around you can say $400 million that could be deployed toward acquisitions on a leverage controlled basis. Is that a wrong way to be thinking about in rough terms what the acquisition volume would be on leverage neutral basis without returning to the equity markets or increasing dispositions? Scott Estes : I think that's generally right. Ross, Scott Estes. We do have a -- one thing you didn't mention is we have $400 million of debt maturing in March so the only other item that is contemplated in guidance is that we replace that with prevailing rates. So 10 year to debt for us today is probably in the 4.4% to 4.5% range. But the three pieces for the sources other than that are retained earnings. We obviously get about $300 million from our DRIP and then the $1 billion of dispositions in addition to that. Ross Nussbaum : So you are going to leave the DRIP on? Scott Estes : Yes the DRIP, yes. Not the ATM. Ross Nussbaum : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim of BMO Company Markets. John Kim : Thank you. Good morning. On your joint venture with CPPIB, can you just discuss if there was any discussions on partnering on your existing assets rather the new acquisitions? Tom DeRosa : We have many discussions with CPP. They are a close partner of ours now and so you should assume that, any and all possibilities are discussed with CPP. John Kim : And then what about right of first offers in Florida? Do they have any as far as new acquisitions for you or dispositions? Scott Brinker : Yes. John its Scott Brinker. There are mutual rights of first offer based on defined radii around the properties that we acquired that is limited to independent living buildings since that's what we acquired with them. John Kim : Okay. And then on your $1 billion of disposition guidance can you jut elaborate who the buyers in the market are today and how we should be thinking about cap rates -- those 9% in dispositions in the fourth quarter but as you mentioned 7.2% on assets held for sale so how should we think about cap rates going forward? Tom DeRosa : Well lot of this $1 billion is loan repayments, so the buyer's HUD rather than -- HUD you wouldn't ordinarily think about as buyer. The others that we have in process it's for the most part private equity groups. You have to ask them about the return expectations. I know ours have increased a bit. But I don\u2019t think they spend enough transaction volume, at least in seniors housing to know where cap rates are going. I would say medical office is such a liquid market with a lot of buyers that I don\u2019t think the impact of the public REIT share prices or the non traded REITs no longer raising money has much of an impact in that sector. And we have seen several skilled nursing portfolios very recently transact to cap rates that are really no different than what we have seen for years in that business. Seniors housing is where it slowed down a bit. So I think a lot of people are wondering where cap rates will ultimately head. John Kim : Okay. And then finally on Genesis, I appreciate that they haven\u2019t reported full year results yet, but they did guide to a sequential decline in EBITDAR in the fourth quarter. Can you just elaborate why are feel confident that their headwinds are not the same as ManorCare's given the patterns seems like it's very similar? Scott Brinker : Yes I mean there are a long list of things that are different. Now I know a lot more about Genesis but not to about ManorCare. So I will this time focus my comments on Genesis. But it gets back to the comments, I made in my script, John. They clearly are facing some industry headwinds but those headwinds are not new. Medicare Advantage has been an issue for years and years putting pressure on length of stay and rate and Genesis has stayed ahead by getting out of certain assets, acquiring assets that are better fits for the current environment and actively managing their labor costs, which again is the most significant operating expense. And the other thing I would mention is they have a much lower Medicare mix and that probably has an impact on why they have held out better over the past four years, because a lot of the pressure has been on the Medicare side of the business. And the other distinction I would make is the results at the corporate level. So I talked about property level cash flow being more than adequate to pay the rent but there is also a huge difference in terms of the corporate cash flow which provides a significant security blanket for our rent payment. And they've been able to grow that cash flow through merger synergies and they will grow it going forward through refinancing and probably some asset buybacks. John Kim : Can you just remind us what percentage of the Genesis equity that you own? Scott Brinker : It's just over 4% John. John Kim : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore of Stifel. Chad Vanacore : Good morning, all. So just looking at the shop portfolio occupancy has actually improved for the past couple of quarters. What are you seeing or expecting that you are factoring in to get to your flat occupancy in 2016? Scott Brinker : Chad we like the market position of our buildings in the vast majority of our locations. But I just remember just 12 months, when it seems like the day after we hung up on our fourth quarter earnings call, occupancy started to drop pretty quickly because of the flu. So there's just some things you can't predict and we're taking a conservative approach here. I mentioned earlier that occupancy today in the same-store pool is above last year. So, that implies that we should be in a good position and we continue to see positive trends really in all three countries. Chad Vanacore : All right, so speaking of three countries, I think Scott you might have mentioned that you expect a rebound in the U.K., how should we think about that given your occupancy starting at a much lower level now and how should we think about that growth? Scott Brinker : Yes, it is and it will probably ramp up over the course of the year. When I get back to the comment I made about the three variables that really impact performance; the first is occupancy and there's clearly a rebuilding that was necessary after the flu season last year but we've seen it, across that portfolio occupancy is coming back very strongly. The second variable being rate and we continue to increase rates in the 3% range if not higher this year. The third variable is more challenging and that's labor because of the impact of the living wage which is up 7% throughout the country and even higher in other markets. So, unrelated to anything that Sunrise can control, there's just an external factor that's going to be a headwind on NOI growth this year. Chad Vanacore : All right and then just one last one. So you've done several JVs with capital partners now, can you just talk about your thoughts on what these capital partners are bringing to the table and why don't just go it alone? Tom DeRosa : Well they bring some of the largest pools of capital in the world and Chad we believe that there is going to be an increasing need for senior housing in the major metro markets. And if you think about the cost of building in Midtown Manhattan or Central Washington, D.C. or San Francisco, it's significant and it's important that institutions like CPP now understand the investment thesis for deploying capital to seniors housing. The other piece of this is that we again very much believe is that it's going to take trillions of dollars to rebuild the acute-care hospital system in this country to basically accommodate technology that is with us today or will be developed in the future that will dramatically allow us to lower healthcare costs and improve outcomes. We have a lot of antiquated acute-care hospital infrastructure in this country. So, while I'd like to think we could go it alone and the capital markets will accommodate us to fund every bit of capital need that we will need to build this infrastructure, we aren't -- we're not that big a gambler. So, it's been very important for us to spend time with institutions like PSP and CPPIB and we'll bring others in because I think they understand we're smart and we can provide them opportunities that they cannot find on their own and they will also see interesting opportunities to deploy capital at returns that possibly aren't available in other sectors -- in the traditional sectors of real-estate where they are one of the major owners. Scott Brinker : And Chad the other thing I would mention is they give us a lot of flexibility. Keep in mind that at as a Healthcare REIT we can't own operating companies. At least we can't own more than 35% of them. So Sunrise is an example, we'd love to own the whole thing but we can't. So, this is a company that's worth probably $500 million plus, this is a big profitable company and the question is, if Healthcare REIT Welltower can only own up to 35% of that company who owns the rest? There are very limited people that could write a check that size, private equity is one but frankly generally speaking they don't align with our approach to business. So, PSP acting through Revera owns the balance of Sunrise alongside of us and that's just one example of how we are I think controlling our own destiny, helping shape the future of the industry through these ownership stakes that without a group like PSP we would not be able to do. Tom DeRosa : Scott just said it, we're a long-term investor and these are long-term investors, they're not managing to a 7 year fund return. So we think we are much more aligned with this investor class and I think you'll see more of that from us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra. Vikram Malhotra : Just going back to the RIDEA growth across the different geographies, could you maybe just give us a range of how that 2% to 3% would pan out in the three different regions? Scott Brinker : I will be happy to. The U.S. is 70% of that portfolio and drives the majority of the growth rate so you should expect it to be right in the middle of that range. The U.K. probably a bit higher but backend weighted in the second half of the year and then Canada a bit lower, mostly because of the economy there. Inflation is zero. Vikram Malhotra : And you obviously talked about the expense or the wage pressures in the U.S. -- in parts of the U.S. and then in the U.K. Anything, any similar trends in Canada or pressures in Canada? Scott Brinker : We haven't seen as much in Canada, Vik, probably driven or just by the health of the overall economy there, the labor market is much more reasonable. It's really the U.K. because of the change in the living wage and then particular markets in the U.S. which have a higher minimum wage. Tom DeRosa : And the U.K. has a tight -- particularly around, London has a very tight labor market. There is a demand particularly for people with nursing skills and a lot of that is -- it's complicated because a lot of that demand is being met through nurses that are coming from other countries and you actually get into a whole immigration discussion. So it's quite complicated but that's where a lot of the pressure's been in the U.K. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, and then just, just to understand kind of the methodology we use to kind of to come up with your RIDEA growth numbers and kind of what the impact of supply is? I think some of your peers use sort of a 3% absorption number factored into that equation. Just wondering what you guys use and can maybe just give us a little bit more color on how you -- what sort of industry trends you assume in that model? Scott Brinker : I think the number that you're referring to is in the supplement. So I'll just use the 3 mile radius as an example because we still think that's the most appropriate for our urban locations based on where residents usually come from. We had a more suburban or rural market portfolio I think 5 to 10 miles is more appropriate but for Welltower I think 3 miles really is the best radius to be looking at. So in this quarter's supplement we say that 1.7% of our total NOI is impacted by new supply, okay, and that assumes that all of the NOI from the properties that we own will be impacted 100% by the new supplies. So it's kind of a worst case scenario, meaning if you take all the properties in our portfolio that are impacted by new supply, that 1.7% assumes that NOI at those properties goes to zero, which is obviously not going to happen. In fact our history is that properties in our portfolio that are subject to new supply have actually held up quite well when new supply enters the market and we studied it for years, looked at their performance before and after the new competition enters the market. And on average occupancy is pretty much flat and NOI has been up 4% on average. So it's not the Draconian downside necessarily that people assume. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, that makes sense, and then just last one on Mainstreet, correct me if I'm wrong but I believe when you had announced this in '14 you talked about potentially a $1 billion worth of acquisitions or at least the option to buy them and you baked in if I'm not wrong about a $160 million. Can you just talk about incremental opportunities from over and above that? Tom DeRosa : Yes, there were two different pipelines. There were 17 buildings that we are committed to acquire and now closed on 12 of those, so there're five more to come. And then there were 45 additional properties that had yet to be started and those are starting to roll out and the structure on those is that we provide a small mezzanine loan. Mainstreet puts in lot of equity and then obtains a third party construction loan and when those 45 buildings open, one at a time we have the option to buy each one at a 7.7 cap rate. So it's one building at a time, our option. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vin Chao of Deutsche Bank. Vin Chao : Hey guys. My question's been answered actually, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, good morning. Question on the proposed acquisition mix, I mean I know there's nothing embedded in guidance today, but I'm curious given sort of the dislocation at least in the public markets, related to the ManorCare news if you will. If there's any opportunity to get -- any opportunity in post acute if you'd look to get bigger there, invest incrementally and then maybe any other comments of any other vertical within the portfolio you'd be interested in? Sort of the deploying incremental capital. Tom DeRosa : Not sure I understood. You're saying has there been interest from other parties in our skilled nursing assets either buying them from us or investing helping us fund development of skilled nursing. Jordan Sadler : I'm more interested to know what you want to do with your capital as you look forward, so obviously we saw DSL but I'm curious what you would do in the post acute space? Tom DeRosa : So what we're interested in post acute is investing in the next generation of post acute care. We are not interested in owning lots of low Q mix on nursing assets and we sold lots of them over the years that Scott mentioned, that's been a component of the $4 billion in dispositions we've made. We believe in the post acute sector. We do not think it's going away. And so we will deploy capital into the next generation of post acute of which Genesis is one of the operators that is offering that product through its PowerBack facilities. We think that as a good place to commit capital. We think -- recently just this past Monday we were with Cleveland Clinic and they mentioned that they had just formed a relationship with Select Medical where they are actually in a new suburban setting, where they have an outpatient in a smaller hospital they are actually putting Select Medical post acute bed attached to the hospital that Select Medical will run. So hospitals more than ever need strong post acute operators and so that's where we will deploy capital. We are not looking to acquire skilled nursing beds because the cap rates look attractive. That is not what we do as a company and I think that's a very important differentiating point about Welltower. Scott Estes : I might answer that question Jordan in a little bit of a different way to that of Tom's comment just focused on post acute. But really in a time where capital is more precious we are really focused on our existing partners. You all know that we have a partnership based approach and we have 30 partners that we have been growing with historically. So if you had to think about asset mix, As Tom said, post acute maybe a part of it but I think primarily seniors housing is where we have our largest share of relationships. We are always going to be I think focused in seniors housing area first and foremost. Jordan Sadler : Okay, that's helpful. And then separately on returns in cap rates, Scott Brinker I think I heard you sort of in response to a question mention that you had ratcheted your return expectations higher. I'm curious how much or to what degree what assets classes? Scott Brinker : It's hard to even say what the number would be because we just think at our current stock price there is no reason to do anything. It's ridiculous price to try to raise money at. I don\u2019t think it has any connection with intrinsic value of the company let alone the platform. So we are not really thinking about acquisitions right now. There is a pretty large gap between market expectations for cap rates and what would make sense for us and that means we are going to keep relationships warm. And when that discrepancy flips and at some it will, we will be active again. Jordan Sadler : Is there a difference between sort of that comment regarding the equity and keeping the DRIP on? Scott Brinker : I guess yes. We would say -- I would say, couldn't hurt to look at it. Actually we never turned it and off and fortunately been in a position and if we stated what we would argue is a depressed stock price for a period of time we could do it. So I think it's worth looking at again to the extent we are traded at a lower value for a longer period of time. Really raising only about $50 million-ish or $60 million-ish per quarter in terms of the number of shares that typically come in. Jordan Sadler : Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya. Tayo Okusanya : Good results good to see. Two quick questions. First of all the JV with the Canadian Pension Fund. Just kind of given how some of the -- how large some of the other JVs have been in the U.S., just kind of curious how big do you think that could potentially get or whether this is more just a one-off thing? Tom DeRosa : Tayo, I don\u2019t have that information because they are not a public reporting entity. But you should assume they own some very large -- for instance, central business district metropolitan office buildings. You know what the -- you have better idea of knowing what those are worth than we do. But just assume that they have billions of dollars allocated to top end commercial real estate around the world. Tayo Okusanya : But is the expectation that this JV gets bigger with you over time? Tom DeRosa : As we present them opportunities that meet their investment targets, yes, I would assume that will get bigger over time. Scott Brinker : Part of the relationship goes both ways, think about PSP who owns Revera, they have brought us $2 billion of opportunities over the past four years that are now in our portfolio. So it isn't a one way partnership. Tayo Okusanya : And then the $1 billion of dispositions, any sense timing wise as we try to model that? Should we just go to median convention or spread it evenly throughout the entire four quarters? So just curious because it does make a big difference to the numbers. Scott Estes : It's probably best to spread it evenly throughout the year, Tayo. I mean what's held for sale on our balance sheet is about a $110 million MOB portfolio and a $60 million seniors housing Triple Net portfolio. Scott Brinker mentioned loans is clearly a component of that. Again like using the potential, Genesis refinancing as an example will take time to play out throughout the year. They go through the whole process and then everything else would be opportunistic, so I do think it's probably best to blend it throughout the year. Tayo Okusanya : And then last question is U.K. related. I know Avery is a little bit different because of the amount of residents in most Avery facilities that get assistance from the local authorities is lower than the national average. But just when we think about the U.K. as a whole, this combination of wages going up dramatically, this idea that a lot of the local authorities are trying to lower or not increase payment rates as aggressively as it's been in the past few years. And we think about a lot of care home operators in the U.K. being fairly levered entities. I mean what do you actually think is the ultimate outcome here in the U.K.? Do we go through a round of consolidation or do you kind of somehow think that somehow the other local authorities will be forced to continue with the [custom rate] as is? Scott Brinker : Yes, Tayo, there are really two businesses in the U.K. 95% plus of what exists there are buildings that we wouldn't want to own, because the real estate quality is pretty bad and the payer mix is virtually all government pay and I think that business is in a lot of trouble. That's why we did not invest any capital into that space over the past four years when we so aggressively pursued the high end private pay market. I say that because one, the real-estate quality is low, but two think about the minimum wage impacts when government reimbursement rates are increasing maybe 1% a year and your staffing costs are going up 8% to 10%. That's a tough dynamic to manage through. And I can trust that with the three portfolios that we own in the U.K.; Sunrise, Signature and Avery, all of which have 90% plus private pay. They actually increased rates at pretty substantial percentages this year to offset most of that wage increase and that\u2019s why you really do need to think about two different sectors that are targeting two very different residents. Tom DeRosa : Tayo we offer an alternative to either local authority when it comes to elder care or even on -- in acute-care as you know we own four hospitals in London that are private pay hospitals. So if you think about a network of in London today of over 70 elder care facilities that are private pay that are networked with four private pay acute-care hospitals, that is a formidable entity. Because the fact is you have -- in the U.K. they can't afford to treat their growing elderly population in NHS beds, they just can't do that, and I think that there's going to be an increasing demand for private pay healthcare options as more and more of the population will not get what they want from the government. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll of RBC Capital. Michael Carroll : Scott you indicated in your comments that HCN has been preparing for the changing reimbursement environment for the skilled nursing facilities base over the past few years. Can you quickly highlight what those changes were? Were those just mainly the sale of lower quality assets and retaining some of the higher quality assets, you think that could benefit from these changes? Scott Brinker : Yes, exactly. Michael I talked about Genesis increasing property level NOI by 2.5% per year over the last four years. The assets that we sold would not have held up that well. They had very low coverage, older buildings, really no corporate credit and that's important to understand in the skilled nursing business. Generally speaking there's no corporate credit behind these leases. Although there may not be AAA there's a substantial entity standing behind all these and we're happy to invest more. With Genesis we've been doing that but we've been focused on the modern post-acute properties that often have higher payment coverage as well, so that there's an even bigger cushion. Michael Carroll : Do these modern facilities have a higher percentage of Medicare patients that would see more pressure or do you expect that the modern facilities will be able to capitalize because with a bundle of payments they can capture more of that volume? Scott Brinker : Yes, they'll capture more volume without question. When you think about the healthcare business really transitioning to more of a consumer based industry, where would you rather go given the choice. If you've been in one of their Mainstreet properties or PowerBack, these are very nice properties. In terms of a private room, big rehab space, the amenities, in comparison with a typical 50 year old nursing home, semi-private rooms. Tom DeRosa : The future is what I mentioned with Cleveland Clinic which is in your backyard and/or what we have with Virtua in Voorhees where you have got a PowerBack contiguous to the outpatient and the acute care hospital. That's the future. That's what hospital systems have to embrace that they need to partner with the best in class post acute operators. And Genesis is one of them. Michael Carroll : Okay, and then do you guys know the breakdown of the Medicare mix for Genesis and Mainstreet and if they're being impacted by Medicare Advantage and I guess what of their Medicare mix how much of that is Medicare Advantage? Scott Brinker : Michael in the supplement we give the quality mix for Genesis which would include Medicare, fee-for-service, Medicare Advantage as well as any other private payer, commercial insurance and it's right around 48%, so slightly below half. We don't disclose the specific breakdown among those different payer classes, the rates are generally in the same range. Anyway I can tell you that of their Medicare revenues roughly two-thirds is traditional fee-for-service and the rest is Medicare Advantage and that's pretty consistent with the national average where if you look at all Medicare beneficiaries about two-thirds of them are still in the traditional fee-for-service business and the other third are in the Medicare Advantage business. Michael Carroll : Okay, great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose of Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I just had a quick question on your loan portfolio. Are the -- is the interest on that all cash from the borrowers or is there any kind of pay in kind arrangements for some of that or is it all just cash? Scott Estes : The -- I think it's all cash, the current rate is 8.1% on the blended loan portfolio, Smedes. A very small part is not cash. Smedes Rose : Okay, all right, back to you, you covered the rest of my questions, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Thank you and good morning. Just wanted to get back to post acute. You know it's been said a few times on the call that this is not a new issue and I think we can all agree with that but now the rubber is kind of meeting the road and operators are having to point out the pressure that they're seeing and I would argue that that is not or is a new issue. And so there is a need for post acute of course over the long term but the question is no one really knows what the ultimately landing point of all this is. And you know could there be a significant enough spread versus your rents to their profitability that will ultimately make this okay. So while the temptation is to maybe goose the rent escalators as much as possible. Do you think the end game here ultimately over the long term will be lower rent growth in the industry so that you're partnering correctly with the post acute operator Genesis and others? Just want your comment on what the ultimate end game could be here when you consider the newness of the impacts from these not so new events? Tom DeRosa : That's a tough question Rich. You're asking us to make some predictions which we don\u2019t like to do. It's hard to say. The way I'd answer the question and I would invite anybody in the room here to answer this as well. I mean the way I'd answer it is that you have acute care hospital providers that are going to be under increasing pressure because of bundled payments. They are going to need to align with post acute and seniors housing operators. So I think if you're focused on working -- and also Scott mentioned a word that you don't often hear with respect to healthcare which is called consumerism. As the consumer is forced to have more choices in the future because they're paying more, you're going to -- there's all these phenomenon that to us say if you are aligned with the leading surviving health systems and you have a post acute business that helps them manage in a new reimbursement world more effectively, I think that leads to a good outcome for both the acute care hospital as well as the post acute provider, as well as the consumer. And that is a new way of talking about healthcare. Rich Anderson : Okay, I guess the ultimate question is, you know where does this all end and you're saying right now that you're not expecting anything in the way of rent cuts down the road, no matter how far out you look? Tom DeRosa : I mean it's hard to say. I mean I think that this is a complicated area, there will be bumps in the road. It's very hard to answer that but we feel we're very well positioned. Scott Brinker : Rent cuts are something that we talk about, I mean that think about the facility level payment coverage which again is the cash from the buildings that we own. It's patched up by corporate guarantee, so we feel very comfortable with where we're at from both levels. Rich Anderson : Okay and then the comment was just made about your acute mix with Genesis being below 50% and I remember having this discussion with you guys, about maybe we should be focused more on low acute mix on assets and that concept was kind of pushed aside. Now you were talking more swimmingly about low acute mix asset classes or assets within the post acute world. Do you think that's the next generation of thought process given that all the pressures going on? Scott Brinker : No. And I think there is a huge miss understanding on that point, because the pressure that you are seeing from managed care in the Medicare business will also come from Medicaid. The states are throwing up their hands and giving their entire programs to commercial insurers who will continue to squeeze this business. And to me government funded long-term care is the high cost setting for those residents. We are considered the alternatives. Post acute is the low cost setting for those residents. So you have to think about a market and what it looks like five to 10 years from now, not just what the headlines suggest. So we continue to be a lot more bullish about the sector for post acute than for the long-term residential care, which frankly every state is doing everything they can to keep patients out of long-term care nursing homes. Rich Anderson : Okay, fair enough. Then just a quick turn of the topic, U.K. there was a doctor strike a month or so ago for younger doctors. I don\u2019t remember specifically where that has gone since then, but I'm just curious if you can give any color on that? How much it concerns you, even though it may not have been a direct hit to your business? Tom DeRosa : I don\u2019t think it was something that we focused a lot of attention on because it's been affect us. I guess there are longer term big issues in the U.K. regarding medical professionals I think it affects mostly the National Health Service. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then last question is a little bit of a brainstormer but do you have any concern -- you are partnering with the large pension funds out of Canada. It's a country that is highly dependent on energy. Is there any -- have you given that any thoughts about the longevity of them as partners if we continue to see depressed nature of oil and other commodities? Scott Brinker : Rich, CPP and PSP have been around for decades. They are the -- every day they are receiving millions to billions of dollars which have to be invested in safe assets, so they can pay out these pensions over time. They've been around across many cycles, whether oil was a $100 a gallon or whether it's $20, whatever it's -- we don\u2019t worry about that. They are stable, a institutional partner as you can find in the world. Rich Anderson : I was brainstorming. So appreciate the color. Tom DeRosa : Rich we like it when you brainstorm. We enjoy that. Come see us and you can brainstorm -- come see us since we don\u2019t. We can brainstorm even more. Rich Anderson : Okay, sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford of Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. Karin Ford : Hi. Good morning. Recognizing that you can't speak to your specific coverage in 4Q 2015 ahead of Genesis' earnings report. Can you just talk generally about what you think the direction of the coverages will be for 2016 given your escalators and the ratcheting interest rates on your loans? Scott Estes : Well fortunately we can talk about that because, they talked about it in their press release a couple of weeks ago and the specific comment was that at the corporate level fixed charge coverage is 1.31 times in 2015 and they are projecting 1.35 times in 2016. Karin Ford : Okay, thanks. And then second question is just I want to ask about your 3% to 3.5% assumption for shop rate growth in 2016. Did Sunrise and your other operators push through rate increases on most of their units on Gen-1 and given that you are seeing occupancy perform pretty well here is that what gives you confidence on that assumption? Scott Brinker : Yes. That's a good question Karin, I'm glad you brought it up, because of our shop portfolio roughly half of the properties do increase rents for existing residents on January 1. But the other half do it on the anniversary date of when the resident moved in. So it takes some time to impact revenue and I'll contrast that with wage pressure which increases for everybody on January 1 and that's a main reason why we think the second half of the year probably looks a little bit better than the first half. This year just given those dynamics and when it comes to rates for new residents coming in off of the street we do know what the operators are planning to charge in terms of an increase, but the variable is the timing right, they come in throughout the course of the year so it doesn\u2019t impact revenue on day one. Karin Ford : Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Tyler of Green Street Advisors. Kevin Tyler : Thanks guys. Just a quick one on the Genesis side. I know that there has been some additions for the loan portfolio there. What's the total balance today stand? Is it about $450 million on my math or? Scott Estes : Yes it's $440 million. Kevin Tyler : And then is there anything contractually that obligates them? I get the fact that the loans become more expensive as time goes on, but contractually anything obligating them to pay you back when HUD funds? Scott Estes : Yes. If HUD funds, they clearly have to cash back. I mean we have the first mortgage on their properties, so HUD won't close without taking that back from us and economically they have a strong incentive to cash back. I think the rate escalates by 100 basis points every 90 days and it's at least twice as high as what HUD will charge them. And so the incentives are well aligned here. Kevin Tyler : And then Tom just, kind of building on some of the points earlier related to CPP. In your conversations has there been anything from others, almost like a follow-on effect from others of the likes of CPP that are now potentially interested in more in the medical office, senior housing, healthcare space in general as they see maybe CCP being -- or CPP being one of the first movers? Tom DeRosa : Yes. Good question, Kevin. I think it's early days. I think that clearly these big institutions that have not invested in this sector before are typically more interested in either urban outpatient medical buildings or I would say that would be their prime -- it's easy for them to get their hands around that sector. But I think this announcement that we made today that now again you have another big global institution partnering with us like PSP in the senior housing space, I think raises a flag to others that maybe you should take a look as well. So, I think it's early days, but we are in conversations with a number of them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : So, thinking about new investments, it sounds like new acquisitions are on hold here, but that's -- how are you thinking about RIDEA senior housing investments compared to Triple Net's just given the comparable same-store NOI outlooks that you have over the near term? And then also are you still pursuing new development opportunities considering the yields are higher? Scott Brinker : On the first question, Mike Triple Net versus RIDEA, it's a good question. It becomes a bit more nuanced because most of the Triple Net opportunities that we see recently have been, I'll call them lower quality properties, they're not in our core markets and the payment coverage tends to be quite low without much corporate credit standing behind the lease. And if I can trust that opportunity with a RIDEA Class A investment in Los Angeles or New York, I still prefer the risk reward of RIDEA even though structurally that first Triple Net investment looks more attractive. I think that's -- you need to think about it in a little bit more detailed way. And now if I could get Triple Net coverages at 2 times, that may change my opinion, but for the most part the market today is in the 1.1 payment coverage range which to me they are not really getting as much protection on a Triple Net lease as the structure may imply. Mike Mueller : And then development, once you work your way through this part of the pipeline are you refilling that just given the yields are higher or are you pulling back on that as well? Tom DeRosa : Well, we are very selective when it comes to development and again if you could see us develop -- now you know we are developing in London because there's no -- we have already rolled up the existing supply of high-end private pay elder care in the London market. There's still a demand and that's where we are doing some development. We look very selectively at markets in the U.S. where we know there's no supply or very limited supply of high-end private pay senior housing and that's where we on a very selective basis will allocate capital. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender of Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Just for probably for Scott Estes. You have about $170 million of properties included in the available-for-sale bucket. Just because dispositions seem high this year, what kind of visibility do you have on the remaining portion of assets and what's in that available-for-sale group? Scott Estes : The held for sale is two portfolios, again about $170 million; like I said $110 million of medical office buildings and $60 million senior housing Triple Net portfolio. I would say probably have -- getting us up to our -- from that $170 million up to roughly half of the total disposition number with potential loan payoffs and there's a little bit of variability again largely to timing of Genesis going through the HUD process. And then the rest is really probably the most flexible piece. So, I think we really just want to maintain that flexibility. We have the luxury of time here. We feel good about where our leverage is. But do you have a more specific question, because again we didn't want to identify specific assets. There's a lot of options and where pricing is in certain markets we can be opportunistic and if we can also do some things that you know enhance the quality of the portfolio we would look at those too. Todd Stender : Now that you're going into Florida with the CPP deal, any overlap with your existing footprint down there? Scott Estes : No, we don't have much in Florida actually. It hasn't historically been one of our targeted markets. We just happen to like these assets in particular. These are big campuses that stay virtually full 100% of the time and equally important Discovery as good as we've seen, especially the marketing side of the business and controlling costs. So it\u2019s I think a reminder that our business is driven not by real estate but also by the quality of the operations and that's what we found so attractive about this particular portfolio. Todd Stender : Great, thanks Scott. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question, long call. I just had one. I know you laid out your strategy and rationale for exiting U.S. hospitals and that was very helpful. But would now be possibly a good time to increase exposure to the asset class given operators better understand the ACA impact and hospital value is probably more attractive than before last year's 2Q peak? I'm just trying to understand your strategy to remove exposure to that sector while one of your competitors is selling out now. Tom DeRosa : So this is where we -- this is our -- where we come out on that. The hospitals that we would want to own are not available. You can only buy hospitals that we would today -- that we consider not good long term investments. We believe that much of the hospital supply that exists today in this country will be taken out of service. It will follow the path of many other sectors of real estate that you've seen taken out of service. We got a lot of empty department stores anchoring struggling malls in this country. Remember there was a day that every city in America had its own unique department stores that were part of the social fabric. And those don't exist today because most of them have gone away or they're called Macy's. And you -- I predict that many of these communities that all have numerous acute care hospital systems, in the next 10, 20 years you will see very few and you'll see the big not-for-profit brand names in healthcare. So the Cleveland Clinics, the Mayo Clinics, the Johns Hopkins, start to proliferate into other markets. So I think you can look at a little bit at history and from a real estate perspective to know that a lot of hospital supply that you can buy today is probably going to be -- if you think the cap rates are attractive today just wait a little while because they're going to be more attractive when you\u2019re buying buildings that are being taken out of service. So this is not an area that we will deploy capital. We think that is not the right strategy for our shareholders. Jonathan Hughes : Okay, fair enough, thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Juan Sanabria : Thanks guys for sticking around. Just on Genesis, could you give us any sense of what the coverage would be at the facility level EBITDAR if you excluded the therapy billings? And just on that same point, does Genesis have any ability for whatever reason if they want to sell their therapy business under the master lease, is that permissible as the way it's structured? Scott Brinker : They cannot sell assets without complying with the financial covenants and where they sit today there's no chance that they'd be able to sell an asset that's valuable like the rehab therapy business without our consent. So that's easy, I am not sure I follow your first question though about rehab. Juan Sanabria : Is there a way to strip out the therapy billings, sorry, from EBITDAR coverage, what would it be if you exclude that? Scott Brinker : I'm not even sure what you mean exclude, I'm not sure Juan where you're going with that. The rehab billings, I mean they own their own therapy company. So they charged -- the rehab therapy company charges the facilities for rehab. And that's what's in our number. Juan Sanabria : Other companies may not have that therapy billing so I'm just trying to get an apples to apples comparison. Tom DeRosa : That's because Genesis owns its own therapy company. Juan Sanabria : Fair enough. Just one question a follow up on G&A. What's driving the 10% increase in guidance? And what would you expect that number to grow kind of on a go forward basis? Scott Estes : Sure, Juan we have you know a guidance range that implies about again 10% growth like you said. The majority of it is actually the run rate on existing hires and processes have been put in place in 2015 that's about two-thirds of the growth. And then we have a pretty limited remaining amount call it $5 million to $6 million that's largely what I would call professional services related. So those would include items like consulting, tax, legal, HR. And what I would actually give as an example because we are very focused on lowering our G&A costs. Included in that G&A estimate is about $2 million to $3 million of consulting work we are doing in the tax area. But it's projected to generate savings of $6 million to $7 million on the tax expense line so we actually have a little bit of a shifting that's going on this year where we are incurring a little bit higher G&A. But net we should save the company actually a good bit of money. Juan Sanabria : Can you give any color on what those tax savings may be coming from or look like? Scott Estes : Sure. Yes there is a -- well again like we -- tax expense guidance of $16 million to $18 million did include the benefit of those savings. So that number is lower in our forecast as a result. And in example if something like rehab, pretty complicated number of structures in terms of the sheer number of TRS' in our idea portfolio. So if we can consolidate a 125 TRS' into one that gets a lot more efficiency on which of them are generating income, the efficiency of it, the tax returns and it reduces your overall tax expense. That's one of the projects that we are working on. Juan Sanabria : Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Holly, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Welltower's fourth quarter 2015 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at welltower.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and, from time to time, in the company's filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Tom DeRosa. Tom? Tom DeRosa : Thank you Jeff. Hello this morning I want to talk to about real estate. The power of real estate. What I mean by that, I mean Real estate then locations and markets it cannot be easily duplicated. Real estate that is nimble and adaptive to changing consumer Preferences. Real estate that defies conventional wisdom about supply and retains value across economic cycles. Overtime the lease that class a real estate has reproduced superior and resilient results compare to others that have not followed this strategy. Our quarter is yet another example of the phenomenon that began in 2010. This is my friends is why you own Welltower.The headline number is that our operating story grew by 5.5% in the first quarter. This numbers have not come as a surprise to us, in fact it's totally consistent with the operating same store in a wide growth portfolio over the last five years. Our total portfolio is now around 3.8% and FFO is 9%. All thanks to our business produce good results but we did have a phenomenal quarter in our senior housing for portfolio. While there have been real headwinds from increases in labor costs and other operating expenses our class A real estate was able to pass this along to the consumer in strong rate growth while at the same time increasing occupancy by 60 basis points to 90.7%. Now the last few earnings calls we told you that we remain bullish about the senior housing business and continue to believe that that's the spike pocket of oversupply in the industry. Our portfolio once valued entry markets from operators in the modern assets will continue to create tremendous value from shareholders by generating attractive growth with minimal CapEx. We see the market taking the data on new supply and applying it broadly across the entire senior market. We think that is a mistake and our performance supports that. We had a long conversation about our strategy around Post skewed and Genesis last quarter. Despite short-term challenges we continue to believe in looking beyond headlines and understand how the skilled nursing industry fits in the continuum of care. I am very pleased by the fact the CNF's recommended at 2.8% rate growth last week. You the biggest Medicare increase in seven years. And I think this supports our thesis. May I remind you that our Genesis portfolio is currently traded in high density east coast markets with significant form of profitability? Our last call we also discussed in length our capital allocation framework. Our sustained relative outperformance in the same store in a wide growth is a product of the strategy as well as smart and highly targeted investment discipline. Capital allocation is not about when to buy and what not to buy. You may have heard about the acquisition of the site on the corner of 56 Street and Lexington Avenue in New York City that together with Heinz we will build the Welltower, a State-of-the-art largely dementia Alzheimer care facility. The supply of residential care options for the growing elderly population in Manhattan is at best pathetic. For a population of over 1 million people there are only 70 marginal care facilities in Manhattan and I can tell you that they are marginal quality because we used to own them. So well tower will be an anchor for in affluent Challenge population has been forced to live in the shadows. The Welltower Will make them part of the larger community which includes billionaires row one block away. Now we are limited by nondisclosure agreement in what I can share with you today we hope to give you more color in the coming months. But what I can tell you is that we didn't sacrifice our return expectations and underwriting criteria to be In Manhattan. Frankly I cannot think for more class A Real estate opportunity. What that I'm going to turn the call over to Scott Brinker. Scott Brinker : Okay. Thank you, Tom. A common question from investors the past few years was what would happen when the cycle turned. The answer today is very positive. Today's more challenging environment is highlighting that not all properties are the same, not all markets are the same and not all operators are the same. Our portfolio outperformed in the upcycle and today we have seen that continued. Each segment turned in a strong quarter with same stories above guidance. That being said, I wasn't to repeat something we said in the past. We don't over emphasize any one quarter good or bad. We think about results overtime, to reduce the noise that can occur over 90 day increments. I will start with the operating portfolio where top line fundamentals were incredibly strong. We increased rates 4.2% out sacrificing instances as occupancy increased 60 basis points. The result was 5.5% same store NY growth. CapEx remains modest levels, the age of our properties is a material advantage. It allows us to generate superior economic growth while retaining earnings to fund new investments. Here's some color on each country. Performance in the U.S was outstanding. Same story in the wide growth 5.1%. This is not a case of easy coms as we reported 5.2% growth in Q1 2015. Not to mention, an 8% in the first quarter of 2012, 2013 and 2014. An important takeaway is that our core markets extended their long track record of outperformance. It will continue to prioritize these markets with our capital allocation. Turning to Canada, our two partners Riviera and Hartwell delivered strong results despite a sluggish economy. Same-store NOI grew 7.2% last quarter, revenue increased nearly 5% while expense growth was in the mid 3%. It's reminded that seniors housing isn't perfectly correlated with the broader economy. The UK bounced back with 6.1%, same store NOI growth. We're seeing very strong demand for our properties. Revenue grew by more than 5% while expenses increased in the high 4%. By design we're a private pay high-end business in the UK. This gives us the ability to better offset cost pressures like the increased minimum wage. It's equally true in the U.S. Next, I want to share an observation on a broader topic. Seniors housing is a private-paid business, the laws of supply and demand apply. That's why we chose to concentrate markets with the ability and willingness to pay. This also happen in the markets which are more difficult to bring new supply. We know that location impacts performance because we've been tracking the data inside our portfolio for years. Our data is very powerful in a sector where the window in the industry level performance is limited to asking grants in occupancy. As result, seniors housing remained an inefficient market. Cap rates hardly vary at all based on location. We think that will change as operating data in the industry becomes more transparent. When that happens, our unmatched scale in premier markets will be highly valuable. Turning to outpatient medical. We extended our track record of consistent results with 2.6%, same store NOI growth. We have excellent long-term visibility into this earning stream driven by low rollover in our history of renewing the vast majority of maturing leases. Next up is the triple net portfolio. Quarter after quarter including Q1, the blended growth rate in this segment is in the 3% range. The lease structure gives us consistent and growing rental income not withstanding any volatility in the underlying operations. That's especially true of skilled nursing - a business that's long been subject to cycles. Public sentiment is even more volatile than the underlying business and right now, the pendulum has clearly swung toward the negative. I'll contrast to this volatility with skilled nursing valuations in the private market which have been remarkably consistent over time. If there's a prolong disconnect between public and private valuations, we may look to take advantage through selected asset sales. Moving to investments. Our activity in Q1 was intentionally low given the environment. We funded $350 million at a 7.7% initial cash yield. As usual, these were done in private negotiations - not auctions - which helps explain the healthy yield. We expanded relationships with leading health systems like Essentia and Adventist and we grew with core partners including Sunrise, Silverado and Signature. Each investment builds on what makes Welltower unique : premier markets, leading operators and modern buildings. Our stock has come back a bit since our last earnings call, but this still feels like a time to be highly, highly selective with new investments. Our strong balance sheet and unmatched relationships allows to be flexible if conditions change. As expected, we had $160 million of loan pay offs last quarter including $68 million of Genesis mortgage loans. We'll receive continued repayments from Genesis throughout the year. The bridge to HUD business plan is working as planned, we'll benefit Genesis cash flow and enhance the credit that stands behind our master lease. Now here's Scott Estes. Scott Estes : Thank you, Scott and good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start to the year with strong quarterly earnings growth and an increase in our same store NOI forecast reflecting our confidence in the continued strength of our portfolio. While significant stock market volatility occurred during the first quarter, we remain highly focused on capital allocations. Our current earnings guidance continues to assume that we remain net sellers of assets for the full year. We were also able to enhance our liquidity position during the quarter by opportunistically raising $700 million of 10-year unsecured debt. Importantly, we were able to raise this debt in an overall leverage neutral manner through offsetting debt payoffs and a small amount of equity rate through our DRIP and ATM programs. As a result, we had no senior debt maturing until September of 2017 and have only $398 million of secured debt maturing over the remainder of the year. With other $2 billion of current liquidity and a continued focus on capital allocations, our strong financial position allows us to remain both disciplined and opportunistic in regard to any incremental investments, dispositions and capital raises throughout the remainder of the year. I'll again begin my detailed remarks with perspective on our first quarter financial performance and a minor change we made to our supplement this quarter. We started off the year with strong quarter-over-quarter earnings comparisons generating normalized FFO of $1.13 per share of 9% versus last year and normalized that of $1.01 per share increasing 10% versus last year. Results were driven primarily by our same store cash NOI growth and the $1.8 billion of net investments completed over the last four quarters. I'll comment briefly on several of the more noteworthy income statement items this quarter. First our G&A came in at $46 million for the first quarter. This was in-line with our expectations as the first quarter is typically our highest of the year due to the timing of expensing stock compensation grants for certain employees and directors. After a detailed review of our cost this year, we now expect to come in toward the low end of our initial guidance range of $160-$165 million for the full year. We recognized impairments of slightly over $14 million in the first quarter. These impairments were a result of slight reductions in the carrying value to relatively small seniors housing portfolios currently held for sale which are now expected to be sold for roughly $167 million in the aggregate. And last we recognize the tax benefit of $1.7 million in the first quarter. Taxes came in slightly below our expectations for the quarter as a result of both tax planning initiatives and several revisions to our TRS taxable income forecast. Based on these revised expectations, we now anticipate incurring quarterly tax expense of approximately $1-$2 million per quarter for the remaining three quarters of the year. In terms of dividends, we'll pay our 180th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on May 28th of $0.86 per share, rate of $3.44 annually. This represents a 4.2% increase over the dividends paid last year and represents a current dividend yield of 4.9%. In terms of our supplement, we made only one relatively minor adjustment this quarter as we moved our UK-based private pay outpatient facilities from our hospital category to our outpatient medical category. This was done to reflect the fact that the vast majority of revenue comes from outpatient care and elective short-phase surgeries just like our outpatient surgical facilities in the U.S. I'll turn now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet. I think the highlight of our first quarter capital markets activity was the unsecured debt offering which closed on March 1. We completed the sale of $700 million of 10-year's senior unsecured notes, priced to yield just over 4.3%. We took advantage of strong investor demands to upsize the transaction from the originally announced size of $400 million. This offering helped extend our way to the average senior note maturity to 9.2 years and as a reminder, this debt offering was not included in our initial earnings guidance for 2016. In terms of equity, we issued over a million shares through our DRIP and ATM programs this quarter raising $93 million in proceeds. As Scott mentioned, we generated $116 million of proceeds through loan pay offs which included the $68 million in Genesis mortgage loans repaid during the quarter. In term of debt repayments, we repaid all $400 million of the five-year three and five-eight senior unsecured debt that matured on March 15, 2016. And last, we've repaid approximately $130 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.5% while refinancing $75 million of secured debt at a blended 3.1% rate. As a result, we continue to have significant liquidity with over $2.2 billion available at quarter end, with only $645 million of line borrowings and $356 million in cash on balance sheet. Our balance sheet of financial metrics at the end of the first quarter remains strong. As of March 31, our net debts-to-undepreciated book capitalization of 39.6% was consistent with last quarter, while our net debt to enterprise value improved 40 basis points to 32.3%. Out net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA sit at 5.7 times, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter remains solid at 4.1 times and 3.2 times respectively. Our secured debt level remained at only 12.1% of total assets at quarter end. We were pleased to receive an affirmation of our BBB+ ratings from Fitch last week, and as a reminder we sit at BAA2 BBB flat ratings with positive outlooks from both Moody's and S&P. I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. First, in terms of same store cash NOI growth. Based on our strong first quarter result across our entire portfolio, we're comfortable raising our same store cash NOI guidance for the full year by 25 basis points to 2.75% to 3.25%. Where same strength across virtually all of our respective portfolio components, and as Scott mentioned I think it's appropriate to remained focus on the blended forecast for our entire portfolio for the full year. In terms of our investment [ph] expectations, the only acquisitions in our forecast beyond those closed in the first quarter are an additional $98 million of investments expected through our Mainstreet partnership at an initial cash yield of 7.5%. In terms of development, we expect to fund an additional $363 million on projects currently under construction and expect $283 million of additional development conversions at a blended projected yield of 7.9%. Moving to dispositions. We continue to include a total of $1 billion in our forecast. This is comprised of the $116 million of loan payoff during the first quarter. Our current projection of $303 million in proceeds from properties currently held for sale at a blended yield bond sale of 6.5%, with the remainder representing loan payoffs and the other potential property sales over the rest of the year. Our capital expenditure forecast remains $83 million for 2016 which is comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the seniors housing operating portfolio with the remaining $28 million coming from our outpatients' medical portfolio. We typically see a lower CapEx spending during the first quarter, so we do expect the remaining CapEx will be higher during the last three quarters of the year. As previously mentioned, our G&A forecast is tracking around $160 million for the full year of this point, and as I also discussed earlier our tax expenses are likely to be about $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the remaining three quarters of the year. So finally as a result of these assumptions, we're maintaining our FFO guidance of $4.50 to $4.60 per diluted share and FAD guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represent 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results. I think it's important to note that our decision to maintain both our FFO and FAD guidance ranges today was related to the fact that our $700 million bond offering was not in our original forecast, and that the results are still considerable variability around the timing of the approximate $900 million of dispositions that have yet to occur. Most importantly, we continue to focus on making prudent capital allocations decision to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain significant liquidity in the current environment. So in conclusion our continued focus on capital allocation this year will continue to prioritize enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix, maintaining a strong balance sheet and low leverage and retaining ample liquidity and greater stability in the broader capital markets environment. So at that point, I'll turn it back to Tom for some closing comments. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Scott. So as you've heard we're quite pleased with Q1 results. It's all about the real estate and how we are driving better performance and value from our industry-leading healthcare real estate platform. Our optimism and our ability to sustain this performance is reflected in our decision to raise our 2016 guidance for same store NOI growth to 2.75% to 3.25%. And with that I'd like to ask Holly to open up the lines so we can take your questions about rack audits. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Paul Morgan with Canaccord. Paul Morgan : Hi, good morning. Tom DeRosa : Good morning. Paul Morgan : Can you talk a little bit about kind of what came in above your expectations in the quarter and in terms of the idea portfolio and, I mean, you talked about kind of being able to pass through the kind of the labor cost you've been talking about in the past few quarters and, I mean, is there anything sort of at the market level that gave you the confidence kind of early in the year to boost the guidance or any color there? Tom DeRosa : Well we all have something to say about this, but I would say again, not to be the dead horse, it's about having the best located senior housing assets in their markets with the quality operators. So there is demand to be in these buildings and as the operators are sustaining real increases in expenses largely due to labor, they can pass it along because there is demand to be in those buildings. I think it's that one of the simple, probably the most simple answer I can give you. Scott, any other thing you want to say? Scott Estes : Yes, Paul on the out performance, really three drivers of the business, operating expenses and those were up in the low to mid force, sort of where we expected and the other two drivers are occupancy and rate, and we out performed them, so we were expecting occupancy to be roughly flat to up slightly for the year instead we're up 60 basis points and rate growth at 4.2% was quite a bit above where we were projecting. Paul Morgan : I mean is there kind of color, you said it's not really kind of a regional thing or in terms of kind of maybe the parts of your portfolio that are exposed to supply kind of hang in there better or kind of more than just sort of a macro perspective? Scott Estes : The color is that the majority of our portfolio is located in, at least in the U.S. in six core markets, and those markets continue to outperform by a very meaningful factor. So from quarter to quarter it might be two times, it might be five times which was what we saw in the first quarter and those are the markets that we've prioritized for years and we'll continue to prioritize. So that doesn't mean you'll see SP 100% concentrated in six U.S. markets, we like some level of diversification. But frankly, we just see much better supply demand over long periods of time in these core markets, and we've established partnerships with the operators that essentially control the markets. So a company like Sunrise that has 30 plus buildings in Southern California, that's tough to replicate when it takes four to five years to see approvals to build a new project. So we're very selective going back years and who we chose to do business with and which markets they had a concentration. You're seeing the benefit of the discipline we have had just fell out of those marginal markets over time. I mean that is paying dividend today. You know for a rate that's a difficult thing to do. But our shareholders have been on that ride with us now for a number of years. We've sold a lot of assets, we've acquired a lot of assets, and it's all about having the data and the discipline to allocate capital into the best markets and de-emphasize the markets that just will not perform over time. That's what we do. To get one of the keys to this company's strategy and its success. Tom DeRosa : And one final point I think it's important to add to in your question was I guess largely based on seniors housing, but I think it's important to note that out performance this quarter was beyond just the seniors housing portfolio at least in relation to our initial guidance. And our MOB performance was above our initial guidance for the full year, as well as the post same-store NOI. So we saw it really across the board this quarter. Paul Morgan : So you think that's sort of equal contributors to the boost in the guidance? Tom DeRosa : We're not quantifying it in particular, and we think about it as the whole portfolio for the whole year. Paul Morgan : Okay, great. Thanks. Tom DeRosa : Thanks. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Good morning, thank you. I had a couple of questions on your same store numbers on Page 29 of your supplemental. Are the Canadian and U.K. figures on a constant currency basis? Tom DeRosa : Yes. John Kim : So when I look at the same store NOI per unit in Pounds in the U.K. it was 21,000 per unit this year, last year at this time it was about 27,000 per unit. So it's a bit decline on the per unit basis but you had a 6% increase in the same store NOI in the region. I know some of these is probably mixed, but I just wanted to know why that bit of discrepancy. Scott Brinker : Yes, John, it's Scott Brinker. We did a big acquisition in August of 2014 called Critiswa [ph] and those are a very nice private-pay properties, but at a much lower price point than the Legacy-Sunrise portfolio that comprised the prior year's numbers. So that's what you're seeing. John Kim : Okay. Do you know what the same store per unit was if you're like at a comparable basis this year versus last year? Scott Brinker : Can you repeat the question? I'm not sure what you're asking is, John. John Kim : Just the same store pool from last year to this year on a per unit basis. I could follow up later. Scott Brinker : Yes. Are you asking about NOI unit? John Kim : Yes. Scott Brinker : Yes, we might just follow up with you. I don't have that handy. Scott Estes : Yes and U.S. dollars is going to be impacted by the changing currency rates from then to now, too. So let us follow up with you later. John Kim : Sure, no problem. And Scott Estes, I just had a question on your balance sheet. There's a fairly large receivable balance this quarter of $693 million? What is this in relation to? Scott Estes : That number has actually been pretty consistent over time. It has, boy, there's lot of different items in there - value of derivatives, receivables, intangibles are all in there and it's actually been in that $600-$700 million area pretty consistently for the last couple of years. John Kim : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Scott Estes : Yes. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Chad Vanacore : Hey, good morning, all. Scott Estes : Hey, Chad. Scott Brinker : Hello. Chad Vanacore : Okay. Just a thing about your shop portfolio, can you actually go into the buildup of that? I've seen you're 2% in a quarter to 3% in a quarter percent right now for the full year? That's going to be on rate to assuming not much occupancy changed? Are you assuming some occupancy decline as well? Scott Brinker : Chad, it's Scott Brinker. We're not really changing the guidance that we gave for the data portfolio. We've increased the company's overall same store growth projection for the year and that's of course driven in part by the out-performance on the operating portfolio that we're trying to keep people away from being overly focused on every single segment quarter-to-quarter. This is a portfolio and it out-performed in the first quarter and that's why we raised the guidance. Your question is do we still get about the operating portfolio at the end of the day? The answer is yes, we have much better revenue growth driven by occupancy and rate and we were expecting the beginning of the year. We don't see that changing overnight, but we also don't see a need to continue to update every quarter what the guidance is going to be. Chad Vanacore : All right, Scott. I would have expected a leap year expenses to eat in the shop margins a bit. How should we think about that OpEx growth in second quarter compared to the first quarter? Scott Brinker : Yes, it did increase operating expenses. Compensation in particular because a lot of the employees are hourly. So our rough guess is the compensation was up about 100 basis points more than it otherwise would have been because of the extra day. That being said, some of our operators charge by the day rather than by the month, so we do get some benefit on revenue. Chad Vanacore : All right. Then you had some commentary on the bridge loan genesis. Could you remind me how much was repaid and how much remains outstanding? Scott Brinker : Sure. We have two only secured first mortgage loans with Genesis that they used to complete two mergers last year. In total, they had about $500 million of original principal balance and they've now repaid roughly $120 million. So the balance today is around $370 to $380 million. Chad Vanacore : All right. And then just staying with Genesis for a second. It looks like coverage just improved marginally, although if I recall, Genesis had a weak fourth quarter. What do you suppose is driving that sequential improvement? Scott Brinker : Well, remember we report first of all in a trailing 12-month basis, but also one quarter in arrears. Chad Vanacore : That's what we're talking about, fourth quarter\u2026 Scott Brinker : Yes, exactly. So they had a week, fourth quarter of 2014 as well and at least some of the issues that they referred to in their fourth quarter earnings release did not impact our portfolio like all the bad debt adjustments they booked for skilled health. That doesn't impact us and reality is we own the best assets and I think we're maybe at least bit less impacted by some of the head winds that they're feeling elsewhere, but there's no question that the operating environment is a bit challenging. So I wouldn't be surprised if coverage was under at least a bit of pressure over the next couple of quarters. Chad Vanacore : All right. That would be it for me for now. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Kevin Tyler with Green Street Advisors. Kevin Tyler : Good morning, guys. Scott Brinker : Kev? Kevin Tyler : Scott, you've mentioned earlier that senior housing cap rates has been consistent or roughly the same for high and low barrier markets. But are you seeing them up more broadly and then is there maybe a little bit of a faster creep higher in the lower barrier versus the higher barrier markets? Scott Brinker : Hey, Kevin. We haven't really seen senior housing cap rates move at all. It feels like it has been almost a year now where a lot of buyers including us have been trying to push for higher cap rates. But for the most part, especially in auctions without much success and at least the packages we see, the sellers and the brokers don't seem to reduce their expectations if they're trying to sell product that's outside of our core market. So you've not seen us prioritize or allocate our capital for those types of investments because we just don't feel like historically or even today you really get the yield premium that you should to make an investment in those markets. Kevin Tyler : Okay. That makes sense. And then maybe to follow on that point on the disposition side. It certainly seems like senior housing be a good place of cap rates of health firms to potentially take some chips off the table. But outside of that, I know there are some debt repayment that's coming through, but where do you see the best value today on the sale side? Scott Brinker : It's probably in skilled nursing. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that despite sometimes wild volatility in the public market, private market valuations and skilled nursing have been remarkably consistent. I've been doing this for 15 years now and it feels like cap rates and the skilled nursing space have hardly moved at all. Maybe inside of a 50-basis point ban plus or minus year, after year, after year, notwithstanding what's happening with investment environment, or publicly traded stocks and today, skilled nursing is only 15% or so of that overall company, so it's hard to say how much it impacts our stock price, but based on the number of questions we get about it, I would say it's a very big and very large negative impact and yet, we see transactions in the private marketplace including very recently at prices that are quite attractive. Really no different than a year ago or two years ago when the public markets loved skilled nursing. I could see a stake in advantage of that if these conditions persist. Tom DeRosa : They're more inbound calls regarding our interest in selling skilled nursing today than in seniors housing. I think there are a lot of investors out there in the private markets as Scott has said that are seeing the headlines, seeing how some of the misinformation that has been put out there has created some tremendous volatility and they're looking to take advantage of that, or at least it has raised the idea of buying skilled nursing to a higher position in the queue for how they might deploy capitals. So it's an interesting time, a bit of a paradox about how the public market is viewing the sector and how the private market is viewing it. Scott Brinker : Kevin, I agree on senior housing as well. Two of the assets that are in the health for sale bucket are in very much secondary, if not, rural markets and if the sales proceed as planned, we'll be selling those for less than a six cap on rent. We do still feel like this is maybe a good time to exit some non-core senior housing assets as well and the same applies to medical office where we've got about $100 million of assets held for sale on the balance sheet today. Again, at least in our mind very attractive cap rates, relative to markets and asset quality. Kevin Tyler : Okay. I appreciate the thorough color you got. It's helpful. And then last quick one for me - on the development side, definitely interesting project in New York and looking forward hearing more there, it sounds like there is not a whole lot you can share. But looking for a second at development at senior housing in the UK and I know it dates largely back to some prior arrangements, but as those properties get delivered, how are they performing? Are yields consistent with prior underwriting and for the newly purpose-built product there, is that performing well in today's market? Scott Brinker : Yes, Kevin. There are really three buckets : we have Triple Net leases with Avery who's now one of our Top 10 operators and they've thought out-performed expectations on everything they've done whether it's the acquisitions or all the new development we funded. We've also got a large development pipeline in arrangement with Signature, which is Tom [ph], ex-President of Sunrise, and they have far outperformed all expectations. We have a mortgage loan program with them where we put roughly 60% of the capital into the development and they fund the bounce with equity and then we have a fixed price purchase option on the building after it opens and those have been remarkably successful and we have quite a few more under way. All of those in the greater London market. And then the third bucket is with Gracewell, which was essentially taken over by Sunrise and those have been a bit below the underwriting expectations. I think Sunrise, who's to my point earlier, to John's question, it's just a lower price point than Sunrise is accustomed to operate in the UK and I think they're still trying to figure out what the right cost structure is for that lower revenue building. It's still mostly private-paid, but it is a bit of a different building. So the NOI on those, Kevin, has been a bit lower than we had expected. Kevin Tyler : Okay, thanks. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Kevin. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : Thanks. Good morning. Scott Brinker : Good morning. Jordan Sadler : First question, just more of like a clarification on page eight of the stuff, there is - in the quality indicators, the quality mixed days on a post-acute portfolio - is that just at typo, it says 37.4%? Because I think it was at 57.4% last quarter and a year before. Or is there something else going on there? Scott Brinker : Yes, we changed it from being based on revenue to being based on days so that we could get a better industry comparable. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then separately regarding New York City, is there anything that you guys can elaborate on in terms of the size of the investment or maybe future opportunities, structure at a JV or is that all? Tom DeRosa : Not at this time. No, we're not at the liberty to tell you really anything more than what I said, or what you've been able to get out of the press. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Can you maybe also just then give us a little bit of color on the acquisition market and the opportunities you're able to successfully source? The couple hundred million this year so far and just curious about what you're seeing in terms of the landscape opportunities on the senior housing side or otherwise? Tom DeRosa : We're seeing very good opportunities from our existing family of operators who still have assets that are very attractive in very attractive markets. Scott Brinker : Yes, for the most part in the first quarter, those were not only privately-negotiated with the existing clients, but in most cases they were sort of purchased options, exercised on newly developed assets. For example, signature building in London, the Silverado building in Austin Texas, these are properties that we did not put all the development capital into the project - in some cases very little and then we alongside with our JV partner have the right to buy those either when they open or in this case when they stabilize. It's an example of how we build an attractive acquisition pipeline at favorable prices, but also great modern real estate and good markets rather than what you find on the next auction of assets in Houston. Jordan Sadler : Is it conceivable that that's repeatable at that pace? Scott Brinker : Yes. It would be hard for us not to do from $200 million or so of acquisitions. We certainly could if the circumstances required us to because for the most part, these are purchase options, not purchase obligations. But at these types of yields, we thought these made sense given the quality of the markets and assets even we are stuck in the low 60s, now that we're back to the high 70s, they clearly are hugely profitable. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Thank you. Scott Brinker : Sure. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Good morning and good quarter for sure. Tom, you said misinformation. What would you say were the one, two or three top components of these misinformation you referred to? Because these things are happening. There are changes going on, there is bundling happening, there is some question marks about how post-acute will be utilized in the future. Where do you think people have gotten it wrong in your communications with both the sale side and the buy side? Tom DeRosa : I'd say in a couple of places. I'd say that you may have seen that there were some wholesale, something of our stock based on maybe misunderstandings about things like RAC audits and if you like us to go through a discussion about that, we're happy to do it. We could do it on here, we could do it off line, but I think there has been a lot - there was misinformation earlier in the year about Genesis that was out there. There was a research before that frankly was just plain out wrong, that caused a lot of activity in our shares. I think the supply issue in senior housing which has been a huge overhand on our stock, I think has been overplayed. I think there's wrong information out there, Rich. We disagree we have opportunities. People call us, we are happy to discuss anything, we show up at lots of conferences, we're there, we're telling our story, we're trying to be as clear as possible, we're a very transparent company, Rich, we don't play hide the ball and we're happy to address any questions people have about the skilled nursing industry, about RAC audits, about supply in seniors housing, about where we think healthcare is going - I don't know what else to say. Rich Anderson : As far as the RAC audits go, isn't it true there is a treasure chest map or whatever by which they can work off of with some of the things that have happened at other firms not in your network? Isn't there at least some risk there that this revitalization of RAC audits might actually be a little bit more of a risk this time around than in past years? Tom DeRosa : Okay. Let's take a couple of points here. The concept has been around for 10 years. They were implemented under the Tax Relief and Healthcare Act of 2006 and there are some notion out there that the sniff sector has not been impacted by RAC audits. But if you look at CMS data, almost $86 million of overpayment was collected in 2014. The CMS is limited, the recovery auditor looked back for period of six months from the date of service for patient status reviews as of May 15, 2015 and I think most importantly is that our operator are prepared for this. They have rigorous compliance and documentation procedures. Medical necessity is established with a physician at admission, a care plan is established with a patient and therapy team, and therapy encounters are thoroughly documented. Rich Anderson : Okay. Tom DeRosa : So this is not a random process on the part of our operators. It's one of the reasons why we're very concentrated with Genesis because Genesis has the scale and resources to invest in compliance procedures that help them operate in an environment where they are principally being paid by Medicare and Medicaid. Rich Anderson : Okay, so - don't be mad at me, I'm not in order. So\u2026 Scott Estes : I'm always mad at you, Rich. This is nothing new. Rich, I just want some more additional context on the rack audits because it's, I don't know maybe it's the medicine name that has everybody all worked up. We're not trying to suggest that it's not an issue, it's just we're trying to put some context around it. Because today as Tom mentioned, roughly $100 million of overpayments were essentially given back to the Medicare program for skilled nursing. Right? That's on a $30 billion denominator. So it's 0.3%, even if that number increases by seven times, right? I mean seven times, it's still just the equivalent of the Medicare inflation update that CMS is proposing for next year. So I mean it's not like this is going to bankrupt the industry, and for operators that have great documentation it will have absolutely no impact other than an occasional headache, and it's at the facility level, Rich. This is not something that is levy, there is no, again we don't have a crystal ball but it's not our understanding that they will pick an operator and saying we're doing a rack audit, cut down the hatches we're coming through. I mean this is on a facility basis. It's hard for us to conceit. Our crystal ball is not as good as yours, but it's hard for us to conceit that the entire value of our net portfolio is subject to the dramatic decline in value because of rack audits. Rich Anderson : No, I'm just saying if something, Genesis happens that pivots from preliminary situation to something more defined, that's a headline risk that people at least should be underwriting in their line of thinking. That's all I'm saying. Now can I just quickly switch\u2026 Scott Estes : No, we want to talk more about this. No, no, no, come on ask me something else about rack audits. Rich Anderson : I want to ask you something about Genesis. Is it true that coverage this year, at least to some degree, is getting a boost from some of the events in their own recent history in terms of investment activity and that some of that will wing down over future years as the skilled gets merge in and everything else. Is that a fair statement about Genesis and the coverage this year? Scott Estes : They're definitely benefitting from some of the synergies on the acquisitions, they're benefitting from the refinancing of the bridge loans, are there roughly 10%, or is in the low fours, that's a big difference for them. But longer term we actually think the story is very positive. I mean our master lease is 187 properties and that matures in 16 years. They have a lot of individual leases or smaller leases that mature either next year or in the next five years that frankly have very low coverage and either they'll reject them or they will substantially renegotiate the rent downwards. So I think there's a lot of those types of opportunities they could certainly exit some of the lower quality buildings that they've acquired and we support them in that effort, their optimization opportunities in the assets that they acquired because they are premier operator. And if you think long term with bundling, I mean the challenge right now is that hospitals and managed care players are already starting to reduce admissions to skilled nursing, but I don't think they really started the process of targeting the best in class properties in each market. And when that happens I think there actually is an opportunity for Genesis to outperform and take market share, but we're just not in that phase of the funding roll out yet. Rich Anderson : Okay, and let me just stay on, thanks for that Scott. And for the final question for me on hospitals. Are you seeing them smalling down their playing field with regards to their relationship with snips, are they cutting back and kind of isolating their relationships post to Q wise, do you have evidence of that and how do you avoid being involved in that side of the business that maybe some of the failed situations on the skilled side? Scott Estes : Rich, at least in our world we see no evidence of that, and let me give you an example of something that we recently saw. The Cleveland Clinic is building a new hospital in Avon, Ohio, about 40 miles West of Cleveland, and this hospital which, actually the project looks a lot like what we did in Voorhees, New Jersey. It's actually going to have a skilled nursing facility attached to the hospital, and Cleveland Clinic isn't running that facility. There's another operator who's going to be running that facility. I believe it's Select Medical. That to me is a good indication of where the future might be going and it validates the fact that the sector is not going away. When you have one of the finest hospital systems in the world now putting skilled nursing, not only on their campus but actually attached to the building. So I think that more and more from our conversations with the leading health systems. We don't spend a lot of time with the non-leading health systems. So all I can tell is you the view from talking to the major players who will survive in the hospital sector that they want to see a strong skilled nursing industry. They know it is part of the future and part of their ability to manage profitably under and ever changing reimbursement environment. Rich Anderson : Okay, I'll yield the floor. Thanks very much for the color. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Karin Ford with MUFJ. Tom DeRosa : Hey, Karin. Karin Ford : Hi, good morning. Just going back to your comments on the quality of the real estate and the performance of the senior housing portfolio. Are you seeing any divergence in the performance between the shop portfolio and the underlying fundamentals you're seeing in the triple net portfolio? Tom DeRosa : I think we can say everything was pretty strong across the board. Tom DeRosa : Yes, Karin, we studied this data for - it feels like years before we made the decision to fill into the days structure six years ago because we do see differences in performance by operator, by market. And I think that's a big reason why you see certain operators in the day portfolio and certain operators in the Triple Net portfolio because our typical increase their in Triple Net is around 3%, and if anything you've seen payment coverage is unfortunately declined a bit or it stayed flat which suggest the underlying NOI of the properties only going 3% and clearly we've done a lot better than that in our [ph]. So there is a divergence. It gets to the point I was making earlier about there is variation and performance by market, by operator, and I don't think that market fully appreciates that yet. We're trying to tell the story, I think a longer time history will be helpful. But we have seen that in our data. The industry data just isn't there for people to see. There is an even reliable source of NOI in the industry. I mean, I hate to say it NIC is doing a great job of trying to change that. But as of today the best you can get is occupancy and asking rent at the national level. I mean, man you're talking about a lot of room to go and you compare that with 15 to 20 years of data in our portfolio. That is an excruciating detail for us to look at and help make investment decisions. We feel like it's a huge proprietary advantage that we have. Karin Ford : Thanks, and coverage in the Triple Net senior housing portfolio notch down just a couple of basis points here for the last few quarters. It's down to one. Any concern with the 3% escalators and the supply pressures that that could, a coverage could go materially lower from the one-one level? Tom DeRosa : Triple Net coverage is a bit lower than we like. It frankly is, for the most part driven by one operator. So it was one-one five two years ago, now it's one-one zero, all of that driven by a particular operator unfortunately. So the rest of the portfolio has helped that propel. But the reality is it's the main reason you haven't seen us do a lot of Triple Net lease acquisitions in recent years because I think there is a mindset by some, and this is going back a couple of years that if you could put something in the Triple Net lease it was a low-risk investment, right? So rental coverage, high escalators and, life is great, probably release looks fantastic and it only took sometimes a year for people to realize it. If the asset quality isn't very good notwithstanding that lease structure which on the surface seems to provide protection for the landlord at the end of the day it's a very risky investment. In our every view it always been that the higher risk investment is actually those Triple Net leases with low asset coverage and low asset quality in comparison to doing red [ph] which granted has some quarter-to-quarter volatility in NOI but overtime if you're in the great assets in the right markets, we think that's the lowest risk investment. Karin Ford : Thanks for the color. And then just last question for me. Did you guys push through 3.5% rent escalator on Genesis in April? Tom DeRosa : Yes, so this is the last of the 3.5% escalators. Next April it goes down to 3%. Karin Ford : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the questions and congrats guys on a strong quarter. Just on the red [ph] side, so one of your peers reported that in some of the markets they saw a decline, single-digit decline and their same store NOI while in markets like New York it nearly, it was quite positive, not surprisingly. Just wondering if you can give us some color as to what the range was within your U.S. portfolio. Tom DeRosa : Yes, I would be to Vik. I mean, we saw a particular strength in Southern California, New York, New Jersey, Washington D.C., these are core markets with NOI growth in the high single digits, and I'll contrast with markets like Chicago and Atlanta where unfortunately we don't have a bid presence but we do have some assets, and in large part because of either weak economies or a lot of new supply, the NOI growth was a bit negative. Scott Estes : Yes, we just always try to sell out of the market that where it's easy to bring new supply. I mean Scott said we do have some exposure, Vik, but in our portfolio it was because of the disposition program that is not exposing as much to those non-core markets. Yes, I mean the resupply is an interesting in this data point, Vik, almost half of the new supply in the U.S. is in six specific markets. I mean that's astounding right? Almost half of new supplies in six markets when you really think about, and only 8% of our NOI in the operating portfolio is in those six markets. So that means 92% of our NOI is in all of the other markets where frankly in a lot of them there is either no new supply or not much, so it really is a market specific issue. We keep saying it and now you're starting to see it in the results I think. Vikram Malhotra : No, they make sense. In the U.K. or maybe even in the U.S. is there a timing difference between when sort of these minimum wages take effect or the increases take effect versus when you sort of get the rent bumps. I'm just trying to see if there's a difference in the U.K. where we see the minimum wages go up 10%. Tom DeRosa : Vik, it's hard to say with a lot of specificity, but for the most part you increase wages on January 1 so you have to recognize that higher expense on day one of the year and with rental rates, at least with existing residence you try to increase rates on January 1 but half of our portfolio, the operators increased rates on the anniversary dates, so they breathe in over the year. So when we, again this is in black or white, but in general you have to suffer due to higher wage growth immediately while the rate growth would blend more over the course of the year. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, and then just last one on the nursing side, wondering if you looked at recent data, see a master list on readmission to hospitals. Sort of in talking to different stakeholders it seems like that's going to be an important metric in determining who maybe preferred vendors or who may see more volume. It's interesting when you look at the story, things which I know there are several components, Genesis being sort of average versus the U.S. but it actually screen very well on the readmission side. Just wondering if you dug into it or have any thoughts around that as to how that could be a future differentiator. Tom DeRosa : We do think that the quality operators in the skilled sector will again have the strategy and program built to minimize readmissions. I think that if you have a random portfolio of mom and pop operators who may be very good at what they do, it's just from our perspective it would be difficult to understand if they do have the structure in place to be a more viable partner to the acute care hospitals. So and we just think that again because of its scale, because of its program strategy, because of technology, we think Genesis is in a pretty good position. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, thanks guys. Tom DeRosa : Okay. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Yes, good morning everyone. Let me also add my congratulations on a really good quarter. Two quick ones for me. First one, Mr. Estes, when I take a look at guidance I understand that the debt raise wasn't in there. Could you just give me a sense of how much dilution that's causing to your guidance number so we can get a better sense of just how better operating results, a really kind of driving growth? Scott Estes : The shortest answer would probably be about $0.03. We had $400 million of the March debt being repaid in our forecast, so the $700 million we raised was $300 million in excess of that, and you think about that for the ten months of the year that it was out there is roughly $0.03. So I think that roughly matched some of the benefits we see from the strength of the same store NOI growth and the performance of the rest of the portfolio. Tayo Okusanya : Okay, that's helpful. And then Tom or the other Scott, I think earlier on in the conversation there was a comment around Genesis that you thought comfortable where things were heading, there was probably some misunderstanding about the company's fourth quarter results but you also added the statement that you do expect some pressure on coverage going forward, could you just talk a little bit about that and where you kind of assume that's going to be coming from? Scott Brinker : It's Scott, Tayo, I mean the skilled nursing business goes up and down. It's the most difficult business that we invest in, that's why we use the Triple Net lease structure. Genesis has been able to maintain payment coverage the last four years despite the 3.5% escalator which is a testament to their quality, but the environment probably is getting more difficult not easier at least for the foreseeable future. It's certainly nice to have the 2.1% Medicare increase, but there are well-document headwinds on the skilled side of the business as well as occupancy with length of stay. So it wouldn't surprise us if coverage ticked down, but keep in mind where we're starting from, right. The corporate coverage is around 1.3, the facility level coverage is around 1.6, before management fee are in the higher 1.2 after management fees. So and there's a lot of cushion there. We're not talking about will it pay the rent, we're talking about what coverage fee 1.24 or 1.28, and at the end of the day four basis points doesn't really impact well, tell her a whole lot other than a lot of question. They pay the rent, if it was substantially lower payment coverage then I'd be really worried about one or two basis points. Tayo Okusanya : Okay, that's helpful. And if I just indulge with one more. Just seeing on the skilled nursing side of things, I mean do you know if any of these bundling programs have actually reached a conclusion yet and if there's anything that be gleaned from any of them in regards to where sniff reimbursement maybe heading? Tom DeRosa : I don't think we know a lot about that yet. Tayo Okusanya : Okay. Tom DeRosa : It's an early base. Tayo Okusanya : Just so I would ask in case something had come through. Thank you very much. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Tayo. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi, thanks. Scott Estes, just to go back to the earnings impact this year. How are your loan payoffs impacting guidance and any loan payoffs coming in? Are they in general coming in as expected or they're being repaid, would you say a little early? Scott Estes : No, we had, Genesis is going through the process throughout the year so we had a pretty balanced repayment expectation and I think they would probably stay the same so I would characterize that, Todd, as in-line relatively balanced throughout the year where they should make pretty good head way on the - it's still remaining outstanding as Scott Brinker mentioned, I think it's $372 million currently still outstanding for us. Todd Stender : Any broader initiatives to call in loans? Just to clean up any of the credit issues that happen in your portfolio? Any expectations that the loan book will actually decline as the percentage of assets? Scott Estes : It definitely will, mostly because of the Genesis mortgage loans which is almost half the outstanding balance. We had at least $50 million of loan payments in the first quarter beyond Genesis and I can think of a couple of others that are in process in the balance of the year, but it's not because of credit issues, or because we're calling the loans. They're just being repaid as expected. Todd Stender : That's helpful. And just this take with you, Scott Brinker. You touched briefly on the Silverado asset you purchased in the quarter. Can you talk about what the least expectations were, what they actually were? Looks like the facility opened in 2014. Just wanted to see and get a sense of what the stabilization period was and any anecdotal evidence? You can talk about of how their strategy is performing in the taxes markets. Scott Brinker : Yes. That's a property that they built with mostly third party capitals. So we didn't invest any money into that project, but Silverado had a purchase option that included what ultimately was a very large promoted interest as well that collectively, we purchased that property, the typical Sunrise communities around 70 units and it would typically take around two years to fill, but they were able to lease that building much quicker than the expectations, so we exercised our purchase option early and because of the promoted interest, the cap rate would have done even more attractive than what we reflected in the earnings release, which just sort of ignores the benefits of that. Todd Stender : Great, thank you. Scott Brinker : Sure. Operator : [Operator instructions] And our next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Thanks for the time. Just hoping to talk a little bit about the senior housing Triple Net portfolio. You talked about Atlanta and Chicago being at risk from supplier, just softer markets in general. Can you help us frame how Triple Net portfolio is exposed to new supply? Is there a certain percentage of the portfolio that maybe is generating that negative NOI that is a very small amount of portfolio? Scott Brinker : Yes, Juan. We haven't done the level of analysis on the Triple Net portfolio that you see in the supplemental for the operating portfolio. As a general comment, the Triple Net assets tend to be in more secondary markets, so we don't have the same emphasis on really the prime, premier, metro markets and as a result, they probably are a bit more impacted by new supply. Now, we don't have a huge presence in the six markets I mentioned, even in the Triple Net portfolio. We just don't have a huge presence in Houston, or Dallas, or Chicago, or Atlanta. We have assets, it's just not a big concentration. But most of the performance decline that you've seen in that portfolio is really driven by one operator who unfortunately is a pretty big percentage of our pool who has gone through some integration issues and hopefully that situation is now right-sized and their coverages can start to pick up again. Juan Sanabria : And I noticed you have - it looks like three different master leases with EBITDAR coverage below 0.95 times. Pretty small, but I noticed they're not necessarily targeted for dispositions. Any reason why? Scott Brinker : That really just means they're not actively for sale. Fair to say that anything on that page could be a candidate for disposition. These aren't big portfolios by any means. It looks like the biggest one is around $10 million plus or minus at annual rent. We only have about $25 million in the outreach of the year so these are very small portfolios. I don't think they'll move much one way or the other. Juan Sanabria : Okay. Just a last question for me. On the portfolio, how should we think about the year-over-year growth as you go throughout the year? I know you've wanted to get away from the quarterly discussion, but is the second quarter tough for a comp, or is it set up as well as the first quarter ended up to be? Scott Brinker : Yes. One of our best guess is that the second quarter may be the weakest of the four quarters this year. In February we said as a general statement that we expected growth to pick up throughout the balance of the year. The first quarter surprised us in a positive way, but at least for now we'll maintain our expectation that the second half of the year should be a bit better, which means that Q2 may slow down a bit. Tom DeRosa : And it's also important to know that the first quarter was not an easy comp. I think there are some perception out there that because of a more severe flu and weather last year that that was an easy comp and that was not the case actually. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Market. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. With regards to the potential asset sales, Scott, you mentioned in your comments, would this be over the billion-dollar guidance and with regard to those sales, I guess with the skilled nursing facilities, are there any focus on operators? Would it be with Genesis, or Mainstreet? Or do you have different operators you would look at selling? Scott Brinker : On the last question, I'd say all options on the table and we're in a favorable position and that we don't have to sell anything. If again the private market describes you a value or something that's much higher than what we feel the public market is valuing it up, we'd be happy to sell it and because with our landlord position, we've got a ton of flexibility to do what we want with these assets. So we're looking at everything, but we haven't targeted one specific operator to say that they're first on the list. Let's see what the market bares, let's see how the staff performs. We want to be as flexible as possible here. Michael Carroll : Okay. And would that sales be over the $1 million guidance that is provided? Scott Brinker : It could be. Again, depends on what happens over the next couple of months. We're looking at a lot of things to hopefully create shareholder value. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then Tom or Scott, with regard to the RAC audit, how cumbersome are those audits for the operators? Does it take a lot of their time and will it cost them to I guess focus on the audits versus operations? Tom DeRosa : Well, it's hard to answer that because we don't think there's a lot of evidence that our operators have sustained a lot of RAC audits and I think if you're thinking they're buses driving around the country with RAC auditors that are descending on skilled nursing facilities, well then it might be cumbersome. But that's not what we're aware of. Who knows? Scott Estes : Michael, they also have documentation that's off the charts. It's not like they need to increase the level of internal audit, or documentation that they do. They live in a regulated world and it's really no changing practice. So I don't think it's going to have any material impact on what they actually do day-to-day in terms of active property level. They may have to start providing information to these RAC auditors and maybe that's a bit more time-consuming than have some added cost, but the real issue is are you properly documenting the service? Do you have a physician order that supports the services being provided and are documentation on those important topics is at least in our estimation best in class? Michael Carroll : Okay. There's not a lot of information on the RAC audits out there right now. Do we know when they actually started, or if they're ramping up, or if they're just preparing? Do we have any information on that? Tom DeRosa : The only information we have is what you have heard publicly and the information that we do have is that our operators provide these services within the guidelines established. So now we have no idea if on a property-specific level that if some - if one of our operators is doing something that would raise suspicions by a rack audit, but we'll have to wait and see. It is something again, we want to remind you, this has been around for a while. Whenever you're on a regulated business, there's always the additional oversight to make sure that there's no funny business. So again, we don't know specifically, but we don't expect that this is going to be a major problem. Anything can happen, but again, this is on the property specific basis. We have no knowledge that thousands of people have been retained to go out and audit nursing homes now. That would be very costly at a time when there isn't money for that. But please, if you hear something, I'd ask you to give us a call because we might be able to help you out to understand it better. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Operator : And at this time we have no further questions. I'd like to thank everyone for participating on today's first quarter 2016 Welltower earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Kaila, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Jeffrey Miller : Thank you, Kaila. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today for Welltower's second quarter 2016 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at welltower.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call, which may be accessed through the company's website. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Tom DeRosa, our CEO. Tom. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks Jeff. Our strong results this quarter were driven by excellent operating results across all of our business segments. From an earnings perspective, funds from operations per share was up 6% and funds available for distribution was up 9%. The Scotts will take you through a deeper dive on what is driving our performance. But first, let me give you the high points. Overall same-store NOI for all of Welltower was up 3.3% versus last year, this is largely being driven by the performance of our senior housing business. The senior housing operating portfolio registered 4% same-store NOI growth versus a year. Despites the industry confirms about new supply and vague expense growth the Welltower family of operators were able to pass along on average, 4% rate increase, while increasing occupancy by 100 basis points. These results can only be realized by from owning A quality real-estate in A quality markets, that is the Welltower story. A key differentiator for Welltower is that 90% of our revenue is from private pay sources. You should expect to see our private pay percentage increase through this year. However, we also had a strong history of managing the credit exposure to government reimbursement for our shareholders, so regarding our Genesis assets, we believe Genesis is continuing to strengthen its business platform and financial position. I can only speak to our Genesis portfolio and I can tell you that the operating performance of our portfolio improved during the quarter. We are pleased to see a strong final Medicare rate increase, the DOJ settlement that was announced by Genesis yesterday and both Welltower and Genesis shareholders should be pleased to have some clarity around there capital structure. This goes a long way towards adding some ballets to the Genesis story and we believe position for Genesis management team to focus their time and energy on the future of their business. Speaking of the future, we are pleased to announce the $1.15 billion Vintage acquisition this morning. This is an ideal strategic acquisition for us. It allows us to go deeper into two important core markets, significantly solidifying our number one market share in Los Angelis, gaining the number one position in San Francisco and which by the way adds to our already number one market position in New York, Boston and Seattle, fives of the Section-56 corner markets in the United States. The Vintage portfolio will be mange by Sunrise, Silverado and SRG. Three of our operators with a strong position in these markets. The Vintage scene has built a great business with some irreplaceable assets. We expect rebranding and connecting these assets to the brooder Welltower senior care network will enhance their value and capture significant upside our shareholders. I do hope you reviewed the Vintage portfolio side presentation available on our website. Our strategy of building scale in A quality real estate in the leading core markets in the U.S., UK and Canada is driving the excellent results, we are reporting today. Our ability to bolt-on a large acquisition like Vintage underscores the dominance of the Welltower franchise and enhances our ability to continue to drive best in class operating results and growth for our shareholders. Now Scott Brinker will give you a closer look at our operating performance. Scott Brinker : Thank you Tom. Welltower is known for discipline around high quality real estate and operating partners. That discipline delivered another solid quarter with 3.3% same-store NOI growth. Just above the high-end of annual guidance, the operating portfolio led the way. Same-store NOI grew 4%, rental rates were up 3.8% and occupancy increased 100 basis points all were above expectations. To-date, we are proving resilient to new supply and higher labor costs. Our diversification by operator service type and geography is a key attribute. An example is that same-store NOI in Canada last quarter increased 7.1% outstanding work by our partners at Hartwell and Riviera. Their performance offset more modest growth in the UK. Two years ago, the roles were reversed showing the benefit of diversification. By design, more than half of our Canadian NOI comes from Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and Ottawa, the four largest markets in Canada. Over the past few years our properties in these four core markets have produced five plus percent annual NOI growth far above any comparative benchmark. We have number one market share in several of these markets and intend to go deeper overtime. Same-store NOI in the U.S. grew 3.5% last quarter. We continue to see wide variance by market with clear outperformance from our core markets. Those being Southern and Northern California, Seattle, Boston, New York, New Jersey and D.C., Northern Virginia. Including the Vintage acquisition, our six core markets will account for nearly 60% of the NOI in our U.S. operating portfolio. We have always liked the supply and demand fundamentals in these markets and they have rewarded us with consistently higher rate growth, better margins and same-store NOI growth in the mid to high single-digits. We very deliberately formed partnerships with the leading operators in these markets, including Sunrise, Silverado, Belmont Village, SRG, Benchmark, Epic, Merrill Gardens and Brandywine. Their operating expertise helps our real estate avoid commodity status. They make our market position even more defensible. Including the Vintage acquisition we'll have number one market share in five of these six core markets and number two share in the sixth and yet our market share is only in the mid-teens living plenty of room for growth. The UK operating portfolio produced 2.7% same-store NOI growth last quarter. As expected, labor costs are headwind, to-date thanks to our premium locations we've had pricing power to offset most of those costs. Half of our NOI in the UK comes from the RIDEA structure and the other half is triple-net with 2% to 3% annual rent escalators. This 50/50 mix in the UK gives us a nice balance of upside and stability. Outpatient medical results continue to be boring but in a good way with another quarter of same-store growth in the mid 2% range. There is excellent visibility into this income stream driven by low lease rollover and a high retention rate. Also, the vast majority of the leases are triple-net, which gives us reliable earnings growth because expenses are passed through to the tenants. Moving to triple-net seniors housing. Same-store NOI grew 2.8% in line with history and our expectations. Payment coverage move higher and we see potential for a slow upward trend overtime. Skilled nursing and post-acute. Same-store NOI increased 3.6%, payment coverage declined to few basis points, primarily due to certain assets being looked help for sale and therefore out of the calculation. More important our Genesis properties continue to perform well given the environment. Our master lease saw a nice improvement in 2Q, versus the previous few quarter as Genesis adapts to the new environment. Yesterday Genesis made several positive announcement, including covenant release and a term loan refinancing through Welltower and Omega on a 60/40 basis. For Welltower shareholders this could be viewed as an important first step in a much larger process. As of yesterday, we are better positioned to reduce our Genesis concentration. We own their core assets in their core markets, so getting buyers comfortable with our real estate has never done our concern. Three things changed yesterday, one the hospital lender is gone, two the buyers can under write the corporate credit with more clarity and three Genesis can now focus on running their business rather than on inherited DOJ investigations, covenants and debt maturities. We had already been seen inbound interest in acquiring Genesis real estate from us and we expect the interest level to a increase over the past 24 hours. We raised $227 million of capital last quarter through this positions and loan payoffs including $61 million of Genesis mortgage loan repayments. The largest assets there was in Canada, where senior housing cap rates are now right at the top of the U.S. When we entered Canada nearly five-years ago the spread to the U.S. was at least 100% basis points. Since then institution of capital is poured into that sector, driving down cap rates. We took advantage last quarter by selling a non-core triple-net portfolio in Alberta for $125 million, which is mid 5% cap rate. The price was particularly attractive to us and in light of the weak economy in that province. We closed $356 million of new investments last quarter at a 7.3% initial cash yield. A healthy spread to our cost of capital. Our operating partners continue to be a unique source of high quality investments at reasonable prices. And that takes us to our pending acquisition of the Vintage portfolio in California for $1.15 billion. This portfolio is middle of the fairway for us. First 100% of the NOI is in our core markets. We are going deeper into markets where we have any credible footprint and a track record of success. Second, Welltower is uniquely positioned to unlock value here. We chose SRG, Sunrise and Silverado to take over management of the properties. Seniors housing is not a one size fits all business and we have the unique luxury of hand picking among our operating partners for the task at hand. SRG is an expert in large communities, Sunrise excels at mid size properties and Silverado is the memory care specialist and that\u2019s exactly how we allocated the 19 properties. The cap rate is expected to improve from about 5% in year one to the mid to high 6s at stabilization. That improvement is driven by occupancy rate and expense assumptions that are based on our partners\u2019 deep experience in these markets. Vintage is a very unique opportunity due to its scale and high barrier markets. It includes irreplaceable properties in San Francisco including one of few blocks from Nob Hill and one of few blocks from Golden Gate Park. Also the timing for a big core acquisition is perfect for us given our pending dispositions. And that\u2019s a good segway to Scott Estes. Scott Estes : All right, thanks Scott and good morning everyone. We were pleased to generate another solid quarter of earnings results and operating performance that of our portfolio. I would like to focus my comments this morning on how we are thinking about our business from a financial perspective as we enter the second half of the year. As Tom and Scott mentioned we will not be shy about looking for incremental disposition opportunity throughout the remainder of 2016. As a result, you should expect us to remain focused around our capital allocation theme this year, which emphasizes the following three components. First, we will look to maximize our financial flexibility through enhance liquidity as evidenced by the recent increase in our line of credit from $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Second, we intent to further strengthen our balance sheet by using incremental disposition proceeds to fund announced investments and continue to reduce leverage and strengthen our credit metrics. And third, we intend to further enhance the quality of our portfolio through targeted asset sales which we will remain focused on reducing our skill nursing exposure and in increasing our private pay mix. So again, begin my detailed remarks with some perspective on our second quarter financial performance and several of the more significant changes made through our supplemental package this quarter. In terms of second quarter earnings, we generated normalized FFO of a $0.15 per share up about 6% versus last year and normalized that of a $1.4 per share, which increased 9% versus last year. Results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth and the $1.9 billion of net investments completed over the last four quarters. Overall I think this is a fairly straight forward quarterly report, as our net investment volume of $129 million was relatively light, a G&A of $39.9 million was in line with expectations, and tax expenses only quite less than expected. The only somewhat unusual item was on other income line which included an additional $11.8 million related to the receipt of insurance proceeds and the release of an escrow the benefit of both of which were backed out of our normalized earnings results. Moving onto dividends, we will pay our 181st consecutive quarterly cash dividend on August 22nd of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually. This represents a 4.2% increase over the dividends paid last year and represents a current dividend yield of 4.3%. I'd also like to point out three fairly significant enhancements we made to our supplemental package this quarter. First, you can see at the bottom of page five that we enhanced our CapEx disclosure to include both recurring CapEx that impacts our normalized FAD, but also the other CapEx amounts that are generally the value enhancing larger renovation projects throughout portfolio. Second on page eight, we had a detailed trip-net payment coverage data that highlights both EBITDA coverage and duration of the individual leases in our portfolio. And third on page 29, we added disclosure related to our same-store NOI calculation methodology which details the specific adjustments to arrive at our same property count at the top of the page and the adjustments to arrive at the same-store NOI by property type at the bottom of the page. I think our intent here is to be as transparent as possible in showing you how we calculate our same-store result. Turning next to our liquidity picture and balance sheet, the second quarter was fairly quite from a capital markets activity prospective, I think the highlight of the quarter occurred in May, when we further enhanced our financial growth stability by increasing our line of credit from $2.5 billion to $3 billion, while extending the units of that improvement at 2020. Our new line is priced that LIBOR plus 90 basis points, represents saving of 2.5 basis points from our previous line and carry the one-year extension option and in accordion fees for additional $1 billion. This brings our total unsecured credit facilities at 3.7 billion, when including our U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar term loan which were also extended for another five years. In terms of equity, we raised $64 million by issuing 914,000 shares through to our [drip] (Ph) program this quarter and we also generated 227 million of proceeds for dispositions and loan payoff, which importantly included $61 million in Genesis mortgage loan repaid during the quarter. and lastly, repaid approximately $151 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.2% while issuing $87 million of secured debt at a blended rate at 3%. So as a result, we continue to have significant liquidity with over $2.7 billion available at quarter end, with only $745 million of line borrowing and $467 million in cash on balance sheet. Our balance sheet and financial metrics at the end of the second quarter remains strong, as of June 30, our net debts-to-undepreciated book cap of 39.2% improved 40 basis from last quarter, while net debt to enterprise value improved 230 basis points to 30%. Out net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.5 times, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter remains solid at 4.2 times and 3.2 times respectively. Our secured debt level remained at only 11.9% of total assets at quarter end. In addition, we are pleased to receive an upgrade in our senior debt rating from Moody\u2019s to BAA1 in June. In light of the recent Brexit vote, I would like to take just a moment to remind you that we have fairly little financial exposure to the recent weakness in the pound sterling as a result of our hedging program. More specifically as of June 30, our UK exposure from a balance sheet prospective is over 80% hedge, through a combination of sterling denominates unsecured debt and other currencies hedges in place, while our earnings that at the UK are approximately 90% hedged, their interest expense on debt, G&A CapEx and cash flow hedge. Since the UK does represent only 8% of our total NOI, each 10% move in the pound against the dollar currently has an annualized earnings impact of less than $0.01 per year. I will conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. Regarding investments, our acquisition guidance includes those completed during the first half of the year, the $1.1.5 billion Vintage portfolio, and an additional $48 million of investments expected to remain through partnership. Moving to depositions, we have increased our dispositions forecast for the full -ear to $1.3 billion in proceeds from the previous $1 billion. Our new forecast is comprised of the $343 million in proceeds received during the first half of the year. $769 million of proceeds from properties currently held-for-sale, with the reminder representing loan payoff and other potential property sales over the rest for the year. Most of the $300 million of incremental disposition proceed and they were added to our guidance this quarter of skilled nursing asset and do to include $68 million from our Genesis portfolio. As Tom and Scott mentioned, we continue to evaluate opportunities to sell additional Genesis assets above and beyond those included in our current guidance. And just to be clear, our exposure to Genesis has declined by $57 million for the three Genesis related items that have been disclosed over the past two days, which includes the $61 million in mortgage loans repaid during the quarter to $68 million in pending dispositions partially offset by the $72 million new term loan. In terms of our same-store NOI growth forecast, there is no change to our blended full-year estimate of 2.75% to 3.25% though I would state that we are attracting toward a higher end of the range at this point driven largely by the strength of our senior housing operating portfolio. Our FAD CapEx forecast is currently $82 million for 2016 comprised of approximately $55 million associated with the senior housing operating portfolio with the remaining $27 million coming from our outpatient medical portfolio. We do expect CapEx spending to ramp up a bit during the latter half of the year due to the timing of projected expenditures. Our G&A forecast continues to track towards the low end of our initial guidance at approximately $160 million for the full-year at this point. Our tax line item is projected to return to an expense of about $3 million to $4 million per quarter during the each of the last two quarters of this year based on slightly higher taxable income forecast. And a result of all of these assumptions we are maintaining our normalized FFO guidance of $4.50 to 44.60 per diluted share and FAD guidance of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, both of which represents 3% to 5% growth over normalized 2015 results. I think our decision to maintain guidance was largely based on the fact that the incremental dispositions added to our guidance this quarter should be roughly offset by the Vintage portfolio acquisitions and continued solid operating portfolio performance through the second quarter. So in conclusion, we remain focused on our capital allocation efforts this year that we will continue to prioritize, maximizing financial flexibility through increased liquidity, strengthening our balance sheet by lowering leverage and enhancing the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix. So that concludes my remarks and I think at this point, Tom I will turn it to you for some closing comments. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks Scott. Before we take your questions, I wanted to highlight a few promotions that were approved by our Board and announced last week. Many of you know Mercedes Kerr as she is an important leader in the senior housing industry. I\u2019m delighted to tell you that Mercedes was named an Executive Vice President and a member of the Well Power Management Committee. Mercedes oversees business development and relationship management activities and has relocated to the Mothership here in Toledo. Additionally, Matt McQueen, Senior Vice President of Legal was named General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. I am grateful for their contribution to our success and they have further strength to an already deep senior management bench here. Now, Kaila open up the line for questions please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Thanks. Good morning. Guys can you give us an update on the sales process of the Genesis assets I know you touched on that in your prepared remarks and may be you can touch on the depth of the buyer pool that you are currently tracking? Thomas DeRosa : Yes Michael I will be happy to. The held-for-sale bucket include $68 million in Genesis properties that are already under contract and that should closed in the next 60 days or so. Those are unique and that Genesis is actually existing the operations as well, so we are selling the real estate they exit in operations. And I would say that unusual or unique, because for the most part, we own core Genesis assets that they want to stay in as the operator. So would be selling our real estate and Genesis would remain as the operating partners. So I think that\u2019s less complex transaction and trying to sell the real estate and the operations together. In terms of interest level it\u2019s strong and it\u2019s from number of different sources, private equity for sure, overseas capital for sure. And we are actually starting to see that private and public REITS show interest again, which we were not have been the case in the past three to six month as the stock prices have come back and the capital rates has improved. So there is actually a pretty deep buyer pool and the lenders continued to be interested in the space as well provided the payment coverage\u2019s reasonable. But I would highlight something that Scott said earlier Mike is that based on the Genesis announcement yesterday I think there is even greater interest in owning these assets. Because there were a number of issues that were providing a little bit of a smoke screen in terms of really understanding the true value of the real estate and the future of the Genesis operating platform. I think the lot of that has been taken care of by the measures that we have already talked about. Michael Carroll : Okay then can you touch on the get how much of the portfolio, you would like to sell and would this be done multiple transaction with JV or one single transaction? Thomas DeRosa : Mike, we have always been both buyers and sellers of real estate and we are opportunistic and strategic in both those regards and we again are evaluating opportunities to sell across our portfolio as they come in. I think we are comfortable with what we own today, and felling better about it today then we might have felt a few days ago. So again, just we ask you to stand by and assume that we are seeing a lot of interest and we\u2019ll make the best decision with respect to our shareholders. Michael Carroll : Okay great and last question, can you give us some color on that California portfolio you agreed to buy. I think the release said a stabilized yield in the mid to high 6% range. Why is this a stabilize yield, does that assume some type of redevelopment opportunities or does that see many types of operational improvements for the transitioning your existing operators into those assets? Scott Estes : Michael it\u2019s more the latter, there are couple of properties that would benefit from some CapEx and redevelopment but that\u2019s not the reason for the gap between the first year yield and the stabilized yield. That\u2019s more of that we are going to pretty dramatically change the service profile at the communities. I think the service level of the price point is going to change pretty dramatically and you chosen three operating partners to do that with who have extremely deep experience in these markets. So we have underwritten occupancy rates and expense assumptions, they are very much based on their historical experience in these markets. And any time you do an operator transition you have to assume that there is going to be a decline in your line, especially if you are increasing the service mix. It's just the way it works is the expenses go up first and it takes time to be able to increase occupancy and rate to match the service level that you implement day one. And no doubt you have staffing changes as well as turnover within the resident population. So the year one is always a bit depressed. Michael Carroll : So what's the in place or initial yield on these assets? Scott Estes : It's around 5% Michael in year one. Michael Carroll : Okay. Great, thank you. Scott Estes : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Tyler from Green Street Advisors. Kevin Tyler : Good morning. Thanks. Just following up on that point on the Vintage deal, can you give some color on how it ultimately came together I know the portfolio had been roomer to be kind of on and off the market. What brought them to the table ultimately? Scott Estes : Kevin the only much we can say about something like that, I would say that patience is a virtue sometimes and the timing here was particularly well for us given cost of our capital today and may be versus in the past and our disposition proceeds that are pending. So we felt like this is always been a portfolio that we had our eye on. We always had operating partners that we thought could do a great job creating value and at time it came together perfectly. Thomas DeRosa : And Kevin we don't know of another opportunity to be able to create the level of scale in the Los Angeles and San Francisco markets that this acquisition will give to us. So we think it's very a highly strategic move for us to be able to acquire Vintage, we are very excited about it. The Vintage Group, Vintage Senior Living really assembled at excellent portfolio of assets in some extremely high barrier to entry locations that's what we are all about. So this as Scott said down in the middle of the fairway this is exactly the type of growth opportunity that we seek out. Kevin Tyler : Okay. Thanks yes I agree definitely some high barrier locations there right in our backyard here in Southern California. In the slides that you put out the occupancy in the Southern California piece of the portfolio I think it was around 83%. I was just curious given the nature of these assets and where they are why that might be a little bit lower kind of the industry average any color there? Scott Estes : We think there is opportunity to bring it up to the industry average. Our occupancy in these markets is in their low 90s SRG, Sunrise, Silverado consistently run at that level and it will take a little time to get there. But we are confident that overtime these properties will be at that 90-ish percent level and that's why we one of the reasons why we see the yield in this investment improving overtime. Kevin Tyler : Okay, thanks. Just switching gears onto the Genesis and sniff side for a second. As we think about the overall exposure to these new bundling initiatives we are trying to quantify what that means for any particular operator. We try and pencil down what percent of NOI might be exposed to joints broadly and then may be go from there into [Technical Difficulty] 67 geographies that are laid out under the CJR program. I am just curious from you and we've been also talking exact numbers, but directionally Genesis exposure to CJR and in those 67 markets, how do you think about that that and if we are talking about our terms, would you think if that represents in terms of their NOI? Thomas DeRosa : I guess Kevin, the world of healthcare reimbursement is moving towards underlying and it\u2019s hard to answer, you question incrementally, because there is so many unknowns. Genesis is very much preparing for world that looks different than today in terms of reimbursement and I would say as the lowest cost setting with that can deliver the best outcome will be the winner. Kevin Tyler : Okay, thanks for the thoughts guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : I was just hoping you could comment on the changes that Genesis announced yesterday with regards to its covenant to get a 20% to 25% better. If you could just comment on what we should expect that imply, does that imply a more pressure, like we had and if you could comment on what the governance want, were they are now relative to the governance and what the change was? Thomas DeRosa : One that answer what I can, Genesis who have their call on Friday, I think they are disclosing particular governance but the point is when these covenants were set three and four years ago, it was a different business environment and they were set in a level that give it cushion to the projected performance and that\u2019s the same thing that we've done here. The idea behind covenants is to give you self to see at the table, when things are turning in the wrong direction so that and you can sit down and have a rational discussion by how to proceed and that\u2019s what happened here among Genesis and it\u2019s various capital partners. So we agreed to reset the convenient to levels that certainly have all of us being paid and as they disclosed the caution in the 20% to 25% range against the EBITDA projection that they recently provided that\u2019s based on today\u2019s operating environment. Juan Sanabria : And so, is the convenient were for regards to 6 charge or what is the new convenient level, and if you can comment what did you guys get in return for the change for that governance? Thomas DeRosa : So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to talk about specific numbers Juan, but there is the fixed charge coverage, there is an interest coverage, there is a leverage convenient, liquidity, networks, I mean there are number of covenants that hit all the key factors on our corporate credit. And for us there is a master lease payment coverage as well. Juan Sanabria : Okay and then on Genesis you talked about the lenders being supportive of potential buyers of any assets that you are looking to sell. What you are seeing in terms of lenders and what kind of coverage levels do they want and may be you can comment on, how that is relative to your expectations? Or how your Genesis portfolio will look as the year progresses, given I think you said that the second quarter were strong, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a one quarter trailing or kind of a as of today. Thomas DeRosa : Yes Juan One on the payment coverage, we are talking about, because we always report on a trailing 12 month basis but also on a one quarter lag, so the number that you see in our reports is, it can be a bit miss leading. So when I talked about the second quarter being strong I\u2019m talking literally about the three months from April 1 to June 30 and that the performance in those 90 days was a nice improvement over the prior two quarters which is encouraging to us. In terms of the payment coverage the lenders are looking for and the same is true of the buyer pool and it tends to be in the 1.3 times coverage range. So, our coverage today is close to 1.25 so we are slightly below but not in any material way, which gives us additional comfort that these are very saleable assets particularly now that the Genesis corporate profile is a lot less uncertain than it was a week ago. Juan Sanabria : And just last quick one from me, you guys have obviously substantially exposure to Genesis and if you were to do call it a $1 billion of dispositions over the next 12 months or whatever the timeframe may be. Are you still ruling out a potential spin of whatever may remain after kind of an initial larger transaction? Thomas DeRosa : Yes, we are. Juan Sanabria : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. Just another Genesis question, I mean you\u2019ve said that one of the motivations here to do the term loan to become a term loan there was to remove other lender parties from discussion table make it easier when trying to sell a chunk of the Genesis real estate in deals where Genesis would stay the tenant. So I guess some of that motivation, but it is skeptic to say it looks like no other lenders were willing to step on new term loan besides you and Omega. And then looking at the LIBOR plus 13% rate doesn\u2019t that signal a very weak credit profile and that you were forced into becoming a lender of last reserve here? Scott Brinker : Hey Nick its Scott. It\u2019s interesting that where we thought about the term loan is that it\u2019s not a core business, so 98% plus or minus of what we do is high quality real estate. So you are not going to see us do things like this so often on occasion to accomplish a longer-term bigger goal we will extend a loan and we have a good history of having those loans repaid. And in this situation we can\u2019t speak for Omega, but for Welltower we told George and his team to go out and talk to the marketplace see what a third party was willing to lend and we would be going to match it and that\u2019s what we did. Because this is an important security and the Genesis capital structure and we prefer to control it rather than have a hostile third-party be in that position holding the parts even though they have 1% or less of the capital at risk. So the situation existed a week ago to us was untenable and was not allowing us to accomplish important goals and was distracting Genesis, but we did not do a below market loan, we didn\u2019t do an above market loan this is a market rate clearly it\u2019s not a AAA credit. So we are being paid for the risk that we are taking. Nicholas Yulico : And then, what is the incentive for Genesis at this point to go out and try to refinance the term loans right and it sounds like you guys want to be the term loan near term because it helps with some asset sales helps short Genesis. But, why if the rate is market what is the incentive for Genesis to go out and refinance this with new term lenders? Thomas DeRosa : So regards with who the lender as one looks at one capital sac, you want to payoff to the highest cost that you can. So I would say that given that Scott said this is market terms of this kind of paper, it\u2019s always going to be the type of paper that management what is to get rid of as soon as possible so. Scott Brinker : And our maturity at December of 2017 to another consideration exactly. Thomas DeRosa : Exactly. Nicholas Yulico : Okay thanks and just going to be the Vintage deal, could you just talk a little bit more about the time, you think it\u2019s going to take to get, from the going yield the 30% NOI outside to get to mid six yield and I forget you said what the occupancy today that portfolio is ? Thomas DeRosa : Yes Nick the occupancy today is in the 84% to 85% range to bit lower in Southern California, then it is in Northern California and it\u2019s going to take a couple of years. This isn\u2019t unlike redevelopment opportunity and we think given the locations in this scale the 6.5% to 7% stabilized yield is more than adequate return for this type of opportunity and then in longer-term. We think it\u2019s fits right into the profile of inflation plus outperformance. So this is not a [indiscernible] investment for us, this is continuing to built on a really important footprint in great market. Scott Estes : I think that\u2019s what is exciting about this acquisition is that while Genesis has been doing a good job. We think that the scale being that we already have in those markets and the operational efficiencies that being part of the Welltower, Umbrella bring to any asset in our portfolio, was the very reason why you see our performance leading the industry. It\u2019s not magic, it\u2019s hard work and believe, we bring tremendous synergies with the other pieces of our portfolio to the with this portfolio and we think that will benefit our shareholders over time. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks everyone. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you and you guys have pretty solid central growth in the operating portfolio again this quarter ahead of some of our peers. So you continue to show sort of a result there, I\u2019m just wondering on the expenses side, was anything one-time in that comp expense, I think it was up 6% and what should we assume sort of a good run rate over the next few quarters on expenses? Thomas DeRosa : Yes Vik, there is always a usual, it\u2019s one reason that we try not to focus too much on 90 days increments of time, well that\u2019s a plus or a minus with this many properties, there is always something that usually going on but. We don\u2019t really move those in or out, the pool is the pool, if there are any adjustments that are particularly unusual, we tell you exactly what we did in the supplemental. So the numbers are always going be a little bit was also, let\u2019s say triple that lease. The compensation for sure is escalated this year, particularly in the UK, in the US, we talked about that at length. It\u2019s in our projections for the year and those expectations are being meet. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s good or bad, but we actually predicted the cost would be up quite a bit with respect to labor. The fact is we are in core markets that are at the leading edge of the change and the minimum wage like San Francisco and New York and Los Angeles. And the benefit is we have the pricing power to offset that. So we can\u2019t view these things in isolation and our performance to-date is showing that the revenue growth has been enough to offset the cost growth and still deliver really good performance. Scott Estes : Yes, I think just look at the occupancy the fact that our occupancy increased across the portfolio a 100 basis points as we are pushing rate growth that is not what you see across the industry. It is what we are able to do because of what we own, how our operators manage and the benefits that the Welltower platform gives to the portfolio. That\u2019s why we get those results. Vikram Malhotra : Fair point. And just more broadly on the shop portfolio you are now at what 37%, 38% can you may be just give us some color on the opportunity set just going forward for similar types of large transactions that you just announced. And where do you want to see this segment of the business going in terms of business mix? Thomas DeRosa : Vik there aren\u2019t many opportunities of this scale sort of most of what you\u2019ll see from Welltower in terms of investments in everyday portfolio will be select acquisitions that are in core markets and new development and virtually every one of our 10 U.S. RIDEA partners is actively doing new development between two and five properties a year. sometimes they do it alongside of us sometimes we have an option to buy when it opens or when it stabilizes. So you are much more likely to see us to one at a time, two at a time acquisition and development to grow that portfolio going forward. But there always a handful of portfolios that are interesting to us or that may be aggregated overtime. But there is nothing else out there like this Vintage portfolio in terms of its scale in core markets. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. And then just last one thanks for the Triple-net coverage you have mapped of, realty useful. I am just wondering how what our operators think today when they look at when they look to enter into deals or they look at their own coverages which fits some cases may be 1.1 or below 1.1 on an EBITDAR basis. What are they saying about the level of coverage doing new deals or do you seeing some operator say, hey we need to rethink about structuring the deal? Thomas DeRosa : I think so Vik. When I started doing this 14-years ago the typical coverage for seniors housing was in the 1.25 or higher range and to us that was a structure that made sense for the landlord and the tenant and this has become more competitive the coverage ratio have declined and declined and 1.1 today is sort of the market. And for years operators are going to enter into leases at those coverages. Frankly we were not doing many if any acquisitions at those coverages. We have been saying for years now that to us the distinction of risk in focusing on triple-net versus RIDEA was really not the way we think about risk. And we would always prefer to own a Class A asset in class A market and deal with the quarter-to-quarter variation in results and that\u2019s exactly why you\u2019ve seen us concentrate our investments were you have for the past six years. We have various yield triple-net investments, when we do it tends to be a new development, were there is an opportunity and enough profit, in the development for there to be strong opinion coverage or a turn on opportunity. We are just, we don\u2019t like the thought of doing big acquisitions to near one coverage. It looks straight on the press release because you got great structural protection here so got structural protection, but we seen already that there is don\u2019t always out as plan and, if the deal doesn\u2019t work for both parties, it eventually doesn\u2019t work for either party. And I think you have seen that and to us to market coverage\u2019s ratio is today are not appropriate and there is not enough for the balance between risk and rewards for the tenants. Scott Estes : You have seen often the operators is getting frustrated, when once at the profitability is going into the ramp and we find that it\u2019s much more constructive to have the RIDEA structure where you are both incentivize to try the NOI share in the CapEx and you want to drive the performance as supposed to try and find some means that starching out profitability when it\u2019s right around one, one to one. Scott Brinker : Yes now that the great point and I think the other thing that is, just understand that we have built and infrastructure here over the last five-year that really allows us to maximize the performance along with the operator of the RIDEA assets. So I think that\u2019s a key point that you have to consider, going forward. There will be a rare occasion that we will, you will see as acquire seniors housing assets in a triple-net lease structure. You might expect to see some of the triple-net lease assets we own moved to our idea structure, if that\u2019s the possibility in the future I think , we think it\u2019s better for us, we think it\u2019s better for the operator, we think it\u2019s better for our shareholders. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. Thank you guys and congrats on a strong quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Just wanted the follow-up on Juan\u2019s question about, some of the changes to the covenants and if HCN actually received anything in consideration for that? Scott Brinker : Tayo, it\u2019s Scott speaking. There are a long list of projects that we are working on. With Genesis some of them disclosed, some haven\u2019t, and it\u2019s fair to say that the term loan is well as to covenant really were part of a much broader discussion. So we are not prepared to talk about this specific pluses and minuses. I would just ask, you to have patients, give us time, we are clearly focused on the situation and there is a much bigger picture that we are focused on than covenant release and a term loan. Tayo Okusanya : Okay, fair enough. And then did you do anything similar to what Sabra did in regards to changing the least maturities as well to kind of help Genesis have a staggered maturity schedule? Scott Brinker : Well I can\u2019t speak for the details of what Genesis and Sabra agreed to. I can tell you that all 180 plus reminders of our properties are in one mass release that matures in 2032. So the maturity date is not something we are not worried about. Tayo Okusanya : Okay helpful. And then last one for me. I know you guys have always kind of be in and out of life sciences for while, we've kind of went off through this [Waxford] (Ph) transaction. I guess that was a little bit surprised to see them do it and probably now you guys have given you already got experience with life sciences and you\u2019ve always kind of expressed an interest in it. But, had expressed frustration you couldn\u2019t grow in the past. So just some thoughts around that transaction, did you look at it and why didn\u2019t you do it if you did indeed look at it? Scott Brinker : Well we will only invest in real estate that\u2019s in core markets, that\u2019s part of our strategy and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve heard us say that we want to invest in life science related buildings. We told you when we did the deal with Four City in Cambridge that was an opportunistic investments and it was an opportunistic sales. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve heard us say that we had any interest in getting into the life sciences real estate business. Tayo Okusanya : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore from Stifel. Chad Vanacore : Hey good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. On that Vintage acquisition what is the mix of stabilized versus reset opportunities? And then what kind of occupancy increases are you assuming to go from that 5% in place GAAP rate for the mix expectation? Scott Estes : Hey Chad it\u2019s Scott. Occupancy today is in the low to mid 80s and our portfolio in this market - pardon me. Chad Vanacore : Did that get to up above 90s to get your in place stabilized assumptions? Scott Estes : Yes, that\u2019s right Chad in the low 90s which is where we are today in these markets with our operating partners. Chad Vanacore : All right and then what kind of a break assumptions are we making there? Scott Estes : Yes in terms of the percentage stabilized versus unsterilized, I would probably think about it a little bit differently. There are properties that we think have the opportunity to grow senses pretty materially. And almost across the board we feel like there are opportunities to change the service mix, the service level, and change the value proposition pretty dramatically for the residence. So that\u2019s in addition to the occupancy upside it\u2019s really on the rate and service level that we see the portfolio changing the most over the years, but that will take some time. And it is a drag in the earlier years because you\u2019ve got to put the new service platform in place before you can charge for it. All right, people need to see it before they will pay for it and it takes time turn over the population. So this is a long-term investment for us, the 5% cap rate is accretive day one, but the fact is where cost of capital is today it\u2019s probably is accretive 5% this is very much a long-term play for us. Thomas DeRosa : You said differently the way I think about it Chad you really do have the opportunity for four to five years for mid to high-single-digit NOI growth for the year after spending those additional dollars. Chad Vanacore : All right, thanks. And then just one more. So, Scott you made a comment that increasing private sale reduced exposure with the priority I think a quarter or two ago you guys may have made a comment that that Sniff actually look like the best value at the time to you. Can you reconcile where we are today? Scott Estes : I don\u2019t recall anybody saying that Sniffs were an area that we wanted to invest in. We said that we are comfortable managing our Sniff portfolio that\u2019s operated by Genesis, but I don\u2019t think you have heard us\u2026 Chad Vanacore : Probably kind of the general pricing environment on\u2026 Scott Estes : I would just say Chad that the skilled nursing environment is still one that is attracting in investments dollar, it\u2019s just as we think about the direction of our company, it\u2019s probably does not in Welltowers portfolio. So that is the population that uses those properties, it\u2019s going to double in size over 20-years and the supply of properties is declining. So when you think about the longer-term rather than the next three quarters or the three months. I think the supply demand dynamics are still quite favorable for that business despite the headwinds that exist. And in a world with yield that are pushing zero percent in most developed economies. You can still price skilled nursing in the high-single-digits unlevered, and get attractive financing. And it generates an awfully attractive return on equity immediately and the payment coverage is unlike seniors housing, were they are awfully low with 1.3 times coverage, it\u2019s a pretty stable yield, particularly if you own good real-estate with two good operator. So look it is actually still is a good investment. It\u2019s just not for us. Thomas DeRosa : I would even remind everybody, I think it\u2019s important, where everyone is still focused on Genesis, we actually and even today we just announced an incremental progress on disposing a skilled nursing assets. So within our 1.3 billion of projected disposition proceeds about 60% or so of that is skilled nursing and pro forma for what we have announced through today, we are already at 90% private pay. So Genesis is just a little bit of part of those numbers currently, but we are actually seeing those reasonable prices, we have 760 some million of potential proceeds, some asset held-for-sale in that low 9s kind of cap rate. And that\u2019s kind of, I think a good example of how we are continuing to improve the quality of the portfolio. Chad Vanacore : All right guys. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi thanks. I just wanted to ask you about how you are thinking, if any change is about your investment in the UK, if you want you may be bring that down, given their pending exit from the EU or does it change the way you think about in investing there going forward or is it too soon to tell? Thomas DeRosa : Yes, I think that you just answered the part of the question. Yes I think it is too soon to tell, I think we have seen a very different view of the impact of the Brexit over the couple weeks. The thing you have to understand as 99% of the population in our building are UK residence. So they are not leaving the UK, because of Brexit. The UK is not going to be building new assisted leaving assets for its population. More and more of the UK residence will have to turn to a private pay alternatives to local authority funded elder care. And the bulk of our assets are in the London Metro Politian area, which I don\u2019t think you bet against London long-term. I think London has had a 30-year head start on building an irreplaceable infrastructure, an economic machine that will prevail regards what of what happens here. So I don\u2019t think we are losing sleep over it. I think there are some challenges, you have heard us talk about on the wage side in the UK, but we continue to manage through that again for the same reasons why we are managing through that in the U.S. I said we have the best located real estate with the best operators and people want to live in this portfolio. So at the same time, we are watching what is happening in the UK and Europe very closely. But at the end I would tell you that we have assembled a really great portfolio of assets there. Smedes Rose : All right that makes sense. I think you guys did the rest of them so thank you. I appreciate it. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks. Scott Estes : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Canaccord. Paul Morgan : Hi good morning. Just a couple of quick things. So on your, you mentioned that you are trending towards high-end of your full-year same-store NOI guidance and I think that still implies may be around 50 basis points of deceleration, if I have that right. Would you think that\u2019s accurate and if so are there any factors of markets that might be driving that in your outlook? Scott Estes : First quarter I think it 3.8% blended to 3.3%, averages to about 3.5% and I think in short we like to keep a little bit of conservatism in there and are attracting toward the higher end of the range. So really the only variable is again around the operating portfolio, but we feel like it\u2019s doing pretty well. So we are hopeful we would again be able to come in toward the high end of that range at this point or may be in a little better. Paul Morgan : Okay. Great and then on Genesis I think you mentioned that one of the reasons for coverage decline was based on held-for-sale assets and so I might have thought that the sale assets would have lover coverage is that just specific to the deals or is there anything - kind of is there any color there you can offer? Thomas DeRosa : Yes, it\u2019s more because among the assets that are being sold are in-patient rehab hospitals that have particularly high values in extremely high payment coverages. So that\u2019s what is driving it and it\u2019s not a huge portfolio at the end of the day. So if you sell a $60 million, $70 million property that has three times payment coverage unfortunately impacts the portfolio about two or three basis points and that\u2019s what happens. Paul Morgan : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly going back to bench, sorry if you mentioned this and I missed it. But is there anything in terms of a contribution to the ramping yield to stick to the stabilized level that\u2019s coming from the cost side as you roll those assets into your platform in those markets or is it all really occupancy in REIT? Thomas DeRosa : Yes, it\u2019s more driven by revenue in this case one property 13 taxes have a impact immediately, the minimum wage is an issue in a lot of these markets so we have budgeted for that and our operating partners expect to increase of the service level and not decrease it. So it\u2019s not like we are assuming big expense cuts, it\u2019s really just the opposite here. Paul Morgan : Yes. Okay. Great thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Muller from JP Morgan. Michael Muller : Spent a little bit of time, Tom I think at the beginning of the call talking about performance in the core markets and hitting at and talking about how after Vintage I think core markets are going to be 60% at the end of NOI for senior housing or for the operating portfolio. And I guess just given the disconnect in terms of performance that you are seeing between the six core markets and everything else. Should we expect ramp up asset sales in those non-core markets over time? Thomas DeRosa : Well Mike, we like what we own across the portfolio, but that\u2019s how it\u2019s changing. What today is the good market may not be a great market in the future, so expect that we are always looking for opportunities to recycle capital and constantly improve the quality of the portfolio. I would say that we are laser focused on building scale in the top markets in the country. You know Scott mentioned that the six of the sexy six is DC where we are number two, but expect that we are very focused on building scale in DC. And a number of our operators have development properties being the constructed in the greater DC market that\u2019s an important market for us. But you have heard us say this before, we are looking to go deep in the top core market in the three country, in which we operate and get as close to the centre of the core as possible, which is not typically where you found senior housing assets. So that speaks to what we are doing in New York city, which we talked about on our last call. And it speaks to some of the things; we are doing in market quite Toronto very much in the centre of the urban market there. You will see on assets, we are either own today or developing in Los Angelis. So it\u2019s very much our strategy, expect you are going to continue to us to follow that strategy and the other piece of this, which you will be hearing more about in the future is, how we are connecting what we do to the major health systems in those core markets. Scott Estes : The one thing I would add - Mike its Scott Estes. I think it\u2019s important that, because what Tom just said, we have here at visits, investing methodology and I think we see less variability between the portfolio, I think we start talking about the six core markets that\u2019s used is generally in industry. But, I remember when Scott Brinker had some color during the first quarter think about our same-store RIDEA NOI growth was 5%, 5.5%. The best markets were 7%, 8%, the low were 2% or 3% all positive. And around the 4% this quarter, we don\u2019t see why variability and no big negatives or anything, we don\u2019t dislike any market. I think it\u2019s important that we feel a pretty about the market we are in. Scott Brinker : Yes when we talk about performance, we talk about the entire portfolio, we are not bifurcating our portfolio. We generally like the markets we are in, we are skewed to the core markets. It\u2019s not a 100% of what we own, but we have edited the portfolio, over many year and that\u2019s why our performance is better. Because we don\u2019t have a lot of weak links in our portfolio, that is one of the key differentiators of the Welltower business mode. Again, it\u2019s not magic, that our same-store numbers are what they are, it\u2019s because we have better assets and much fewer lower quality assets Michael Muller : Got it and just one quick follow-up on the Vintage, the $1.5 billion investment does that capture everything as you go through this, you know $5 billion yield ramp up to $6.5 million or is there is an incremental spend above and beyond that to get there? Scott Estes : Yes Mike it starts at $1.15 billion and there is some capital that needs to be put into a couple of buildings in particular, but that\u2019s accounted for when we talk about a stabilized yield in the 6.5% to 7% range. Michael Muller : That number is fully loaded. Okay. Scott Estes : Yes, correct. Michael Muller : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of [Andrew Rosawitz] (Ph) from Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : Hey thanks. It\u2019s late so I will talk really fast. On Genesis, I wanted to ask about the [facility] (Ph) EBITDA coverage. Because it\u2019s interesting if you look at 1.57 it\u2019s actually being constant for over a year and does that imply that basically the operator property level EBITDA on a same store basis has been flat over the last year which would appear to be a lot better than the overall commentary for the skill nursing industry and also Genesis\u2019 portfolio overall? Scott Estes : Yes Andrew this is Scott speaking. We have commented in the past and we\u2019ll do it again. Our properties have performed quite well over the past four years there is a 3.5% lease escalator in our master lease that\u2019s a high bar for Genesis to climb over every year now next year that goes to 3% so a bit of relief from their standpoint. But our coverage is other than in 2011 when Medicare cut reimbursement substantially have been very consistent over the past four years. And we think\u2026 Unidentified Analyst : I guess a follow up is how are they able to do that and one thing I thought about it there is a difference between because you are not in the ex-Sun asset right, you are not in the ex-skilled assets is that kind of legacy Genesis doing better? Scott Estes : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Just curious, is there a reason why? Scott Estes : They have huge geographic scale in these markets so we are concentrated in New England in the Mid Atlantic they have been there for decades they have their referral networks the brand, the staffing and it\u2019s good real estate. So I don\u2019t know as much about the Sun portfolio or the skilled health portfolio we don\u2019t own those assets. We do own their core legacy assets and they have held in quite well, which is why keep saying we are confident that there will be interest for our real estate. And the issue was clearing up the corporate credit situation, because they have done three or four big acquisitions in the past three years that on hindsight may be not all the assets were perfect and they did use a lot of debt to finance them. So the corporate credit isn\u2019t as strong as it could be despite strong performance in our real estate. Thomas DeRosa : But Andrew thanks for noticing. Unidentified Analyst : Any time. Thanks for taking the question guys. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender from Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Did you talk about what types of leases you will enter into sort of Vintage deal just across the three operators and maybe it is a mix of RIDEA or a triple-net? Scott Estes : Hey Todd its Scott. These are all RIDEA structures, so no leases. Todd Stender : Okay. Thanks. And about the rent coverage, can you tell us what the rent coverage was in a trailing basis and that what you underwrote it at? Scott Estes : For the Vintage portfolio Todd? Todd Stender : Yes and may be bifurcated between independent living and assisted living if you can? Scott Estes : So There may be some confusion, we are using the RIDEA structure, so this is just management contracts there is no lease or payment coverage in place. Todd Stender : Okay, can you tell what it was covering at? Scott Estes : It was owned by a different operator and a different owner. Sorry I\u2019m not sure even how they deal with structure... Scott Brinker : We are just looking at from how we underwrite it and we are happy to help walk you through that offline if you would like. Todd Stender : Got it okay, and how the funding sources, I know disposition proceeds are going to be factored in having any assumed debt? Scott Estes : There is real small amount of that we have seen that like $35 million in the low force, with a eight year maturity, so there was its cash. Thomas DeRosa : And we are in a good place from a cash position Todd, with almost a billion of pending dispositions and $467 million of cash on balance sheet currently. Todd Stender : Great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question come from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thanks good morning. I was wondering if you could provide some on color on the asset held-for-sale as were as composition, skilled nursing, senior housing and MOB? Scott Estes : I have that, John now are you doing? Its Scott Estes. I would say it is about half skilled nursing and then the other 25% is about evenly split between 11 medical office buildings are in that pool and some triple-net seniors housing. Probably it will happen more heavily into the third quarter as well. I didn\u2019t comment too much on that, but again our guidance was flat. You have $300 million of incremental disposition largely in the third quarter, about evenly offset by the benefits of the vintage acquisition that\u2019s probably more towards the later part of the year, end of the fourth quarter, plus some better operating performance kind of netted each other. John Kim : Great and then a couple of follow ups on the Vintage acquisition, can you discuss a number of units in this portfolio, average age and also if there any development expansion opportunity? Scott Estes : There are 19 properties, 2600 units, there is excess land at particular properties, but we will focus for on selling the buildings that we have and was there another question John? John Kim : Average age and development expansion? Scott Estes : Most of the buildings are in the 10 to 15-year range, there are couple of other buildings that have been completely redeveloped and renovated including one in San Francisco that technically is 100 years old, but if you walked in it [indiscernible] so. It\u2019s sort of material those off the average, but most of them were built in sort of the late 1990s early 2000s. John Kim : And development? Scott Estes : Oh sorry, I thought I covered that. There is excess land at particular campuses, but that\u2019s not part of our expectation right now, we want to focus on maximizing the value of the existing buildings. John Kim : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson -from MUFG Securities Richard Anderson : No Mizuho, but anyway. What doers Vintage get you to from a RIDEA prospective, as you are 38% now where do you get to? Scott Estes : Well I guess it depends how many dispositions we have, but it could easily be in the low 40\u2019s Rich. Richard Anderson : Okay and. And what would you comment be just in terms of the elevated profile risk profile that that would suggest in an uncertain economic environment and so on. How would you respond to that? Scott Estes : We don\u2019t think it elevates the risk profile, because we have very seasoned operators and an infrastructure to manage RIDEA assets that\u2019s unparallel and we feel much more comfortable in our ability to manage our RIDEA assets than we might with certain triple-net just by the nature of how the ownership is structured. We think that not that we would say that triple-net is necessarily riskier, but we think we know how to manage risk and enhance value through a RIDEA structure better than anybody. Richard Anderson : Okay. I would be quicker. I would like to talk about rack audits. so but I do want to talk about Genesis and is it first of all true that whatever else you may sell after the $68 million that kind of have on under contract will be just real estate, it will be areas where Genesis plans to stay and continue to operate those buildings, is that correct? Thomas DeRosa : That\u2019s mostly correct Rich, there may be handful of properties 10 plus or minus they would prefer not to be in. So there are some states like Ohio and Kentucky where they have got a very small footprint and prefer to exit. We are the landlord on those and we would be happy to participate in a complete exit from those properties otherwise, yes, they will remain the operator. Richard Anderson : Okay. So if that\u2019s true and by the way did you give a cap rate that you are expecting on the $68 million is it in the nines or tens? Thomas DeRosa : No, it\u2019s lower than that, but what Scott gave is the blended yield for the entire held-for-sale bucket is in the low nines. Richard Anderson : Okay. So my question is if Genesis plans to stay in the majority of the stuff that you may sell in the future. That would indicate that these are pretty good assets and I think you probably are going to agree that without any question. So like if you were a private investors as oppose to a publicly traded REIT, could you see yourself sort of taking a shot and committing more to Genesis and working with them through this. Particularly since these assets that may be sold or assets they are big welcomed to maintain operations in. I\u2019m just curious like is the publicly traded element of your story at all driving your decision to be a seller and what can be argued a pretty inopportune time right now at this point in the cycle? Thomas DeRosa : That was also an opportune. Richard Anderson : Well, it\u2019s not a great time for skill nursing, we can all agree with that. Thomas DeRosa : I haven\u2019t seen it that much from when we bought it. I mean I guess the point is the cap rates and the payment coverages haven\u2019t really changed over the years. So we can talk about it when we actually announce something Rich, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that when you compare the cap rates hit the property level when we entered portfolio six years ago to what we think we can exit at, they are awfully similar. So I\u2019m not sure what is happening elsewhere whether it\u2019s in the [indiscernible] or inside Genesis, but our properties I think are quite valuable and we are seeing a lot of interest from buyers. Richard Anderson : Then why sell them? Thomas DeRosa : Well, today we announced another fantastic quarter and we spent 90% of the call talking about Genesis. Richard Anderson : Sorry. Thomas DeRosa : Let\u2019s now talk about rack audits. Richard Anderson : Okay. That\u2019s all I have. I won\u2019t keep it going. Thanks very much. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks Rich. Operator : We have now reached the end of today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line and have a great day.",

My name is Holly and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Jeff Miller : Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Welltower's third quarter 2016 conference call. If you did not receive a copy of the news release that's distributed this morning, you may access it via the company's website at Welltower.com. We are holding a live webcast of today's call which may be accessed through the Company's website. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call maybe deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the news release and from time to time in the Company's filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Tom DeRosa, our CEO. Tom? Tom DeRosa : Thank you, Jeff. I'm pleased that the strong results we announced today reflect solid operating performance across all business segments as well as strategic capital allocation decisions. Normalized FFO and FAD were up 4% and 5%, respectively. These excellent results were driven by core growth, same-store NOI was up 2.6% and our track record of making accretive investments. Our Class A healthcare real estate concentrated in major markets has consistently demonstrated resilience. And in a year where wage pressures of challenging operators across the senior care industry as well as new supply coming into many secondary markets, we are confident in our position and we are raising 2016 same-store NOI guidance to 3% to 3.25%. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our senior housing operating portfolio. Year-to-date same-store NOI growth in this business is averaged 3.9% relative to our initial guidance of 2% to 3%. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, these assets saw a strong occupancy increase of 70 basis points and rental rate growth of 4%. Offsetting these strong top line results has been wage increases, which have been growing at 6% plus year-to-date. Our focus on major markets allows us to pass along much of this expense growth to the consumer and same-store NOI growth for our operating portfolio resulted in an expected 2.2% increase for the quarter. Wage inflation is not unique to the senior care industry. Its impact has been felt across all sectors of healthcare. This creates particularly unique challenges for government reimbursement focused models that do not have the same ability to pass along increases in operating expenses. This is another reason behind Welltower strategy of focusing on private pay sectors. You all know the aging demographic wave were positively impact utilization across all sectors of healthcare. Welltower, however, is capitalizing on this demographic trend by investing in healthcare assets where commercial forces determine price and where market forces limit supply. Given that let me make a few comments regarding our capital allocation strategy and the press releases we issued this morning. The execution of the announced asset sales will have the effect of meaningfully reducing our government pay exposure and significantly lowering our leverage in order to create future capacity and seize opportunities that may result from unpredictable central bank actions and expected interest rate increases. Our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet were rewarded this morning by S&P with an upgrade in our credit rating to BBB+. We are delighted with this news as I'm sure our bondholders are as well. We are a long-term investor in healthcare real estate and believe that skilled nursing, while historically a more volatile asset class will remain an important component of the healthcare delivery continuum. Given our strategy to increase private pay sources of revenue, we indicated that we would explore interest we were seeing from private real estate buyers looking to establish position in this sector. We listened to and considered the views of our shareholders and undertook a thoughtful and measured approach. This led to numerous discussions that have resulted in a series of transactions that will take out private pay revenue mix up to 92.4% and long-term post acute care concentration from 19.9% down to 13.5% of NOI. Combine this with our sector leading balance sheet and you have a stable shift that is positioned to seize external growth opportunities as they arise and drive continued sector leading operating performance. I want to thank our shareholders for their confidence in allowing us to take a patient approach to unlocking significant value for these dispositions. Welltower takes great pride in the capital partnership we established last year with CPPIB. This partnernship not only diversifies our source of funding, but also validates healthcare real estate as a true institutional asset class. Today, we welcome our first China based institutional partner, Cindat, to the Welltower family through our joint venture investment in post acute long-term care and seniors housing. Cindat\u2019s vision and significant interest in the U.S. healthcare real estate sector exemplifies the natural fit between long-term investors seeking returns driven by unmatched demographic trends. We could not be more pleased to be working with these fine partners. With that I will pass the mic to Scott Brinker to shed additional light on our operating performance and acquisition and disposition activities. Scott? Scott Brinker : Okay, thank you, Tom. Good morning to everyone. Very happy to tell you about several big steps we've taken to increase our tenant diversification and private pay mix. First, in September, we closed the $1.15 billion vintage acquisition, highlighting our focus on best-in-class real estate. The acquisition solidifies our number-one market share in Northern and Southern California. Both of these markets have outstanding supply and demand fundamentals. We chose to bring in three existing operating partners, SRG, Sunrise, and Silverado to add their unsurpassed local market expertise. Together we will create a lot of value in these communities. And second, this morning we reported a number of dispositions. We've always been an active portfolio manager. That includes selling nearly $1 billion of skilled nursing over the past few years. Those efforts continued last quarter as we sold a non-Genesis skilled portfolio in the Southeast for $300 million. We realized $140 million gain on sale and a 13% unlevered IRR. We have also substantially repositioned our relationship with Genesis in a way that is beneficial to both parties. So far in the fourth quarter we have closed on the sale of $1.2 billion of real estate previously leased to Genesis in two separate transactions. We've also signed a definitive agreement to contribute a third Genesis portfolio into a joint venture with Cindat and Union Life. Cindat is a China-based institutional investor specializing in overseas real estate and Union Life is one of the leading insurance companies in China. Together they will contribute cash for a 75% interest in the venture and Welltower will retain the other 25%. The joint venture also includes 11 seniors housing properties that we currently leased to Brookdale. Those 11 assets are being contributed at a $45 million gain above our original purchase price for the properties. The joint venture is valued at $930 million, roughly 70% of which represents Genesis assets. This is another example of us bringing first-time cross-border capital into the sector to accomplish our strategic objectives. These three Genesis sales aggregate to $1.7 billion in proceeds to Welltower and have a blended cap rate of 9%. The sale price is $180 million above the price we paid for these assets in 2011 and will realize a mid 9% unlevered IRR. Importantly, our long-term post-acute payment coverage will improve because we're selling properties with low coverage. Genesis credit will improve because the leases within new buyers have lower rent and escalators that exist today. The terms of our remaining Genesis master lease will not change, including 3% escalators and at 2032 maturity date. To further strengthen the relationship we\u2019ve also signed a letter of understanding that has two components. First, Genesis will have the right to buy back certain properties from the Welltower master lease. Second, we will jointly market the real estate and operations of 14 non-core properties. These two transactions should generate 600 plus million of additional proceeds to Welltower in 2017 and further improve out private pay mix and tenant diversification. Below the headlines our unique relationship-based business model continues without interruption. We are known for owning high-barrier real estate, which is true, but it's the breadth and depth of these relationships that make our strategy so hard to replicate. More than 20 of the leading operators in the sector come to us first when they find an opportunity in their local markets. More and more institutional capital is flowing in the sector, so the ability to get a first look is invaluable. As an example, last quarter we exercised purchase options on two recently stabilized senior housing properties developed and operated by a longtime partner for an attractive 7.25% cap rate. Turning to operating results, we delivered a solid quarter, given the environment. Same-store NOI in the operating portfolio was 2.2%, rental rates were up 4%, and occupancy increased 70 basis points over the prior year. This allowed us to offset higher labor costs, which were a headwind as expected. Pricing power is critically important right now and that means owning a lot of real estate in markets like California. It's also important to understand that, unlike many other real estate sectors the new supply in seniors housing is more heavily concentrated in low-barrier markets. In fact, the percentage increase in new supply in our core markets has been less than the remainder of the country in every single year that NIC has tracked the data. To that point, the industry data shows the broad-brush commentary about the sector is misleading. And quarter after quarter in our own portfolio we see wide variance by market with clear outperformance from our core markets. Turning to medical office, we\u2019ve been allocating capital to this business for the past 10 years. Today we are one of the largest owners in the sector. We have always liked the outpatient business because of its convenience for customers and its low cost for payers and providers. We shelf manage virtually the entire portfolio. Mike Noto and his team are invaluable when underwriting new investments, as their market knowledge is unsurpassed. They also do a terrific job creating steady, predictable growth. Last quarter same-store NOI grew 2.5%, consistent with prior quarters. That platform is also scalable, evidenced by increased operating margins as we've grown the portfolio. Moving to triple net seniors housing, same-store NOI increased 2.6% and payment coverage continues to move higher through improved operating performance and active portfolio management. The long-term post-acute portfolio had another strong quarter. Same-store NOI increased 3.4%. Payment coverage should improve by roughly 10 basis points upon completion of the 2016 dispositions, creating an even more secure income stream for Welltower. I want to wrap up by sincerely thanking the Welltower team as well as our operating partners. The past few quarters, in particular, have required trust and perseverance. It was exhausting but also a lot of fun to watch them together rise to the challenge. The true test of a relationship. And now, over to Scott Estes. Scott Estes : My comments today focus on the significant balance sheet and portfolio enhancements that are expected as a result of our portfolio repositioning plan announced this morning. Today's announcements are the culmination of the capital allocation plan we've been discussing with all of you throughout 2016, which should importantly provide the following three benefits. First, we will significantly strengthen our balance sheet, with leverage and credit metrics improving to the strongest levels in the modern history of the company. Second, we will enhance the quality of our portfolio, increasing our private pay mix in reducing our long-term care exposure. And third, we will improve our liquidity and financial flexibility in 2017 with our full $3 billion line of credit available, virtually no near-term debt maturities and an expected improvement in our cost of capital. I will begin my more detailed remarks with perspective on our third-quarter financial results, our 2017 dividend payment rate and one addition we made to the supplement this quarter. In terms of third-quarter earnings, we did our normalized FFO of $1.16 per share and 4% versus last year and normalized fit of $1.04 per share, which increased 5% versus last year. The results were driven primarily by our same-store cash NOI growth and the $2.6 billion of net investments completed over the last four quarters. The highlight of the quarter was closing the $1.15 billion vintage portfolio acquisition earlier than anticipated. G&A of $36.8 million for the quarter came in slightly below our expectations. We recognize the significant $162 million of gains on sale. We did have $9.7 million of impairments associated with three small assets that are held for sale based on current price expectations. I think otherwise this was a fairly straight forward quarterly report. Moving on to dividends, we will pay our 182nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend on November 21 of $0.86 per share, a rate of $3.44 annually and a current dividend yield of 5.1%. Our sizable disposition expectations were a significant consideration as we set our dividend policy for 2017. Based on the strength of our platform and confidence in our longer term earnings growth potential beyond 2017, we are announcing a 1.2% increase in our 2017 dividend payment rate today that will commence with the February payment. We also made one notable addition to the supplement this quarter, which is on the bottom of Page 16, where we are now providing the NOI contribution from the 13 core markets that comprise 57% of our idea portfolio. Turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet, the most significant capital event this quarter was our decision to opportunistically raise a total of $358 million of equity through a combination of our ATM and the RIP programs, where we issued a total of 4.7 million shares at an average price of $6.98 per share. We also generated $489 million of proceeds, through $60 million in loan payoffs and $429 million of property sales, which included $162 million in gains on sale. Last, we did repay approximately $191 million of secure debt at a blended rate of 5.4% and we issued our assumed $79 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 3.7%. However, really the biggest story today is how we expect to improve our balance sheet upon completion of our portfolio repositioning plan. Importantly, we expect to use $2.8 billion of the $3.3 billion in disposition proceeds expected in the fourth quarter to pay down debt and preferred stock. This will greatly strengthen our balance sheet on a pro forma basis. More specifically, net debt to underappreciated book capitalization will decline by roughly four percentage points to the 34% area. Net debt adjusted EBITDA will decline to approximately 5.1 times and interest and fix charge coverage will improve to 4.4 times and 3.6 times respectively. Most importantly, these balance sheet enhancements should improve our cost of capital, allow us to be entirely self funding over the near-term and provide considerable financial flexibility and optionality for the company over the next several years. I was also excited that S&P recognized our improving balance sheet strength with the rating increase this morning which brings Welltower to the BBB+ equivalent rating with all three agencies. I\u2019ll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2016 guidance. Regarding investments, our 2016 guidance does include an addition of $314 million of acquisitions and loans, at a 7.2% blended yield expected to close in the fourth quarter. We don\u2019t normally provide future acquisitions in our guidance, but we\u2019re doing so this quarter to allow us to provide the pro forma detail for the expected use of disposition proceeds that\u2019s included in our portfolio repositioning press release. In regard to dispositions we\u2019ve increased our disposition forecast for the full year to $4.1 billion from the previous $1.3 billion. Our new forecast is comprised of the $832 million in proceeds received through the third quarter, plus the remaining $3.3 billion detailed in our portfolio repositioning release. As the $3.3 billion is comprised of approximately $1.9 billion of proceeds from long-term care postacute assets, $1.2 billion from senior housing triple net assets, $51 million from senior housing operating assets and 151 \u2013 excuse me $150 million in loan repayments. In terms of our same-store NOI growth, as Tom mentioned, we increasing the low end of our full-year guidance to a range of 3% to 3.25% from the previous range of 2.75% to 3.25%. And I think while you always see some variance from quarter-to-quarter, in our same store results we think it\u2019s increasingly important that everyone focused on the consistency and stability of our same store results on an annual basis. I would note that our senior housing operating portfolio in particular has again demonstrated its consistency this year, generating meaningful occupancy and REVPOR increases in the phase of significant industry supply and expense growth headwind. We continue to effectively mange our G&A expenses and now anticipate that we should come in at or slightly below the low end our original 2016 guidance range of $160 million to $165 million. And with only one quarter remaining in 2016, we\u2019re revising our 2016 normalized FFO guidance to a range of $4.50 to $4.56 per share. And normalized FAD guidance to a range of $3.99 to $4.05 per share, representing 3% and 4% increases respectively at the mid-point. The slight reduction in our FFO mid-point is primarily a function of the increase in our disposition guidance, while the FAD increase is primarily a result of lower CapEx in previously projected. So in conclusion we look forward to the continued execution of portfolio repositioning plan and will provide additional detail on asset sales and debt repurchases as they occur over the next several months. Most importantly, our portfolio repositioning efforts will significantly improve the long-term growth profile of our portfolio while dramatically improving the strength of our balance sheet and financial flexibility heading into 2017. So with that Tom, I\u2019ll turn it over to you for some closing comments. Tom DeRosa : Thanks Scott. So before we open up for questions I like to leave you with the following thought. The announcements that we made this morning further enhance Welltower\u2019s unique opportunity to deploy real estate capital behind the most compelling demographic trend we have seen, the aging of the population. We have fresh capital, we institutional partners of sector leading balance sheet and an unmatched relationship investment model. We could not be more excited about our future. Now Holly, please open up the line for questions. Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good morning, guys. Congratulations on getting a lot done during the quarter maybe I think the first question for Scott. If you could just give us sense of kind of the run rate for FFO post the sales. And you talked a little bit about the dividend, but what the pro forma payout ratio is and why you feel comfortable with that reset number. Scott Brinker : Sure, Juan. Thanks for the question. I do think we provided quite a good bit of detail in regard to sources and uses to provide the pretty good run rate. You can see the disposition proceeds of $3.274 billion and then the specific uses. That's really the numbers I think everyone should use to start thinking about 2017. We will provide guidance in February. Once we get all the models and everything done at that point. The one thing that will benefit 2017 are a couple things beyond what's just in this press release, though. As a reminder, obviously you should model same-store NOI growth. We are going to have some development conversions, and obviously it doesn't include any acquisitions as well. So we give you a fourth-quarter number effectively with our guidance this year and I think I would just model off the in-place NOI from the numbers we give you in the release. Juan Sanabria : Okay. And then on the SNF dispositions, is the cap rate you guys quoted, 9%, is that affected at all by any rate cuts that the buyers have received, or is that the cap rate, i.e., loss NOI to Welltower? And if you would give us a sense of the delta on the reset rents? Scott Brinker : Sure, Juan. It's Scott Brinker. Thanks for listening today. So the cap rate that we quoted is based on the in-place rent that exist today under the current master lease divided by the purchase price from the third party, so pretty straightforward. In terms of the rent adjustment that Genesis received, a goal all along here was to create a better relationship, stronger relationship between Welltower and Genesis and to improve Genesis credit. So I think we were able to come up with a pretty creative way to accomplish that in that we agreed with Genesis and the third-party buyers to essentially reduce the rent going forward by about 5% on both portfolios, so that's about $8 million of year one rent. And in exchange for that, Genesis gave us a note with a four-year term that bears interest at a 10% rate, but a good part of that is payable in kind versus in cash. They have a sizable cash flow benefit in year one from this transaction, not to mention materially lower increases going forward. So one of the challenges in the Genesis portfolio has been a 3.5% lease escalators for the last five years, which George and his team frankly have done an amazing job of keeping up with because our payment coverage has been basically flat for five years now after the big Medicare cut. But it's tough; I mean Medicare and Medicaid rates are growing 1-ish percent per year at best, plus the occupancy challenges in the business \u2013 it's tough to keep up with that kind of an escalator. So when the new leases with the new buyers, they have agreed to 2% or below escalators for the next 15 years. So that over time there's a meaningful benefit to Genesis. Juan Sanabria : And just to wrap that up, did you guys \u2013 there was no reset to your remaining rents or changes to the escalator; correct? If you wouldn't mind giving us any price per bed that was implied by the transactions? Scott Brinker : Yes. On your first question, that's correct. The remaining Welltower master lease is unchanged, so no change in rent, no change in escalator, no change in maturity date. And the price per bed \u2013 in the aggregate it was probably $160,000-plus per bed. I know it by portfolio but I don't have the aggregate number off the top of my head. But it was in that range. And these are high quality properties and generate a lot of cash flow, so the price per bed is quite high. Juan Sanabria : Great. And maybe just one last question, if you don't mind, for Scott Estes. Obviously, a much lower levered balance sheet and a position to grow. How should we think about the target range of where you could re-lever to and where you feel comfortable and maybe just where you think acquisition cap rates will be to think about using that firepower? Scott Estes : Sure. The reality is I think we've reset the balance sheet to some extent. I feel really good about those new leverage metrics, the 34% to 35% area is a great one for net debt to underappreciated book. And they like the lower fives on the debt to EBITDA. So obviously resulting fixed charge and interest coverages are good. And at the end of the day, we will capitalize on acquisition opportunities first and foremost with our existing partners but don't have to. And the key word here is really optionality, in my opinion. I think we have great optionality where the balance sheet is. And maybe, Scott, I don't know if you want to comment on just cap rates and what you are maybe seeing in the current market in terms of pricing? Scott Brinker : Juan, I would just say at the beginning of the year we told people that this was a year to be extremely disciplined, just given where the market is from an operating environment and where we believe our cost of capital is relative to our NAV. So we have been pretty selective about what we bought. Our acquisition volumes are lower this year than they have been as long as I can remember. But that's not because of lack of opportunity, that's because of conscious decisions we've made. And even though, we now have a substantial free cash flow on our balance sheet, I don't think our mindset is going to change. There are deals that make a lot of sense, virtually all of them with existing partners in our core markets. Some of that is in the fourth-quarter acquisition guidance that we gave this morning. But outside of that I don't think you should expect us to change our approach that we shared in the last three quarters, which is to be really, really disciplined in this environment. Juan Sanabria : Thank you, guys. Congrats on getting all this done. Scott Brinker : Thanks, Juan. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Paul Morgan with Canaccord Genuity. Paul Morgan : Hi, good morning. Maybe give a little bit of an update on what you're seeing in terms of your external growth, your acquisition pipeline looking forward. Obviously it's been a very busy quarter or two in terms of structure in these asset sales. But now you have closed Vintage. And as you look into 2017, what does the opportunity set look like? And I think, based on your comments, we should think about post-close the 2017 external growth being on a leverage-neutral basis? Scott Estes : Yes. The outlook is favorable in that we have 20-plus operating partners in senior sizing alone that are regularly coming to us with opportunities. Right now a lot of that is actually redevelopment where we may provide a portion of the capital to help them get the project up and running and then we have a purchase option when the project stabilizes. That is a run rate volume of $500 million plus of modern, purpose-built properties that we get the first right on. And then occasionally we have an opportunity like Vintage that we work in tandem with one or more operating partners to fill out their existing core footprint. And you should expect us to look to do more of those types of investments. There are a few, handful of operators in our core countries in U.S., Canada and the UK that we're still looking to establish as new partners and bring into the portfolio. So we have our targets and we are building those relationships. Scott Brinker : Yes, just picking up on Scott's point Paul, one thing we consistently remind people of is that this large portfolio of operators that are part of the Welltower family still own real estate that we don't own. And that provides us somewhat of an annuity stream of high-quality investment opportunities. And again, our operators are typically the dominant regional players in the best markets in the country. And those markets behave differently than a lot of the secondary markets where a lot of the new supply is coming into. So they still see good growth opportunities. Our strategy we talked about on the last call is to continue to go deep in the top markets in the U.S. And so we still see very good opportunities in the senior care business. Scott talked about some development opportunities because there are markets like Manhattan, where the product does not exist for us to acquire. So we are developing it. And I think we will see some interesting opportunities that will come from other sectors of healthcare delivery, where we like the medical office business and we will continue to look for opportunities to grow that business because not only are we a good acquirer, we also have an excellent management company based down in Jupiter, Florida. Paul Morgan : Thanks. And then just my other question. You've obviously spoken to a lot of kind of new institutional capital investors in looking at healthcare real estate over the past few quarters as well as your ongoing relationships. But, I mean, do you have any kind of takeaways from the disposition process with respect to Genesis and kind of the conversations you had? How deep and kind of how broad are the pockets that are increasingly looking at healthcare real estate right now? Scott Brinker : We see lots of interest. As I mentioned in my remarks, we received significant inbound interest by private investors in owning post-acute long-term care assets as well as senior housing assets. So we are seeing continued interest from private capital sources to build positions in healthcare real estate. Scott Estes : Maybe the one addition would be is the foreign institutional capital comes into U.S. healthcare real estate for the first time, almost across the board their first question is, do you have a portfolio or an opportunity on the East or West Coast? They always ask that question. You never hear that question from U.S. buyers, especially in seniors housing, medical office. Nobody cares, right? And that's why we've said it for years, there is no \u2013 very little differential in cap rate when you look at differences in asset class, building quality and particularly location. Everything is sort of the same. And our view is that that's going to change pretty dramatically. You've seen that in other real estate sectors, where there's a huge difference in cap rate among building in New York/New Jersey, in California or secondary location in middle America. There's no question that healthcare real estate is going to move in that direction in our portfolio and operating partners are going to benefit from that because the foreign capital is coming in a major way, and that's the thing they care about. You see, again, huge pricing differential in other real estate classes. We don't yet see that in our sector but it's coming. Scott Brinker : The other point on foreign capital coming in, which I'll make with respect to Cindat, China has the same aging demographic issues that we have in the United States except it's amplified there because of the size of the population. We believe one of the reasons that Cindat was attracted to forming this joint venture with us is that they want to learn how to invest in this asset class because it has relevance to what will happen back in their home country. And the other piece of this is that Genesis has a business in China. And so that's also important here. So, there are lots of synergies at play here for Cindat forming the joint venture with Welltower and acquiring an interest in Genesis assets. Paul Morgan : Great. That's great color, thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Hey, good morning everyone. I just want to stick with the Genesis asset sales. I guess, can you just talk about a little bit about how the decision to include certain assets was in the disposition pool versus the key pool? And what does the profile look like for the stuff that will remain going forward? Scott Brinker : Yes, Vince. Hey, it\u2019s Scott. That's a great question. I think we spent more time on that particular topic than we did in picking the buyers that we chose to go forward with. So the concept with all the buyers that we talked to is that the properties that they bought would be a representative pool of assets. So we decided to keep all nine powerbacks in the Welltower master lease, so those are not included. But the traditional Genesis long-term-care properties have been allocated among the Cindat joint venture, the Lindsay Goldberg purchase, the Genesis buyback portfolio and the remaining Welltower master lease in a way that everybody gets a broad cross-section of assets. So nobody cherry picked for the positive and nobody got cherry picked to the negative. And we all looked at a very comprehensive asset quality scoring metric that included things like building age, operating margin, occupancy, quality mix, star ratings and clinical outcomes so that everybody felt like they got a representative sample of assets. Vincent Chao : Okay, thanks for that. And of the 7% that remains, how much is that \u2013 does that break down between power backing and traditional? Scott Estes : Well, the percentage would be \u2013 I\u2019ll have to get back to you with the exact number, but the percentage is probably roughly 20% power back, 80% long-term-care, if we are able to execute on the $600 million plus of additional 2017 dispositions that we talk about in the press release. But I\u2019ll get back to you with the specific percentage. Vincent Chao : Okay, that\u2019s great. And maybe another question just on the sources and uses \u2013 that was very helpful in terms of outlining exactly how that breaks down. But I was just curious; on the debt repayments and some of the preferred stuff, how should we think about timing of that? Are you going to be able to do that all at the end of the year? And I guess should we expect some FDA prepayment penalties? Scott Estes : We are going to do it as quickly as possible, as the proceeds comment. And we will keep you updated, I think, probably just modeling-wise most of it you can generally assume at the end of year in terms of the run rate. The one piece for sure, the preferred stock redemption, is in March 2017. And the reason we put the $48 million of aggregated debt extinguishment and other costs in there \u2013 that\u2019s the number you asked about. So that ties that to the same uses as the proceeds. Vincent Chao : Okay, got it. Thank you. Scott Estes : Yes. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Market. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. Scott, was there a difference in the cap rate among the three Genesis portfolio sales? I believe it was announced the Lindsay Goldberg purchase had an initial cap rate of about 9.4%. I mean how does that relate to the 9% that you guys quoted? Scott Estes : Yes, there was some differential. I can\u2019t comment specifically on what Omega reported; I\u2019ll leave that to them. But in terms of the cap rate as we view it, there was a differential, and a couple of things drove that. One, the asset quality was the same, so that was not the issue. But there was a timing issue in that Lindsay Goldberg was the first to step up. That\u2019s why they are the first one to close. They bought a bigger portfolio, which was relevant. It wasn\u2019t easy to finance; that\u2019s a lot of money to raise in today\u2019s environment. So that was meaningful to us. And the last thing I would point out is that they bought 100% interest. So it was a free and clear purchase versus a retained interest. But frankly, we\u2019re pretty happy about the joint venture with Cindat because it gives us a lot of optionality. After five years, either party is able to create a liquidity event that we could either take more or exit the portfolio. And we are going in with the expectation we are going to grow the partnership with Cindat and Union Life. But it\u2019s nice to have that optionality. So I think that mix of structures is actually quite beneficial to our shareholders. Michael Carroll : Okay. And what about the potential Genesis sales in 2017? Is there a type of an agreement you have with the tenant about the $120 million of non-core sales and the cap rates that you would give them for the rank credit? And is there a discussion on the cap rate for the $500 million of potential buybacks that the tenant has? Scott Estes : There is, and it would be in line if not a bit below the 9% cap rate that we reported today on the dispositions. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then finally, can you talk a bit about the remaining exposure you have to Genesis in the post-acute care facilities? Are you comfortable with your exposure now or would you like to reduce that further? Scott Estes : We have very publicly stated that it is our intention to grow our private pay mix. So you should expect to see us continue to grow that by acquisition and in some cases by disposition. Michael Carroll : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the questions and my thanks as well. I\u2019m sure you guys did a lot over the last quarter do get this done, lot of moving parts. Just first question, just picking off of the last comment about growing private pay, can you maybe just update us? I think the portfolios out there for the large caps are probably more different today than they have been in recent past. And I\u2019m just trying to understand, having post-acute in your portfolio, how do you view that, whether it\u2019s even smaller for me or not but just your view on is it important to be part of a diversified portfolio like you guys have? Scott Brinker : We believe that it is still important to have some investment in the post-acute care space. If you talk to the leading hospital systems in this country, they will tell you that they are very interested in having a viable post-acute care option to work with as they look to their futures because post-acute care is a much lower-cost setting than the inpatient hospital setting. So we believe this is not going away. And we also believe that post-acute care in the future may look different than the historic skilled nursing model that you are familiar with. So Scott used a word that we often use around here called optionality. We are a long-term investor in healthcare real estate. And we want to maintain optionality to be opportunistic and deploy capital across the spectrum if we believe it\u2019s in the best interest of our shareholders. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, great. And then just on senior housing triple net sales, the 6-3 cap was pretty impressive. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us some flavor of type of assets, what percent were maybe below uncovered and sort of what prompted the sale overall. Scott Estes : Sure. It\u2019s a combination of a couple of things. One is that we think this is an opportunistic time to be a seller in the seniors housing market. And secondarily, these are portfolios that are not a perfect fit for our strategy at this point. They are operators that, generally speaking, we are not growing with and therefore we are probably better off freeing them up to grow their business with a different capital partner. And it helps to have an existing portfolio to bring to the table for that. And for the most part these have quite low payment coverage. So we are optimistic that the triple net senior housing portfolio that we have left will have improved credit metrics and payment coverage than what we had before. Vikram Malhotra : Do you have a pro forma coverage post this? Scott Estes : Vik, it\u2019s not going to move materially, in any event, when you think about just the size of that denominator. But our hope would be that it\u2019s moving up 1, 2, 3 basis points, which it has been the past couple of quarters. After a number of years of steady decline, driven by one operator in particular, we are now finally trending up because we have some development projects stabilizing and we have been able to remove some of these lower covering master leases. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, thanks. And just a last quick one on the shop portfolio \u2013 within expenses there\u2019s an all other bucket that includes, I think, 8%. Can you give us some sense of what\u2019s in there and what led to that increase? Scott Estes : Yes, I can. One is management fees. So we generally pay a base 5% management fee to our operating partners. And there are always incentives up and down based on their performance. It\u2019s also things like insurance, professional fees, workers compensation. So I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019ve said this before, including the first quarter, when we reported 5.5% NOI growth, and I\u2019ll say it again this quarter, when we generated 2.2% NOI growth, is that 90 days is just too short a period of time to make conclusions about performance of the portfolio or trend or trajectory. It just \u2013 $1 million is not much money in the scheme of things, and yet it moves the same-store growth rate by 50 basis points. So small accruals, adjustments that typically happen and, they are unpredictable, move that number a lot. So by the same argument I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that other line item this quarter. The fact is operating expenses are driven by labor; that 60% or so of the total operating cost. And we have been saying for over a year now that labor costs are the headwind. That\u2019s the biggest challenge that our portfolio is facing. And today, our operators, our properties have done a remarkable job offsetting that cost pressure. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, great. And this is for Scott Estes but also the whole team. I think it\u2019s just a comment from my side. It\u2019s pretty impressive, given all the portfolio activity you\u2019ve had, to take the dividend up 1.5% for next year. So congrats, guys. Scott Estes : All right, thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Another very busy quarter for you guys \u2013 so to anyone in the room, if you had done this Genesis sale two, two and half years ago you probably would have gotten an A cap on it. And I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a precise number, but clearly things have gotten \u2013 question marks have come to the table and it has resulted maybe in a little tougher sell there. And I\u2019m wondering if anything about this is a teaching moment and if you kind of should be thinking a few more steps forward on a go-forward basis. For example, it seems -- you mentioned the escalators coming down on the sold Genesis portfolio but yours are staying at 3. Is there any reason to think about that more proactively and saying maybe we should be re-assessing our escalator for the next 16 years with Genesis or anything like that, that you think is more on the forward thinking docket for you now, having had this experience with the Genesis situation? Scott Brinker : Well, I\u2019ll just start off by saying that I think we are a very forward-thinking organizations. And we take a long-term view of our investments, and we own and manage a diversified portfolio of healthcare investments. So that will not change. We don\u2019t have crystal balls. We try and make as sound investment decisions as we can, and I think we have a pretty good track record of that. Rich Anderson : Okay. And so \u2013 and no argument on your process. I\u2019m speaking just specifically on the Genesis sale and if \u2013 again, how does Genesis produce a situation where they will do better than 3% growth over the next 16 years versus your escalator? I\u2019m just curious if you are giving that any thought at all. Scott Brinker : One of our goals in selling assets out of the portfolio was to have a remaining Genesis portfolio that had better coverage so that there was a broader cushion. And to the point earlier, they have actually kept up with the escalator to date. So the rent payment to HCN is going to be more than cut in half as a product of these transactions. So we are confident that they will continue to pay us the 3% escalator. Rich Anderson : All right. To Scott Estes, you gave some guidelines about timing of use of proceeds, the preferred redemption maybe in the first quarter, but everything else kind of back end with the exception of the acquisitions and dispositions this quarter. You kind of do that math and you get to some meaningful dilution at least in the short-term and you\u2019re raising the dividend. I\u2019m not going to ask you to put a number on that dilution, but your I\u2019m just curious, are you looking at payout ratio being temporarily at the very high end of a comfort level next year and expecting a returns a more normalized level in 2018 and beyond. Is that the way you\u2019re thinking about the dividend. Scott Brinker : I think, it\u2019s fair, Rich, like again, I would go back to the answer of we [indiscernible] that you hear that does get you to the run rate, net sources and leases. My point would be that as you start to think about 2017, we have normal same-store NOI growth acquisitions development, conversions et cetera, that will offset some of that potential dilution. But you\u2019re absolutely right. We don\u2019t want to do a need your dividend policy reaction what\u2019s based on an awesome long-term growth potential for the company. The balance sheet just made a few humongous forward, full line of credit available you can think about all the optionality again that we\u2019ve been talking about. When we talked [indiscernible] over the next three years, let\u2019s look at what the earnings power of the company is and we think it\u2019s very significant. So we concluded that a slight increase was right for next year and I think, it\u2019s more important to think about that context in the bigger picture. Rich Anderson : Okay, and then, another maybe one for Mr. DeRosa. The increased exposure now almost entirely private pay, you another has are kind of jumping on this private pay than [indiscernible] I\u2019m just curious what are the risks in going so, far field in that direction when you think about a very uncertain economy, you become much more kind of tethered to worse case some of type recession or something like that. What do you doing for managed that issue given going so far deeply into the private payroll. Tom DeRosa : I think you have to look at the markets where we concentrate capital and I think that that\u2019s the markets where population is moving, where there is job growth. We see that strategy as \u2013 in terms of concentrating our assets in centers of wealth as a mitigant. But we are also what the opinion that healthcare will be moving much more in a private pay direction, that, in the future, those who can pay for their health care will be shouldering a bigger percentage of their healthcare costs. We know that Medicare is quite challenged and not prepared for the aging demographic that we are going to see over the next \u2013 over the coming decades. So we believe that the markets that we are focused in, delivering a product that is a premium product for the upper end of the market who will have no choice as they age other than to seek alternative residential setting to live productively. So we see this business as not a nice-too but I must-have enrich. We don\u2019t know what that world looks like, we\u2019ve never experienced a world where the 85-plus percentage of population will start to dominate. And so we think that staying at the top end of that market is a good place to be long-term. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then last question for me \u2013 and Brinker touched on this when you talked about optionality in the joint venture. Is it a fair way to think about this is so post-acute skilled is going through a week uncertain patch right now, but longer term it could be a great business again, depending on how it evolves. And so if you get down to 11% or 12% of your portfolio is post-acute skilled but giving yourself the optionality to get back, are you timing this in some ways where you think ultimately this is a good business and don\u2019t want to leave it, and that\u2019s the mindset that you might have to take a few steps back and then a few steps forward? Is that how you are thinking about post-acute on call it a 10-year horizon type of time frame? Scott Brinker : Yes. We\u2019re trying to look forward, so I think you just summed it up well. Rich Anderson : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Hi, thanks. I just had a couple of quick follow-ups on asset sales, Tom. I heard your comments about trying to reduce further exposure via acquisitions and maybe some asset sales. But can you help us try to put some brackets around dispositions for 2017? It sounds like you have another $600 million here of skilled nursing tied to Genesis. In the past you\u2019ve talked about normalized calling of call it maybe $300 million-$400 million of just normal-course stuff. So should we think of a base case for 2017 as being that $600 million, because it\u2019s highly likely, plus a few hundred more to get you to $1 billion or so? Is that reasonable? Tom DeRosa : Mike, that sounds like a reasonable assumption. I think we are giving you a little bit more clarity than we normally do because we\u2019ve talked about the Genesis portfolio. So we are constantly looking at our assets. We own about a little over 1,500 buildings today, and we have very dedicated asset management, a very dedicated asset management function here. So we are always looking at the real estate we own and the markets that we are in and trying to make as educated a decision about which assets we want to own for the long-term because that could change every year. So we do the best we can here. I think you\u2019ve seen some of the systems that we\u2019ve built here to better assess the long-term viability of the assets we own in the markets that we are in. So I would say we will always, as we have in the past, dispose of assets in a year. And we will continue to do that in the future. And I think that your assumption is probably a good one. Mike Mueller : Got it. And last follow-up on this \u2013 for the $500 million option for Genesis, what do you think would cause them not to exercise that? Tom DeRosa : Well, they have to raise the capital to do it. So with this announcement and continued stable operating results, their stock price recovers. One of the benefits at the time of going public two years ago was that they would have liquidity to raise equity to buy back assets. So that clearly hasn\u2019t gone as planned today, but our expectation and hope is that the stock will start to rebound as they announce important transactions like this one and stabilize the operations. And they may raise joint venture capital. I think they have a number of options, but that would be the biggest one. They clearly like the buildings, so that you diligence and underwriting isn\u2019t a problem; they just need to raise money. But clearly, a major institution\u2019s choosing to own Genesis real estate doesn\u2019t hurt the story that Scott just outlined. That should all be a positive reflection on Genesis. Scott Estes : And they can finally turn their attention to that opportunity. They have been bending over backwards to help us, and we will forever be grateful, to help us get these transactions done. They can only do so many things at once. They are an operating business, not a transaction business. So they have been super helpful and cooperative. This is a good deal for both companies. And now they will be able to focus on the $500 million buyback, which is a great opportunity for them. Mike Mueller : Okay, thank you. Scott Estes : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. I had a question on the changing landscape in senior housing. So over the last couple days there have been at least two new private capital sources entering the senior housing market, acquiring at about the 7% cap rate. But at the same time, when you look at Brookdale\u2019s share price, it suggests a dislocation between public and private market values. And given they are one of your major partners, I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s something that you could do bigger with Brookdale. Scott Brinker : Brookdale has a large footprint in senior housing in this country. And they are dealing with challenges that relate to the emeritus transaction. We are always looking for opportunities in the senior care space, and there may be opportunities that come from Brookdale or some other senior care operators in the U.S. that are not currently part of the Welltower family of brands. We like the space. We believe in the long-term viability of the space. And we, every day, look for opportunities to make smart investments in the space. Scott Estes : And I would just add -- I think it\u2019s important the way we look at transactions always would be like the Genesis. We would want transactions that would be a win for Welltower as well as a win for our partners. That\u2019s the way we would approach any operator relationship. John Kim : And I think Tom mentioned Cindat's interest in Genesis assets, and that's partially due to their business in China. But what about their interest in Brookdale? Was that specific to Brookdale? Did you bring those assets forward to them, or do they want an interest in the national operator like Brookdale? Tom DeRosa : Well, I think, like Genesis, I would say that again Cindat's and Union Life's investment here is to understand how to invest in this sector, and that's not just skilled nursing; it's also seniors housing. If we have a need, a long-term need for good quality senior care in this country, they've got it. They've got it on the multiply higher perspective. So, Scott? Scott Brinker : That's exactly right. They want to invest with a best-in-class capital partner and high-quality, well-known operating partners. And Brookdale and Genesis clearly fit that bill. These are 11 high-quality properties, mostly on the West Coast, that have continued to perform well. So they have not been as challenged as some of the other, maybe, portfolios or properties that Brookdale is working through right now. So that's the background. John Kim : Okay. And given the joint ventures you have established in the past year and, I think, your focus on increasing scale, will you be more focused on AUM growth going forward rather than balance sheet asset growth? Or is balance sheet asset acquisition still a major part of your strategy? Scott Brinker : It will be both. Operator : All right. And our next question will come from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Chad, your line is open. Okay. And our next question will come from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi, thanks. Just on the theme of the joint venture, can you share some of the details about the exit or buyout options that exist for you guys within the JV? Scott Brinker : I don't want to get into the details of the joint venture, but it's pretty straightforward. After five years there's a mutual right to seek liquidity rights. So going in with the expectation we are going to do more with Union Life and Cindat, but it's nice to know for both of us that that's there if we choose to change our exposure to the postacute space five years from now, one way or the other. Todd Stender : And then on acquisitions, is it limited to just the U.S.? Is this something that you could enter China with one of the partners or both? What constraints or what opportunities exist? Scott Brinker : We see tremendous opportunities in the markets that we already have a foothold in. One of the things we've said \u2013 we're not prepared to go into markets unless we are prepared to put significant boots on the ground like we have in the UK and like we have in Toronto. And actually we are putting significant boots on the ground in Los Angeles, because of the percentage of assets that we will own that are in Southern California. So we see lots of opportunities in those markets and we are not very actively looking for opportunities outside of those markets. Todd Stender : Okay, thanks, Tom. And then just to stay with you, Tom, if you don't mind, you've touched on Brookdale's large national footprint. In that theme and consistent with how you allocated operators to certain markets around the country like you did with the recent California acquisition, do you see operators becoming more sharpshooters like the Silverados or the Brandywines, as opposed to more national operators? Tom DeRosa : That's a good question, Todd. I do think so. I think that you will see some of these operators may be expandable a little bit across state borders. Some of them were just in one given state with great concentration. I think you'll see some of them expand regionally. But I would say, other than Sunrise and Brookdale, we don't see any of our operators having great aspirations to develop a national footprint. We think there are a lot of benefits in having a deep position in quality markets, and that's what we like to see. Todd Stender : Great, thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi Research. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman with Smedes. Scott Estes, I was wondering if you can just provide a little bit more clarity in terms of the run rates. And as you said, the fourth quarter implied we can get to, which is about $1.05 to $1.10, $1.11. But obviously the timing of the dispositions and the reinvestment of those proceeds has a significant effect to where you are, sort of December 31, on a quarterly basis. And so what would be really helpful is just to understand what that quarterly number is, where our starting point is from an annualized perspective heading into 2017. Scott Estes : I understand the desire for clarity. I think I've got to stick with our numbers. We have a blended yield on disposition proceeds right there at 8%, you have a blended yield you can calculate. I would assume that all of the proceeds come in right at year-end and then, obviously, we are going to work as fast as we can. So you could make some general assumptions on some of the things like secured debt may take a few months to pay off, and the preferred stock, as I mentioned, is March. But that's really the way you are going to get the run rate from the number you just cited for the fourth quarter. And I would tell you, more importantly, the first quarter really isn't that important. We're going to get all these things done. We have all the benefits attendant. We are going to work as fast as we can to give you updates and there's a lot of things that will help 2017's earnings that I mentioned like the same-store NOI growth and development in acquisitions. So we'll give you the full update in February. Michael Bilerman : So again, just doing simple math, you have about $0.09 of quarterly dilution. So how much of that \u2013 it sounds like most of that $0.09 is not in the $1.05 to $1.11 in the fourth quarter. And the only reason I'm asking \u2013 the Street is at $4.70 for next year. Clearly, with almost $0.40 of dilution from doing this and potential other dilution from these sales into next year, again putting aside all the benefits you will get from the development coming online in the same store, there's a significant amount of earnings that will have to come off. And I think I just want to better understand how much of that $0.09 of dilution is actually in the $1.05 to $1.11 in the fourth quarter. It sounds like it's nothing. Scott Estes : I would say the way to answer that is we talked about closing $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion of the Genesis transaction that was just announced today, so you have about that amount that's already in the numbers. So assume November 1, and then I would assume the rest of the numbers are roughly at the end of the quarter. Michael Bilerman : Okay. And then from a balance sheet perspective, that's the other part of it in terms of the deleveraging. It sounded like you would rather stay at these levels \u2013 five times debt to EBITDA, mid-30s from a debt to unappreciated book, so that we should expect any future investment should be funded either by increased about all, so leveraging that, or through additional sales or new common equity. Is that a fair way to characterize it? Or do you want to have the ability to go back up to the mid-5 debt to EBITDA and towards the 40s debt to unappreciated book? How should we think about the goalposts? Scott Estes : I would think that modeling for everyone generally on a leverage-neutral basis, based on these new numbers, is the way to go. And we obviously would have those options available to us if we saw good options and have always been pretty conservative. But modeling-wise I would say assume leverage neutral, based on these new numbers. Michael Bilerman : And then can you just review a little bit -- the loan receivable book, at least at quarter end per page 20 of the supp, is at $950 million. If memory serves, that excludes the development loans you have outstanding. You have another $150 million coming in, in the fourth quarter, $75 million of which was the note you took back from Genesis. So you're going to be at $1.1 billion. Can you review the chunks of that in terms of cash pay versus PIK and any large sort of borrower orders in that $1.1 billion? Scott Estes : Yes, Michael. I'm happy to try to give some color. This big picture is that we rarely, if ever, make loans as a standalone business model. It's always done to support an important real estate relationship. In many cases, the loan is secured by real estate and is reflected that way on our balance sheet. The loan balance is a bit higher than it has been in the past at roughly $1 billion. We are actually expecting substantial repayments in the fourth quarter from Genesis and others. So I think you will see that loan balance decline going forward, even though we are taking back the $75 million of loans from Genesis. And it should meaningfully decline if you take a longer term view, meaning into the late 2017 time frame. Michael Bilerman : So what's the current yield on that $1 billion? How much is cash pay versus PIK? And if -- because my assumption is if it's producing higher than average earnings, right, so pretty high yield, the reinvestment as that loan balance comes down is another diluted effect to earnings and cash flow. Scott Estes : Yes, that is definitely the case. The yield on most of the loans is in the high single digits, if not 10%, on average. The vast majority, Michael, is cash pay. There are a couple that have PIK interests, including these takeback notes from Genesis. But that's the exception. Michael Bilerman : And is there any concentration within that $1 billion in terms of to a certain borrower? Like what are the top two or three borrowers in that? And how much is real estate versus non-real estate? There's a footnote that says some of it is not real estate. Scott Estes : Yes. By far the biggest amount is with Genesis. So there's the $330 million or so of first mortgage loans on our books as of September 30. That number will continue to decline going forward. And then there's the $72 million term loan that we made to Genesis last quarter that's not secured by real estate. And then we will add this additional $75 million note to Genesis here in the fourth quarter. That's by far the biggest component of the $1 billion. Scott Brinker : And the difference between the two you can just see right on the face of the balance sheet. $630 million is the number that's real estate loans with the remainder being the non-real estate loan component. Michael Bilerman : And so there's another $230 million to other operators as loans outside of the $72 million to Genesis? Scott Estes : Correct. Michael Bilerman : Okay. It would be helpful just \u2013 if you like about supplementing disclosure, and we do certainly appreciate the continued improvements in the supplemental, just having, now that it's a much bigger balance at $1 billion relative to your enterprise value, having that level of detail in terms of yields, amounts, borrowers because it is really lacking both in the 10-Q as well as the supplemental. Scott Brinker : That's a good point, so we can look into that. Michael, I'll just give you one example of the loan portfolio that is the $40 million note that was repaid in September, a number of years ago. We had made a loan to an important operating partner to help buying out the old ownership group. And as part of the disposition of that skilled nursing portfolio last quarter, for $300 million they've also extinguished the $40 million note receivable. So that's the type of situation, generally speaking, where we have used loans. And we have a very good track record of having them repaid. Michael Bilerman : Yes. Okay, thank you so much. Operator : And our final question today will come from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Karin Ford : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask about the 1.45 times coverage level that you are going to have on the Genesis portfolio post-disposition. Would you consider that to be market coverage and do you feel good about the cushion that you will now have, considering the challenges that are probably ongoing in the industry? Tom DeRosa : Yes. I want to start by clarifying a couple of things. One is the coverage that we've talked about is after a management fee. So not everybody reports that way. That's important because the coverage before a management fee is often 40 basis points higher. The second verification is that that coverage ratio that you talk about, Karin, is for the entire long-term postacute portfolio. It's not for Genesis in particular. And then as to your specific question, it's 10 basis points higher than it is today, so we are definitely happy about that. We would like it to be higher, but at this point I would say it's above market, not below market. And the evidence for that would be two very sophisticated and knowledgeable investors, Lindsay Goldberg and Omega, just bought Genesis assets at roughly 1.3 coverage, plus or minus. So we feel good about having 1.45. We hope it keeps going higher, but it's certainly not below market. Karin Ford : Thanks for that. And then my last question is, were the Genesis notes receivable calculated as part of the 9% cap rate? Scott Estes : Yes, we include those as proceeds in terms of the sales price. That's right. Karin Ford : At the $70 million number? Scott Estes : Correct. Karin Ford : Okay, thank you. Operator : This concludes today's Welltower third-quarter 2016 earnings conference call.

My name is Holly and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President, Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, Sir. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower's fourth quarter 2016 results and outlook for 2017. Following my brief introduction, you will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Mercedes Kerr, EVP, Business and Relationship Management; Shankh Mitra, SVP, Finance and Investments; and Scott Estes, CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurances projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning's press release and from time to time in the Company's filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release this morning, you may access it via the Company's website at welltower.com. Before handing the call over to Tom DeRosa, I want to highlight four significant points regarding our 2016 results. One, we realized full-year total portfolio average same-store growth of 3%, at the high-end of our original guidance. All four of our business lines achieved average full-year growth of 2.4% or greater. Two, we completed $2.8 billion of dispositions during the year, including $2 billion of postacute facilities which decreased our exposure to postacute as a percentage of total portfolio NOI by 750 basis points since January 1 of 2016 and as a result increased private-pay share of total Company revenue to 93%, the highest level in the history of the Company. Three, we finished the year with under 5.4 times of net debt to EBITDA and a net debt to book capitalization ratio of 37.4%, a reduction of more than 200 basis points during the year. And four, we attained credit ratings upgrades from both Moody's and S&P to BAA1 and BBB+ respectively. And, with that, I will have call over to Tom for some remarks on the year and the quarter. Tom? Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Tim. We were pleased with our 2016 results, particularly as it was a transition year. While delivering results at the top end of our most recent guidance, we disposed of $2.8 billion in non-core assets, rebalanced our operator exposure thereby improving our risk profile and we significantly delevered our balance sheet. We began 2017 with a corporate reorganization that is rationalizing and reinventing the way we do our business. This plan is expected to realize a $30 million reduction in G&A from our 2016 guidance. You see we need to adapt the way we do business to respond to the extraordinary opportunity that is before us. It is well-known that healthcare delivery is transitioning from an acute care hospital-focused model to broader outpatient subacute, postacute and senior care networks that can deliver better outcomes at lower costs. In order for this transition to be successful, real estate needs to have a seat at the table. A key element of Welltower's strategy is to be the partner of choice for the major academic and regional health systems across the U.S. As they invest in building more advanced and robust outpatient networks, we intend to be their partner and connect our leading senior dementia and postacute care platform to these systems to help them better manage their patient populations and provide them with a competitive advantage to grow market share and profitability across the healthcare delivery continuum. So today we announced a strategic collaboration with Johns Hopkins Medicine, the world-renowned patient care research and teaching institution. Mercedes Kerr will tell you more about this first of its kind collaboration, but what I will say is this healthcare REIT is being recognized as best-in-class by the top health systems in the world and we're using our real estate and service platform to position ourselves to capture the next level of accretive investment opportunities for our shareholders. We see our healthcare real estate platform as delivering value well beyond the brick and mortar. Our proprietary leading regional operator bench is critical to managing growing population of frail to demented elderly. We're in the early days, but this should help explain why Welltower's senior housing operating portfolio consistently outperforms the industry. This, plus our more efficient operating structure, should drive earnings growth, despite fears that our performance is only a factor of interest rates. I will stop here to turn the mic over to my colleague, Mercedes Kerr, who will give you a closer look at Q4 investment activity and our view for 2017. Mercedes? Mercedes Kerr : Good morning. I am pleased to provide you with an update on our market activity and the opportunities that we're driving from Welltower's best-in-class platform. I'll start with fourth quarter 2016 investments and dispositions. Our operating partner relationship has been and will continue to be a source of differentiation for us. This is evidenced by our ability to repeatedly source off-market investments and by our consistent track record of follow-on transactions. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we invested $878 million at an average yield of 6.7%. 73% of these investments were with existing Welltower partners, a series of hand-picked operators with whom we enjoy close working relationships. We were pleased to welcome our new notable partner this quarter, the Northbridge Companies and we have long admired Jim Coughlin and Wendy Nowokunski's work in New England. They share Welltower's commitment to high-quality service offerings in top markets and we look forward to growing together. We also made significant progress towards our stated goal of selling non-core assets this quarter. This included the completion of our previously announced Genesis dispositions which generated $1.7 billion in proceeds at an effective cap rate of 9%. These transactions demonstrate a significant institutional appetite for our real estate both locally and abroad. Our 2016 market activity reflects our highly targeted capital allocation strategy aimed at improving portfolio quality and reducing single tenant concentrations which we believe will enhance our value to shareholders. Turning to our plans for 2017, I want to describe how we will execute on one of Welltower's key objectives, to maximize the value of our existing platform. This is a theme that you are going to hear from me often. As a result of our improved organizational structure announced in January, I lead an integrated team responsible for domestic and international dealer origination and relationship management, outpatient medical portfolio management and asset management. This new structure is designed to optimize portfolio performance and to seize external and organic growth opportunities. Let me explain what this will look like. First, we remain very optimistic about Welltower's opportunity to source top-quality investments through our existing partner network and our experienced business development team. We have created a partnership-focused investment strategy that is very difficult to replicate. Our focus in 2017 will be on seniors housing and outpatient medical opportunities. We will continue to prioritize high barrier to entry markets and high-quality sponsorships. We will seek to enhance our business by adding younger properties and sometimes developing irreplaceable assets. In select cases, we may also partner with important health systems to deliver next generation postacute real estate solutions at their request. We feel better about high-quality opportunities now than we did at this time in 2016. Next, we will find new and improved ways to drive same-store growth and operating efficiencies. Our scale, data, knowledge of best practices and ties to expert operators, including our own self-managed outpatient management group, position us for superior performance. The quality and resilience of our portfolio should become increasingly evident in less favorable operating environments and we're building tools to differentiate ourselves even further. For example, the room turn and box program which affords our seniors housing operators lower negotiated prices, rebates and a process to reduce the time required to refresh a vacated room. Early adoption in a six property pilot suggests that we may achieve as much as $500,000 in annual savings at these sites alone. We will look to expand this program and other performance-enhancing tools in 2017. In addition, we will include our full-service outpatient medical group in our marketing asset and portfolio management programs. We're one of the largest owners in the medical office sector and we plan to increase growth in our top-quality portfolio through even more active management. Our goal is to deliver improved performance through enhanced leasing structures and by combining the service offerings of our seniors housing and outpatient medical portfolios which are often in the same market. I'd like to wrap up my comments by reiterating the value of our integration strategy. As you heard from Tom, healthcare delivery is shifting toward more efficient, higher impact and more consumer friendly settings. Welltower and its operating partners are well-positioned to benefit from this evolution in care. I can offer an example. Welltower introduced one of its most successful memory care partners to one of its key patient medical tenants which happens to be the leading health system in the region that they both share. The health systems quickly realized that this expert in seniors housing could improve care outcomes for its patients suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In addition to developing a referral relationship, the two groups work together to create training modules for hospital staff and information resources for local seniors. Since the outset of their relationship in 2016, the two Welltower seniors housing communities that are in that market have increased occupancy by 200 basis points combined. The improvement added to an already high occupancy level and can be tied directly to this alliance. This is just one of the ways that we're driving performance. Earlier today we announced a strategic collaboration with Johns Hopkins Medicine, one of the world's preeminent patient care research and teaching institutions. Together we will explore best practices and design infrastructure alternatives to offer better care at lower costs. This arrangement will give Welltower and its partners direct access to Johns Hopkins' vast network of experts as we seek to innovate and advance healthcare delivery models together. Our work will benefit Welltower's operating platform and enhance shareholder value. We look forward to demonstrating our exceptional value proposition and our performance and now over to Shankh Mitra who is going to walk you through our operating results. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Mercedes. Good morning, everyone. I'll review our quarterly operating results, reflect on our full-year 2016 operating performance relative to our initial expectations and provide you our preliminary assessment after 2017's operating environment. Before I add the specifics, one element I trust you will take away from my comments today is our best-in-class assets located in the most affluent market and run by the premier operators have and will continue to drive superior relative and absolute performance. This is a direct result of a disciplined capital allocation strategy over many years, including our unique relationship investment strategies and a surgically targeted disposition program. Modern physical plants run by great operators have pricing power because the consumer wants to live in that environment or the modern healthcare can be effectively delivered in that setting. Our same-store portfolio grew 2.3% in the fourth quarter, bringing the total same-store NOI up to 3% for 2016, meeting the high-end of our initial expectation of 2.5% to 3%. This outperformance was driven by 3.4% growth in our short duration seniors housing operating portfolio where we originally guided for 2% to 3% for the quarter. 1.7% same-store NOI growth in Q4 was in line with our budget. Strong revenue growth of 3.8% was dampened by an elevated 4.8% increase in expenses for the quarter, mainly due to high labor costs. I will come back to this topic in a moment. We have enjoyed strong pricing power throughout 2016 in the U.S., UK and Canada and finished strong Q4 RevPAR growth of 4.3% with the highest contribution coming from our U.S. portfolio. We did lose incremental occupancy in the U.S. in Q4, but saw strong occupancy growth in the UK and Canada. As a reminder, we set an initial expectation of flat occupancy for the short portfolio in 2016 and ended the year up 50 basis points Looking forward to 2017, we're projecting 1.5% to 3% same-store growth for our senior housing operating portfolio, our short portfolio. This reflects our confidence in our asset quality, superior execution of our operating platforms and our asset management capabilities that are driven by our unique data and analytics platform which, as most of you know, is unmatched in the industry. Our operating assumptions include a solid RevPAR growth in the 3% to 4% range, offset by a flat to slight reduction in occupancy as a result of new supply in select market and recent food trends and a 4% to 4.5% increase in expenses, including a 5% to 5.5% increase in labor costs. While labor costs remain at elevated levels, we hope we have seen the worst of this cost item in 2016 as contributing factors such as living wage growth in the UK moderate in 2017. Though we do not and will not provide any quarterly guidance, I will remind you that 2016 was a leap year. We estimate the extra day in last February will negatively affect our Q1 2017 growth rate by roughly $1.8 million or around 1% for the short portfolio. We will not normalize this item and the negative effect on our growth rate is already baked into the full-year projection. The medium duration outpatient medical portfolio continues to produce steady and predictable growth driven by low lease turnover and high tenant retention. This dynamic led to a solid quarter with 2.1% same-store growth, right in line with our expectation. We had outstanding tenant retention of 92% in the quarter, offset by an 8.1% same-store operating expenses growth, driven by mostly taxes and other maintenance-related expenses. For the full year of 2016, same-store NOI was up 2.4% at the high-end of our initial guidance up to 2.5% for the year. Our exceptional operating team led by Mike Noto, combined with great assets, 95% of which are affiliated with highly regarded health systems, provides us excellent visibility into this income stream. As such, we're projecting 2% to 2.5% growth for this portfolio in 2017. The long-duration triple net portfolio continues to produce stable and reliable performance. This has the benefit of counterbalancing potential volatility in our short duration portfolio in certain parts of the cycle. Senior housing triple net NOI was up 2.8% in Q4, capping the year at 2.8%, squarely in the middle of our guidance range of 2.5% to 3% for the year. As a reminder, we don't include fee-related income in our same-store metrics. We think this provides a more accurate picture of underlying performance. We're projecting 2.5% to 3% for the segment for 2017. Turning to postacute and long term care which now represents only 13% of our portfolio, same-store NOI grew 3.3% for the quarter, capping the year at 3.4% relative to 3% initial guidance for 2016. We're projecting 2.5% to 3% NOI growth for the segment in 2017; however, the story here more than the numbers is our significant effort last year to reduce single tenant risk. Our remaining portfolio is now even more secure with coverage at 1.7 times before management fee and 1.4 times after management fee. This is a sequential improvement of 7 and 5 basis points respectively. As a reminder, management fee of operators are subordinate to our rent. To conclude, we expect another good year of steady growth in 2017. Our portfolio is diversified by geography, product type, operators and duration which helps to drive resilient growth through cycles. We'll continue to focus on highly targeted capital allocation strategies to finetune our portfolio. This will drive sector-leading operating performance and superior full-cycle returns to our shareholders. Before I pass it over to Scott, I want to touch on a topic of interest, senior housing supply. We will continue to emphasize the importance of local market and submarket exposures when evaluating the supply picture. Compared to national numbers, in 2016 our top 10 U.S. markets experienced 30% less inventory growth and at year-end has 200 basis points less construction as a percentage of existing inventory. Looking forward, based on construction start data which peaked in the third quarter of 2015 and using a four quarter, six quarter lag, deliveries are expected to top out in the first half of 2017. This could shift later in the year due to potential construction delays. We're not in the business of predicting macro supply, but the client development cycle attests to the strength of our high-quality portfolio and the advantages of having the patient and perspective of long term investors, investing in one of the biggest secular teams of our generation. With that, I'll pass it over to Scott Estes, our CFO. Scott Estes : Thanks, Shankh and good morning, everybody. Throughout calendar 2016, our corporate finance team articulated a capital allocation team that had three primary goals, to enhance the quality of our portfolio and private pay mix, maintain a strong balance sheet and low leverage and to retain ample liquidity until the broader capital markets environment improved. Well, I'm happy to say we delivered on all three fronts. First, we enhanced the quality of our portfolio, minimized single tenant risk and drove an increase in our private pay revenue mix to 93%. Second, we reduced our leverage by over 200 basis points to 37.4% at year-end, strengthened our credit metrics and received ratings increases to BAA1 and BBB+ from Moody's and S&P respectively. And third, we renewed and extended our line of credit through 2021, ending the year with nearly $3 billion of liquidity. As we enter 2017, our balance sheet is positioned to support our strategy as we intend to focus on three major financial objectives during the upcoming year. First, we'll maintain the strength of our balance sheet. Second, we'll become a leaner, more efficient organization as our 2017 G&A expense is projected to come in $30 million below our original 2016 forecast. And third, we'll drive incremental cash flow growth by both enhancing the performance of our existing portfolio and through potential acquisitions. I'll begin my more detailed remarks with perspective on our recent financial results, our 2017 dividend payment rates and several minor changes we made to our supplement and earnings release. In terms of fourth quarter earnings, we generated normalized FFO of $1.10 per share and normalized FAD of $0.99 per share. G&A of $32.8 million for the quarter came in below our expectations. We recognize significant gains on asset sales of $200 million and we incurred $13 million of impairment, primarily associated with three properties based on current valuations. For the full year of 2016, our normalized FFO and FAD per share increased 4% and 6% respectively. This annual growth was primarily driven by solid same-store cash NOI growth as net investments totaled the relatively modest $244 million in 2016 as a result of the significant $2.8 billion of dispositions completed this year. Now moving to dividends, we paid our 183rd consecutive quarterly cash dividend on February 21 of $0.87 per share, representing a new rate of $3.48 annually and a current dividend yield of 5.2%. Now we did make one notable addition to the supplement this quarter where on Page 19 we provided both the effective interest rate and cash interest rate on our loan portfolios and I would also point out that in our earnings release, we no longer intend to provide FAD guidance due to its potential perception as a liquidity measure, although we will continue to provide the component parts as detailed in our 2017 outlook section in Exhibit 4. Turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet, I think the most significant capital event this quarter was the $1.93 billion in proceeds generated from dispositions through $125 million in loan payoffs and $1.8 billion of property sales which included $200 million in gains on sale. A portion of our net proceeds were used for the early payoff of our $450 million in 4.7% senior unsecured notes maturing in September of 2017, as well as reducing our line of credit borrowings by $705 million to a balance of $645 million at year-end. We also repaid approximately $92 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.9% during the quarter and we assumed or issued $280 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 2.5%. So, as a result, we have nearly $3 billion of liquidity entering 2017 based on $2.4 billion of credit line availability and $557 million in cash and 1031 exchange funds on balance sheet. One of the most important achievements during 2016 was emerging at year-end with an even stronger balance sheet. As of December 31, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization has decreased to 37.4% and net debt to enterprise value declined to 31.1%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.4 times, while our adjusted interest and fixed charge coverage for the quarter was strong at 4.2 times and 3.3 times respectively. Our secured debt level remained at only 12% of total assets at quarter end. Importantly, we anticipate further strengthening our balance sheet in early 2017 by using near term disposition proceeds to reduce preferred stock by $288 million and secured debt by over $700 million during the first quarter. I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2017 guidance. In terms of investment expectations, there are no acquisitions included in our 2017 guidance. Our guidance does include $323 million of development funding on projects currently underway and an additional $544 million in development conversions at a blended projected stabilized yield of 7.7%. In terms of dispositions, we've added $400 million of incremental loan payoffs and property sales this year to $1.6 billion of dispositions that were previously disclosed in our December 2016 portfolio repositioning release. This brings our calendar 2017 disposition forecast to $2 billion at a blended yield on precedes proceeds of 7.6%. As a reminder, the $1.6 billion of dispositions previously disclosed are comprised of $1.2 billion that were expected in the fourth quarter and a Genesis buyback of $400 million. At this point, we anticipate that virtually all of the $1.2 billion of carryover dispositions have closed or will close during the first quarter. In terms of same-store NOI cash growth, as Shankh detailed, we're forecasting blended growth of 2% to 3% in 2017 as we continue to project solid predictable internal growth across our portfolio. Our G&A forecast is approximately $135 million for 2017. This would represent a significant $30 million reduction relative to our original 2016 guidance. As our leadership team discussed on today's call, we do believe we owe it to our shareholders to maximize efficiencies within our cost structure. The vast majority of incremental savings in 2017 are projected to come from reductions in compensation and professional service fees. Our compensation-related savings are a result of our more efficient management structure and emphasis on leaner, high potential teams throughout the organization. We've also worked to minimize the cost of external professional services fees by bringing capabilities in-house where appropriate and leveraging technology wherever possible. So, finally, as a result of these assumptions, we expect to report 2017 FFO in a range of $4.15 to $4.25 per diluted share detailed in our press release. In conclusion, I will reiterate that our strong balance sheet remains the backbone supporting our strategy as we look to drive operating efficiencies and cash flow growth within our organization and across our portfolio in 2017. So, with that, Tom, I'll turn it back to you for your closing comments. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Scott. As you've heard from Mercedes, Shankh and Scott, we cannot be more excited about the opportunities for us. We've taken the last few years to assemble what is widely regarded as the largest and best located premium seniors housing operating business in the world. Yes, headlines of senior housing oversupply and the continuing saga of weak senior housing operators with poorly managed real estate make for bad headlines. As you've just heard, this is not our story. With respect to assets subject to government reimbursements, there is uncertainty and, as we've seen before, the potential for volatility. As you know today, these assets represent a much smaller percentage of our NOI. But we believe we know how to manage this volatility and our shareholders can trust us to work hard to capture the value of remaining in the postacute care sector even though admittedly the road can be bumpy. Nevertheless, it is clear to us that major academic and regional health systems do require a postacute care solution. Given that, we're exploring how we can best deploy capital side by side with these high quality, strong credit systems to address this need. Nothing more to share on this now, but we're looking into this opportunity. You see we're laser focused on driving shareholder value and we're not afraid to make tough decisions when we believe it's all for the long term benefit of our shareholders. Welltower prides itself on having the most experienced and talented team, the lowest cost structure, the best senior housing real estate and operating platform, an outstanding national outpatient medical management business and unmatched global access to capital to realize the many opportunities to own the real estate that will drive healthcare delivery forward. And with that, Holly, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Todd Stender, Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi. Good morning and, Shankh, thanks for the details on the U.S. and Canada. As far as senior housing, I wonder if I could hear more on Canada? You certainly addressed the supply in the U.S., but maybe we could hear something about Canada just in specific markets if you can? Mercedes Kerr : Sure. We actually are developing a couple of assets in Canada - again, part of Toronto, something that as we talked about before, highly targeted location market. So we're not really seeing any pressure in our individual local markets from new supply that is anything to speak of. In fact, we had very solid performance in the past year in that particular portfolio. Shankh Mitra : And I will add to that. Canada is primarily an independent living market, right? So you are seeing some construction that we're bringing in with our partners, Chartwell and Nuvera and some very high barriers to entry locations in Canada, but there's not a lot of macro supply to speak of at least that's impacting our portfolio. Tom DeRosa : And Todd, it's Tom. The other thing to know about Canada is there are provinces in Canada that have greater acceptance of independent living as an option for particularly the 65- to 85-year-old active senior. This is a concept that is actually promoted by the government as a very good alternative for this older population. It's lower cost and actually allows - at some point when people have health issues, it allows a national health service like you have in Canada to more efficiently deliver healthcare services to this population because they are living in settings that range from 100 units sometimes over 800 units. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll, RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Thanks. Tom, can you talk a little bit about your investment strategy going forward? How has that changed or has it changed with the announced restructuring of the management team? Tom DeRosa : That's a good question, Mike. Nothing has really changed. I mean I think we've been pretty articulate about how we deploy capital across healthcare real estate. I think we've been pretty consistent. Again, we see in senior housing the majority of the capital we will deploy is behind our bench of leading operators. Occasionally like we did this past year, we brought a new operator into the mix. I think you know that we've looked to decrease our postacute care exposure, but we've also been quite vocal about the fact that we're not abandoning the sector because we think there will be opportunities to deploy capital at good returns in the future. The model by which we deploy capital may be different and we're continually looking to deploy capital around our outpatient medical business. As you know, we own 17 million square feet. Today this is a business that is scalable. We think we're best in class. We drive tremendous performance out of that model. So, again, you will continue to see us looking for opportunities to grow that business. With respect to outside the U.S., you should continue to see us look for good opportunities in Canada and for good opportunities in the UK where we have resources on the ground. We have infrastructure in order to properly own, underwrite and manage those healthcare assets. Mercedes Kerr : Excuse me, I just wanted to add one more thing. Our relationship strategy is actually very deeply rooted. We have eight folks in our business development team altogether and Tom just said, some of them are actually in Canada and the UK. But the relationship strategy that I touched on earlier and that Tom was just highlighting is very deeply rooted from the organization. So we continue to see the same momentum that we always have and expect to continue to have that going forward with our shallow pipeline. Michael Carroll : Great. And then are you in the market for larger transactions with new relationships or should we think about your investments going forward would be more focused with your existing relationships? Shankh Mitra : Mike, we're always - we're never in the market for new relationships. We've been in the business for a very long time. We're outstanding professionals who have been in the market and the industry for a very, very long period of time and you have seen we have been following some of these leading operators a decade plus. Northbridge is a very good example of that. They happen when they happen. But as you have seen from other investments, previously most of the investment volumes will come from existing relationships. Do we have a list of operators that we would absolutely love to have in our family of brands? Absolutely but it will happen in that time when the opportunity comes. Tom DeRosa : And, Mike, the other thing I would add is we're very snobbish about the quality of our portfolio. So we're not looking for opportunities to dilute the quality of what we own. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Joshua Raskin, Barclays. Joshua Raskin : First question just again on the investment front, I know you guys have historically not included any investments going forward in any of your guidance. I understand the prudence there. Is it fair to say, though, this year is a little bit more of a - we should take a little bit more of a serious consideration of that in light of the commentary you've made around supply and focusing on existing investments, et cetera. Should we sort of dial back our expectations, not within guidance, but just broadly as to deployment of capital this year? Mercedes Kerr : Well, you're right in that we don't typically give any guidance on that, but I did touch on the fact that we're actively in the market with our existing platforms and are actually optimistic about some of the opportunities that we see could materialize for us and for our investment. Joshua Raskin : Okay. All right. I think I understand. And then just on the G&A savings, if I look at the 4-Q run rate on your G&A levels, it looks like you've got a majority of those savings already in place. Is it fair to say that the $30 million of savings is extremely high visibility that you've recognized a large majority of it? How much of that is left to go? Scott Estes : We're highly confident in our ability to get there. Your run-rate point is right on and as we look at our budget for the teams as we think about them, as well as just contractually what we're thinking in terms of legal tax and consulting, we already have a good feel for what those numbers are going to look like this year. Tom DeRosa : Josh, we're questioning everything about the way we do business and I think that is something you should demand of us in any company. We're always reevaluating how we can do what we do better and more efficiently. So this is not a one-time plan. This should be something you expect from us longer term. Scott Estes : And it really started this year, frankly, in 2016 because that's why we wanted to point out our original guidance was for $165 million in 2016. So this is something we've really been driving last year 2016 and 2017 and beyond. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Chad Vanacore, Stifel. Chad Vanacore : Just thinking about your commentary about reducing your postacute exposure, but not leaving out the option to invest more in the future. Can you give us a little more color on why you're selling your Mainstreet debt and the options to acquire the properties there? Tom DeRosa : Well, Chad, we're looking to rebalance our postacute portfolio. We're looking - our postacute portfolio was highly concentrated. That is something that - we've been very upfront about saying it's something that we needed to address. So when we think about redeploying capital to postacute, we're thinking about it, as I mentioned, in respect to major health systems and helping them to address their postacute care need. If we do not have a model that institutions like Welltower can invest in, then we have a bigger problem because it means many people will remain in hospital beds. So we're working very hard with major healthcare providers to rethink how this postacute care model will work in the future. Chad Vanacore : So how does that Mainstreet model, how does that fit in with the hospital systems? Shankh Mitra : And to specifically answer your question on Mainstreet, Chad, Mainstreet was not aligned to the whole health system strategy that Todd was talking about. As you know, as we've told you last quarter, we have ended our relationship with Mainstreet and to specifically answer your question on Mainstreet debt, they paid us a premium on face value and we absolutely - what we did to sell them our debt that we owned at a higher price than face value. So, if you think about Mainstreet which was not in any of the COS states going forward, we ended the relationship. So that's the answer to that question - that anybody would pay us at a premium we're happy to sell them. Chad Vanacore : All right. So sticking with postacute for a second, can you actually give us an update on your loans to Genesis? You've got a bridge loan out there. You've got some mezz financing. Just let us know where they are and as far as the HUD refinancing goes? Scott Estes : Sure. I Think it's important just to take a step back on our loans big picture. As a reminder for everyone, loans are only 3% of our total portfolio. We actually project them to be down in the 2% range by year-end and we've actually already decreased the loans by about $100 million year to date. We've disclosed the three different components really of the Genesis loans. You're right they aggregate to about $464 million. I think it was the bridge loans are $317 million of that and it really was a part of a bigger solution that provides a little more time to pay those off at a reasonable rate and it was, again, contemplated as a part of the all Genesis transactions that we've been working on. Chad Vanacore : And then just one last one. This may come from you, but how about some guidance on CapEx and income tax expectations for 2017? Scott Estes : Sure. The CapEx number is in that Exhibit 4. It's $71 million for 2017 and the income tax line we're projecting roughly $2 million to $3 million per quarter in 2017. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Knott, Green Street Advisors. Michael Knott : A question for you on your 2017 senior housing operating NOI growth guidance. Can you give us any color on what you would expect between the breakout between U.S. Canada and the UK? Obviously you have quite a bit of divergence there right now with the U.S. I think under 1% and NOI growth in the fourth quarter. So just any color you can provide and how that breaks out for 2017 would be really helpful. Shankh Mitra : Michael, it's Shankh. I will tell you that we're expecting roughly similar growth in U.S. and Canada next year and what is driving - we're expecting significantly higher growth for on a relative basis in our UK portfolio next year. So relatively same U.S. and Canada and higher UK is how I will describe it on a [indiscernible] perspective. Michael Knott : Okay. And then just one other quick one. The Johns Hopkins announcement today, just curious as you guys go forward and think more about health system relationships, particularly as it pertains to any future investments in skilled nursing and postacute that you might make, just curious how many of those types of relationships in the future would be made explicit like this one is or how many would just be in the background the way your outpatient medical business runs today? Just curious how many of those will become more explicit in the future? Mercedes Kerr : I expect them to become more explicit, Michael. One of the things that we're going to be working with Johns Hopkins on is real estate infrastructure and our objective is to find ways to innovate to become better partners, if you will, for health systems as they are expanding their ambulatory strategies. Naturally those ambulatory strategies will have real estate implications and so that is certainly a focus for us. Michael Knott : Okay. So I guess another way of saying my question was for those systems where it does become more explicit, is it a different type of relationship than what you've done historically in outpatient medical, for example? Mercedes Kerr : That's right. Because historically it has been a landlord and tenant relationship that we have had with them and what I'm describing is a partnership much like the kind that you've seen us have with senior housing operators. Tom DeRosa : Michael, one of the things that we're seeing is these large superregional and academic medical systems are taking a very keen look at the senior housing space. So we talked little bit about postacute and why that is - for them is an issue that needs to be addressed. But they are also looking at how they can connect to the senior housing operators, particularly around the conditions of high levels of frailty and dementia Alzheimer's. Mercedes talked a little bit about one of the large regional systems where we have effectively brought our operator together with the system. And it is not only benefitting that health system, it's benefiting Welltower by seeing a 200 basis point increase in occupancy. This is very early days. We were invisible. Senior housing was completely invisible to hospital systems. Why? Because it's outside the reimbursement framework. But increasingly, these systems need to see senior housing as part of effective healthcare delivery networks because the people that live with us are the largest risk population for those health systems. They are seeing how our sector can help them manage that risk, so I would say more to come on this. Michael Knott : Okay. So you think MOB-type relationships will be more important in the future if you can bring the health system relationships or expertise, not only in the MOBs but across senior housing and postacute as well? Tom DeRosa : I think it gives us a competitive advantage versus all the capital out there that would like to invest in the MOB space. What that capital doesn't bring is all the benefits which I just articulated. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Karin Ford, Mitsubishi Securities. Karin Ford : In the operating seniors housing portfolio, it sounds like you're getting good pricing, but expenses are keeping the 2017 growth a little below the long term trend. If memory serves, it's closer to 3% to 4%. You mentioned potential moderation of supply and maybe even expense growth later in the year. Any chance you could see NOI accelerate in the portfolio in the back half and maybe get back up to the 3% plus level in 2018? Shankh Mitra : So, Karin, it is very hard to comment on 2018 at this point in time. But if we look at the NIC information, you will see that most of the supply - the sort of peak of the supply will be delivered in the first half of 2017 and you also have in - you obviously are following the flu situation - the impact will also be sort of the first quarter. So our focus was the first quarter. So you will see that, relatively speaking, you will see a little bit of acceleration in the back half of 2017 from a numbers perspective. Now if supply doesn't really pick up, you can see at least in our portfolio, our U.S. portfolio still has occupancy upside left. And obviously the expense growth moderates, stays at that elevated level but at least moderates from a year-over-year perspective, you can see some acceleration in 2018, but we're not prepared to talk about that just yet. Karin Ford : Fair enough. Okay. My second question is on postacute. Are you guys on track to hit the pro forma coverage level of 145 that you had talked about on the disposition - following the dispositions? And I saw you took out the Genesis disclosure. Can you just tell us on a same-store basis what happened to coverage and occupancy for the retained Genesis facilities? Scott Estes : Hi, Karin. It's Scott. I think first in terms of the coverage you can see there was a nice improvement this quarter, but that really was largely the result of those Genesis dispositions that affected the occupancy and affected the coverage that you see on the first Page of the supplement. It's almost the same answer to your question as why I can't get more color - why did we take out our disclosure? We were reporting Genesis information on a one quarter lag like we do with everybody else. We don't do that for anybody else and since they are a public company, what would've been in the supplement was what they reported four months ago. So you can continue to see their dot and their bubble page in terms of their coverage overall which is a little above 1.2 for the data that we reported, but we're just going to keep reporting on this basis going forward. Karin Ford : Okay. And are you on track to hit the 145 level? Shankh Mitra : If we continue to sell Genesis, as Scott said, that obviously Genesis buyback is in our guidance, that coverage you should see should continue to go up. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Paul Morgan, Canaccord Genuity. Paul Morgan : Just to go kind of go back to the Hopkins relationship, I know it's obviously early days here. But just maybe is it possible to kind of set expectations on what we should expect to hear next out of the venture and kind of both in terms of the sort of relationship type stuff and hard investment in 2017 and 2018 or is it kind of a longer term situation then? Mercedes Kerr : The relationship is expected to be a long term one, but we will be updating everybody certainly as we make progress on the multiple initiatives that we're undertaking. We're actually already working on a quality measurement tool that we think will illustrate the value in assisted living and memory care that Tom was describing before. Obviously the information can be shared with existing and potential customers. It could also help to pave the way for other mutually beneficial partnerships between health systems and our seniors housing operating partners. So there will be a number of different fronts that we're going to be working on together and we'll bring updates as they become available on the progress that we're making. Paul Morgan : Okay. Great. And then just a quick question. Is there any update you have on the vintage portfolio relative to your kind of initial pro forma and how things are shaping up? Mercedes Kerr : Certainly, as you know, we announced a closing in October and since then our operators have jumped in and they are very focused. They are executing on their plans. So it's early days, but they're doing everything that we would expect them to do hiring staff and working on renovation plans and such. The property is obviously a great fit for us - our Sunrise in Silverado and they are great operators. So if anybody can deliver on a plan, it would be them. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra, Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Just two quick ones on RIDEA. First, you kind of mentioned I think overall occupancy was down about 40 bps in the quarter. Can you give us a bit more color on in the U.S. markets where you're seeing supply how occupancy and maybe NOI growth trended there relative to markets where there is very little supply? Maybe just rake up the growth profile in the U.S.? Shankh Mitra : Tim, our head of asset management will give you the details. But overall obviously, as you know, we provide very detailed disclosure. We're not prepared to give you even more than the occupancy projection in different parts of our portfolio. But, as I said, the U.S. we lost occupancy and we gained in UK and Canada. Relatively that's what I want to think about. Tim Lordan : Yes, Vik. This is Tim Lordan. The story is the same there. So we saw weakness in Chicago, Atlanta and Kansas City, but the core markets held up well. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. And just on as you think about making future investments in senior housing and RIDEA in particular, with incremental capital potentially foreign capital also chasing, have you tweaked or changed anything in terms of your underwriting parameters or any other factor that you are focused on more so today than you were maybe over the last two years? Justin Skiver : This is Justin Skiver, SVP of Underwriting. I would say that we really haven't changed our perspective on what we're looking for from an underwriting perspective. It's the core markets and most importantly it's the top operators. So I would say that the fundamentals there from an underwriting perspective have not changed. Obviously, on a deal by deal basis, you are evaluating the individual characteristics of that deal related to the real estate, the acuity level of the residents. So I would say nothing has changed, but obviously deal by deal you are looking at it more deeply. Scott Estes : The one thing I would add to that is every day we're driving more value from our expertise on the operating side and helping these smaller regional businesses operate on a higher level. We've been very focused, as you know, on helping them drive down expenses and driving the benefits of scale that they get from being part of the Welltower family. We're now looking at ways we can help them on the revenue side, so stay tuned on that. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Sheila McGrath, Evercore. Sheila McGrath : Could you give us an update on the New York City developments and your expectations of timing? Is that a project you would envision some strategic alliance with a major medical entity might make sense? Mercedes Kerr : Yes. Thank you for that question. In fact, it is one of those locations that is prime for the innovation that we've been trying to describe and we're in conversations with the health system about how we can collaborate in that market to bring more value to the population. We continue to make progress on the project. We're on track. The properties that we're actually going to demolish are now vacant. So we're going to start our pre-demolition work here probably by next week. So we're excited to see that kind of progress. We've also actually increased the size of the project slightly because we found some efficiencies. So more value enhancing our returns. And, believe it or not, are already fielding phone calls from prospective residents who are quite interested in living in the community and have actually offered to become almost ambassadors on our behalf and getting the message out about the property. So the schedule continues as we have always advocated for now and we're starting to make progress. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler, KeyBanc Capital. Jordan Sadler : I just wanted to flesh out the opportunity in outpatient medical. It sounds like that's an area of focus for 2017, but I guess, if I think back or look back over the last several years, it's not really been an area of focus in terms of incremental investment. Maybe you've invested a few hundred million dollars over the last three years. Can you maybe talk about what it is about the opportunity set that's presenting itself today that you're sort of directing us as that's an area of opportunity we should expect you to be investing in? Tom DeRosa : Well, Jordan, one of the things I said earlier was that the major academic medical systems and regional health systems are really taking a very close look at their outpatient ambulatory care strategy. It's going to require a lot of capital for them to build the networks they need to grow their patient population base. One of the key strategies of major health systems is they've invested significant dollars in generally their Center City acute-care facilities where research and teaching and technology are driven from. In a world where length of stays are decreasing every day in hospitals, how do you keep those beds filled? You need to build a broader feeder system to that acute-care hospital so you can maintain your competitive edge and they are going to do that by building larger ambulatory care networks. This is something that because of our relationships with these systems is an area that people are looking very closely at. One of the reasons why you haven't seen the business grow perhaps the same rate as senior housing is it's rare that there are large portfolios to acquire in this space and if they come about, in many cases they haven't been of quality that reach our screen. So we're always in the market, we're always looking and we're a big player. Again, we own 17 million square feet of outpatient medical and we're a full-service outpatient medical management. So this is an area that has always been import and we're seeing some of the changes that are helping across healthcare delivery perhaps bringing a new set of opportunities that we have not seen in the past. Shankh Mitra : And, Jordan, I'll add to that. As you know, medical office business has been very, very competitive from a pricing perspective and you know our investment philosophy is more offmarket relationship driven. So every time you saw opportunities, obviously the option tends to run very crowded and that's not how we invest capital. So obviously now what you're hearing from Tom and Mercedes and the team that we're replicating the same relationship investment strategy from the senior housing that we have been very successful and trying to go and replicate the same idea and same strategy in the medical office business and that's what you're hearing from us. The relationship that we announced today is just the beginning of that. But we do not want to deploy capital for the sake of deploying capital. We want to deploy capital when we think we can make money for our shareholders. Jordan Sadler : That's helpful. And then one other. As it relates to Brookdale with all due respect to the ongoing process and your relationship, I'm just curious if the margin - this is one of your top operators listed in your supplemental, would you be inclined to increase exposure to an operator like Brookdale or decrease at the margin? Mercedes Kerr : So I'll start off, we're not actually looking to expand our relationship together. So consequently we're actually not participating in any process there. What I can tell you about our properties with Brookdale is that we have a solid group and I will say that we're not in the habit of giving individual portfolio statistics. But just to illustrate my point, I can tell you just this one time that our portfolio there covers 1.2 times. So we have a solid relationship, but it's not one that we're expanding. Tom DeRosa : And think I think that's pretty similar to what HCP may have announced in the last week or so, that their coverage was about 1.2 times just like ours. Shankh Mitra : I'll add - Jordan, I'll just add from the Q4 numbers that we released this morning, our Brookdale exposure, as we said this morning, is lower because we have closed the Brookdale as part of our Cindat joint venture yesterday. Jordan Sadler : What's that pro forma number? Shankh Mitra : I don't have it off the top of my head. Jordan Sadler : That's okay. I can calculate it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Juan Sanabria : Maybe this one is for Scott. With regards to the dispositions that are scheduled and planned for in 2017, how should we think about the use of proceeds? Is the plan mainly to delever over and above kind of what you've committed to for development funding? Scott Estes : I think that's a good way to think about it. So I think really in two phases at least. The first phase I can give a good bit of detail on. Like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there is about $1.2 billion of dispositions that carried over from last year. Those are largely seniors housing triple net deals that have basically happened or should happen within the next few weeks. So the use of those proceeds which are about at least $1 billion of that $1.2 billion, would be to pay off our $288 million of preferred stock. Plus, we've targeted about $700 million of secured debt. So I think the rest of it is a little bit wait and see. We still have some line borrowings available, but hopefully we'll have some success in ongoing acquisitions and development funding. But I think the net reduction probably comes in the first part of the year. Juan Sanabria : You would like to keep that level lower leverage going forward? Scott Estes : Yes, I feel great about the balance sheet. I mean it's been very helpful, I think, in terms of how we're thinking about the business. It just gives us a ton of flexibility. So the $3 billion of liquidity I articulated did not even account for the potential $2 billion of dispositions. So we really have an opportunity to take one more notch down here and that just puts us solidly in the range we're at today. Juan Sanabria : And then just on seniors housing CapEx, I know you gave kind of the gross guidance for 2017 for the Company, but kind of what are you expecting on a dollar per bed spin basis? And how should we think about that going forward? I think Tom mentioned in his intro remarks that you would like to kind of focus on newer product as you grow and just trying to think about how CapEx should change given all the new supply being added to the purpose built just to keep the existing stock relevant and competitive? Shankh Mitra : One, we'll follow-up with you on the exact number on CapEx. I want to make one point, though. As you know, we have the youngest assets in the industry in our portfolio, as you can see in those numbers. So we're not particularly worried about as they put CapEx in existing facilities to drive performance. But if your question is more focused towards the industry, that is definitely something that you should probably see or will see from the industry. As far as we're concerned, we have the youngest assets asset pool in the business and we think - Scott Estes : In the best locations. Shankh Mitra : In the best locations and we think that we'll be fine. Juan Sanabria : And just one last kind of question for me. So you talked about the MOB opportunities and kind of the Johns Hopkins relationship being the first step. What exactly are you thinking about in terms of the actual product type when you say ambulatory turn networks versus how we traditionally think of MOBs? Is it the same or is that kind of a different, more purpose built product or if you could just elaborate a little bit on that? Tom DeRosa : I think you're going to see more buildings that are designed to drive procedures out of the acute-care hospital into an outpatient setting. So what you're essentially seeing is it a transition from the old doc in a box to basically day hospitals. Mercedes Kerr : And we have actually many examples of that in our portfolio already because we identified this trend quite some time ago and it's actually the reason why we talk about our portfolio as an outpatient medical portfolio and not a medical office building portfolio. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Mueller, JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Two questions. One, wondering can you comment on development trends for the portfolio in terms of what's coming online? How long it's taking to stabilize versus expectations? And then, Tom, one of your comments again about possibly growing postacute, how should we think about that from big picture? Is it once you sell the $1.6 billion that's identified now, you are probably not going to see anything more meaningful and then just selectively grow it? I mean do you think the percentage allocation will change dramatically? Tom DeRosa : No, Mike. I think we're going to be very selective. And I hope that came across clear in my remarks. We're going to be very selective about how we deploy capital into postacute. We're not looking to roll up existing supply of postacute that is out there. We're looking to help drive the next generation of postacute where we can feel the opportunity to deploy capital will provide our shareholders with the right risk return scenario. Next question. Shankh Mitra : And, Mike, I just want to add, as you heard from Scott, we have the Genesis buyback of $400 million or so built into our guidance. So, if anything, net net you might actually see our exposure go down. But we're definitely not looking to bulk up in that space. Tom DeRosa : Now, Mike, you also asked a question about development - our development pipeline and occupancy there. Michael Mueller : Yes, fill-up trends. Tim Lordan : Mike, this is Tim Lordan. As Shankh mentioned, it takes about six quarters to develop these projects and if you do them in the right markets, you develop a nice waiting list or a list of residents as you go through that process. So fill-up could take anywhere from a year or 18 months after that. Scott Estes : The only thing I would add, Mike, is that we have a good - most of our fill-up assets are in our triple net or postacute portfolios. So we're collecting rent from day one on those. I don't think I've noticed any material change in the time it's taking these assets to fill up. And I would also note that about 80% of that fill-up, again, is in a master release. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson, Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : On the outpatient medical discussion point, do you see that as kind of a slow kind of process of developing assets here and there or something that could require quite a bit of time that by the time it's done, we'll all on this call be retired? Or is it something that could happen in kind of quick spots through large types of bulky investments, more of a rapid pace to the end game? Tom DeRosa : One of the things that we're hoping for, if you follow the progress of some of the major regional and academic medical systems, they are acquiring other hospitals. This gives them large portfolios not only of additional hospitals but also ambulatory and outpatient assets. We're hoping that at some point these systems will look to sell some of these or partner some of these assets. That's where most of the high-quality outpatient opportunities lie. They are sitting in the hands of these major health systems. Rich Anderson : And so we're talking $1 billion type dollar deals. Tom DeRosa : This could be one of the biggest pools of potential investment opportunities that the healthcare REIT space has ever seen, if you think about it, if you look at the amount of real estate that is owned by these major systems. And that's why we have limited our strategy to these major systems. We believe they will wind up growing and essentially pushing a lot of weaker systems either out of business because they will be increasingly marginalized or pushing more and more acute-care into the safety net business of caring for the uninsured and Medicaid population. And that's not where we intend to be. Rich Anderson : Okay. Interesting. And so buying another medical office REIT is not the strategy that you have in mind here? Tom DeRosa : We don't comment on M&A and like anything, Rich, if the stars line up and that's the right thing for the shareholders, we would always review any opportunity. But that's not anything we're laser focused on at the moment. Rich Anderson : Okay. And then second question is you talk about G&A savings and rightsizing the leadership. Mercedes and Scott have numerous functions reporting to them. They may actually need an eighth day of the week to do their job at some point. How long can a company the size of this operate without an Chief Investment Officer or Chief Operating Officer or is that in the game plan down the road, just not right now? Tom DeRosa : Rich, when I stepped into this role a little under three years ago, I inherited a bloated inverted pyramid organizational structure. Since then, without fending off any major players, we got it to a rectangle. And as of January 3, we get it to a functional pyramid. Rich Anderson : So it's not a trapezoid? Tom DeRosa : No, it's not a trapezoid. It's a functional pyramid. So when you look at the way we're organized, the Company is now organized across three verticals. So one of those verticals reports to Mercedes, one of those verticals reports to Scott and one of those verticals reports to me. Those verticals create a much enhanced internal management structure, functional oversight structure and internal governance structure. So those structural enhancements allow for us not to have a Chief Operating Officer role because it is those aspects of that role are filled by the structure. Same thing with not having a Chief Investment Officer. So that is - the role of the Chief Investment Officer is fulfilled by a functional structure. This is something we can talk to you more about at any time, but we think it's working really well. And you know what? We all work 24/7 and that's what you should spec of any management team. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question will come from the line of John Kim, BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : I think Shankh referenced the flu season. We're about two-thirds the way through this winter. Can you just comment on how you see the impact of the flu season this year versus last couple of years in your shop portfolio? Mercedes Kerr : Sure. You probably have heard this from others already and seen the numbers yourselves and there is, indeed, a spike in 2017 in the incidence of the flu. Obviously we monitor that very closely and we're always in very active dialogues with our operators about this sort of thing. Naturally they have protocols to contain the flu and other such epidemics. These are the kinds of things that we're in dialogue with them about and their use of those kinds of tactics to try to stay ahead. Tim Lordan : John, this is Tim Lordan. I would say in summary we see the flu being a little bit more impactful than last year, but not anywhere near the historical flu season we saw a couple of years ago. We're seeing trends like that elevated in the UK. Fortunately to date we're not seeing a lot of exposure to flu in our communities in the UK and in the U.S., as Mercedes said, our operators are all over that. One of the lessons they learned from the historic flu season a couple years ago is how to improve their protocols to deal with that more effectively. So we had seen some impacts of flu in Connecticut and some other areas but nothing widespread. Shankh Mitra : And just as you think about - John, as you think about the numbers, if we have an outbreak of the flu that is greater than what we're talking about today, that probably gets us towards the lower end of the guidance and vice versa. So if you thought about the flu trend, it is one of the things we're thinking about. That's why we sort of created a range. That gets you from one side of the range to the other side of the range, depending on how it plays out. Tom DeRosa : I can tell you we've all been passing the flu around here in Toledo. That should be an area of concern, but we continue to come to work every day. John Kim : I can definitely relate to that. Moving on to Brookdale, hypothetically speaking, if another REIT were to acquire an ownership stake in the company, Brookdale, would that materially change how you view that relationship? Mercedes Kerr : Well, look, as you can imagine, our agreements have consent rights and the like that might apply in different scenarios. So a process that would require our input and we always seek to be constructive. We always seek to protect our shareholders' interests. So we really have no particular idea of what to play out if anything at all. It is speculative. But just know that we will have a seat at the table if ever it's required. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Knott, Green Street Advisors. Michael Knott : Just a couple of quick ones. Sorry. I know it's been a long call. The $1.2 billion, I think it is, of dispositions that will close in 1Q, I thought those were going to close by the end of 2016. Just is there anything noteworthy in terms of why that was delayed a bit? Tom DeRosa : No, it was just timing and closing process which is why they are happening early in 2017. Shankh Mitra : Michael, they were actually supposed to close in mid-February is what we thought. And one of them, as I said, closed yesterday. I thought it was going to close in two or three weeks, but they were never supposed to be closed by that year end. Michael Knott : Okay. Thanks for that. And then I'm still a little bit unsure how to think about your acquisition stance for 2017 and sort of how to sort of reconcile the fact that your guidance is zero but at the same time you had a surprisingly large fourth quarter of activity? And then also I think, Mercedes, you mentioned that you feel better about some types of relationship opportunities than you did a year ago. So just curious how to really think about all that together. I know you historically don't really guide on the acquisition side, but still having a little trouble figuring out your stance on how you are thinking about acquisitions in 2017? Mercedes Kerr : And I can appreciate that, Michael. I maybe I'm just repeating myself, so I apologize for that in advance. But it's what we said. We have a strong relationship network. We have a very strong business development team. We've described to you some of our initiatives with respect to the new business and how we're looking to replicate our success in outpatient medical. We feel that that is going to yield us off-market opportunities. We have - again, I'm repeating myself a little bit, but it's all to say that those are some of the reasons we feel optimistic about this coming year and our opportunities. Shankh Mitra : Michael, I'll just add to that that, as you heard from Mercedes, that we feel better about the opportunities as we sit right here. However, we'd never include acquisitions in our guidance and it's hard to do that, right? I mean you don't know when they are going to close, you don't know when you are going to shake hands, what your cost of capital will be, how much you want to keep, how much you want to JV. So all of these things play, but what you should remember is we have - opportunity is never constrained and the second point is we're seeing better opportunities. The third is we feel pretty good about the business. So, if the stars align, you should see strong acquisition opportunities from us as you have seen in the fourth quarter. Michael Knott : And then just last one, if I may. Tom, your comment about next-gen postacute, if I can use my words, not yours - is kind of where it's at in terms of skilled nursing. Just if I can ask a devil's advocate question of why in the long run keep the existing SNFs that you have now if the next-gen is where it will be at in the future? Tom DeRosa : Michael, it's because I think there's always going to be a broad need for skilled nursing. So, remember, our business is more aligned with the top end of the market and the top end of the market has a skilled nursing need. But the broader market won't always have a skilled nursing need. So when you can own skilled nursing with the right operators in the right markets, that should remain a reasonable asset class to invest in. It has been challenged because of all of the issues, whether they be from Medicare or Medicaid and we're in a period of uncertainty now because we don't know how the repeal of the ACA will affect particularly Medicaid reimbursement. There's a lot of questions about that. All I can tell you is, if this administration can address the fact that Obamacare expanded Medicaid to include able-bodied adults - so some people believe that of the 20 million of newly insured, 6 million were able-bodied adults that were added to the Medicaid ranks - that is a problem for everyone because Medicaid is for the elderly children, the blind and the disabled. So we're hoping for some clarity there and maybe that provides some relief to SNF operators that rely on Medicaid to get reimbursed for their services. But, you know, it's been a tough go and we're trying to be optimistic but we maintain skilled nursing cannot go away. Shankh Mitra : And, Michael, adding to Tom's point, if you think about it, we're very focused on capital allocation as our main job, right? Tom said, as you heard from him three times today, we want to maintain flexibility. And environments change. Investment opportunities change. If we see really good risk adjusted return opportunities with great health systems, we'll explore that. On the other hand, we think that there is a huge demand for these assets coming from foreign and domestic investors. If we think that we should crystallize the value for our shareholders, we'll go that way. You have seen us doing both and we want to be flexible and remain open and change as the market changes. Scott Estes : Final important point, Michael. This is Scott. I think we've actually been making this shift already. Not only is the postacute portfolio getting to about the 10% to 12% range which is right sized, but we've been selling the more Medicaid-centric skilled nursing assets for really the last five to seven years. And even with Genesis as well, we've been growing our powerbacks and the assets there - Medicaid centric and private pay, not even Medicaid certified assets. So it's actually happening already. Operator : And, at this time, we have no further questions. We would like to thank you for dialing into the Welltower earnings conference call. We do appreciate your participation and ask that you disconnect.",

My name is Holly and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President, Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, sir. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Holly. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower's first quarter 2017 results. Following my brief introduction, you will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Mercedes Kerr, EVP, Business and Relationship Management; Shankh Mitra, SVP, Finance and Investments; and Scott Estes, CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurances as projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning's press release and from time to time in the Company's filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release this morning, you may access it via the Company's website at welltower.com. Before handing the call over to Tom DeRosa, I want to highlight three significant points regarding our first quarter 2017 results. First, we disposed of over $1.1 billion in non-core assets, bring our private tape as a percentage of revenue and 93.1%, and using proceeds to retire $1.1 billion of high rate, secured debt and preferred securities. Second, this balance sheet focused capital allocation, reduced net debt to book capitalization to 35.8% and net debt to EBITDA to 5.26%; and nearly half turn reduction from just a year ago. And third, we reported 2.2% total portfolio same-store NOI growth for the quarter, and we are reaffirming our guidance of 2% to 3% total portfolio same-store growth for 2017 which as a reminder does not include any benefit from leap year adjustment. And, with that, I will hand the call over to Tom for some remarks on the quarter. Tom? Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Tim. We were pleased with our first quarter results, predictable and right on-track characterize this quarter. Words that may sound boring to some but speak of the stable growth that an A quality premium portfolio of healthcare real estate assets provides. The effective new supply hardly coupled with little differentiation in cap rates for A versus B assets has made us a net seller of senior housing assets this quarter. We have taken that capital and redeployed it behind the Welltower family of operators and reduced the leverage to historic low levels. Welltower's senior housing presence in dynamic metro markets on the eastern west coasts, as well as in Canada and the UK continue to provide a significant competitive performance advantage. We continue to reinvent the way we run our business with a focus on integration, efficiency and data. This contributes to continued decreases in our G&A costs. You see, we look to model the most successful growth companies of tomorrow and not bloat it [ph] inefficient structures of yesterday. Our unique focus on investing only in premiums assets has given our senior housing operators crucial pricing power and resilient organic performance that tells a very different story from national trends. Our leap year adjusted RevPAR was up over % despite a number of issues seen in Q1 like elevated and prolonged flu [ph]. Shankh and Mercedes will offer more detailed comments on senior housing supply but we are hearing that non-recourse construction financing is more limited than we've seen in years which may dampen the speckle of building we've seen in many markets. This leads us to believe that supply issues that have been impacting the senior housing industry may in fact start to moderate. Mercedes will offer some comments on the investment environment but I will say that today discipline is a hallmark of our investment strategy. There are many lessons learned from the asset aggregation period of our past that today guide how we deploy our shareholders capital. We will continue to refine our portfolio by shedding non-core assets where we do not see an adequate return on CapEx dollars, and reinvest that capital in a next generation of our senior housing assets that will become an effective partner to the major health systems in the top markets in which Welltower is concentrated. Now over to you Mercedes. Mercedes Kerr : Thank you, Tom. I will start today by describing our first quarter 2017 investment activity and will follow with some market perspectives, as well as an update on our value enhancing initiative. During the first three months of 2017 we completed $217 million of new investments, all with existing Welltower partners including new perspective senior living and Avery Healthcare. These follow-on transactions consist of recently constructed buildings and include a $104 million of new acquisitions, a blended yield of 6.4%. We also faced nine development properties into service during the quarter with a total value of $186 million and a yield of 7%. Our ability to add recently constructed assets to our portfolio at attractive stabilized fields is especially valuable given our disposition strategy. As you heard in the first quarter, our dispositions totaled $1.1 billion and yielded 6.6%. These dispositions included a combination of loan payout, outright sales and the completion of the previously announced monetization of a 75% interest in 11 Brookdale assets into our Cindat/Union Life joint venture for $268.5 million. Scott Estes will describe our uses of proceeds in more detail. To echo Tom's opening comments, Welltower's investment in dispositions this quarter highlights our disciplined capital allocation and spending. On the investments front, we're pursuing earnings in NAV accretive opportunities which are often off-market while at the same time we're careful to reject those deals that don't offer adequate risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. Our disposition strategy is designed to improve portfolio quality while selectively capturing the benefit of buyer demand and attractive market pricing. Speaking of market pricing; this fair to say that cap rates remain aggressive, especially for widely marketed portfolios. Our focus on all markets deals and repeat business throughout our operator partnership keeps us mostly out of that fray but as owner, we are observing these trends with great interest as local and foreign institutional investors growing appetite for healthcare assets with a premium on quality portfolios like ours. Regarding new supplies, we continue to monitor changes in occupancy and other operating metric which may result from new competition. But we remain optimistic about our portfolios resiliency and are encouraged by the slowing in construction financing and starts of recent quarters. As you know, starts peak in the third quarter of 2015 are continuing to moderate. Non-recourse construction financing have become scarce in the last six to nine months and spreads have widened 50 to 75 basis points along with the increase in LIBOR. This has resulted in an all -- in a cost increase of as much as 150 basis points. While starts data is volatile from quarter to quarter, we continue to believe that we will see a dampening from construction cost increases as we look into the second half of the year. In addition to anecdotal and evidence of these trends, the year-end seniors housing industry report published by CBRE has detailed discussions on the topic for anyone looking for more color. I want to end by sharing a few examples of our most recent asset management initiatives. First, we're helping operators implement industry leading systems to better match staffing levels to current census and acuity, and to improve billing accuracy for the services provided. These tools are tailored to fit each operating platform and should have a meaningful impact on revenues. On the expense side, we have previously talked about our savings resulting from group purchasing of property insurance. We're now looking to expand into other products such as health and wellness benefits coverage. And finally, we're leveraging our outpatient medical teams experience to produce maintenance expenses in our seniors housing communities. These projects use to scale and the intellect of the Welltower platform to drive sustainable improvements and cash flow. We're excited about the possibilities that we will post to you on progress. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Shankh who is going to discuss portfolio performance. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Mercedes and good morning, everyone. I will now review our quarterly results with an emphasis in our senior housing business and focus on some geographic detail that many of you have recently asked about. Our overall same-store NOI increased 2.1% year-over-year. The triple net portfolio continues to produce stable and reliable performance. Our senior housing triple net segment grew 3.2% and the long-term post-acute portfolio grew 3.4%. Growth remains healthy and payments remain secured. Same-store NOI for outpatient medical portfolio grew 2.4%; all three of this business segments are in line with our expectations that we describe to you in the year end call in February. As a reminder, we don't include fee-related income in our same-store metrics. We think this provides more accurate picture of underlying performance. Our senior housing operating segment reported growth of 0.9% above our initial budget for the quarter. The headline results are partly lower due to leap year effect, sales in 2016 which benefited those operators that bill residents on a part DM basis adjusting for one extra days of NOI in Q1 of 2016; on a comparable basis, Q1 '17 shows same-store NOI grew 1.9% despite a 90 basis points decline in sure occupancy, revenue increased by 2.3% due to a 4.1% increase in RevPAR on a leap year adjusted basis. Strong pricing power is the hallmark of Class A real estate and long-term value preservation. Operating expenses increased 3% for shop; adjusting for the leap year, same-store expenses were up 3.5%. Labor expense remains elevated but the growth rate is down from recent highs. 2016 UK living wage growth is still impacting Q1 numbers but we expect overall operating expense to moderate in rest of the year in UK. Overall, senior housing demand supply remains largely healthy with the pockets of imbalance due to heightened deliveries in certain markets. We have seen overall industry occupancy drop as new deliveries lease up. It is important to understand that move outs in the quarter was elevated due to a heightened and prolonged flu season. Much has been written about this topic with a focus on overall population data from CDC. If you look at 65 plus segment of the population as we do; outpatient visits due to flu increased 70% from last year and was 35.5% higher than the epic 2017 flu season. The hospitalization rate in this segment almost quadrupled from last year but was 50% lower than 2015. While debt due to flu is almost up 4x over last year, it is a lot lower than 2015. How do the stats translate into our business; quality operators learned valuable lesson in 2015 and were much better prepared to deal with a bad flu season this year. These precautions have led to many more temporary resident bans to protect our resident population. Say for example, what we observe in the New York metro region. While we saw strong demand that manifested in 5% plus RevPAR growth in New York MSA, admissions banned in a handful of our communities contributed to an occupancy decline of 2,280 basis points resulting at flattish NOI growth in this market which usually ranks amongst our top markets quarter-after-quarter in NOI growth. We think this admissions bans will prove beneficial to rest of the year's results as they have held to protect our resident population, providing us a base to build upon as we enter the traditional moving season in late Q2 into Q3. These markets -- in markets where we did not experience this occupancy headwinds, we continue -- our continued strong pricing power manifested into strong NOI growth in markets like D.C., Southern California, Toronto and London. Our core market versus non-core market performance spread narrowed this quarter relative to last year. Other markets remain relatively flat but core market growth has receded from mid-single digit growth due to flu situations in New York and New England. We expect core market growth to pick up in the second half as we build back occupancy. It is important to note that we also observed an interesting divergence in our IL versus AL performance from last year. While same-store NOI growth in our IL communities was higher than that of AL communities primarily due to lower expense growth in IL we observed higher occupancy decline in IL versus AL. While one quarter does not make a trend, we will continue to keep close eye on this topic. In conclusion, our operating metrics were as expected in Q1 with the exception of [indiscernible] portfolio which outperforms our initial expectations. We're excited about the year and at the prospect of our operating performance. We believe our operating portfolio provides significant total return or unlevered IRR opportunity driven by three levers; occupancy upside, rate growth and normalized expense trends. We believe our sustained rate growth in the face of new supply exhibits not only the quality of real estate that we own but also the value propositions senior living provides for its growing need based resident population. While regency [ph] buyers may dominate the mindshare in very short-term, we are confident our assets class in general and Welltower in particular offers a unique opportunity to medium and long-term investors. This is particularly interesting as investors think about comparing our portfolio to many core group asset class with mid-90% occupancy level at the time when the economy is essentially at full employment. We hope as our growth rate starts to reaccelerate in the second half of the year relative to the first half and shows resilient growth in next couple of years; the public markets will share the enthusiasm that we encounter every day from world's most astute private investors. With that, I'll pass it over to Scott Estes, our CFO. Scott? Scott Estes : Alright, thanks, Shankh and good morning, everybody. From a financial perspective we're off to a solid start to the year as we continue to demonstrate the capital allocation discipline that we've been articulating over the past year. As we continue to enhance the quality of our portfolio, our corporate finance team has ensured that our balance sheet has made commensurate improvement as well. I'll start off by emphasizing three specific first quarter financial highlights. First, we generated over $1.1 billion in disposition proceeds during the quarter which were used to repay both secured debt and preferred stock leaving us with limited debt maturities throughout the remainder of the year. Second, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet through these pay-offs resulting in enhanced credit metrics and a reduction in undepreciated book leverage at 35.8%, its lowest ordering level in nearly five years. And third, we dramatically improved the operational efficiency of our platform as first quarter G&A declined by more than 30% from the comparable quarter last year. Most importantly, our stronger balance sheet and nearly $3 billion in current liquidity will allow us to remain both disciplined and opportunistic in regard to any incremental investments, dispositions and capital raises throughout the remainder of the year. I'll begin my detailed remarks with some perspective on our first quarter financial results, our dividend and changes to our supplement and earnings presentation. We started off the year with solid financial results relative to our expectations generating normalized FFO of $1.05 per share versus $1.13 per share last year. Earnings declined as expected due to the nearly $4 billion in dispositions completed since the beginning of 2016 and our efforts to reduce leverage by nearly four full percentage points over the last 12 months. As a reminder, we're no longer providing an official fed per year [ph] calculation this year but are providing additional detail regarding straight line rent, CapEx, non-cash interest expense and stock based compensation at the bottom of exhibit 2 in our earnings release. Our G&A came in $31 million for the first quarter, this represented a significant year-over-year reduction from $46 million in 1Q '17 as we continue to enhance our operational efficiency. Based on the strong start to the year, we're tracking at or slightly below our initial G&A guidance of $135 million for the full year. We recognized significant gains on asset sales of $244 million during the quarter. This was partially offset by small impairments and a few held for sale properties and an unconsolidated entity. We also recognized charges related to our secured debt extinguishments and preferred stock redemption. In 2017 we began capitalizing most transaction costs which is why you see a zero in that line in the income statement this quarter; but I would note that the $11.7 million in other expenses includes some transaction costs primarily from deals that occurred in 2016, as well as severance costs. Moving onto dividends, we'll pay our 184th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on May 22 of the $0.87 per share representing a current dividend yield of 5%. We made several changes to our supplement this quarter to simplify and streamline its presentation. On page 6 based on analyst and investor feedback, we did refer the presentation of our triple net payment coverage stratification back to a chart format. And I think one notable addition that was made this quarter is on page 18 where we now provide additional detail on our debt broken out by local currencies, as well as related hedges. Turning now to our liquidity picture and balance sheet; I think the most significant capital event this quarter was the $1.1 billion in proceeds generated from dispositions to $65 million in long pay-offs and over $1 billion of property sales which included $244 million in gains. We used the majority of the proceeds to repay $806 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 5.6% during the quarter which lowered the average rate on our remaining secured debt at 3.7%. We also redeemed all 11.5 million shares of our 6.5% Series J preferred stock during the quarter valued at $288 million; and in terms of equity we generated approximately $112 million in proceeds under our [indiscernible] programs during the quarter. So as a result we have nearly $3 billion of current liquidity based on $2.5 billion of credit line availability and nearly $400 million in cash on balance sheet. Our significant secured debt and preferred stock pay-offs allowed us to significantly enhance our balance sheet metrics during the first quarter. As of March 31, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization declined 35.8% representing a 116 basis points sequential improvement from year end while net debt to enterprise value declines at 28.8%. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.26x while our adjusted interest in fixed charge coverage for the quarter increased to 4.3x and 3.5x respectively. Our secured debt declined to only 9.6% of total asset at quarter end representing a significant 240 basis points decline from the previous quarter. So I'll conclude my comments today with an update on the key assumptions driving our 2017 guidance. First in terms of same-store NOI growth based on the solid first quarter results generated across our portfolio. We're maintaining our blended growth forecast of 2% to 3% for the full year. In terms of our investment expectations, there are no acquisition other than that was completed during the first quarter and our 2017 guidance. Our guidance does include an additional $265 million of development funding on projects currently underway, and an additional $375 million in development conversions at a blended projected stabilized yield of 7.9%. In terms of our full year disposition forecast, we continue to anticipate a total of $2 billion of disposition proceeds at a blended yield of 7.6% based on $1.1 billion completed to-date and $900 million of incremental proceeds throughout the remainder of the year. And finally, as a result of these assumptions, we're maintaining our normalized FFO guidance of $4.15 to $4.25 per diluted share. So in conclusion, our enhanced balance sheet in $3 billion and current liquidity as a result of our capital allocation discipline continues to provide us with maximum financial flexibility in the current environment. So at this point, I'd turn it back to you Tom for some closing comments. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Scott. So let's talk about the deal of the week. We were quite pleased to see the excitement generated by Duke's decision to sell its medical office portfolio. In our almost 50 years in this business we have never seen such enthusiasm for healthcare real estate. Should we all be surprised? No. Revisited data indicates the value of hospital and medical office real estate in the U.S. to be $1 trillion. And by the way, 82% of this real estate is owned by health systems and physician groups with only 10% held by REITs and 8% by institutional investors. Over $600 billion of that is attributable to hospital brick and motor and the balance is MOBs. You should know that the majority of this hospital real estate was built around a fee for service model; so if it takes 10 days to fix a hip fracture, the hospital submitted a bill to the payer and got its cost reimbursed plus the margin. That model requires lot of real estate. Today however, we are moving to a value based model; if it takes you 10 days to fix a hip but the payer will only reimburse the hospital for the equivalent of a two-day stay, the hospital must eat those 8 days. As the focus increasingly shifts to outcomes, underperforming hospitals will be under further pressure. You should not be surprised that 52% of U.S. hospitals lost money last year. Like many malls, strip centers and suburban office; much of the hospital real estate in this country is obsolete and health systems are looking to evolve their real estate footprint while they invest heavily in other areas like technology. The shift in patient demand is being reflected in real estate demand as spread between hospital cap rates and MOBs continues to widen. A new generation of outpatient medical real estate connected to lower acuity settings like senior housing and modern post-acute care needs to be built in order to facilitate the transition to value-based healthcare. This is a huge opportunity, perhaps the most compelling opportunity the real estate industry has seen in decades. So the enthusiasm for Duke's healthcare asset is yet another indication that we are finally being recognized as an institutional investment class. If only a small portion of the 82% of this real estate transitions to REITs and other institutional investors, it's tens of billions of dollars investment opportunity. No company is better positioned than Welltower to take advantage of this opportunity, so stay tuned. Now Holly, open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, thanks. I wanted to ask you just quickly it sounds like there is no change in your -- or you said there is no change in your full year outlook for same-store NOI but I was just wondering was there any change in the composition of getting to that and I guess specifically are you still in that kind of 1% to 3% change growth in your -- in the same-store shop NOI for the year? Scott Estes : This is Scott Estes. You are correct; there is no change to any of the components to the build up for the same-store NOI. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. And then Tom, I'm just wondering, I know it's only past the house but the potential changes in the ACA -- does that give you any changes in the way you think about being in the post-acute business and I guess particularly some of the changes that we're talking about for Medicaid? Tom DeRosa : Yes, you know, it's still very early to tell. I think some of the proposed rhetoric that was coming out from CMS was initially seemed to be taking as negative. Actually it could easily be positive, I think it's just we have to stay tuned. You know, I come back to the fact that we need to move to lowering healthcare costs and improving outcomes. The real estate footprint that I just talked about is limiting the ability to reduce costs in healthcare delivery and I think the proposal for the repeal of Obamacare is very much focused on improving outcomes reducing cost and doing that by increasing competition. And I do believe that this should drive more of this hospital real estate to shut down. We cannot afford to keep the lights on in hospitals that are continuing to lose money in this country and I think that's going to drive a lot of senses to other lower acuity settings like post-acute care and seniors housing, and medical office buildings which really will become primary sites of care versus the traditional acute care hospital. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Okay, thank you for that. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Morgan from Canaccord. Paul Morgan : Hi, good morning. In terms of -- do you have any update on John Hopkins [ph] and kind of how you expect to really -- coming the first year of that venture to evolve and then maybe -- you know, any update on progress kind of with other systems with similar ventures? Mercedes Kerr : Sure, this is Mercedes Kerr. The conversations that we're having with John Hopkins Center are primarily around two topics; research and collaboration, clinical collaboration and both of those conversations are actually very active and starting more tangibility well with respect to the kinds of projects or specific implementations that we might seek to collaborate on together. So we're working on the research project that we've talked about before having to do with outcomes and quality measures and indicators for seniors housing, as well as a collaboration primarily, and some of the markets that they are expanding into for example, DC. So nothing particular that I can share beyond that today but just I suppose giving you a little bit of comfort around the fact that this is -- lead publications are really going in the right direction and turning more tangible projects for us together. With respect to other health systems, the same is true. Conversations that were a little bit more general or conceptual in the past year let's say are now turning into much more specific tangible opportunities that we are pursuing and we hope to have something to talk about yet this year. Paul Morgan : Thanks. And in some other question you commented about higher loan cost for developers kind of helping the supply picture as you look into '18; are you thinking about capitalizing on the balance sheet that you have as you look forward and maybe kind of reaccelerating senior housing development into that, maybe decelerations looking into '18 and '19? Mercedes Kerr : No. You know, we're not -- we're setting as we go to -- supposed to with respect to development, we see a lot of opportunities, especially from our existing operator, and there are some certain operators that grow more specifically through development, others grow through acquisitions and so I don't see any radical changes with respect to our approach there. Shankh Mitra : It's Shankh, I will just add that if you look at -- you know, if your question is specifically about we filling the void for the construction lending, as you know we're not a lender, we have no ambition to be a lender but we do think that finally the construction cost are going us. As Mercedes said, with LIBOR also on the spread; so that's something very interesting, we observe the cost are going up, recently we heard from a big bang that one of the constructional loans which was priced at LIBOR plus 300, they could not syndicate it. So we're pretty excited about what is -- the industry is going, you know, there probably have been too much development that should not have happened but were they excited where the industry is going and we will find opportunities like we have seen in New York where its core development and we'll continue to pursue those. Paul Morgan : Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Josh Raskin with Barclays. Joshua Raskin : Thanks, good morning. Just trying to sort of put together just couple of the pieces on sort of -- you know, the targeted markets and the discussions you guys have been leading Tom for the last year or so and you know, I understand a lot of the new investment which is relatively modest is with existing partners but when I see cities like [indiscernible] Lancaster, Warsaw, etcetera; I know you're -- to some extent at the mercy of where your partners are expanding but how do you think that just -- how are you guys affecting a more targeted strategy to really build in where you think buy close to [ph] -- you know, premier market as you describe it? Tom DeRosa : So Josh, I would say that our investment strategy is very much built around our operators. These operators are largely concentrated in major market but because they all share a focus on the premium part of the market, there are many smaller markets, you mentioned Rawly [ph], Rawly is a fantastic market, it is a high growth market, it behaves like a major metro market in a state where there -- it is not easy to build because North Carolina is the certificate of need state [ph]. So we are not red lining some of the smaller markets, particularly in the South or even in the Midwest because there are towns, whether it be Michigan or Madison, Wisconsin that behave a lot like the types of major markets that the same drivers in terms of job growth and population growth are seeing in some of these smaller markets. So in summary Josh, I'd say, we're focused about the deploying capital behind the partners. If there are partners that do not have that focus, those are likely the assets that you have seen us sell or will sell in the future. And we will again continue to be laser focused on deploying capital into markets where you see positive demographic factors. Mercedes Kerr : Yes, and the one thing that I would add to that is; some of the conversations that we're having with health systems do center around development. It's not the bulk of it but there will be some element of that and those are conversations that we are driving, and they will potentially in seniors housing as a component. But my point is to say that we are actually on the forefront of being proactive and trying to select our markets and select our partners and so that -- you know, on one hand we're receptive and responsive to our operators and on the other hand we're also trying to help guide the conversation with the data and other relationships that we can bring to bear. Justin Skiver : And one more point I'd like to make Josh, this is Justin Skiver, SVP of Underwriting; is that the distinction between triple net and our ideas important in that a lot of the deals that you're referencing are triple net based structures as opposed to an idea where we would expect a steep higher growth from the portfolio than triple net. Joshua Raskin : Okay, that makes sense as well. And then just a second question, just trying to figure out the calculation on this VPR impacts; you know, just taking an apples-to-apples comps to the others and I understand the shop impact is about 100 basis points, just sort of finger in the air that makes a lot of sense when last in the quarter; but these are the rate impact, it was 180 basis points but the OpEx impact was only 50 basis points; so what drives the difference in leap year impacts on the different parts of the NOI? Shankh Mitra : Josh, it's Shankh. So if you think about expenses, roughly half of the expenses are fixed and half of the expenses are floating, right. So only that portion of the expenses which you have floating labor cost and others are food, that will only be impacted but if you have a fixed expense category, that will not be impacted. On the revenue basis obviously, we're only -- remember, we're only looking at the 29th day of February last year, and if you charge on a per DM basis, you have a revenue. So if you charge on a monthly basis, you have no difference. So it is only impacted some operators that charge on a per DM basis on the revenue side and on the expense side it's only impact the cost of the expense category. Joshua Raskin : That makes a lot of sense. So the OpEx of 50 basis points makes a ton of sense that 50, 56 and floating; but again, I guess I'm just struggling with the rate; if you're charging on a per DM basis, why would rate be as much as 180 basis points, right, because I'm assuming not everyone is even charging on a per DM. Shankh Mitra : Yes, because where do you see the most impact at higher there as to entry market like Boston and New York, that's why the rates are much higher. So when you get that operator in those -- in New England and New York market, where you have one higher extra grade, that impacts the overall report than if you just compare to our overall portfolio, it's not just those markets. For example, I told you -- New York report was 5%. So you have one day of change in New York where you have an operator who charges on a per DM basis you have a much bigger impact. Joshua Raskin : Right, so it's really a mixed issue as well. Shankh Mitra : Yes, it's a market mix issue. Joshua Raskin : Okay, that's perfect. Thanks again, guys. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC. Michael Carroll : Thanks. Tom, can you give us a little bit more color on the plans for future dispositions, is there anything else we should expect that you could sell outside of the $2 billion that's included in guidance? Tom DeRosa : Michael, we are -- we look at our portfolio over the long-term and we're always trying to be in front of where we might see changes in a market that might impact performance. So it's hard to tell you that -- to give you a specific number, we're also opportunistic. If someone is willing to pay us a cap rate on assets that for a variety of reasons maybe very strategic for them but are not so strategic for us, we'll take advantage of that. So I often say both in my personal life and in my business life, real estate is always for sale. So I think you have to be opportunistic and I think over the long-term I think that protects the shareholder. Michael Carroll : Okay. And can you kind of talk about -- I believe on previous calls you highlighted that Genesys [ph] had some purchase options that they could exercise in 2017; should we expect that tenants exercise as purchase options and how you're thinking about that portfolio going forward? Shankh Mitra : Michael, that's a very good question. So as we mentioned Genesys had some purchase options and is that to echo as [indiscernible] from our portfolio that expired on March 31 and we're pretty excited because their purchase options were priced at a certain cap rate and the cap rates on those assets have come down significantly from there when we exercised those when we struck that deal. So what happened because of this Genesys credit as you know has significantly improved in last nine months, so -- and that happened obviously a month ago, we are currently negotiating three term sheets with various buyers, so we're hopeful that you will see further reduction in Genesys concentration as we go to through this year but more to come on that, stay tuned. Michael Carroll : Great. And is there a timing on this term sheets or are those completed yet or is that just kind of still in the negotiation process? Shankh Mitra : It's in the negotiation phase, too early to comment but definitely as I said, stay tuned, there will be more to come on this topic. Michael Carroll : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Good morning. So just wanted to get to the shop portfolio, the 0.9% first quarter same-store NOI growth was underwhelming relative to your nearest REIT peers. I guess what you're saying kind of not to be viewed as a trend maybe for the full year; but looking back at your comments last quarter, you were expecting flattish occupancy and you got a 90 basis point reduction in occupancy this quarter, was that in your expectations? And how much of the performance caused you to think a little bit about tweaking down the guidance for same-store this year? Shankh Mitra : Rich, that's a very good question. So if you think about when we said last year, last call about flattish occupancy, we talked about the entire year, not Q1. So Q1 -- if you think about, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks; Q1 same-store NOI growth for the shop portfolio is actually higher, not lower. So what is the difference? First thing is the revenue growth -- it is underwhelming as you said for sure but if you look at the revenue growth, it's actually higher than most peers I believe. So we've got slightly lower occupancy but we got much better rates, and we are -- we have no desire to decrease same-store idea guidance for the year, we do not change the guidance quarter to quarter on different segments but I think we're trying to tell you we are more excited, not less, about that particular business and as we throw -- think about the entire year. Rich Anderson : Okay, I just wanted to break that up a little bit and see if I can get some more but I appreciate that. And then Tom, maybe you used the disciplined a lot in your opening remarks; can you quantify discipline as it relates to your process in the Duke sale? Tom DeRosa : Well, we were certainly interested in that portfolio; I think everybody was interested in that portfolio, they ran a very competitive process. I don't really know any other details Rich regarding who was in the process but there must have been lots of players to drive the price to where it eventually settled. And I think that's a positive for our industry and this property type. Rich Anderson : Maybe I could ask it this way; I know this is a medical office and just a general focus on lower cost environment is your bread and butter investment approach for the hearing now. Let's call it 47/45 cap rate, I don't know -- we can argue with the numbers but how many -- how does that compare to the value you see and what you're looking at? In other words, if let's just say the numbers four/five -- if you're looking at medical office in -- the conversations you're having, how many basis points is that lower than what your dialogues are starting? Tom DeRosa : We've never seen cap rates at that level. And if cap rates have been at that level, they've been situations that we have not participated in. Mercedes Kerr : Yes, I guess let me add a little bit to that and we've been successful in acquiring at more favorable cap rates, let me put it that way and with respect to this portfolio, I mean I would tell you I think it's -- there were a lot of overlaps with ours and certainly we were very interested both in terms of market concentrations, as well as tenant roaster. It's probably the second best portfolio out there after our portfolios of medical office buildings, and so we were very keenly interested. But there is a point where naturally it needs to make sense to our shareholders and we need to know that it will be accretive. And considering that we have a very successful property management platform which tends to operate at a far higher margin frankly than just an anything we've seen out there comparatively. You know, we thought that we did a good job of underwriting it and then remaining disciplined about it. Tom DeRosa : And I would say that it is -- it's our strategy in the future to build our medical office, outpatient medical business through the relationships that we have formed with the major health systems. So as we keep telling you, stay tuned for that, we don't have anything to announce to you today but the -- those relationships we believe will bear fruit overtime and we'd rather build our asset portfolio in that way than in participating in major marketed auctions, whether that would be in the senior housing space and you know you've not seen us build our senior housing asset base through auctions, we've done it through our relationships and that's what we're trying to duplicate in the outpatient medical business. Rich Anderson : So it's 4.5 -- 100 basis points lower than your radar right now? 50 basis points lower, 75? Tom DeRosa : I'd say there are deals trading at five -- probably 50 basis points higher we've seen. Rich Anderson : Okay, thanks. Mercedes Kerr : That's fair, we haven't seen the 5% reach until now. Tom DeRosa : Yes, we have not, exactly Mercedes. Rich Anderson : Good enough. Thanks very much. Tom DeRosa : Alright, Rich. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you. So just -- Shankh, going back on your comments on IL and AL, I thought it was interesting; you mentioned the performance was a little better in IL but certain metrics was better in the other category. I'm just wondering given all the supply in AL and limited supply in IL, what do you think is driving sort of this difference? And what is that -- what are the implications going forward in terms of your preference for IL versus AL? Shankh Mitra : Vikram, I think that's a great question. As I said, one quarter does not make a trend, I will tell you that not only the occupancy was better in AL but also the revenue growth was better in AL. So do we have -- does that mean that we have a better preference for AL versus IL today? The answer is no. We have preference for best quality real estate in the best market run by best operator, and that wherever we find that opportunity, whether it's IL versus AL, we do not think about that any differently; it depends on that particular asset in the particular sub-market run by the particular operator and we think about a lot of -- sort of supply ways coming. As you know, as marked into [indiscernible] as we have for IL today, and we love independent living as a business, absolutely love it. It is a relatively more cyclical business and we have to think about that as we -- you know, in particular time in the economy which is essentially at full employment, so we do think about that. And the other point I would tell you is, despite all of the talk of the supply, our AL portfolio is in very, very good markets and they are need-based products; so obviously the care component of it, we cannot overemphasize that what's the importance of operators in this business. So we're seeing some -- starting to see some differentiation but it's too early to comment. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, thanks. Then just second question; can you give us some more color and maybe some perspective on the UK; one of your peers has at least decided in part to move away. Just how are your recent developments that have come online? How are they being -- how are they performing and just expectations for future opportunities in that market? Unidentified Company Representative : Hello, it's [indiscernible]. So I mean, we've historically restricted ourselves and our partner relationships to our peers, so we don't have the same structural impediments as you saw HDP notes in the past. And as you know, we've got a full service team there on the ground in London. We've opened up, I think 15 buildings or so in the relatively recent past and occupancy across that portfolio has done really well. So we're quite pleased with the work of our partners at Sunrise Grade 12 [ph]. I've been doing on filling those buildings, we've got a good rate, as well as good occupancy. So we feel further cautiously optimistic about how the market is developing there. Again remember, you see the starting of supplement, buildings on average half the age of the UK, the UK's on an average is 20-years old and talk about not fit for this session, we're bringing online high quality brand new buildings into superior markets. So it's the [indiscernible] have good occupancy and good occupancy growth. So we're happy to put a good quarter together and we're optimistic for the rest of the year. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. And if I can clarify just on pricing in the UK, you talked about in the U.S. being flattish; and any notable changes in the UK? Tom DeRosa : Well, the UK had some structural costs increases as you know. Shankh noted the National Living Wage which has been escalating quite quickly although it has started the temper, and because of that the whole industries had to push pricing up; and that pricing industry-wide has obviously stuck across the industry. We're very luck that we're very highly privately pay focused, so we're in a business to consumer market in some ways rather than some of our peers operations which are receiving large amounts of government reimbursement, on average the private sector has been pushing rate in the UK between sort of 4% to 6% per market rate; and I'd say that's sort of the average for our partners as well in the market. Vikram Malhotra : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Juan Sanabria : Hi good morning. Thanks for the time. Just going back to one of the earlier question on skilled nursing, you said, you've been focused on kind of the newest operator trends which to me kind of talk towards Genesis' focus on the short-term rehab and that clearly seems to be one of the focal points in terms of potential pressures from CMS' new initiative. So, just wondering if that changes your thinking on how you are focused with your remaining post-acute portfolio, are you still committed to being exposed to Genesis in their short-term therapy business over the long-term? Bryan Hickman : This is Bryan Hickman. I guess I'll answer your question in two parts. First, to talk a little bit about our thoughts on the CMS rule that came out. So, for CMS' initial estimates of the impact of the proposed rule to modest with changes in payments to for profits and freestanding facilities of minus 1.1% and minus 0.5%, respectively. So, this is yes at the high single digit cost of Medicare revenue that some are suggesting maybe significantly overstated.  Second, ACA, the skilled nursing industry's lobbying group has been involved in the design of this payment reform package with that several years with input from providers across the industry. So, CMS did not create this proposal in a vacuum. We've been hearing from several of our operators that the proposed rule contains provisions that will help operators deliver care more efficiently. For example the increase in the allowance for utilization of concurrent and group therapy seems like a positive, especially when you consider that in the context of our Genesis PowerBack properties which are highly rehab focused. Finally, the consensus on the pre-rule is that it's long way from implementation and there is going to be commenting on over the next several months of the year. An analogic credit is the revision to the long-term care regulation with CMS implemented in late 2016. Those were originally proposed in early 2015. So, that also has played out over about 18 months and further more operators had ample opportunity to provide commentary directly to CMS regarding that changes. So, we expect to see that play out similarly. As it relates to our PowerBack portfolio, we believe that that is a -- has been a good investment for us and we continued to invest with Genesis. We have a construction start that began with them in the Philadelphia metro market, a PowerBack property and then one that's coming online in on the New Jersey side of their operations this year. Tom DeRosa : So Juan, I think as Bryan stated, we're going to continue to look to invest in the next-generation of post-acute care assets whether that will be with Genesis or maybe there will be some other operators that are bringing this next-generation of post-acute care to the market. It is very clear to us, because of the amount of time we spend with the major academic and superregional health systems that this is an area that is keenly important to them, and so we are working with these health systems to try and refine the infrastructure that post-acute care can be delivered in effectively. It's always going to be a volatile space to be in and we want to make sure that we can continue to invest albeit never going to be a big piece of our business. But invest in a way that we will be getting an adequate return on the capital that we will deploy towards this space. Juan Sanabria : Just one question on the senior housing side, we've heard that Holiday maybe looking to transition some of their independent living assets that are facing more supply -- sorry assisted living assets facing a supply to independent living. Do you think that creates a shadow supply that maybe not disclosed or highlighted in the mix data in the independent living bucket that payers are watching. Are you seeing that trend at all? Mercedes Kerr : No, I have to -- this is -- I'll speculate a little bit, but I'd have to tell you this, this is prime where the exception in the rule there. Frequently conversations is based you know that are responsive to the market for example we might take some units in a building convert them to memory care. If we decide that there is a lot of demand that should be met and that we could get a nice return on that sort of conversion dollars that we invest in a property, things like that are happening frequently. But to have sort of whole clause changes when you are taking a portfolio and converting it from assisted living to independent is not a common -- I have not seen that happening in any widespread way at all. And we don't expect for it to happen. Juan Sanabria : Thanks Mercedes. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Good morning everyone. I just have a quick question about senior housing. I think in general there is this sense out there that things will get better soon based on slower delivery later on in the year or everyone taking a look at some of mix of that. But if you do look at mix forecast, you know they do still call for decline in occupancy and tough kind of NOI outlook all the way up until 2018. So, I guess how do you kind of reconcile some of this kind of optimism that things turn around very soon versus saying it could still be another 18 months of tough outlook Shankh Mitra : Tayo, it's Shankh. Your definition of soon may not exactly match with our definition of soon you talked about. We talked about you know emphasize on medium to long-term, that's questions number one. But I will give you some numbers where I want you to focus on -- focus on not the whole industry, but our portfolio. So, if you go back and calculate quarter-after-quarter, we give you a three-mile, five-mile sort of radius and how it impacts our portfolio right? Let's just talk about a broader picture 5-mile. In Q3 of 2015, our total NOI that was impacted by supply was $83 million. That was the total. It peaked in Q2 of 2016 at about $90 million and today that is $73 million. So, I'm talking about just our portfolio. You saw a spike up and now it's coming down. So, you know we can sit here and talk about the NIC data and how that all relates to the whole industry. Obviously, you know we share enthusiasm for our sector, but we are particularly talking about how our portfolio which we think will do better. Tim Lordan : Tayo, this is Tim Lordan. The only thing I would add to that is, one of the reasons we're optimistic about the balance of the year is, you know the rate growth in our portfolio, the rate of rate growth continues to exceed what we see in the NIC data and that rate growth has been there consistently. That's not something that's new for us this quarter. So, that continued rate growth combined with what Shankh mentioned earlier slightly deceleration in the rate of increase of labor driving our optimism. Tayo Okusanya : That's helpful. And then this quarter it didn't seem like you announced any new relationships with some of your investments that you've done. I was just kind of curious if that deliberate in regards, you have been much more selective in regards to who are partnering up with, but that's more of a cast of -- you just see a lot of opportunities with your existing relationships. Tom DeRosa : Well you know we have 17 RIDEA operators in our portfolio. You know you hear us use this term the Welltower family of operators. You know Tayo, I think we have a pretty strong bench. There will be on the margin, you saw us add a new operator to that group last year. I think there maybe a few left, but we are focused on putting capital behind this very skilled group of operators that have dominant positions in the markets that are important to us. So, I wouldn't see us -- I would doubt that you will see us 25 operators next year. Shankh Mitra : And I thought we have always been very selective. So, we're not -- you know particularly selective now. We have always been selective and that's not changed. Tayo Okusanya : Got you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel Nicolaus. Chad Vanacore : So, I was thinking about same-store shop NOI performance and we've talked about revenue and occupancy. But what were some of the issues that lead to higher OpEx in the quarter and what happened in Iowa in particular? Shankh Mitra : So, Chad I think you have two question, one is not -- quarter OpEx was actually pretty favorable. It's pretty inline to what we expected. So, I'm not sure you know what are you thinking behind that question. It's pretty inline what would be expected is the same issues we have faced. Labor remains and issue, however we expect as we said, we're seeing it moderating and U.K. has an impact as John Goodey talked about. So that sort of one thing. I yelled, there was no specific, we saw a favorable revenue trend in AL versus IAL, but we saw a favorable expense trend in IAL versus AL and that's what drove the NOI difference in those two property types. Chad Vanacore : Just thinking about the midpoint of same store NOI guidance for the year, you did 2.2% of first quarter, so mid-point figure 2.5%. That would imply some improvement through the year. So, what segments would be the primary driver of that improvement if you hit it? Tom DeRosa : Shop. Chad Vanacore : It's all on shop. Shankh Mitra : You will see improvement in shop as we sort of discussed here. Chad Vanacore : Alright, is there anything that could really move on the needle on the outpatient medical portion? Shankh Mitra : Outpatient medical has been relatively very steady performer. It continues to produce a very favorable and predicable growth for us. I mean quarter-to-quarter things change, but we don't see massive change in that portfolio. Scott Estes : Yeah, that's around 95% occupancy and 80% retention is a good forecast. So, we're pretty much maxing out our portfolio occupancy as we have for some time in that part of the business. Chad Vanacore : Alright, thanks Scott, and I will hop back in the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the MOB portfolio trade this week. So, the one thing that seems to have surprised everybody was the price at which it traded. You guys and as well as your peers. But as the same time you know I guess Tom, as you were wrapping up your remark, you mentioned to stay tuned. So, I'm just curious, do you expect more sellers to basically put assets on the market is a result of this pricing or you know how should we be reading into that. I think there's just been an acceleration or pick-up in the number of players looking to buy MOB assets and then that was demonstrated in this price, and I'm just curious, what brings the supply to bear? Tom DeRosa : So, Jordan, if you are buyer that needs to find assets in auctions, this was the action of all auctions in the MOB space, because we don't know of another portfolio of that size diversity that is available. It's hard -- it's not on our radar screen. When I said stay tuned Jordan, it goes back to a point that I made on another question. We will build our medical office portfolio organically, which means that we're not sitting waiting for some big portfolio trade, not to say if one comes out, we won't be hanging around the hoop. But I will tell you that, we believe that the major health systems that we have aligned ourselves with across our business. We realize they cannot own all of their real estate for the long-term. You heard me talk about that 82% of this real estate is still owned by these health systems. They have significant capital needs for example in technology that will allow them to remain competitive. If they don't invest in technology and continue to sit there and think they need to own all of their real estate, they will become less and less relevant. So, we believe that we will mine medical office investments and development opportunities through the same way we've done it in the senior housing space, by picking our partners and being a trusted partner. I moderated a panel last month at a research conference, where I brought not only Chris Winkle from Sunrise assisted living, but also Mark Shaver who is head of Strategy for the Johns Hopkins health system. And actually Mark looked at the audience and said, I have to tell you, we own too much real estate and you know you haven't seen -- you probably haven't heard, someone at that level publicly state that. And basically said, and like you will see Tom owning some of our real estate at some point in the future. I think that's the way we're going to grow this business and it's important that their medical office footprint is going to be connected to our senior housing in post-acute care portfolio. That's the future of this company, that's why I am so excited about our business. I think this is one of the biggest opportunities that the real estate industry has seen in decades. So, that's why I say stay tuned. I don't have anything to announce to you. Jordan Sadler : Okay. That's helpful. How do you gauge? You guys mentioned, I don't know if you are seeing fictitious but you know the portfolio that traded was the second highest quality portfolio next to yours. How do you gauge portfolio quality? Mercedes Kerr : By age, by occupancy, by operating margin, by retention by the tenant rosters, so on just about every mark that you might be thinking about when you consider outpatient medical portfolio we outrank. Jordan Sadler : On campus versus off, does that\u2026 Mercedes Kerr : We talk about affiliations too. Be careful with that, it's affiliated or not affiliated, you should care about and our portfolio is 95% affiliated with health systems. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Michael Knott : Hey guys it's been a long call. But I wanted to ask one question in particular. On your senior housing business, your full year guidance is 1.5% NOI which is comparable to the 0.9% for 1Q. So, you've talked about it a little bit on this call on different questions, but just can you help me better understand the comment that you are more excited not less, as you think about that particular guidance range as it relates to what you reported for 1Q? Shankh Mitra : Michael, its Shankh. So, as you know we do not update our guidance on a quarterly basis for different segments of the business, but you heard me right, that 0.9% which we reported as the growth is comparable to 1.5% to 3%. So, Tim, I think cleared that and we are more excited about that segment of the business because of the first quarter beat that we had relative to our expectations. And it's driven by Tim Lordan said, it's driven by what we see in the rate trend as well as the expense trends. Michael Knott : Okay, and then what do you make of the country breakout just to go little deeper into, the slightly negative print for U.S. excluding leap year or 1% leap year adjusted you know as I think somebody else said earlier was a little underwhelming. So, just curious how you thought about that part of it I assume that part too was also largely in line with your expectations. Shankh Mitra : It was, if you think about on a country basis, it was largely in line with our expectations and we expect U.S. to perform as we look through rest of the year. Again, I would recommend to you one thing obviously we're excited about our U.S. portfolio, we think that performance will get better, but as we want you to think about our whole portfolio, not just parts of the portfolio because different parts of our portfolio came together purely because our strategic allocation, capital allocation decision is right. So different points in the cycle, you will see different countries will react differently. IL and AL will react differently, but that's how we think about our capital allocation as a portfolio rather than one particular product type or one particular country. Michael Knott : Sure. But then just overall, it relates to the 1.5% to 3%, it sounds like it's mostly on the rate side to drive that sort of the three quarter of the rest of the year from 0.9% up to the 1.5% to 3%. Shankh Mitra : That's right Michael. Michael Knott : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, we have no further questions. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for dialing in to the Welltower earnings conference call. We do appreciate your participation and ask that you please disconnect.",

My name is Dorothy, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President, Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, sir. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Dorothy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower's second quarter 2017 results. Following my brief introduction, you will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Mercedes Kerr, EVP, Business and Relationship Management; Shankh Mitra, SVP, Finance and Investments; and Scott Estes, CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurances as projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning's press release and from time to time in the Company's filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release this morning, you may access it via the Company's website at welltower.com. Before handing the call over to Tom DeRosa, I wanted to point out four highlights regarding our 2Q 2017 results. First, we reported 3.5% year-over-year same-store growth in our seniors housing operating portfolio, driving total portfolio same-store growth of 3% for the quarter. Second, we increased full year total portfolio same-store guidance to a range of 2.25% to 3% lifted by first half seniors housing operating performance at the high end of our additional expectations. Third, we paid down a $182 million of debt in the quarter, bringing year-to-date retired debt and preferred securities to $1.275 billion at a bundled rate of 5.6% and a cost of less than 3% of principal. Finally, as a result of this stable core operating performance and efficient balance sheet management, we finished the quarter with debt to adjusted EBITDA up 5.17 times. And with that, I will hand the call over to Tom for further remarks on our quarter. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Tim, and good morning. We are pleased with our operating results for the second quarter, as well as the success of our efforts to further improve our balance sheet and drive operating efficiencies across the Welltower platform. The strong year-to-date performance of our seniors housing business, which has resulted from strong rate growth, focused asset management and a rebound in our UK business gives us the confidence to announce the increase in our same-store NOI guidance for the year to 2.25% to 3%. We are broadcasting to you this morning from Welltower's offices in Beverly Hills, California. When you walk the streets here and see scores of four Lee signs, over the windows of high-end shop space, you cannot help, but be reminded of the disruptive impacted ecommerce has had on traditional retail real estate. There are clearly disrupted forces at play in healthcare as well, but, Welltower's real estate portfolio stands to benefit from this disruption. As healthcare delivery moves from a high cost acute care hospital centric model to smaller, more efficient disease management sites of care connected to ambulatory, post-acute, seniors housing, memory care and home. Our current real estate assets become even more consequential and valuable. Further, this phenomenon calls for a new class of real estate to be developed. Welltower has uniquely positioned itself at the table with the leading providers, payers, distributors, data and technology companies that are transforming healthcare, so that we can deliver a next-generation class of real estate. This potentially represents the largest capital deployment opportunity we have seen in decades. I'll come back with some closing remarks, but it is now my pleasure to hand the mic over to my colleague, Mercedes Kerr. Mercedes Kerr : Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The Welltower team completed $292 million of investments in the second quarter of 2017, as we remain disciplined in our approach to the market. This amount consisted of a $110 million of acquisitions at a blended yield of 6.5%. A $163 million [ph] of development funding with projected yields of 7.8%, and $20 million in loans with a blended rate of 6.6%. Our investments continue to be made with existing operators such as Legend Senior Living, Sagora Senior Living and Ascension Health. But we were also pleased to welcome a new partner to the Welltower's family, the University of California Irvine Health through the acquisition of an outpatient medical office building less than a mile from the highly regarded Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, California. This acquisition advances our stated strategy to increase our participation with the Academic Medical Center Community. In addition, we put 10 high quality development properties into service during the quarter, representing total invested capital of $273 million and a blended stabilized yield of 7.6%. These properties operated by well-known Welltower partners such as Sunrise Senior Living, Brandywine Living and Kisco, will enhance our operating results for years to come. We remain committed to working with our partners to fund development and acquire best in-class properties on a more off-market basis across our countries of operation. This relationship focus strategy delivers its highest value during market periods like the one we are currently experiencing were widely auction portfolios generally don't seem to offer a shareholder's acceptable rates of return. We completed $160 million of dispositions in the quarter. This activity consisted of $43 million of loan payoff at an average yield of 8.9%. And a $117 million portfolio sale of 11 skilled nursing facilities with a yield of 9.3% and unlevered IRR of 11.4% and a gain of $42 million. To provide some context for our investment decision making process and how we behave across cycles, I would like to share a glimpse into our multi-disciplined eight-member investment committee and how it works. When we scrutinize underwriting results, we focus as much ongoing in-cash yield as we do on the long-term growth potential of an investment opportunity and the CapEx required to sustain that cash flow growth. This results in a total return or unlevered IRR driven investment process. As we review new investments and dispositions, the committee also focuses on diversification of operators, asset type and geography, which we believe enhances the stability of our portfolio returns. The rating agency seem to agree as evidenced by our recent upgrades after the reduction of our concentration in certain operators. Our often-used RIDEA structure gives us opportunity to optimize operating performance more directly. You have heard us speak about our initiatives around this before. We have invested in the people, systems and infrastructure to actively manage our RIDEA portfolio and we have Welltower boots on the ground, enhancing our shareholders' interest in the markets where we have strong concentration such as London, Toronto and Beverly Hills. Our market leadership position ensures we see the vast majority of what is marketed and we consider each opportunity carefully, relative to our cost of capital and standard real estate metrics such as replacement cost. In periods, where we don't see a positive balance between the market's pricing of risk and return, we may report modest - at least when measured Welltower's own history. We may also monetize selected investments opportunistically during these periods to crystallize value for our shareholders. And importantly, we always seek to drive value from our existing portfolio. We feel confident that our approach and discipline through these cycles will prove to be the correct strategy to drive the period shareholder value in an enduring way. Our off-market investment pipeline for the balance of the year is promising and we will fit in - we'll fit the criteria that I have described. We look forward to sharing our news of progress. I will now turn the call over to Shankh Mitra for a discussion on portfolio performance. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Mercedes, and good morning, everyone. I will now review our quarterly operating results with an emphasis on our outpatient medical and seniors housing business. We're pleased with our operating results and increasing our - for the overall portfolio to 2.25% to 3%, which we believe is appropriate given the strength of our shop portfolio. I'll remind you, we do not - our outlook on segment level NOI growth through the year, but we are tracking towards the top of our original 1.5% to 3% guidance for the shop portfolio. Our overall same store NOI increased 3% for the year. Our Triple-Net portfolio continued its reliable performance. Our seniors housing Triple-Net segment grew 3% and long-term secured portfolio grew 3.1%. Our outpatient medical portfolio reported 1.6% NOI growth in Q2, which was below our expectations. New leasing is ahead of our expectation for the year, but we had some later than expected rent commencement due to delays and tenants fit outs and few move-outs in the quarter that are shifting economics to later quarters. Despite this quarter's performance, our expectation for the outpatient medical segment remains unchanged for the year. We remain confident in our team's ability to execute and expect growth to bounce back in the second half. Our seniors housing operating portfolio is the highlight of this quarter with meaningful outperformance relative to our budget. Occupancy trends were lower than expected. However, those were significantly offset by our pricing power, which resulted in strong rate growth, 3.9% year-over-year and better expense trends 1.7% a year. Our operating partners are constantly optimizing rate, occupancy question to maximize revenue at this point in the cycle. We're very proud that they have achieved this growth, while keeping expenses in check. While labor cost remains elevated. They continue to moderate from the highs as our partner strike the right balance between excellent care delivery and efficient staffing model. Our group purchasing power and other cost initiative being realized through expense savings in food, professional services, insurance, utilities and incentive management fees. Geographically, the U.S. and Canada were neck-and-neck from a performance perspective contributing solid growth, 2.6% and 2.8% respectively with UK being the clear winner as we continue to benefit from our UK team significant asset management effort in last 18 months. We continue to - UK outperformance for quarters to come. Overall, growth was driven by our core markets which bounce back as we hoped and discussed last call. So Cal, No Cal Toronto, London, Seattle were significant drivers. Following up on our conversation from last call, the New York MSA has started to demonstrate beta results, but New England continues to be challenging though it is improving. With respect to different product types, we have observed significant outperformance of both revenue and NOI in assisted living versus independent living this quarter. Much has been written about the supply stats in AL versus IL which is appropriate and relevant, but as long-term owners of class A real estate we have observed greatest thickness of demand in AL versus IL, when new competition opens around a given asset. We would also like to point out the recent absorption metrics for both product types as reported by NIC. For Map 31 and Map 99 respectively, absorption for AL was 4.3% and 4.2% for the quarter and 2% and 1.9% for IL for the quarter. These absorption numbers are more than 2X of current 85 population growth signifying a greater acceptance of this need based product and validating the value proposition that community based care provides to our resident versus the alternatives or receiving care at home. This above population demand growth indicates the true long-term growth potential of our asset class as that growth in acceptance of the asset class augments the acceleration of 85 population growth in the decades ahead. Overall, we are very pleased with our operating performance of our portfolio. We allocate capital across geographies product types and operating partners, so that you as our shareholders can enjoy sector leading inflation plus growth through the cycle. We believe our results so far this year is proving out that strategy. With that, I'll pass it over to Scott Estes, our CFO. Scott? Scott Estes : Great, thanks Shankh and good morning, everyone. From a financial perspective, I think the highlight of the first half of the year has been our ability to maintain our capital allocation discipline. Most importantly, it's allowed us to take advantage of the current market dynamics to both sell assets and raise equity optimistically to further enhance our balance sheet. As a result, we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on high quality investment opportunities as soon as they become available in the future. I'll start my comments today by emphasizing three financial highlights from the second quarter. First, our strong total portfolio same-store NOI growth is 3% and $292 million in growth investments allowed us to report a solid normalized FFO result of $1.6 per share. Second, we utilized disposition proceeds in the equity capital raise to further strengthen our credit metrics and reduce our un-depreciated book leverage at 35% at quarter ends. And third, we ended June with over $3 billion in liquidity providing considerable financial flexibility as we move into the latter half of the year. By more detailed remarks, we'll begin with some perspective on our segment financial results and dividends. As second quarter, financial results did exceed our expectations, generating normalized FFO of $1.6 per share versus $1.15 per share last year. A year-over-year earnings were supported by our solid same-store cash NOI growth and $2.8 billion of growth investments completed over the last 12 months, but declined as expected due to the $3.7 billion of dispositions completed over the same period. Importantly, these dispositions in equity raise allowed us to significantly lower our leverage by over 4 full percentage points over the last 12 months. Our G&A came in at $32.6 million for the second quarter. This represents a significant 18% year-over-year reduction from $39.9 million in Q2 2016, as we continue to enhance our operational efficiency. Based on our strong first half of the year, our G&A forecast is now tracking closer to the $130 million to $132 million range for the full year versus our initial guidance of $135 million. We recognized significant gains on asset sales of $42.2 million during the quarter. This was partially offset by $13.6 million in impairments on several seniors housing properties currently held for sale and some minor charges related to secured debt extinguishment and loss on derivatives during the quarter. And in terms of dividends, we will pay our 85th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on August 21st of $0.87 per share, representing a current dividend yield of 4.8%. Turning now to our picture on balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $160 million in proceeds from dispositions through $117 million of property sales and $43 million in loan payouts, which included an additional $28 million of Genesis loan repayments. In terms of equity, we generated over $190 million in net proceeds under our ATM program during the quarter. We did use the majority of our net proceeds to reduce our line of credit borrowings by $137 million and to extinguish $182 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 4.4% during the quarter, while we issued or assumed $172 million of secured debt at a blended rate of 3.1%. So, as a result, we sit today with over $3 billion in current liquidity based on $2.6 billion of credit line availability and $442 million in cash on balance sheet. Our balance sheet continued to strengthen during the second quarter. As of June 30th, our net debt to undepreciated book capitalization declined another 80 basis points on a sequential basis to 35%, while net debt to enterprise value declined 160 basis points to 27.2%. As Tim said, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.7 times, while our adjusted interest in fixed charge coverage for the quarter increased to 4.5 times and 3.7 times respectively. Our secured debt declined by 10 basis points to 9.5% of total assets at quarter end. That conclude my comments today with a brief update on the key assumptions driving our 2017 guidance. I think in short there are relatively few changes this quarter, in terms of same-store NOI growth, as team said based on the solid performance across the portfolio that really highlighted by the seniors housing operating portfolio in particular, and increasing our blended growth forecast 2.25% to 3% from the previous 2% to 3% range for the full year. And consistent with our normal practice there are no acquisitions other than those completed during the first half of the year and our 2017 guidance. Our guidance does include an additional $173 million of development funding on projects that are currently underway and an additional $143 million in development conversions at blended projected stabilized yield of 8.8%. In terms of our full year disposition forecast, we continue to anticipate a total of $2 billion of disposition proceeds at a blended yield of 7.6% based on $1.3 billion completed year-to-date and $700 million of incremental proceeds through the remainder of the year. And finally, as a result of these assumptions, we're maintaining our normalized FFO guidance of $4.15 to $4.25 per diluted share. So, in conclusion, I think we're in an excellent capital position with an even stronger balance sheet in over $3 billion of current liquidity providing us the significant financial flexibility to execute upon our plans as we move into the second half of the year. So, at this point, Tom, I'll flip it back to you for your closing comment. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Scott. Since the start of our call, the sun has now come up on the West Coast and we can see outside our windows which are just one block from Boyega [ph] drive, many of those empty Beverly Hills Street retail store fronts, I mentioned at the top of the call. So, like you, we wonder about the future demand for this premium retail space. Our street retail space here on Bedford and Brighton Way formerly leased to traditional clothing and jewelry retailers is about to be occupied by a next-generation pharmacy within fusion therapy capabilities and a surgery center walking clinic for one of California's largest academic medical centers. This major health system realized, they need to have a more consumer-friendly retail facing ambulatory care strategy. They chose Beverly Hills and they chose to be at the Welltower. Yes, the four buildings we own in Beverly Hills are branded Welltower. And people here talk about seeing their doctors at the Welltower. In one of the world's most sought-after retail destinations, the new anchor is Welltower. This is an important indicator of where healthcare delivery is headed, and we cannot be more excited about the opportunities before us. So, now Dorothy, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Michael Mueller : Quick question on development, it looks like you have about $1.6 billion of unstabilized developments and out of curiosity, how long is the average property staying in that bucket and are there any changes in terms of the trends staying in there longer or shorter period of time? Mercedes Kerr : Traditionally, our development projects might take roughly 18 months to complete and we traditionally also expect anywhere between 18 and 24 months for lease up and I'm talking now about seniors housing, as you probably know in outpatient medical when we develop property, we find large, they are 75% or more pre-leased before we even commence construction. So, I hope that gives you some rough estimates of how we see our fill up and so on. Michael Mueller : Okay, but nothing is really changing or it's taking longer or shorter period of time, it's fairly - is that right? Mercedes Kerr : No, nothing has changed in those kind of - those are very standard assumptions I think to prove out consistently. Michael Mueller : Got it, Okay. And one other question in terms of shop same-store occupancy ended the quarter at about 89.5%, can you talk a little bit about where you see that going through the balance of the year and even into 2018, if you could? Shankh Mitra : So, without being too specific, Michael. As you know there is a seasonality in the business, right. So, if it's purely thinking sequentially we would expect some occupancy improvement through the year, as I mentioned before that occupancy trends have been lowered than what we expected. And to be honest with you, we're not trying to optimize or maximize occupancy, we're trying to maximize revenue. So, we will see as you sort of think about the revenue maximization, we'll see what market gives us, but we're constantly playing occupancy versus rate game and we will see what market gives us. But definitely, you will see sequentially as you see in the business slight improvement sequentially through the end of the year. Michael Mueller : Okay. That was it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. I guess just wanted to talk, I know you guys have been very active with overseas partners and investors and the Chinese in particular and I'm just wondering if you've seen any change in terms of their appetite given all of the - I guess rhetoric that's come out of the country about deploying capital overseas? Shankh Mitra : That's a great question, Steve. If you think about from the two or three categories of overseas investors, we have seen a material increase in the larger companies or larger insurance companies with a very large balance sheets in overseas operations, including the sovereign wealth funds, very, very active. I have never seen this active before, but if you look at sort of the smaller insurance companies and asset managers, their capital control might have some effect on the private equity with most of the money is in Hong Kong, there has been no change not an increase or decrease that capital seems to be pretty steady and interesting in U.S. healthcare assets. Steve Sakwa : Okay, thanks. And then, I guess maybe a question for Scott just on sort of the issuing of equity. Obviously, the balance sheet was in great shape before your tap the ATM. How are you guys thinking of the usage of the ATM raising equity capital at these levels and what is the kind of primary drivers that make sure it's FFO accretive, NAV accretive I mean how do you guys think about that and what should we think about going forward? Scott Estes : Sure. I think NAV accretion is a good benchmark but you think about it, we were just opportunistic really. If you think about it, we did complete about $300 million of gross investments this quarter. We have a pretty active development pipeline, we have about $540 million in projects underway and there are some more coming. So again, I think in small amounts if it's NAV accretive that's how we've chosen to deploy the ATM. Steve Sakwa : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel Nicolaus. Chad Vanacore : Hey, good morning, all of you. So, just thinking about the seniors housing occupancy trends, which have been getting lower. Are you seeing anything that indicate the change in the trend of rising any acceleration or deceleration? Shankh Mitra : No, Chad as I said that sequentially we would expect the improvement, but year-over-year, I think you will still see a decrease obviously I'm talking about U.S. We're seeing significant improvement in occupancy in UK. So, we're trying to maximize revenue, not occupancy. I cannot emphasize on that enough that how we are thinking about this. Tom DeRosa : Yeah, Chad from a leading indicator standpoint, I think you'll have to look at capital availability for construction in seniors housing. The supply you're seeing today has a lot to do with capital availability that started back in late 2013, 2014, 2015, that has driven the supply that's really coming on - that started coming on the market last year. Anecdotally, we've been told that capital availability for new construction in seniors housing is back to 2009 levels, which means that's minimal, So, if you think about that with the aging curve, the 85 plus cohort starting to accelerate in just about 2.5 years from now, you would have expected that the supply of capital would be today to meet that demand, so - but that's not the case. So, we think actually there'll be - there potentially is a supply demand imbalance when the - really when the demographics when start really propelling our business. Chad Vanacore : All right, so capital availability getting tighter - and absorption is pretty in the street. Tom DeRosa : We're pretty encouraged. Yeah, I would say that it's very market specific. We keep harping on the fact that we have and I'll use Mercedes word, curated our portfolio. It's concentrated in high barrier to entry. More resilient regions of the U.S., Canada and the UK and that is what is behind our performance. There you can't paint the U.S. or any of the other markets with one brush. So, we are now - we also had said, we were seeing spikes in labor costs in the major markets earlier than you were seeing in smaller secondary market. So, in a way - we always believed we were seeing the spikes last year and to early this year. Now we started to see that moderate. It's hard to predict that. But I think the major markets that Welltower is focused in are behaved differently and it's what's driving our performance. Chad Vanacore : All right, so now I'm going to ask a granular question that hopefully either you or Mercedes can answer, which is if you're talking about the MSA that are you are in. Are you seeing any difference in what NIC map is recording in those MSAs and then your performance in those MSAs? Shankh Mitra : Chad, if you don't mind me answering that question, we definitely - as you know that we have very significant concentration in great submarkets. So, when you think about NIC map, you think mostly MSA. We do not think about business in MSA terms. We think about our business in submarket terms, even more granular than that. And we are in a very wealthy location in the markets, so obviously their reports are significantly higher than average MSA. So, we're seeing outperformance, but I would not just attribute that to very difference of - sort of MSA position like it's just a submarket and wealth locations driving that, but we're definitely seeing very significant demand growth and many, many locations that I mentioned So Cal, No Cal, Seattle and everything else. From another - there are one place that we are not seeing that. I think I had mentioned that is New England is under - there is some supply in New England, so their MSA is under pressure, we're seeing that too and New York MSA the same thing. New York MSA is starting to bounce back in our portfolio. We are hoping to see that New England follow very soon. Chad Vanacore : All right, thanks for taking the questions. Shankh Mitra : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thank you. Shankh, just following up on the RIDEA side. Would you be able to give us what the change in occupancy was across regions? Shankh Mitra : Yes, if you look at, we usually don't do that, but I want you to think about a business as a diversified portfolio where we allocate capital, not just U.S. or UK or Canada. Our focused on one particular country because it's doing well and also doing well. But just throughout, for this I'll give you the numbers, the occupancy in U.S. is down 180 basis points just 1/4, Canada is down 120 basis points and UK, 180 basis points. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. And just sticking to an RIDEA, you obviously - you had great cost control, can you maybe just elaborate a bit on that and like what for the exact drivers that I saw on the other bucket that was down about 6%, could you just give us some color for what that was? Shankh Mitra : Yes, so I think I try to mention that in my prepared remarks, if that bucket, if you look at consist of A, first is we saw a very significant cost control success in raw foods and utilities by moving to the other buckets, we are seeing some very significant improvement in worker's comp, insurance, marketing, professional services and also our internal management fees. So, we have seen that pretty much across the board. We now enjoyed the fruits of our efforts for group purchasing and others that we have been talking about for years to come. And very significant and focus asset management efforts in this area. So, across the board there is not one-line item that I can talk about, that is driving that but we're seeing it across the board. Tom DeRosa : No, go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : No, I was just going to say no, it's actually very strong performance across the board. So, congrats on that. Tom DeRosa : Vik, this is a business that really requires the real estate partner to be very hands on. And I know Mercedes mentioned this in her remarks. I mean we have over a number of years made significant investments on the asset management side here. Our UK turnaround has a lot to do with the people that work in our UK office. We have 10 people in London, they are very hands on. There were a number of management challenges that were negatively affecting performance of our UK portfolio. Those issues would not have been address had Welltower's team really been on the ground there. And making sure that the right initiatives were being implemented, so we can turn that performance around and that is the same - that's the same story across Canada and the U.S. This is a rollup the sleeves real estate business. And we feel that because of that investment we've made we take some level of risk out of this business. Mercedes Kerr : Tom, I want to include that operators I think overtime at some of these initiatives I was trying to play through have really grown more and more comfortable with our ability to collaborate in some of these projects that Tom was describing. And so, it's an evolution that we feel very comfortable about and I just want to make sure that I mentioned that our operating partners naturally are an important component of it. Vikram Malhotra : So, that make sense. And Tom, I have to ask you since you talked about Beverly Hills and Welltower, when you changed the name of the company, did you think people would be going to the Welltower store. Tom DeRosa : Of course, they would - they would think about it, but it's very interesting here. At some point, we'll bring some analysts to see what we have here. What we are doing is in a sense creating a wellness district through the real estate that we are own here in Beverly Hills. And now the retail, which again if you came here, five years ago, you would have seen typical retail in medical office buildings. What's happening is we are starting to drive a new class of retail here. And your people even on the - I think in the mall and shopping center, sectors have been talking about how they want to drive healthcare to the traditional mall or street or strip center, we're actually doing it here. And I think the fact is, I was very surprised how quickly people have grabbed on to the Welltower name, but it's interesting again looking at our windows, I see Neiman Marcus in Fifth Avenue on top of buildings and across the street our four buildings that say Welltower, so people are starting to recognize this name and what we hope it stands for is quality real estate that if you are in healthcare, if you're a healthcare - being in a building it says Welltower stands for quality and stability. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. Thanks guys. Tom DeRosa : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Omotayo Okusanya : Good morning. First of all, congrats on the really solid quarter, it's good to see. I have two questions. First of all, the shop portfolio, could you talk specifically about the outperformance in the UK like what are markets kind of fundamentals doing in UK that making it kind of have this consistent outperformance versus the other market? John Goodey : Yeah, hi there. It's John Goodey from the International team. So, it's a good question. Morning. The market dynamics are relatively benign right now is the only stance or so, we have a in UK a rough balance between supply and demand in the sector that we care about which is the first in business class and equivalent of the industry. The big difference I think is the partnership as Mercedes said, we have with our operating partner Sunrise that run the Sunrise and Gracewell branded buildings there. So, we've been working diligently with them for the last 18 months. so on how to maximize the performance of those buildings in the complex of the markets and Shankh used the time neighborhood, this is neighborhood relative business. And it's been just real diligence hard work, hard work on cost, hard work on positioning those buildings on the revenue side as well and seeking to maximize the overall revenue from the buildings not just occupancy or rate growth. So, because of the superior locations and you'll see it in some of our supplemental disclosure, our ability to drive the revenue per occupied room in those buildings has been international this year, it was good last year, it's been very good this year and that's just aligned with overall occupancy growth of nearly 2 percentage points across the portfolio. So, it's just the hard work element seem to be becoming together now and it's just driving performance and it's durable, it's not water change at least not for now until the basis of performance changes, we feel good about H2 as well. Omotayo Okusanya : Okay. But how do you end up measuring kind of incoming supply versus in the competitive kind of property side versus your assets? John Goodey : Yeah, so unfortunately, we don't have a NIC database in the UK, but as you can imagine we have our A's to the ground on performance all across the portfolio of - that is also around what our competitors are doing and what's coming on and there are local clusters where there is strong supply growth, because there's strong demand growth as well. So, we have - Welltower is not operating in a vacuum. We people doing what we do in the UK. I think we do it best, but we are imbalanced in many of the markets and what we are seeking to do and I think I said this before we own a small fraction of the facilities back in the UK but a very high fraction of the quality that Welltower likes. So, what we're doing is selective info acquisitions small time, but also acquire a lot of construction and that takes hard work like we did in Manhattan another high wealth areas this is where the operator relationships in the Welltower capabilities come together to build buildings in areas of London, for example they're really hard to access, they take multiple years just to find a site and then to construct. So, that's the competitive advantages is finding these high barriers to entry markets with real resilience to entry as well and then working hard to plant the Welltower flag there. Shankh Mitra : And I'll just add one more point to that, if you think about our UK business is primarily London focused. London is probably the toughest market to build that we operate in maybe other than the West side of LA. So, it's significantly harder to build in London than in New York MSA for example, so you're seeing the UK, I don't want you to think just as UK results. This is more greater London centric results. Omotayo Okusanya : Got you. That's helpful. And one more from me Shankh, MOB portfolio - you did talk about a turn around and performance in the back half of 2017, what specifically are you looking as that are you looking at that's going to end up resulting on acceleration in same-store NOI growth for the MOB portfolio? Shankh Mitra : Yes, I mean as I said if you think about the quarter, obviously we're not so pleased with 1.6% NOI growth. But it's just a question of timing. If you think about every quarter is a snapshot of 90 days. Right we as long-time owner real estate, we don't run our business for 90 days increment. So least thing, as I said has been pretty strong and running ahead of our expectation. But there has been couple of unexpected move-outs as well as it's taking longer for tenant [ph] and other things. For this, tenant to come into the space and commence it. So, it's just a question of timing, you will see the economics have shifted from quarter-to-quarter. We don't really focus too much on that, but given from here you would see the acceleration, of course. Scott Estes : Yes, Tayo, the MOB portfolio has been unbelievably consistent for years and years and years. The occupancy has been 94.5% to 95% and we very consistently generated the 2% to 2.5% growth. So, that's what we continue to expect in short-term here. Omotayo Okusanya : Got you. Thank you very much. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Tayo. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital. John Kim : Thanks, Tom. I think with your balance sheets, the strong has it's been for a while in getting strong in the near-term. I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you're seeing in terms of investment opportunities as far as the investment type and the timing. Mercedes Kerr : So, we have been working for some time. I think I mentioned earlier that we are reticent to participate in widely auctioned sort of processes where there seems to be some exuberance and little bit of a flossy market, not enough growth for what we think our shareholders deserve. And so, what we have been working on instead is this off-market more proprietary type of a pipeline. We are actually very encouraged by what we see. Some of that we will take a longer to materialize because the relationships for example with top health system are ones that we are building from scratch and but we have some real momentum in that case. And then there is what we sometimes have referred to as our shadow pipeline, the ongoing business that we get from our own existing operating platform from our partners, which is very consistent again largely off-market. So that we're not knocking ourselves up, trying to compete in the market with others and so. There is a very solid pipeline ahead. It is - in some cases, I think we'll be able to talk about it this year and in some cases, these are through opportunities like the ones that Tom was describing in the disruption of healthcare real estate that may take just a little longer to materialize that will be significant. John Kim : Mercedes, you've mentioned increasing your exposure to academic and medical centers. Is life sciences at the class you would consider entering back in again? Mercedes Kerr : It's not something that we're considering at this time. It is such a unique and different asset class even though I know sometimes it's considered into healthcare category, I supposed I understand why, but from our perspective with respective to how it is underwritten, how it is managed, it's just such a different animal from what we're focused on right now. John Kim : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Smedes Rose : Hi. Thanks. So, I'm going to a follow-up, you mentioned your sort of Welltower health district in Beverly Hills and I was just wondering could that kind of strategy of creating a consumer-friendly healthcare facility for consumers. It's actually you could formally be targeting other U.S. markets to create a similar kind of concentrated healthcare facilities. Tom DeRosa : Definitely, Smedes. We think that it's really important that healthcare and the concept of wellness is hard to be really come to mainstream and that's what we are seeing here in Beverly Hills and we clearly think there are other markets for that. The concept of wellness is finally rising to a priority, not only for major health systems but also for the healthcare industry at large. And if you think about the only institutionalized wellness model that we now, exist in senior housing industry. So, and when I wellness I mean nutrition and hydration and physical movement on social comment of engagement safety usually elements that we deliver to the 85 plus cohort but the fact is other populations need that wellness model as well. So, we think that there is an opportunity in partnership with health systems and partnership with major health insurers to start to take wellness and bring it to mainstream, bring into the consumer. So, we are very excited about that. Smedes Rose : Okay, thanks. And I just want to ask one more on your shop via comparisons, I know there is some fitness here but I should be starting if you could provide a little more color around the adjustments to last year's number, let's say healthcare to bring 60% growth for the U.S. portfolio. Could you just walk through that a little bit more? Scott Estes : Sure Smedes, this is Scott. It sounds like you're just referencing the normalizing adjustments and again I would - for everyone's benefit. We have a strict policy that we review with the audit committee every quarter and these are just really unusual item. So, actually a lot of the things that happened in 2016 were benefit that we didn't take like we received some insurance reimbursement proceeds of almost $8 million that out of last year's number. There is some minor adjustments like a worker's comp and a payroll approval that we didn't take the benefit of. So, they're all listed there and the footnotes on page 24 and if you wanted to spend more time, we would be happy to do it, that is pretty straightforward. But we're not - this quarter, there were more things that we did more in our supplement in 2Q 2016. Smedes Rose : Okay. All right, thank you. Scott Estes : Sure. Thanks, Smedes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Market. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Good morning. So, the next data suggest that the under-construction pipeline continues to win and HCN's portfolio looks relative good on this basis? And it seems to show up a little bit in your sequential performance year-over-year at least. So, do you believe that show fundamentals have bottomed here and who are we setting up into 2018? Shankh Mitra : Jordan, it's too early to comment on 2018, but we definitely paying that the show fundamentals for the year have definitely bottomed last quarter. So, I can tell you that, overall, I mean I will not - if you think about the numbers as we said, starts our peak in Q3, Q4 of 2016 and they are coming down, if you think about average it takes as of the 18 months to 24 months impact. I still think we have few quarters to go through a tough operating environment, we're very pleased that kind of performance we are generating even in that environment. But I would not be saying that from the supply impact has bottomed just yet. But we hope to see it in next probably 12 months. It's very hard to predict but definitely in our time horizon, we are very excited that is in near-term. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then on the - this is complete [indiscernible], but on the acquisition of the on-campus MOB in the quarter, I guess in Austin, Ascension Health asset, it looks like a pretty good yield. I'm wondering one if that's stabilized number and two - or if it's the going in number. And two, if you see significant incremental one-off opportunities for outpatient medical purchases? Mercedes Kerr : Yes, that's actually there is - it's a multi-tentative building but there is a gap master lease if you will, to support master lease from the health system in place that is for now bridging frankly a very small difference between what the actual occupancy or the real occupancy of the building is and what we would consider stabilized. So, we have a support mechanism in place, but soon to probably be of no need because have the same occupied with the final users. So, that's sort of but the property that you're asking about in Texas, the Ascension property. And you're right, we are - so Ascension is a system with which we have large relationship, we have actually many of those and to the extent that we can be helpful to them even on a one-off basis given the existing of relationship, the nature of existing contract, et cetera. It just makes it efficient for us to - from time-to-time to a single property, a single development or acquisition whereas sometimes we might look to try to move the needle faster. But this is a more efficient that you said it's a good yield, there is no reason why we wouldn't be doing a follow-on business here and so, we really enjoy that that's part of the shadow pipeline that I was referring to earlier. Jordan Sadler : Okay, so that seller provided the master lease? Mercedes Kerr : No, it's actually the health system, that's it and like I said, it's a really small amount space, I'm talking about maybe 5000 square feet or something like that, I think that largely that space is now occupied, I don't have the number in front of me, but if you would like more details about that we can speak separately. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Thank you for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Chao with Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : Hi, good morning, everyone. Shankh, maybe just question for you back to the optimization of the show seems the revenue growth 2.3% in the quarter mysterious how close you think, you are to opted more at this point or do you think there we could see occupancy dip maybe even more below where we're used to seeing most real estate have price and power? Shankh Mitra : Yes, so I think, thanks for your question, Win. If you think about its we've to say this is not something we do sitting in front of a computer and deciding more in our optimized revenue occupancy or rate should be. You have to see what the market gives you, right? You have to see what the demand is and you are doing this on a daily basis and obviously our operators are very sophisticated, they understand the market and they are doing it on a daily basis, this is the way asset management in sense of business, right? So, you have to see that, I can tell where things are going sitting today, I'll tell you how things have played out. Sequentially, we should expect some occupancy improvement and as I said that year-over-year the occupancy is down or can we see that it will be down more, we absolutely can see. We're trying to maximize the revenue not occupancy and but sequentially we'd probably see improvement from here from an occupancy perspective and it's too early to talk about 2018. Vincent Chao : Okay. And then maybe a question on the pipeline Mercedes, it sounds like there is a pretty healthy pipeline there, but investment volumes as you said are below by historical standards for yourselves. What you think is the delta, the pipeline is strong, is it just seller expectations are too high at this point? Mercedes Kerr : I hope that not in the pipeline that I'm talking about. This is off-market pipeline we think is going to bring adequate returns. I would almost as we sit in our table and talked among ourselves, we sometimes think that as we continue to remain disciplined as I described before, we are likely to do much better even with the lower investment volume than others will, who might be putting more dollars to work with a lot less storks if you will. We actually do feel like this proprietary - that we are describing, it's going to not only show an opportunity for us to put money to work, but then for us to put money to work really above average. Vincent Chao : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question... Tom DeRosa : We know you all have to get on another call in 2 minutes, we're just going to have time from one other question of, we'll be happy to take, those of you who are in the queue, who did not get your question answered, please reach out today. So, final question. Operator : Our final question comes from line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Great. Sounds like I just made it this time. For Shankh, could you go real quick, I think last quarter you talked about you had three term sheets out for the Genesis portfolio or at least portions of the Genesis portfolio, can you give us an update on that? Shankh Mitra : Yes, we are still negotiating a lot of this term sheet and we see very significant demand as I said from overseas as well as domestic sources. It's too early to comment you know these things obviously take a long time as we have told you last year that we have a steady hand on the wheel here and we will continue to execute, but as you know unfortunately real estate transaction takes longer than 90 days period to get done, but we have lot of interest from a lot of investors including those three. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. And then just last question on the remaining portfolio is there much differences between what you have left versus what you sold in the prior quarters? Shankh Mitra : Yes, absolutely. So, if you think about our crown jewel in our Genesis portfolio that's our power back asset. We have retained all those assets, most of those assets in the remaining portfolio. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. Thank you. Tom DeRosa : Thanks. So, we're going to wrap up here and please reach out to us with any questions you have. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for dialing-in to the Welltower earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation and ask that you disconnect.",

My name is Dorothy, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President, Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, sir. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Dorothy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower\u2019s third quarter 2017 results. Following my brief introduction, you will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Mercedes Kerr, EVP, Business and Relationship Management; Shankh Mitra, SVP, Finance and Investments; and John Goodey, CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance those projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning\u2019s press release, and from time to time in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release this morning, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at welltower.com. Before handing the call over to Tom DeRosa, I wanted to point out four highlights regarding our third quarter 2017 results. First, we reported 4.1% year-over-year same-store growth in our senior housing operating portfolio, supported by greater than 3.5% growth across all three of our global geographies; second, driven by senior housing operating performance, we reported total portfolio same-store growth of 3.4% in the quarter, allowing us to raise full year total portfolio same-store guidance for the second time this year to 2.5% to 3%; third, as a result of the continued strong property performance, we are increasing normalized FFO guidance to a range of $4.19 to $4.25 per share from our prior guidance range of $4.15 to $4.25 per share; and fourth, we finished the quarter at 5.19x net debt to EBITDA, representing a half-turn reduction in year-over-year leverage. And with that, I will turn the call over to Tom for further remarks on our quarter. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Tim. As Tim just highlighted, we are pleased to report a strong quarter characterized by industry-leading results from Welltower\u2019s premier seniors housing portfolio, which is concentrated in major metro markets. The REIT sector appreciates the resilience of A-quality real estate in most industry categories, and our performance supports the fact that health care real estate is no different.While the overall environment remains challenging, our same-store seniors housing operating portfolio registered 4.1% growth, with the U.S. posting 3.7%.Keep in mind that we have 423 properties in our same-store operating pool, which is by far the largest same-store operating portfolio in the industry. So our numbers are statistically significant, consistent from quarter-to-quarter and financially reliable. The unique hands-on operations and data and analytics-focused approach we employ in the senior housing space is validated by our continued outperformance, and we continue to attract top-quality operators to the Welltower family. Together, Welltower and our premier operating partners deliver premier results. I\u2019m proud to announce that Sagora Senior Living, a resident-first centered operator based in Fort Worth, joins our bench of RIDEA operators. Donny Edwards, Bryan McCaleb and Robert Bullock have built an outstanding business with some of the highest quality next-generation assets I\u2019ve seen in this industry. For Sagora, we used the security of a triple net lease to incubate this exceptional team and their business plan. Now as Sagora has achieved critical mass, we employ the RIDEA structure to share the future upside in the value of Sagora and the real estate. This new joint venture better aligns Welltower and Sagora to grow and enhance investment returns. We also welcomed Encore, a U.K.-based operator of assisted living and independent living, this quarter. Many of you know, Welltower dominates the high-end private pay senior housing business in the U.K., and Encore further solidifies our position there. Welltower is quite bullish about the future of health care real estate, so in the current environment, we are taking every opportunity to enhance and derisk our business platform, so that we can take full advantage of the significant strategic opportunities to deploy capital we see in the future. We have continued to strengthen our balance sheet, reducing leverage to 5.19x net debt to adjusted EBITDA this quarter. We continue to sell assets in noncore markets and assets where CapEx investment does not offer an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Further, we have continued to look for ways to limit our exposure to assets subject to government reimbursement. And while we work with our operating partners to better manage expense growth, we also continue to tighten our own belt. This quarter, you saw us donate our headquarters building in Toledo to the University of Toledo, which will allow us to maintain our corporate headquarters on this bucolic campus, while lowering our annual operating expenses by several millions of dollars per year going forward. Along with other efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our business model, we are tracking overall G&A to decline from $155 million to below $130 million for the year. Keep in mind, we are undertaking these initiatives from a position of strength, all with an eye toward driving growth and shareholder value in the future. I\u2019ll now hand the mic over to my colleague and friend, Mercedes Kerr. Mercedes Kerr : Well, thank you, Tom. I would like to start today by describing the organization\u2019s resolve, which we witnessed from our operating partners and Welltower\u2019s own property management team last quarter. Hurricanes, floods and forest fires put many people at risk, and it put about 100 Welltower outpatient medical properties and senior housing communities in the path of these natural disasters. We saw first-hand what great team preparedness and good property maintenance can do to minimize losses and protect our residents, tenants and buildings. Our property management team ran around the clock surveillance during the worst of the storm, and without hesitation, our seniors housing operators took in dozens of residents who had to be evacuated from other area communities. There was an impact to our quarter earnings resulting from these storms. However, we viewed this as a cost of doing business and the numbers are included in our financial statements as an ordinary expense. We are grateful to Welltower\u2019s and our operators\u2019 staff for keeping our tenants and residents safe and our properties in good order. Turning to Welltower\u2019s investment activities in the third quarter. We continue to expand our existing partnerships and also added a new one, which I will describe in a moment. 95% of the $381 million of new investments that we reported involved existing relationships. We acquired $304 million at a blended yield of 6.5% and funded $70 million of construction, with an expected stabilized yield of 7.9%. We also funded $7 million in loans with a combined yield of 7.8%. Dispositions of $84 million included $51 million of loan payoffs at an average yield of 8.3% and $33 million of property sales, with a blended yield of 8%. Welltower\u2019s relationships continually produce desirable off-market opportunities with above average returns and a reduced risk. It makes our repeat business model exceptionally valuable. As we look to 2018, and we study the specific transactions available with our partners, we\u2019re optimistic about the new business opportunities that we will source for our shareholders. In addition, some of our investments in 2018 will also bring in new relationships. It is something that we do selectively, but consistently through the cycle. A good example of this is Encore Care Homes in the UK, which we added to our family of operators in the third quarter of 2017. Our first investment with this quality operator marks the beginning of a long and fruitful relationship, which we expect to expand significantly over the coming years. We are pleased to have joined forces with this innovative team, and are excited to grow our platform together. Lastly, on the asset management front, we continue to drive efficiency wherever possible by supporting our operating partners so that they can perform even better. We recently hosted 12 operating companies for one of our Welltower collaborative events, where we share proprietary lead generation tool and presented new technology to help reduce employee turnover. This work, combined with our operator strength and willingness to participate, is the great differentiator which drives Welltower\u2019s superior performance. I will now turn the call over to Shankh Mitra, who will provide more color on our portfolio results. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Mercedes, and good morning, everyone. I will now review our quarterly operating results for different segments of the business, and provide you with an update on our continuing portfolio repositioning efforts. We\u2019re very pleased with our results and are increasing our same-store NOI guidance for the overall portfolio to 2.5% to 3% on the back of significant outperformance on our SHO portfolio, which grew 4.1% year-over-year. I will remind you that we do not update our outlook for the segment level NOI growth throughout the year, but we are tracking towards the top end of our original 1.5% to 3% guidance for the SHO portfolio. Same-store NOI increased 3.4% year-over-year for the entire portfolio. The triple net portfolio continued its reliable performance as our senior housing triple net segment grew 3%. The payments stream remained secure despite a 2 basis points of optical decline in coverage. This decline was primarily driven by the removal of Sagora portfolio, part of which was converted to a RIDEA joint venture as Sagora had higher coverage than the overall triple net portfolio. While industry debate is often focused on RIDEA versus triple net, we have combined the best of both worlds in structuring this relationship. Newer assets in the best of markets are now structured as RIDEA joint venture, while more middle-market assets where we can earn reliable and consistent returns are part of a triple net portfolio. Alignment of interests and downside protections were two of the most important pillars of restructuring. We\u2019re extremely confident in Donny and Bryan\u2019s ability to drive significant value here. The outpatient medical portfolio reported 2.4% NOI growth in Q3. Growth rebounded from Q2, as we expected, due to strong leasing and high tenant retention. Our steady performance and continued growth demonstrates why institutional investors are flowing into this asset class. Our post-acute portfolio, which constitutes 13% of our NOI and approximately 7% of our value, grew same-store NOI at 3.1% for the quarter. Our payments stream remained secure at 1.55 times on EBITDARM and 1.24 times on EBITDAR basis. I would like to remind everyone that management fees are subordinate to rent as defined in our master leases. This decline in coverage was driven by our skilled nursing portfolio as well as our small LTAC portfolio. Specifically focusing on Genesis, it is no secret that skill mix and occupancy have been materially impacted by the evolution of reimbursement model over last few years. However, we are really encouraged by the sequential stabilization of EBITDAR in a majority of our Genesis portfolio. We are confident that Genesis will be a winner in the new value-driven landscape because of its superior clinical abilities. We and other Genesis-graded parties understand the current capital structure is suboptimal. As you know, we\u2019re going through a disposition program that will provide a substantial deleveraging event for Genesis. We have select the counter party -- we have selected the counter parties, and largely negotiated the economics and structure and are currently working towards documentation. Given the current status of this transaction, we cannot further comment on this topic other than to say that upon successful completion of these deals, Genesis will receive approximately $25 million of rent credit and reduced escalators, as you have seen from our last two Genesis transactions. This meaningful deleveraging of Genesis will put the company in a sustainable capital structure and accelerate market share gain, which will help our joint venture partners and our retained interest, while crystallizing value for our shareholders today. As a reminder, we own real estate assets, loans and some equity interest in Genesis. While we cannot guarantee any outcome, we\u2019re confident in our ability to execute and hopeful that you as our shareholders will keep the same faith in us as you did last year to maximize the value of our total capital deployed with Genesis. We are encouraged and grateful for your support in our path of maximizing value for our existing shareholders rather than the short-term temptation of solving fund equation -- exposure equation only to attract the new ones. Our senior housing operating portfolio is the highlight of the quarter, with meaningful outperformance relative to our budget. Occupancy trends were slightly lower than we expected, about 20 basis points, weaker in Canada and U.K., but better in the U.S. This favorable occupancy trends were significantly offset by our pricing power, 30 basis points above budget, which resulted a strong rate growth, up 3.9% year-over-year, and significantly better expense trend, up only 0.8% year-over-year. Both Canada and U.K. outperformed expectations in terms of rate growth. As we mentioned before, our premier operating partners are consistently optimizing the rate and occupancy equation to maximize revenue. We\u2019re very proud that they have achieved this growth while keeping expenses in check. As our operators strike the right balance between excellent care delivery and efficient staffing model, our labor cost continues to moderate from the highs, up 3.6% this quarter versus 4.1% last quarter relative to a peak of 7.4% in Q1 of \u201816. Our group repurchasing and other cost consolidation initiative are been realized through expense savings in food, professional services, insurance, utilities and incentive management fee. We believe our data and analytics-driven asset management approach will continue to help us produce superior results in the long term. Southern California, northern California, Toronto, London, Vancouver and Seattle were significant drivers of growth this quarter. The greater New York MSA has bounced back and produced better-than-portfolio result for the first time in handful of quarters. New England continuous to be challenging, though it is improving sequentially for the second quarter in a row. With respect to different product types, we have observed significant outperformance of both revenue and NOI growth in assisted living versus independent living this quarter. We continue to be encouraged by the greater stickiness of residents in assisted living and memory care assets. So overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the operating performance of our portfolio, innovative structuring with Sagora and progress on our disposition efforts in the post-acute segment of the business. With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to John Goodey, our CFO. John? John Goodey : Thank you, Shankh, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to provide you with the financial highlights of our third quarter, and I\u2019ll take you on our guidance for the remainder of the year.  Our strong Q3 2017 financial performance once again shows the superior quality of our real estate and operator relationships as well as the strength of the Welltower platform to allocate capital and deliver results. We continue to produce resilient same-store growth, maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position and improve our own corporate operational efficiency. The highlight of our quarter was the performance of our senior housing operating portfolio, which saw same-store NOI growth of 4.1%, driven by REVPOR growth of 3.9%, aligned with good operational expense control. Growth was delivered across the three countries of our operations, with the U.S. recording same-store operating NOI growth of 3.7% against a challenged overall market backdrop. This growth, combined with good results from our senior housing triple net and outpatient medical businesses, augmented with in-quarter growth investments of $381 million, have enabled us to report a solid normalized FFO result of $1.08 per share. In addition to this quarter\u2019s acquisitions, we completed three seniors housing developments at $48 million of total costs, bringing year-to-date deliveries to $506 million. We expect an additional $76 million in conversions through the remainder of the year at a stabilized yield of approximately 9.3%. Although Q3 was a slower period for dispositions with only $84 million realized, we continue to see strong investor interest in our sectors, and we will continue to derisk our portfolio through targeted dispositions. In alignment with this, today we announced an increase in our disposition guidance for 2017 to $2.4 billion, an increase of $400 million. This represents an expectation of a further $1 billion of dispositions before year-end or soon thereafter. We anticipate a blended disposition yield of 7.4% for the year overall. Welltower continues to focus on our own corporate operational efficiency by optimizing systems, processes, people and physical infrastructure. Our G&A for the quarter was $29.9 million, a 19% reduction over Q3 2016. As such, we have further reduced our full year G&A expectation to be below $130 million, this being below the bottom end of our already lowered range of $130 million to $132 million. Clearly, we have systemically and durably reduced the cost base of Welltower\u2019s corporate operations, and we will continue to implement further initiatives to improve our efficiency. Our balance sheet remains in great shape, and we will continue to maintain balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. We ended the quarter with cash of $236 million and $2.6 billion of credit line availability. Our leverage metrics remain at historically low levels, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.19 times and net debt to undepreciated book capitalization ratio of 35.5%, while our fixed charge coverage ratio remains strong at 3.65 times. All metrics have improved significantly over 1-year ago. Our strong liquidity affords us significant flexibility to pursue value-enhancing acquisitions, development opportunities in core metro markets such as Manhattan, London and Los Angeles, and to reinvest in our portfolio to drive growth. On November 20, 2017, Welltower will pay its 186th consecutive cash dividend of $0.87. This represents a current dividend yield of approximately 5%. I will conclude my remarks with our outlook for the rest of the year. Given our strong senior housing\u2019s operation performance year-to-date, we are increasing our full year same-store NOI guidance, again, to 2.5% to 3% from 2.25% to 3% prior. We are also increasing our 2017 full year guidance for normalized FFO to $4.19 to $4.25 per share from $4.15 to $4.25 prior. This being based on the strength of our same-store NOI growth, our G&A focus and reprofiling of divestiture timings. As usual, we do not include unannounced acquisitions in our forecast but we do include expected dispositions. On that positive note of upward revision, I will hand it back to Tom for his closing comments and look forward to seeing many more of you in person before the close of the calendar year and continuing our open dialogue. Thanks, Tom. Tom DeRosa : Thank you, John. Before we take your questions, I\u2019m proud to tell you that the Welltower Foundation and our community relations fund donated approximately $100,000 to a number of our operators to help support their employees whose lives were profoundly impacted by the hurricanes in Texas and Florida, and the fires in California. We hope that life there gets back to normal soon as well as in Puerto Rico. Now Dorothy, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Chad Vanacore : Just picking up the Sagora conversion from triple net to RIDEA. You converted 11 properties. What was the coverage on those properties? And then, was this always in the plan or is this opportunistic? And then should we expect them to convert more of these remaining leases to RIDEA over time? Mercedes Kerr : Yes. It\u2019s Mercedes. Let me talk to you a little bit more about Sagora. So we started this relationship in 2010, and as Tom mentioned, this triple net structure rather was somewhat of an incubator process, if you will, but there were a group of properties, these 11 properties that we converted to RIDEA, which stood out from what is otherwise a very solid portfolio, a very consistent performing portfolio, as a group of properties that had outsized growth. And so those were the ones that we decided fit very well in this RIDEA model. As you probably know, we are very selective about what we want to own in that kind of a joint venture structure. We try to, I suppose, manage volatility by really picking properties that we think have the opportunity for outsized growth and performance. So in any event -- the rest of the portfolio, which we thought was very suitable for the triple net lease structure because they are, by all accounts, cash cows for Sagora but don\u2019t have the same growth prospect. It\u2019s kind of the decision that we made with them. You saw, what we\u2019re calling kind of our version 2.0 of RIDEA joint venture, structuring tools, and by that I mean with respect to alignment, with respect to management contracts. So Sagora was very instrumental in us sort of designing some of these new found tools that we think are going to be very useful for us going forward. Chad Vanacore : Mercedes, the outsized growth expectation, is that because these were in process of stabilization? Or they\u2019re outperforming in some other way? Shankh Mitra : No, these properties, Chad, are in the best of markets in the footprint, and so we expect this portfolio that we have in, in RIDEA outperform because they\u2019re in the best submarkets as well as the best demographics. Tom DeRosa : Yes, Chad. It\u2019s Tom. Let me just make a comment regarding your broader question you asked. We built our business model around owning RIDEA assets. For Welltower, we see that as a lower risk structure because we\u2019ve built the full complement of skills, tools, technology to maximize the value of real estate in a RIDEA structure. So you will continue to see us look for operators that we may incubate in a triple net lease format to transition eventually to a RIDEA structure. And you\u2019ll see us likely move away from operators where we don\u2019t see the opportunity to transition the operator or the real estate into a RIDEA structure in the future. That is -- this is -- Sagora is a great example, and I\u2019m sitting here looking at my friend, Joe Weisenburger, who is very much responsible for this relationship and helping this business grow to where we could affect this transition. That\u2019s -- this is such an example of what this company does, and you\u2019ll -- you should expect to see more of that. Chad Vanacore : And then, just thinking about your SHO fundamentals. They\u2019ve pretty much outperformed the industry. Do you think fundamentals have bottomed here coming into the fourth quarter of \u201817? Or should we expect more pressures in 2018? Shankh Mitra : It\u2019s too early to comment about 2018. As you know, we don\u2019t know what exactly the flu seasons will look like. We are receiving the operator budgets now and, obviously, we have a huge process that we go through with every one of our operators. So it\u2019s really too early to comment on 2018. But what I can tell you is, we remain very optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to outperform the industry as well as our peers because of where we are and also the asset management and systems and processes that Tom mentioned. Because if you think about the supply impact, you will see, obviously, 2017 was a deliveries peak. But you also -- if you think about what that means for next 12 months, right. So this will impact operation, but we absolutely believe that we will -- our property, our property and our -- properties in our portfolio will hold up better than the industry and better than peers. Chad Vanacore : So if we can\u2019t take about 2018 yet, fourth quarter 2017, what occupancy and rate assumptions are baked in your guidance? Shankh Mitra : We do not give quarterly guidance on rates and occupancies, but we are pretty optimistic about rest of the year as far as our SHO portfolio is concerned. Chad Vanacore : So one more for me. On the disposition guidance, you raised it from $2 billion to $2.4 billion. What asset classes are you expecting in that increase? Shankh Mitra : That in the senior housing, triple net portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JP Morgan. Mike Mueller : I guess, looking at the Sagora acquisition cap rate of 7.3%. Can you just use that as a starting off point to talk about where you see cap rates for SHO assets at this point? And kind of how that fits into the mix? Justin Skiver : So this is Justin Skiver, SVP of Underwriting. Just to give a little color on cap rates. And obviously, there is many factors involved, but generally speaking, we see Class A seniors housing trading at a 6% cap, plus or minus 50 basis points. And Class B seniors housing is trading at a slight discount to Class A, probably by about 25 basis points. But we view that delta as being too small, and there should be a larger spread between A and B class properties. Mercedes Kerr : And I want to add to that. That\u2019s the beauty of this Sagora transaction, is the fact that we were able to have this relationship and build the trust and build the structure together that I described before, allowed us to take what we consider to be terrific assets with a lot of upside potential at a great price compared to market. Mike Mueller : Got it. And how new are they? And how occupied are they? The ones that were acquired for the 7.3%? Justin Skiver : Yes, the -- three are about three years old, on average, with occupancy in the low 60s. And I think, an important point to make here is that, we are acquiring these at below replacement cost. So we see a tremendous value upside in making this acquisition with Sagora. Shankh Mitra : And Justin is specifically talking about the three new assets that we bought in Texas. Mike Mueller : Yes, okay. And then just last question for me. Just any sort of update on the Manhattan development? Mercedes Kerr : Yes. I can tell you that we continue to make progress. I think our assumptions continue to be validated, both on the cost side as well as with what we see happening in terms of a lack of supply and demand. So we feel very good about the progress. The construction, I think I already reported this last quarter, is underway with a demolition and so on underway. So just things continue to progress, and like I said, our assumption is validated. Mike Mueller : Okay. So demolition is occurring. And when do you see it coming out of the ground? Mercedes Kerr : We\u2019re still on the same timeline, that -- late 2019, early 2020 or so is the timeline that we have been indicating. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : I think, Shankh, you referenced the disposition program that went through Genesis assets. Can you maybe comment on the magnitude of the sale as far as what percentage of your Genesis exposure you\u2019re looking to sell? Shankh Mitra : Yes, John, as I said, you can appreciate this is a live situation, right? I mean it\u2019s very hard to comment on the quantum as well as sort of what will be our retained interest right now. I can tell you that we\u2019re pretty much set on who we think that we\u2019ll go with. We\u2019re set on the economics and the structure and retained interest. But because it\u2019s a very live situation, I just don\u2019t want to comment on it anymore. So -- but we hope that we\u2019ll be able to talk to you about this particular situation in a lot more details soon. John Kim : But this is separate from the $1 billion of dispositions for this year? Shankh Mitra : Yes. John Kim : Right, okay. And then you also referenced the $25 million rent credit. Is that an annual figure? And when does that start taking place? Shankh Mitra : That will take place at the close of the deal. So when the deals close, that\u2019s when we get the rent credit. John Kim : Is it a onetime or an annual figure? Shankh Mitra : It\u2019s a onetime. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : On the expense side, you\u2019ve now had two quarters of pretty strong expense controls. Can you give us a bit more details on sort of the moving parts? And I know, Shankh, you\u2019ve mentioned the comp control there. Just some more details, and just how sustainable are -- is this control? Is there more to go from here? Or is this sort of a good run rate? Shankh Mitra : So I would not consider 0.8% as a good run rate. I just wanted to mention that, obviously. Look, we have heightened labor cost growth for last few quarters. As you know, we have talked about -- like we know, sort of the -- all the deliveries are lining up. There\u2019s been also the law of large numbers [indiscernible], right? So when you -- what happened in 2000 -- late 2015 and \u201816, labor cost went up but also the year-over-year comparison was very low. So year-over-year numbers growth was extraordinary. Now we\u2019re getting to more of a stabilized numbers, where you will see the labor cost will remain elevated but not to the extent that we have seen before. The other expense line item, as you can see, utilities, we\u2019re doing a lot. I mean there\u2019s a lot of very focused retrofit program here that\u2019s driving that lawsuit. You know we have a GPO. We\u2019re focusing a lot on our property taxes. Our asset management group is highly, highly focused on that. And then, it\u2019s the other expense bucket, the all other buckets, where we have seen, this quarter, a significant decrease. As I told you, last quarter, there\u2019s a huge focus on bringing down the professional management fees -- professional fees, lawyers and accountants and consultants, et cetera. There\u2019s significant decrease there. We have seen a significant decrease in the workers comp area as well in the workers comp insurance area, so it\u2019s across the board. We\u2019re looking at everything and trying to retool the business. Not much different from what you\u2019re hearing about our corporate. We\u2019re trying to say, \"Okay, where the business is? What is the sustainable cost model going forward?\" I cannot guarantee you that everything will continue to come down, but we think a lot of these savings are not onetime in nature. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just on the dispositions, I wanted to clarify, I think to an earlier question, that the $1 billion that you are expected to close by year-end, that includes any Genesis sales as well? Or is Genesis over and above that? Shankh Mitra : Genesis is over and above that. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. And then just maybe last one for me. Any update on some of the legal proceedings that you outlined last quarter? Any update on sort of where we are today? And anything on economics? Tom DeRosa : Vik, you know what I\u2019m going to do? Let me have our General Counsel, Matt McQueen, answer that question for you. Matt McQueen : Sure. Vik, as you know, it was disclosed that Welltower filed a lawsuit against Scott Brinker, alleging that he had breached his separation agreement with us in connection with the announcement that Mr. Brinker would start at HCP on January 4, 2018, which was the end of his non-compete period. So we\u2019re pleased to report that we\u2019ve recently reached the settlement of this lawsuit. Some of the terms are confidential, but I can say that under the terms of the settlement, Mr. Brinker is not permitted to begin work as the Chief Investment Officer of HCP before the date that we issue our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ending in December 31, 2017, which will be on or around March 1 of 2018. Tom DeRosa : I don\u2019t want to say anything further about this matter beyond what Matt said, but let me add that the first principle of how we approach everything at Welltower, including litigation, is that we do everything we can to protect our shareholder. That\u2019s what we will always do as a company, and you should not accept anything less than that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : Shankh, did you give the -- if you said it, I apologize. Did you give the Genesis\u2019 rent coverage -- EBITDAR rent coverage today? Shankh Mitra : No, we didn\u2019t. You will find that it\u2019s disclosed in our supplemental. Rich Anderson : Okay. I was searching for it and I didn\u2019t -- but can you give a sense of how that\u2019ll change post sales or is that too much information at this point? Shankh Mitra : No, it\u2019s not. I think I said this before as well that the market is about 1.3 times coverage going forward. So it will be reset to 1.3 times coverage going forward. Rich Anderson : Okay. Bigger picture, maybe for Tom. You guys have an interest in staying invested in Genesis for the couple of reasons you cited earlier in the call. Can you make that same comment about Brookdale? Mercedes Kerr : Well, let me talk to you a little bit about Brookdale. Obviously, they\u2019ve put out their numbers as well. And so we\u2019re always concerned about any one of our operators that\u2019s having any trouble. And I think it behooves everyone, and it would be good for the industry for them to do well. So we\u2019re hopeful that they will do well. But having said that, we\u2019re not actually worried about our own portfolio with them. Their triple net EBITDAR coverage is actually above the Welltower average at 1.15 times. We have some possible type of protections in our portfolio, and we\u2019re always in discussions with Brookdale about performance and also around strategic alternatives. We have a good collaborative relationship with them. But like Tom just said, we\u2019re always looking to protect our shareholders\u2019 interests. So we\u2019re looking always at our alternatives, and we take, actually, comfort in knowing that two thirds of our portfolio with Brookdale is either in California or in Washington or a CON state, and we have excellent operators in every one of those regions who could step in and take over the building, so if we need ever -- if it were ever to arise. Tom DeRosa : So Rich, just from my perspective, and you\u2019ve always heard us say this, Brookdale is not one of our operating partners. We\u2019ve never looked at Brookdale as an operating partner. That has always been more of a financial transaction. Our Brookdale exposure largely arose from the fact that Brookdale acquired some of our smaller operators. Look, we are cheering for Brookdale. We hope they can turn their business around, because the fact is, their issues affect the view of the entire industry. Never say never. But, they are not one of the operators I was referring to beforehand. So ones that we will come in and grow with, grow out of that triple net lease structure into a RIDEA structure longer term. They\u2019re very different situation for us, they always have been. So again, never say never. But, likely, we\u2019re not looking for growth opportunities there. Rich Anderson : So if I\u2019m using how you describe wanting to move most -- anybody into RIDEA or maybe exit the relationship, is this ultimately as you see it today? It could change, but as you see it today, Brookdale is somebody or an operator you would ultimately part ways if everything stayed the same today. Is that a fair statement? Tom DeRosa : Well, we will continue to do what we can to optimize the value of the real estate. And we have lots of ways to manage this. If Brookdale\u2019s performance turned around, we might be happy to keep Brookdale in a triple net lease structure for the time being. The fact is, we have good real estate, as Mercedes said, in good markets. I think anyone who has looked closely at Brookdale knows that the Welltower leases are the best leases, because they are structured around a good portfolio of real estate, which gives us lots of optionality. So we\u2019re continuing to be in discussions with Brookdale -- we have been in discussions with Brookdale for years, and we will maximize whatever value option is in the best interest of our shareholders. That\u2019s the best thing I can say, Rich. Rich Anderson : Through the press release today, several items related to UK investing, is that just coincidental timing? Or do you, as a firm, looking to expand there? John Goodey : It\u2019s John. I\u2019ll take that one in my prior hat on, if I may. And I think the answer is, yes, we continue to expand in the UK We have a number of ongoing construction projects with... Rich Anderson : John, let me just interrupt. Expand disproportionately more than where you\u2019re at today? John Goodey : Well, I think law of numbers, that\u2019s quite hard to do, because we\u2019re sort of 8% of our portfolio relative to the overall portfolio is there. So obviously, we\u2019ve got a leverage -- a multiplication equation to overcome. But I think we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve had great performance in UK As you know, we\u2019ve got some great operating partners there that we continue to grow with. Mathematically, to grow it as a proportion is relatively difficult compared to the growth of the U.S. right now. But I think overall, are we looking to put more dollars to work in the UK? The answer is, absolutely yes, and we are doing that, as you can see, both through a conversion of construction projects into operational assets. We\u2019re bringing Encore as a new development partner, who we hope to grow very significantly with going forward, but also to back our existing partners like Avery, Sunrise and Signature. Rich Anderson : And then last one for me, the $95 million of noncapitalizable transaction costs, what is that? John Goodey : Well, essentially, I\u2019ll take that one on as well with my new hat on, I guess. And because we already owned the real estate, so we didn\u2019t buy any new buildings from them, U.S. GAAP, if you\u2019re very interested in such things, under ASC 805-10-51-21, allows us or means that we cannot capitalize those extra proceeds to Sagora for the transaction onto our balance sheet. We\u2019re not allowed to. The one statement I can make, which is the truism. If we had bought those assets, clean and clear as a first off transaction, that number would\u2019ve just been on our balance sheet. We\u2019d have had a capitalized rate on those RIDEA assets. That\u2019d been very attractive to Welltower, and there would have been -- literally would have been a nonevent. It\u2019s only because of the GAAP accounting. Tim McHugh : Before the next question, I just want to clarify. This is Tim. I was intending to clarify something from a question earlier. In our current disposition guidance, we have a $1 billion in dispositions for the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve kept $400 million in there, as most of you know, from a Genesis purchase option, that was an option going into the year. And we kept it in there to communicate to the market the intention to sell Genesis after that option expired. That $400 million is still in our guidance from a nominal dollar amount, and Shankh, I think, was intending just to stay that the scope of what he described in his opening comments goes beyond that. So there are Genesis dispositions in our guidance for right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Daniel Bernstein : I just wanted to go ahead, and given Tom\u2019s earlier comments about the business platform being built around senior housing operating, and then with Sagora, the increase in NOI from seniors housing operating, should I read anything into that in terms of how you think that the seniors housing industry will recover from the down we are in now? Without specifics, obviously, on 2018, that you don\u2019t want to give out, but how should I be thinking about where you think fundamentals will be in a couple of years? And how much RIDEA you want in your portfolio going forward? Tom DeRosa : Well, I\u2019ll start off the answer to that by saying, we\u2019re very optimistic about the senior housing industry and we\u2019ve been taking this opportunity to lighten up in markets and around operators that we do not see strategic to our business model in the future, and we invest behind operators and markets that are strategic. We have a core Metro market strategy in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. And it is no secret that it is our intention to dominate those core markets. We believe the demographics, starting in about two years, are all in our favor and they\u2019re not going to reverse. Shankh Mitra : And Dan, I want to add. If you look at the numbers even today and you look at the population growth -- nowhere in the demographics as a law, if you will -- the population grows 75-plus-years old. In that category for the last seven years, you\u2019ll see map 31 and map 99 is about 1.5%. If you look at the absorption of assisted living and memory care product, you\u2019ll see its five plus percent. That tells you how the products, the absorption is significantly growing above the population growth. And then you add what Tom just talked about, the population growth itself, we\u2019re extremely bullish about the industry. Daniel Bernstein : Okay. And I should expect RIDEA to become a larger part of the portfolio generally from your 42% or so now it\u2019s... Shankh Mitra : Yes. Daniel Bernstein : Okay. Is there a top limit of that? Tom DeRosa : Hard to say. Daniel Bernstein : Not to corner you. Shankh Mitra : We are opportunity driven, not necessarily equation-driven that we\u2019re trying to sell for. Tom DeRosa : I mean, look, if there was some phenomenal triple net lease opportunity that had really strong coverage in the right markets or with the right operator, we wouldn\u2019t turn that down. So as you keep hearing us say, we\u2019re opportunistic and keeping all our options open. But clearly, Dan, for us, we have built a model around maximizing the returns that wanted to derive from this operating lease or RIDEA structure. That is, if you don\u2019t have the infrastructure and the systems and the right people, that means it\u2019s riskier than a triple net lease. But we\u2019ve made those investments, and we\u2019ve seen, as you\u2019ve seen in our results quarter-over-quarter, particularly this quarter, we\u2019re able to get a return on that investment because we have the system. But it\u2019s not magic. We don\u2019t make it up. It doesn\u2019t come out of the air. It\u2019s real. And it\u2019s real because we roll up our sleeves and we work hard, alongside our operators, and that\u2019s what drives our results. And if you\u2019re not willing to do that, you should own this top category of real estate in a triple net restructure. Daniel Bernstein : No. I can appreciate that. One more quick question regarding Brookdale. Could you talk about the trend in their lease coverages? And do they have any purchase options that can be exercised in, say, the next couple of years, two years? Mercedes Kerr : With respect to trends, I think, sequentially, we\u2019ve seen them sort of stabilize a bit. We\u2019re seeing -- as you\u2019re looking at their corporate performance, which is probably emblematic of a lot of what\u2019s going on in their portfolio, which is some pressures on occupancy and the like. In our portfolio specifically, I think that they\u2019ve been very capable of maintaining cost. So that\u2019s been a very helpful tool for them. And so sequentially, I think they feel relatively stable to us. And with respect to purchase options, they\u2019re out in the future. At the end of some leases there might be 1 or two purchase options that are still left from old structures that remain. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : With regard to Sagora, did you disclose how much compensation you provided to the tenants who moved those 11 assets into the operating structure? John Goodey : No. We haven\u2019t disclosed that. Michael Carroll : Can you discuss it? John Goodey : I think it\u2019s part of the contractual negotiations. I believe that\u2019s not disclosable. But as I said, I think the -- if you take a step back and look at the overall income from the triple net lease revised and the additional net operating income from the excess coverage of the triple net lease, the rate there is probably 50 to 100 basis points better than the present in [ph] the market if you were to buy this quality of assets with this quality of operator. I mean that\u2019s the sort of guidance I can give you. It was a -- overall a good transaction. Mercedes Kerr : And the other thing that I could add is, we reinvested -- they\u2019re saying in the structure of the -- on the -- both on the lease side and the RIDEA side. They\u2019re staying in as joint venture partners with us. And so they have basically reinvested a book of whatever it is that they\u2019ve received in proceeds. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then how much I guess of an ownership stake do they have in the JV? And is there any desire from them or you guys to transition the remaining assets into that structure too? Mercedes Kerr : We have -- as we continue to add assets to this portfolio, and I think Justin talked earlier about some new assets that we just added to the portfolio. So yes, indeed over time, there might be properties that transform into RIDEA. Joe Weisenburger : Yes. To give clarity, Sagora has a 10% ownership in the operating entity, and a 45% owner in the OpCo entity, and they\u2019re reinvesting $33.5 million into the transaction. So we\u2019ve had a strong alignment of incentives. We think this trend -- this transaction was transformative, because it fit the portfolio of RIDEA assets, which has an average age of 5% as well as 90% occupancy and has a strong growth profile. And the triple net portfolio, while it has a strong occupancy in the 90% range, it\u2019s an older portfolio, older than 15 years. So we think it was the best of both worlds to provide a great transaction for us and for Sagora. Tom DeRosa : And that was Joe Weisenburger who manages the Sagora relationship. John Goodey : I think -- Michael, it\u2019s John. The one thing I would say is, you\u2019ve seen us systematically segment the market of those assets that will grow with the market and those that\u2019ll grow faster than market. If it grows faster than market, generally we would love it to be in a RIDEA format of partnership. If it\u2019s going to grow with market, then a triple net lease. And you see that actually in the structuring of Sagora. We\u2019ve had to do it with one partner to stay actually within the portfolio profile. They have a different profile of assets, and we put those together in the different categories of triple net lease and RIDEA to be, I guess, mirroring the way we see the market more generally. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. Just one last question. I guess a bigger question, maybe for Tom. I mean how is your conversations going with the major health systems right now? And are those organizations any closer to partnering with REITs to grow their real estate footprint? Tom DeRosa : Yes, thanks for asking that. Yes, they are. And stay tuned, we may be discussing something between now and the end of the year. Mercedes Kerr : Yes, but you know you asked if they\u2019re closer to partnering with REITs, and I just want to be very clear, they\u2019re closer to partnering with Welltower, which is very different. Building relationships here has been a very, very specific focus of ours, as you know. And the kind of progress that we have made is really very specific to what Welltower can deliver in terms of a value proposition. Tom DeRosa : And I would tell you that we are likely planning an Investor Day in the first quarter of next year, and expect you\u2019ll have the opportunity to hear a lot about this strategy and how it\u2019s being put into practice. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from UBS. Nick Yulico : Just going back to Genesis. You mentioned the $35 million rent credit. So is the way for us to think about this that, versus the current rent you receive, it looks like it\u2019s about a 25% rent cut. So what you\u2019re doing here is, you\u2019re trying to create market level rent coverage for the assets in order to sell those assets outright or in a JV? Shankh Mitra : Yes. I\u2019m not agreeing to your exact numbers, but that\u2019s the idea that if you have coverage below 1.3 times and the market is 1.3 times, then you have to give Genesis the rent credit. And so that going forward, whether it\u2019s a joint venture or the owner will have a sustainable rent coverage. This would only happen upon sale, right? At transaction. Nick Yulico : Right. And then in the senior housing operating segment, you gave the breakdown of your same-store expenses. You talked about this a little bit, but you have this line item for all other expenses. That number is down year-to-date. It\u2019s causing, it looks like the bulk of the reason why your expenses are low. Is any of that year-to-date decline due to a lower management fee that you\u2019re paying operators? Shankh Mitra : So I think I answered that question earlier. But if you look at before all other, you will see utilities is down. You\u2019ll see raw food is down. So you\u2019ll see our NIM is down. You\u2019ll see property tax is down. So I\u2019m not 100% sure where you\u2019re seeing that the -- all the expenses are coming in the all other bucket. But as I mentioned, the all other bucket, it\u2019s a catch-all, right? It has what is comp, insurance, marketing, professional fees, bad debt as well as incentive management fees. This particular quarter, we have seen a significant decrease in the workers comp area as well as professional fees, which is sort of the lawyers and the accountants and consultants, that bucket. Nick Yulico : Okay. But that number is down almost 5 million year-over-year. Is there any lower management fee that you\u2019re paying operators? Shankh Mitra : So I think I answered that question earlier. But if you look at before all other, you will see utilities is down. You\u2019ll see raw food is down. So you\u2019ll see our NIM is down. You\u2019ll see property tax is down. So I\u2019m not 100% sure where you\u2019re seeing that the -- all the expenses are coming in the all other bucket. But as I mentioned, the all other bucket has -- it\u2019s a catch-all, right? It has what is comp, insurance, marketing, professional fees, bad debt as well as incentive management fees. This particular quarter, we have seen a significant decrease in the workers comp area as well as professional fees, which is sort of the lawyers and the accountants and consultants, that bucket. Nick Yulico : And so but the -- but, so that number -- I mean again, that number is down almost $5 million year-over-year. Is any of that -- is there any lower management fee that you\u2019re paying to operators there? I\u2019m just trying to understand if that -- because if that\u2019s the case, whether that\u2019s a onetime issue this year, does that benefit reverse next year? Shankh Mitra : There\u2019s lower incentive management fees there, because of an underperformance of a particular portfolio. If that portfolio bounces back, we\u2019ll be more than happy to pay a higher incentive management fee. Nick Yulico : And what\u2019s the dollar amount of the lower incentive fee? Shankh Mitra : This is a -- Nick, as you can imagine, this is -- obviously, I don\u2019t want to talk about any specific operator or any specific relationship, but it is not significant relative to rest of the expenses. Nick Yulico : Yes, I\u2019m not asking about any operator. I\u2019m just trying to figure out if it\u2019s a onetime benefit this year to your same-store expenses. It\u2019d be helpful to know what the level is. Shankh Mitra : Yes, I totally understand the question. The way to think about it, it could be onetime event, if the topline from -- how the operator is performing comes back. If it doesn\u2019t come back, it will be a recurring event. We\u2019ll much rather have this specific operator perform, so that we don\u2019t have to lower that number. Tom DeRosa : So in other words, if it comes out, it\u2019s a good outcome. And if it stays in, you can see that it\u2019s -- will be relatively consistent in, in there again. But we\u2019re not talking about a big number. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Maybe this first question is for John Goodey. You\u2019ve commented previously about Canadian senior housing supply kind of trailing the U.S. I was just hoping you could help us frame that as a percentage of inventory. What is the supply? When do you expect that to peak? And does that make \u201818 growth maybe more challenging? John Goodey : Yes. So I think it\u2019s fair to say that there is new building going on in Canada. We\u2019re responsible for some of it with our partners. This is a good thing. And what you do see, though, is a very much market-by-market segment outcome for new-build versus existing supply. Unfortunately in Canada, we do not have the equivalent of a NIC, so we don\u2019t have a very reliable -- near enough real-time basic gathering points where we can show all the trends and talk about it the way we do in our supplement for the U.S. What I can tell you is, it feels imbalanced. So when you look at the historical data of gross demand and gross new supply, it looks to be roughly imbalanced. So you end up a little bit with aligning with our strategy that the core urban market seems to be undersupplied and new builds there seems to be slow relative to demand growth, which is again where we\u2019re focusing our capacities in places like Toronto and Vancouver and others. And in the easier to build, suburban markets or country markets, you\u2019re seeing people a bit like with the U.S., building more supply. Again, we are more concentrated in the urban and suburban market, so we\u2019re a little bit less exposed, we believe, than the average of the industry. But again, unfortunately, we don\u2019t have the equivalent of NIC in Canada to give you the deep data analysis that we do here in the U.S. Shankh Mitra : And Juan, if you think about overall year-to-date performance, I mean U.S. and Canada is actually not that much different. On a NOI perspective, Canada is slightly better NOI, but U.S. is better in terms of revenues. So if your question is, when will supply impact Canadian numbers? I will say it is impacting, as we speak. So I don\u2019t assume there will be sort of disproportionate impact next year or the year after. There is some supply in Canada, like you have seen in everywhere else, and that\u2019s sort of flowing through our numbers. John Goodey : Yes, and it is market-by-market. Calgary is quite tough right now, as an example, because of new supply. But Vancouver, Qu\u00e9bec, British Columbia, Ontario, these are mostly in pretty good shape. So it is a market-by-market. Again, it comes back to -- we strongly believe the demand -- there is great demand in the core urban markets. That\u2019s where we\u2019re concentrating our new-build activities, like we are with Chartwell in The Sumach in Regent Park in Canada, and so that\u2019s, again, going to be core to our strategy, where we deploy new capital for new builds, it\u2019ll be in these core urban markets. Juan Sanabria : That\u2019s helpful. And then, I was just hoping you could speak to, again, on the seniors housing on the RIDEA side for the U.S. What you guys are seeing from a leasing perspective on the increases to in-place versus the new leases? And how we should be thinking about that? Brookdale talked about declines year-over-year on new lease rates. If you can give us a sense of how did you -- your U.S. portfolio, that difference is between new and renewals? Shankh Mitra : I think as we mentioned to you last quarter as well, we actually don\u2019t see a huge difference between sort of the new lease as well as the renewals. Remember, like half of our portfolio tons of news on January 1, and rest of the portfolio sort of goes through the year as you have the anniversary. We don\u2019t see a huge difference. It depends on, obviously, market, but on average, we don\u2019t see a huge difference. Juan Sanabria : The rent bumps to your existing is equal to what the increase you get on new versus the old? Shankh Mitra : Relatively the same. It\u2019s a very large portfolio in different markets. Some markets, you see -- the markets that you have weakness, I mean you see the reverse, right? I mean you see weakness in the U.S. and then as well as in New England, you see that. In markets where you have strong demand, such as Southern California, you see just the opposite. But when you blend that -- all that in, in your huge portfolio of 423 properties that Tom talked about, you see relatively the same. John Goodey : When you think about the math of this, the average length of stay means that residents only on average see a couple of increases in their stay. So it\u2019s not that you have a very long cycle of resident increases with in-place, and then a different rate -- a significantly different rate in the new leases because of the dynamic of the numbers -- the number of resident occupancy turnover dynamics. It\u2019s not a, as Shankh said, often the market\u2019s maybe a small fraction difference, but it\u2019s very hard to see them be dramatically different. Juan Sanabria : Great. And just one last quick one for me. Vintage will be added, I think, in the same-store numbers next year. Do you see that additive to the growth of the overall pool? Or not necessarily? Shankh Mitra : Vintage will be added to the pool in fourth quarter actually. And that will take -- that will not be additive to the growth, at least in the fourth quarter. Actually, it\u2019ll be 10 basis points hit to the overall growth for all the new assets we\u2019re adding to the pool, not specifically talking about Vintage. We\u2019re yet to give you -- we\u2019re yet to do the budget on next year, so I\u2019m not going to talk about \u201818, but I just wanted to give you a sense of what\u2019s going on. Juan Sanabria : Can you give us a sense of where that occupancy for the portfolio is? Shankh Mitra : I don\u2019t have it with me right now. I can follow it up with you. Mercedes Kerr : Juan, keep in mind that the -- I think we made this remark when we first made the investment. This is about a lot of opportunity. We saw an opportunity by way of switching the operator, and we brought in three operators that we feel very good about, in particularly in the markets where we put them in. And then we also talk value added opportunities from the repositioning of the assets which require some CapEx work and so on. So what we\u2019re doing right now is actually undertaking that kind of execution and everything is working as we had planned. CapEx is on the way, and so on. There was an element of restaffing that needed to happen and things of that nature. But we always knew that this was going to be a portfolio that we saw tremendous value in but we needed to actually create that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : My question is really is around the SHO portfolio. Again, in the past 12 to 18 months, you\u2019ve really seen some very strong rent growth, not just in your portfolio but for some of your peers. Just trying to understand when you take a look at your residents -- again, many of them are well retired. A lot of them are on fixed income. How is it that you still kind of have this ability to push rent as hard as you have without really impacting occupancy that much? Shankh Mitra : So Tayo, I would characterize it, of course, a little bit differently. We are seeing the impact on occupancy, right? Occupancy is down 170 basis point. So it is a question of optimizing rates versus occupancy. It is a need-driven business. As you know, that there\u2019s a huge part of our senior housing operating portfolio is the living memory care. It\u2019s a need-driven business. We\u2019re eyeing markets where we are usually the best provider of care with the highest reputation, and people are willing to pay for what they consider the best quality care for their parents or their grandparents. And does that mean that everybody is willing to pay? No. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the occupancy decline. So we\u2019re confident that, you know, the -- it\u2019s a game of optimizing rate as well as occupancy. We\u2019re trying to maximize revenue, and if we come to a point where we feel we get more traction by getting more occupancy and attractive terms rate, we\u2019ll do that. But this is a -- as we know, we run a SHO which is fundamentally driven by data analytics and numbers, and we\u2019re trying to optimize and maximize our revenue, not one part of the revenue. So we\u2019ll see what market gives us next year. Justin Skiver : And Tayo, this is Justin Skiver. I\u2019d just like to add to that, that you have to remember that the average length of stay in these building is 18 to 24 months. So it\u2019s not as though these people are getting increases upon increases for 5 to 10 years. It\u2019s a set amount of time. Then new residents are turning over. Tom DeRosa : Tayo, and also -- let me just add to that. A point that I started the call out with. We have 423 properties in that portfolio. You should line up other portfolios to have -- to better understand the numbers that are being reported. We have a large sample that\u2019s very consistent. And I think that is important when you want to understand what\u2019s happening in the industry. Tayo Okusanya : Okay. Are you finding when you\u2019re qualifying residents to live in your facilities that their children or other dependents are having to kind of contribute more towards the payments now? Shankh Mitra : I don\u2019t think that has changed. I mean when you think about -- I think you said that they live mostly on fixed income. The fact of the matter is, our communities are in extremely well, sort of, wealth locations, if you will. Obviously, they have fixed income, but they also have significant wealth in terms of asset. So we haven\u2019t really seen or heard about much changes. Mercedes Kerr : Tayo, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the report that we commissioned not long ago about aging in cities. It corroborates a lot of our strategy, the reason why we focus on these urban centers is that what is attracting, engaging population at double-digit rates into this core centers. That alone, the demand and the desirability, for all the reasons that we found out in our survey, are the reasons why our pricing is more consistent. That\u2019s why people really feel like there\u2019s a value proposition that they\u2019re willing to pay for, and so we don\u2019t have that sort of slippage that maybe you hear others talking about on rate or having to lock rates for life or whatever other people might have to do. John Goodey : I think, Tayo, the only thing I would say is, if you look at Page number 8 of our supplement, where we talk about quality indicators, we tried to give you -- obviously, we have a much larger demographic scorecard than this, that we run our analytics off of as we invest our capital. As you can see there, generally we\u2019re trying to go for areas where there is significantly more wealth than average for the country, and that means wealth of income, because if you do need support from the children, then the wealth is there. Or capital wealth that someone will have accumulated primarily through their primary residence, that they\u2019ll invariably be monetizing as they come into this environment of senior care. So it\u2019s again, generally, for the most part, we\u2019re sighting our capital into high wealth, high-income locations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : First, I just wanted to clarify, the rent abatement that Genesis will receive at close will be 25 million or 30 million? I\u2019m sorry. Shankh Mitra : $35 million. Jordan Sadler : 35 million, okay. Plus there\u2019ll be a reduction in the existing escalators, correct? Shankh Mitra : Yes. Just like you have seen in the $1.7 billion total transaction we have done, it went down from 2.9% to 2%, and we\u2019ll just replicate that structure. Jordan Sadler : That\u2019s perfect. And then on transaction activity, so you\u2019ve laid out the dispositions here plus, obviously, there is some incremental potential dispositions if they\u2019re to close from Genesis. I\u2019m trying to think about, as we look forward, how we should be thinking about your leverage, which remains very low, and whether or not these dispositions will be offset by incremental investment or if we should just expect leverage to head further south? John Goodey : Yes, thanks. This is John. I\u2019ll take that one. So you\u2019re right, we have very significantly strengthened our balance sheet, nearly 0.5 turn deleveraged over last year or so. Look, we continually look at our capital structure to refine that, to provide shareholder value and to remain well capitalized to take advantage of, I say in my script, of acquisitions or new developments. And you\u2019re right, I mean we will look to redeploy capital, clearly, to drive our earnings growth as we dispose off of assets and realize that capital. I think we\u2019re very comfortable in the sort of ZIP Code where we are right now, and we\u2019ll navigate around that sort of area going forward. So no significant sort of major changes, but we would say that we\u2019ll look to redeploy the majority of the funds that we do see coming in through the dispositions that we have ongoing. Jordan Sadler : And is it safe to say at this point that new investments will continue to be pretty focused around seniors housing and senior housing operating, in particular? Or are there -- or you\u2019re seeing opportunities that are of greater interest in the other segments? Tom DeRosa : What we\u2019re seeing opportunities in both the senior housing space as well as in the outpatient medical space. So we\u2019re -- right now, we seem to have a fairly robust pipeline of opportunities to evaluate in both sectors. Jordan Sadler : And what is your appetite for the outpatient medical business in the 5% or mid-5% cap rate range? Tom DeRosa : We are interested in assets if they are strategic, which means either that they are assets that are associated with health systems that are in markets that are strategic for us or there\u2019s ability for us to bring our very experienced outpatient medical management processes to these assets to create upside. So that\u2019s how we look. We\u2019re not just looking to grow that outpatient medical portfolio by acquiring low cap rate assets where there\u2019s no upside or strategic value for us. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve not seen us participate in a number of the auctions to date. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Fleming with SunTrust. Eric Fleming : I wanted to follow-up actually on that medical office comment you just made. So in terms of talking about your strategic markets there, is that -- you\u2019re going to -- kind of what you\u2019ve hinted at with the Johns Hopkins relationship, where -- is there -- is it more looking to add medical office into areas where you already have senior housing and post-acute facilities that you can leverage across those operating sites? Tom DeRosa : That is -- you get our strategy. Our strategy is built around major metro markets where we have senior housing assets, and that is where we will likely see -- you\u2019ll likely see us try and accumulate outpatient medical assets. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Michael Knott with Green Street Advisors. Michael Knott : Is the eventual migration that was talked about earlier from triple net senior housing to RIDEA, is that going to be more of an opportunistic endeavor that will still take quite a long time? Or is there something a little bit more systemic or something that happens more quickly on that front? Shankh Mitra : It is going to be opportunistic, and it will be dependent on one asset at a time. So I don\u2019t want you guys to take away from this call that we are looking to convert our triple net senior housing portfolio into RIDEA. It depends on, as we describe, at least in the Sagora transaction, we found a subpool of assets that we think have tremendous growth opportunity going forward because of the submarket they\u2019re in. And as John said, if we think that the assets will grow with the market, they\u2019re likely to be in triple net portfolio. If they are -- we\u2019ll get market-plus growth, they\u2019re likely to be in a RIDEA portfolio. But there is no effort inside our company to convert all the leases to RIDEA going forward. Asset by asset, operator by operator, market by market. Tom DeRosa : When it makes sense. Shankh Mitra : When it makes sense. Michael Knott : Right, okay. And then last one from me. Are you willing to give any guidance on where your skilled nursing, post-acute, NOI percentage of the portfolio will land after these planned dispositions? Shankh Mitra : Stay tuned. As I said, I hope that we\u2019ll have a very robust conversation about this topic soon. But as you can appreciate, Michael, it\u2019s hard to comment on live transactions. Michael Knott : Sure, okay. And then, maybe that same comment will apply to this one, but do you plan or expect that there\u2019ll be further SNF dispositions later in \u201818 after this current round is finalized? Shankh Mitra : So we -- as Tom mentioned, we\u2019re very focused on asset management and focused on optimizing our portfolios. A portfolio of this size will always have disposition, but we believe that if we can get to sort of the level that we are trying to get at with different asset class, different product types, different operators, we\u2019ll probably hit more of a stabilized in our portfolio soon, and from there, it\u2019s opportunistic going forward. Operator : Thank you for dialing in to the Welltower earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation and ask that you disconnect.",

My name is Nicole, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer-session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President, Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, sir. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Nicole. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 results and outlook for 2018. Following my brief introduction, you will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Mercedes Kerr, EVP, Business and Relationship Management; Shankh Mitra, SVP, Investments; and John Goodey, EVP, CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although, Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance those projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning\u2019s press release, and from time to time in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release this morning, you may access it via the Company\u2019s website at welltower.com. Before handing the call over to Tom, I want to highlight a few significant points regarding our 2017 results. One, we realized full year total portfolio average same-store growth of 2.7%, at the high end of our original guidance, driven again by the consistent outperformance of our senior housing operating portfolio. Two, we continue to opportunistically take advantage of favorable capital markets through disposing of 1.5 billion of non-core assets and raising over 600 million through our DRIP and ATN programs at an average stock price just above $71 per share. And three, we have redeployed that capital in a very disciplined manner, extinguishing 1.4 billion of high coupon debt in preferred securities and recycling 1.2 billion into high quality acquisitions and developments, finishing the year with a well capitalized balance sheet and a 94.2% private pay mix. And with that, I will hand the call over to Tom for his remarks on the year and the quarter. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Tim. In the most challenging environment we have seen for weeks in a number of years, I am pleased to report Q4 2017 financial results, our outlook for 2018 and some important strategic initiatives that all speak to our optimism about the power of the Welltower platform. We run this business to be the most effective global capital and operating partner to the broad healthcare delivery landscape including senior housing and have not been afraid to make bold decisions regarding people, capital deployment, asset mix and operator alignment to ensure our ability to drive our strategy and deliver shareholder value for years to come. Here are some highlights. Despite headlines of oversupply and flu, our seniors housing operating portfolio continued to deliver solid growth throughout 2017 and the outlook for 2018 remains positive. We delivered on our strategy of tying major health systems to our business platform as is evidenced by our Mission Viejo JV with Providence St. Joseph's, the third largest health system in the U.S. and Simon Properties, the world's most prominent mall owner. We announced 1.2 billion of gross investments for 2017 and by month end we will have closed on a 0.5 billion of accretive new investments in 2018. We negotiated a successful restructuring of Genesis Healthcare that has significantly enhanced the credit quality and sustainability of the Genesis business model. I am sure you are all waiting to hear more about that from our friend, Shankh. Now, Mercedes Kerr will give you an overview of new operator relationships, new relationship investments in Q4, and her view on how we expect to grow in 2018. Mercedes? Mercedes Kerr : Thank you, Tom. As detailed in our earnings release, we completed $334 million of growth investments in the fourth quarter of 2017 in the form of acquisitions, development funding, and loans at a combined average yield of 6.6%. For the whole year of 2017, our investments totaled $1.2 billion and had a combined average yield of 6.9%. Consistent with prior period more than two-thirds of our investments in the fourth quarter were completed on an off-market basis and 80% of the transactions completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 or repeat business. Our focus on off-market relationship based transactions is possible because we have purposefully assembled a roster of best-in-class partner with scalable business model. Our unique operator alignment features incentivize us to grow together, so our partners often help us to find off-market opportunities themselves. This was true into fourth quarter when we expanded our relationships with new perspective, Sagora Senior Living, Florida Medical Clinic and Ascension. As well as our recently announced acquisitions with Sunrise Senior Living where we are buying four rental CCRC communities for $368 million at an above market yield of 7%. These project returns are especially noteworthy given the highly desirable markets where these properties are located such as Washington DC and Miami. I should add a note of congratulations to Chris Winkle and the rest of the team at Sunrise Senior Living which was recently ranked the highest in customer satisfaction among Senior Living communities in J.D. Power's first ever Senior Living satisfaction survey. It's great to see them recognized for their hard work. Every year we selectively identify new operators and healthcare providers to bring into our fold. In the fourth quarter, we were proud to introduce Summit Medical Group to our portfolio. This is the oldest and largest physician-owned multispecialty medical practice in New Jersey. We also announced a new collaboration with Mission Hospital, part of the Providence St. Joseph health system, a formidable and progressive healthcare provider. Our project together at The Shops at Mission Viejo speaks to the evolution of delivery of care model and how Welltower and premier health systems can partner to bring state-of-the-art infrastructure solutions to the market. Since the start of 2018, we also expanded our relationship with Cogir Management Corporation by bringing them into our partnership pool. We are extremely pleased to have created a joint venture vehicle with this important next generation Canadian operator and look forward to working with Mathieu Duguay and his team in this new construct. I want to take a moment to speak about the flu, which can impact senior housing revenues and expenses through a voluntary and mandatory additions spend, higher than average move outs due to illness or death and also with higher cost anytime that caregivers are temporarily replaced by agency labor when they are sick. We monitor these trends closely and we know of individual cases where flu has impacted our communities. This year's flu season has been the subject of headlines due to its severity and wide spread nature and its mostly in report, the CDC is calculating a 130% increase thus far this season in outpatient visits related to influenza-related illnesses for individual 65 and over in the United States when compared to last year, and a 92% increase when compared to the difficult 2014, 2015 period. The season is not over, so it's hard for us quantify the precise impact of the flu at this time. Having said this, we\u2019re satisfied with the work our operating partners are doing to care for their residents and staff and also to minimize the financial impact the flu may have on our communities. Finally a quick comment about Brookdale Senior Living's announcement this morning, we hope that their decision to end their strategic review process which has been the focus of much of management attention for a protracted period, will now allow them to get back to the basics. That we\u2019ve said before, we're satisfied with our portfolio holdings with Brookdale and we will continue to collaborate with them going forward just as we have before. With that, I will turn the call over to Shankh Mitra. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Mercedes, good morning everyone. I will review our quarterly operating results reflect on our full year 2017 operating performance relative to our initial expectations and provide you with our preliminary assessment of 2018 operating environment with a specific focus on our SHO portfolio. Our same-store portfolio grew 2.1% in fourth quarter bringing the total average same-store NOI growth to 2.7% for 2017 towards the high end of our initial expectation of 2% to 3%. Our senior housing operating portfolio grew 1.5% in fourth quarter, which was below our expectation for the quarter. Late quarter occupancy declined due to flu, contributed to this performance. This has tempered our outlook for 2018, despite that we believe will have a year of positive same-store NOI growth in that business representing a significant relative outperformance due our best-in-class assets and affluent markets run by premier operators. Specifically our 2018 outlook for SHO portfolio is flat to 1.5%. As you know actual results will be driven by a combination of rate growth, occupancy and expense growth. Low 3% rate growth, 50 to 100 basis points of occupancy decline and a 3% to 4% expense growth built to our same-store NOI growth expectation. We set our initial expectation of 1.5% to 3% growth in SHO portfolio for 2017 and achieved 2.5%, however, this was done through a different combination of rate, occupancy and expense good then we thought. Rates were better, occupancy was lower so were expenses. In addition to our operator focus relationship strategy, our heavy investment in data and analytics capabilities are starting to bare fruit. We\u2019ve outperformed in the up cycle and was continued to outperform in the more mature part of the cycle. We\u2019re confident that this superior relative and absolute performance over the entire cycle every year on a consistent basis was ultimately a result in significant differentiation in cost of capital at some point in time. Another important update for the quarter is regarding Genesis, as we started this journey our focus was to maximize shareholder value on our total capital committed to Genesis. Since we last spoke to you in November, we are continued to be encouraged by the relative stabilization of cash flow in our retained portfolio. Additionally important changes have taken place in this relationship. As Genesis announced last night, they have come to a restructuring agreement in which all of the credit parties have come together to recap Genesis' balance sheet and put the Company in a position of strength. A key element of this structure is an injection of $555 million of fresh capital into the Company by Midcap Financial Trust, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Apollo Global Management, a strong vote of confidence in Genesis and the industry. This recapitalization is a critical step in Genesis' previously announced broader effort, which is expected to result in 80 million to 100 million of annual fixed charge improvement through the combined effort of the multiple credit parties. Our main contribution to this restructuring is a reduction of $35 million of annual cash rent as I mentioned in the last call. However, we also negotiated a five year lease extension and an option to reset the rent to after five years to recoup that $35 million. Genesis also committed to payback $105 million of loans by April 1st. So, so far we have sold $1.9 billion of Genesis loans and real estate with a realized IRR of 10.3% and with today's restructuring Genesis is now 5.2% of in place NOI with a pro forma trailing 1.34 times of EBITDAR and 1.7 times EBITDARM coverage at the profit levels, with the corporate guarantees that is significantly stronger. As with any asset in our portfolio we retain the complete optionality with this high quality PowerBack heavy portfolio in the future. Since the $400 million Genesis purchase option expires in March of last year, we have been communicating multiple possible path of action while negotiating with the public tenant that has been in clear need of a recap for last two years. We have aim to keep our investor attuned to all possible outcomes while maintaining a public negotiation posture that ensure our optionality in order to maximize our shareholder value. We feel strongly that our approach with Genesis has substantially enhanced our flexibility and providing the highest value outcome for our shareholders while minimizing reliance on any one operator. Today we have a maturely strengthened corporate credit standing behind a well covered lease which is in the stark contrast of what you're seeing in the industry. A recapitalized Genesis refocus on its core market is forced to win market share, more broadly in context of shrinking supply and a pending demographic surge, demand for skilled nursing bids is projected to surplus inventory by 2025. While the $35 million income loss is not ideal though necessary in the short term, we will participate in this positive trend through our rent reset provision occurring in year five of the restructured master lease. We'd like to thank you our shareholders for supporting us in this transformation journey, as dispassionate capital allocators we change when facts change. It is important to summarize that we're noticing the following changes. Operating performance is stabilizing in our retained Genesis portfolio. Two, a material credit improvement as a result of Genesis recap has happened. Three, we feel a tectonic shift in the sentiment of smart investors towards us for secured space, all publically announced deals you have noticed the Humana, Welsh, Carson, TPG in case of Kindred and now MidCap forward in case of Genesis. We believe you'll see more. Number four, we preserve full optionality going forward. With that, I'll pass it over to John Goodey. John Goodey : Thank you, Shankh, and good morning everyone. It's my pleasure to provide you with the financial highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2017 and our guidance for 2018. Despite the challenging U.S. senior housing market conditions you have heard about from others, our portfolio delivered solid financial results for Q4 and in 2017 overall and we are positive on the prospects for 2018. Once again our superior portfolio, excellent operator relationships as well as the strength of the Welltower platform to allocate capital and asset manage have enabled us to outperform our peers. In addition, it is noteworthy that our 2017 financial results are being delivered in a year where we've also continued to refine our portfolio and lower our financial leverage. In 2017, we generated $1.5 billion of dispositions with a gain of $344 million realized and a realized IRR of 11.3% and further improved our balance sheet to be one of the lowest leverage in the REIT industry. These actions placed us in a strong financial position to pursue our strategic plan in 2018 and beyond. As detailed by Shankh, our show portfolio grew by 1.5% in Q4 2017, with seniors housing triple net and long term post acute both growing at 2.8% and outpatient medical growing at 2.0%. Overall same-store NOI growth was 2.1% in the quarter and averaged 2.7% for 2017 overall. This quarter's growth was augmented within quarter acquisitions and joint ventures of $223 million along with a $142 million of divestments and loan payoffs. They've enabled us to report a normalized Q4 2017 FFO result of a $1.02 per share. Overall, we delivered $4.21 of normalized FFO per share for 2017 in total. In addition to this quarter's joint ventures and acquisitions, we've completed $42 million of developments bringing full year deliveries across all operating segments to $548 million at a stabilized yield of approximately 7.3%. We're truly excited by the future earnings growth potential of these new state-of-the-art buildings. In Q4, we normalized a number of items including allowance for $63 million relating to a Genesis loan restructuring. We also normalized $58 million of non-controlling interest in unconsolidated equity impairment, the majority relating to write down to certain non-consolidated JV investments. In addition, we also normalized $60 million of other expenses and transaction cost, $41 million of which related to the donation of our Toledo headquarters and $18 million of which is a mark-to-market impairment against our Genesis public shareholding. Additionally, we normalized $17 million related to a deferred tax and valuation allowances including the impact of a Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Welltower continues to focus on our own corporate operational efficiency by further optimizing systems, processes, human capital and physical infrastructure. Our G&A for the quarter was $28.4 million a 13.5% reduction over Q4 2016. For 2017 overall, we reduced our G&A by nearly 21% compared to the year prior. We continue to implement further initiatives to improve our operations and efficiency in 2018. Our balance sheet remains in great shape and leads our peer group. We will continue to maintain balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. During the fourth quarter, we extinguished the $137 million of secured debt bringing our full year retirement of debt and preferred securities to $1.4 billion at a blended average rate of 5.4%. We ended 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $244 million and a $2.3 billion of available borrowing capacity under our line of credit. Our leverage metrics remain at or near historically low levels with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.4 times with a net debt to un-depreciated book capitalization ratio of 36.3%, and our adjusted fix charge cover ratio remains strong at 3.4 times. Based on announced 2018 acquisitions and planned dispositions for the year, we see year end 2018 leverage being in the low five times net debt to EBITDA area. Our debt maturity profile remains well controlled and we will opportunistically access bond markets in 2018 to further manage our profile. As we previously noted to you, our deep liquidity position affords us significant flexibility to pursue value enhancing acquisitions, development opportunities and to reinvesting in our portfolio to drive growth. I will conclude my remarks with our outlook for 2018. As noted in our earnings release, we have adjusted our overall same-store NOI and long-term post-acute growth outlooks for the impact of the $35 million Genesis Master Lease restructuring. Starting with same-store NOI, we expect average blended same-store NOI growth of approximately 1% to 2% in 2018, which is comprised of the following components. Senior housing operating approximately 0% to 1.5%, senior housing triple net approximately 2.5% to 3%, long term post-acute care approximately to 2% and 2.5% and outpatient medical approximately to 2% to 2.5%. We anticipate funding developments of approximately $297 million in 2018 relating to project underway as of December 31, 2017. And we expect development conversions during 2018 of approximately $413 million, which are currently expected to generate stabilized yields of approximately 8%. We\u2019ve incorporated approximately $1.3 billion of disposition proceeds at a blended yield of 7.2% in our 2018 guidance. This includes approximately $553 million of proceeds from dispositions previously expected to close in 2017 and $741 million of incremental proceeds from other potential loan payoffs and property sales. We also replaced the 2017 Genesis disposition placeholder of $400 million in proceeds with $225 million of expected dispositions and loan paying downs this year. This comprises of $120 million of non-core property sales, representing approximately 10% of our portfolio, which are in advanced negotiations stages and $105 million of expected loans payoffs tied to the Genesis restructuring recently announced. Moving to G&A expenses, we anticipate 2018 general, administrative expenses of approximately $130 million in 2018. This level remains significantly below our G&A spend for 2015 and 2016. Based on the above, the aforementioned Genesis restructuring and other items discussed, we anticipate 2018 normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share, with normalized net income in a range of $2.38 to $2.48 per diluted share. As usual, earnings guidance excludes any additional acquisitions beyond those which have been announced, but does include our planned dispositions. I am pleased to announce the Board of Directors approved the 2018 quarterly cash dividend at the maintained rate of $0.87 per share being $3.48 per share annually. As such on February 21, 2018 Welltower paid its 187th consecutive quarterly cash dividend, the current annual dividend represents the yield of approximately 6.4%. Based on our overall outlook for 2018, strong liquidity position and our high quality portfolio poised for growth through operational gains, accretive acquisitions and development pipeline delivery, we remain comfortable with our dividend at this level. With that, I'll hand back to Tom for his closing comments. Tom? Tom DeRosa : Thanks, John. When I became Chief Executive Officer, almost four years ago, it was the tailwind of a rapid asset accumulation period. I knew that was not sustainable nor was asset accumulation a viable long-term business strategy. Since then, we've taken advantage of strong asset pricing, and by year-end 2018, we will have sold nearly $5 billion in real estate at an IRR of 10.5%. While radically improving the overall asset quality, we also massively de-levered the balance sheet. You now know about the plans for Genesis. Three years ago we made the strategic decision not to abandon the post-acute sector. This is a critical component of the healthcare delivery continuum and we see a role for Welltower in reinventing how this sector operates and is capitalized. From here Genesis has a stronger capital structure and a refocused business strategy on its core markets, to effectively participate in value-based care. It feels like we're coming to the end of our asset optimization journey, and I believe both sides of the balance sheet are now positioned for growth. I want to thank the shareholders who have stood by us through this process. We benefit from a business construct based on an operating platform that is focused on delivering real estate settings that promote wellness and provide healthcare at lower costs than acute-care hospitals. This platform is built upon our unique alignment with the leading senior housing companies operating in major urban markets in the U.S., Canada and the UK and health systems like Providence St. Joseph's. I am also now proud to say that I work with the smartest, hardest working, most diverse and highest integrity team in this business. This team is now completely aligned around the objective of driving long-term shareholder value. On February 28th, we shared our old stock symbol for one that speaks to the strategy, W-E-L-L, now WELL will bring wellness to the attention of the global financial markets as well as Welltower. Now, Nicole, open up the line for questions please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Shankh or maybe Tom, just sort of stepping back on your last call, you talk about sort of providing a rent cut and simultaneously doing an asset sale, the size obviously was not known, but at least I took it as being a fairly large chunk of the portfolio. You sort of walked through some of the components of maybe what's changed, but maybe if you can elaborate what has changed between then and now, and more specifically on the outlook given, what you're seeing right now, should we expect potentially more dilution from any further asset sales on Genesis? Shankh Mitra : So, Vikram, I'll tell you the few things have changed, right. If you think about Genesis management has done an extraordinary job of bringing all its credit parties together, just not real estate owners, but all the credit parties together to get to a point of a sustainable capital structure, that's extremely important which we thought basically they're making progress. But they have really surprised us on the positive side for bringing $550 million -- $5 million of fresh capital into the business. So, that's something financially puts the Company in a position of strength going forward. But more importantly for our retained portfolio as you can see our portfolio now is obviously is a much smaller portfolio that is much more focused, it\u2019s PowerBack heavy and we see for us a long time as I mentioned and stabilization of cash flow in that portfolio. So that's one of the other things have changed. So operating performance has changed, credit quality has changed. Now as you can imagine that as capital allocators we look at every asset in our portfolio on sale, right. So, we're looking at this asset quality that we owned, we know the coverage we know what the operating -- really the operating outlook for those buildings and we're thinking at these prices is a buy, is it a hold, is it a sell. And I don't know the answer to that question like every asset that Genesis assets are also for sale at the right price. We retain complete flexibility and are slightly going forward. I'm not going to tell you that we'll not sell further I'm not also going to tell you so those assets will not be sold. So that sort of the messaging is we change when information change when facts change. And Genesis today is drastically a different operator that it was 90 days ago. Tom DeRosa : And Vik, let me add to that that we always look to enhance optionality in terms of how we manage this business and the strongest statement I can make to you is because Genesis is a dramatically stronger credit based on this restructuring going forward it means that Welltower is a stronger credit going forward. Vikram Malhotra : Got it and just to clarify that I think you alluded to the fact that you're now in a position to sort of grow cash flow, grow earnings. Would it be safe to say that assuming there are not too many changes from here on and you keep things intact? Would you be in a position actually grow cash flow AFFO and see very little dilution, if any from Genesis? Tom DeRosa : We hope so Vik, that\u2019s how we run the business. Shankh Mitra : Vik, as Tom said, like we like we\u2019re at the towards the end of that journey, whether we\u2019re in the seventh inning or eight inning, I can't tell you that, but definitely as everybody else seems to starting that journey which feel like we\u2019re at the very end of that journey. We always looked to asset manage our portfolio. There will always be something for sell, but we feel confident with our balance sheet and with hopefully where we're in the cycle that we will be able to deploy capital as you've heard from Mercedes and Tom. Tom DeRosa : So, I\u2019ll emphasize the fact that we made a number of tough decisions when the wind was at our back. We\u2019ve never felt the wind less at our back then we do right now. And I'm very glad and you should be glad, we did take those tough decisions when we did them because this is not the time to be starting that. So I want to emphasize, we do believe we're kind towards the tail end of this journey, and we're -- that is what speaks to the optimism that you've heard from everyone here on this call today about the future. We\u2019re very optimistic about the role that Welltower will play in fixing healthcare delivery. And if you red line certain sectors of the healthcare space or at least the non-hospital healthcare space, you reduced your ability to participate in this change which we believe will drive significant shareholders value in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JP Morgan. Michael Mueller : Couple of questions, so on the same-store NOI growth, if you would go in and I guess not adjusted for the 35 million ramp reduction. What\u2019s the post-acute same-store number and the overall same-store growth? Tom DeRosa : So that was the question, if we've adjusted -- not adjusted, if we just as per the January 1 rent cut rate, I think it's at the midpoint it's minus a 12.25%. Shankh Mitra : And for the total portfolio Mike it's positive 0.5% to negative 0.5% midpoint of flat year-over-year. Michael Mueller : And then, you talked about the pro forma Genesis coverages. What where the coverages beforehand? So how much improvement is there with all the transaction that had been announced? Shankh Mitra : If you look at our coverage, we will give you a range. And if you look at the range and the sub, which you will see that it was close to one. And it's very important question Mike, because if you think about the history of rent cut in this sort of rent free profile in this sector, you will see that majority of the times, the landlords have taken the tenant back to sort of one coverage, did not give them flexibility investment in the business, did not give them flexibility to actually grow their business. And that's why they went back to where they started, right. So we absolutely did not want to do that. As Tom said, we\u2019re never afraid to take bold decision. This was needed and it happened. So, we feel like going forward that you can feel a very significant assurance that we have taken where we didn't kick the can down the road. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : So, today's news doesn't sound exactly like you're recommitting to the skilled nursing business or to Genesis per se, but it does sound at the margin that you are willing to hold today rather than be a seller at an excessive discount. I am wondering; one, if it's a fair characterization; and then two, would you be willing to invest in incrementally in Genesis beyond the incremental term loan piece you are lending? Shankh Mitra : Jordan, if you think about a triple net lease is a credit, right. So, with our credit significantly improved at the property level from a coverage perspective, as I also said the most important thing is the, EBITDARM coverage of above 1.7, and remember, management fee subordinate to the rent payment, right, and it is guaranteed by the corporate. So at every level you look at it, the three levels of stratification is materially improved. So, I want to reemphasize that point, and I also want to reemphasize the point the rent reset that I talked about. So, if you look at the demographics and negative supply, if you believe in the demographics and you believe that nothing is going to change from a utilization perspective, there's going to be crisscross of demand and supply, not too -- in a not too distant future. And we'll be able to recoup that $35 million of rent as I said. Will we invest in Genesis going forward? We are, already are. If you look at, we have a PowerBack development, that's in progress and we believe in that model, so if there're other opportunities to invest in that PowerBack hub and spoke model that Genesis drives its business from, we'd be happy to do that, that's no change from what we have done. Tom DeRosa : Jordan, you've heard me say consistently that we are not going to abandon this sector. Why do I say that because when you interact with the leaders of healthcare in this country, which are the CEOs that run the major regional health systems, they all say, they need a viable post-acute care option. The problems that the REIT sector has been dealing with were capital structures that were not sustainable given some of the changes that occurred in reimbursement. And as Shankh said and I say a lot, you can continue to kick the can down the road, until you just keep kicking the can at the wall and it keeps coming back at you. What we've announced last night and what we've -- are talking to about this morning is a fix that needed to happen years ago, but the industry kicked the can down the road. We have fixed the Genesis' capital structure, not just Welltower, it was every one of their capital partners, and we brought in a new capital partner. I think that says something about the future of Genesis, so we are in the business of maintaining and enhancing optionality. Optionality for where we deploy capital in the best interest of our shareholders. And so, nothing has changed, you've heard me say this, consistently, and I took a lot of stones and arrows for saying it. But I think our strategy will prove out to have been in the best interest of our shareholders. Jordan Sadler : Yes, no that's consistent I think with the messaging you've relayed over time. So my follow-up is really on Genesis again, I don't know if this is for John, but specifically as it relates to guidance. What is the total loan forgiveness that you either recognized in 4Q and that you expect to recognize in '18 of the $400 million plus or so that you've got to Genesis, you had to Genesis? And then what's the embedded total interest income that's in the $4 FFO guide? Shankh Mitra : Jordan, I'll answer the first part of the question, the answer is zero. We have not forgiven loans. We have reserved against those loans. So there is a significant difference in that and that you know and two hidden in your question is, something that I saw a lot of confusion about, if you go back and look at our financials for the last two quarters and see what we said our entire Genesis loan book was in payment in kind, we gave them as they were doing the whole restructuring for last few months. We did not go through a part cash, part payment today. We went from a complete pick to a part cash tactic payment today. And with that, I will pass it over to John. John Goodey : And so I think on the penny front, Tim's got the answer for you on the actual pennies recognized in FFO from Genesis loan. Tim McHugh : So part of that answer is and this is important to know this on a few notes this morning, we are just recognizing cash interest on Genesis in 2018. So in our FFO guidance, this morning is just the cash and as noted in both Genesis' release and that's prior to this, there was no -- these loans picked from 11/15 to the November 15th of last year through February 15th of this year. So if you look at the full year of 2018 important to note from January 1st to February 15th it was all pick and we did not recognize that through FFO. That's roughly a penny on a cash basis income that if you went full year for recognition we would have recognized and then for the rest of the year the pick component represents about five pennies that we have not recognizing through FFO. What we are recognizing is about $20 million of interest income in our 2018 numbers. Jordan Sadler : Okay so on the forgiveness piece, did -- I guess I'm confused because I'm reading the piece about the bridge loans, the 275, they have you want them to repay no less Genesis can do to make progress they've to pay no less than a $105 million of obligations. What happens to the 170? Tim McHugh : As part of the announced restructuring for both Genesis and ourselves this morning is a commitment based upon contingency of having a financing partner step up in that $105 million of refinancing. The remaining piece is assumed to be outstanding for the rest of 2018. That 170 will be current cash paying, it is current cash paying right now because after February 15th, it went back to cash paying. And the assumption in our model is that $105 million is paid back around midyear and the remaining piece of that real estate loan and the term loan remain outstanding for all 2018 and are cash paying. John Goodey : I don't think I'll just reiterate, Jordan, what Shankh said. We have not forgiven them loans we have taken a reserve again because some of this is collateralized that we have to test the collaterals that's underneath the orders as you can imagine make us do that. And that was the reserve that we have to take relates to the collateral, not to a write down of the loan, but Genesis will therefore be forgiven. So, there is big difference to Shankh that we've not forgiven the 60 million write down. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One Securities. Daniel Bernstein : I just want to make sure I understand the 5.2% exposure to Genesis, is that including further loan pay downs or just where it is today? Tim McHugh : The 5.2% is, so the way that we calculate our employees NOI is off of just our property NOI, so if you think about as of the end of the fourth quarter, what's currently in our supplement, pre rent cut is a 7% exposure to Genesis. The 5.2% is pro forma for the rent cut. So it's just\u2026 Shankh Mitra : As well as the asset itself. Tim McHugh : Yes as well as the health for sales assets as 12/31 that 5.2% is essentially as our pro forma NOI exposure to Genesis after rent cut and asset sales. Daniel Bernstein : You see if the change in view in Genesis so much the improvement of credit, but also the improvements at the property level, I think you mentioned that a little bit in your comment. So just want to understand a little bit of better. What's changing at the property level or operational level or Genesis, that makes you a lot more confident in the company there in your assets? Shankh Mitra : If you look at again I want to emphasize the fact in our retained portfolio. There is a portfolio that and obviously we're selling now that is transitioning out of Genesis an operator, Genesis has sold and in process of selling lot of none core space. It is important to understand they are refocusing on the core markets, core markets where Genesis always has done very well. In our retained portfolio, which is as I said is very power back heavy we\u2019re seeing cash flow stabilization after long-term and we believe that if you think about how this plays out that we will be able to grow cash flow in the future. So that\u2019s one of the points and credit is obviously very self explanatory if you can look at the coverage and you look at the EBITDA coverage and EBITDA coverage, that significantly improve above market coverage and the corporate guarantee is extremely important here, which is today with the Genesis -- if we look at the Genesis debt to EBITDA got almost that in half, that definitely an improvement in the credit. So that\u2019s where why feel optimistic again that sound say we can all of our optionality as in any part of our portfolio. Daniel Bernstein : And just real quickly on the demographics, I mean that you talked about in skilled nursing, it sounds like you would apply to seniors housing. Last quarter, you talked about may be looking for opportunities to move some more triple net, leases perhaps RIDEA is that still something you\u2019re thinking about working on? Mercedes Kerr : This is Mercedes. Hi, we look at that obviously just selectively with our operators, I mean there is a lot of things that we might take into consideration as you know, we like to invest in RIDEA when we think that there is a lot more opportunity for upside then downside risk. And so yes, from time to time there might be portfolios that we're seasoning and the triple net structure that might actually become candidate for a conversion to a partnership and we don\u2019t have anything to talk about right now but that something that we obviously look at all the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : My first question is around your same-store NOI outlook for the Shop portfolio. You guys do have an outlook that is positive, your peers have outlook that are generally negative. I am just curious, if we just talk a little bit about why your outlook is much more bullish than theirs? Shankh Mitra : So, Tayo, I mean it's a very good question. I would like you to look at our performance relative to or peers, every year for last seven plus years that we've been in the RIDEA business. That will give you the answer, but it is really -- it speaks to the quality of the portfolio and the operators and micro markets. So, you know, we have invested -- so if you think about how this industry has evolved, if you are mostly triple net investors, right, I mean you are investing in credit, investing in RIDEA invested in real estate equity that requires a different type of skill set. And we're the ones who have invested in technology, in people, in data analytics and asset management. So, you've seen the impact of that pretty much every year probably every quarter and that outperformance should not be surprising, but we're obviously as I said that if you look at over a period of time we hope that will give a better cost of capital, that hasn't happened yet but hopefully people will accept that we have a much better quality portfolio. Mercedes Kerr : And I do have to add that it also has a lot to do with the operators that we have partnered with, so it's a combination of great locations, a high barrier to entry markets, asset quality, but it's also of course having to do with the operators that are in the trenches and that are also willing to collaborate with us and the initiatives that we are trying to source for their benefit and for the benefit of the residents who live with them. Tom DeRosa : A lot of it comes from not being a passive owner of senior housing real estate. We see ourselves truly as an operating partner, and that drives better results. Tayo Okusanya : And then just to confirm with Genesis it's as a result of the recapitalization plan that these zones are now casting rather than the status that we're at back in November, correct? Tom DeRosa : Correct. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Rich Anderson : If I could step back to November, December timeframe, could you describe what was going on there? Did you kind of have some sort of clairvoyant moment where heck, we better keep the Genesis assets and that's what rolled up to where we are today? Or did you -- was it, you kind of backed into the situation where you weren't getting the pricing you wanted, you weren't feeling like the rent cut in asset sales were going to protect your dead investments, and so the market worked against you and now you're kind of like woo, I'm glad we didn't sell at that time because of all everything you're saying on this call. I am curious the chain of events that got you to this point, was it luck or skill? Shankh Mitra : Probably a combination of both; if you look at what happened is it we always said that you know you think about what we're doing, right, effectively Genesis management as I said pulled off an out of code restructuring with all its credit parties that you never know that will actually be able to get to the finish point, right, finish line. Second, we absolutely did not think they'll be able to get fresh capital of the size that they did from the entity that they did. So there's one point you know, you are always interested, Rich, as an observer as a long term observer of the industry, how the tea leaves are changing. I would like you to see what happens in that time frame with Kindred and Humana, Welsh, Carson. You can see today what happened with you know obviously fresh injection of capital, I can talk about a lot of other things because they're non public in nature but things that are happening in the industry, so going back to way specifically to your question do we have the ability to do a transaction, absolutely. Did you get the price that we wanted, absolutely? Is that counter party still around for us to do a deal? The answer is absolutely. So the question is today as we are thinking about it at 134 coverage with a company that has leverage has been cut in half right, from the 7 to 3 is this group of assets we have culled a part of the portfolio you heard from John right, the 10% of the portfolio. At that price is this a buy sell or hold. That's what we think about for every asset class. I share the enthusiasm of the market participants have about 4.5 cap asset classes that grows 2% but think about at the end of the day we are here as a capital allocator to make money, despite all the noise around Genesis our unlevered IRR is double digits. The math that I just mentioned which you know in low 4% mid 4% cap rate going in with a 2% growth with a 12% or 15% you know CapEx you will never even get to 7. We're here to make money for our shareholders and every time we are making a decision on group of assets to see is it a buy, hold or sell. That's what we did. Rich Anderson : Okay, follow up question is you know essentially what are shareholders paying for you know this Genesis lifeline and I'm not saying that tongue in cheek, clearly the fortunes of your tenants accrued to the REIT. So it is what it is. You did what you had to do but going forward you know you kind of get into this risky thing where we don't want Genesis, we do want Genesis, we don't want Genesis sort of if you ultimately were to sell more you know it kind of changes the narrative. So is there some risk that you kind of put yourself into a corner and almost have to commit going forward? Or you don't feel that way? Shankh Mitra : That is precisely what we did what we did. Tom said every call that were not getting out of the post-acute business right, triple net lease is a credit commitment right, we're happy to make that commitment if we get the right price investing in real estate is all about basis. So if we get the right price we'll sell, if we don't get the right price we think this is something that our shareholders can enjoy the cash flow growth we'll do it. But we absolutely believe it is de-risked not only from the position of coverage but all the escalators are downright from 2.9% to 2%, that should be appropriate for the business in the footprint that they are. So you know we have never flip-flopped should we sell Genesis, not sell Genesis. We're looking at all of our assets and thinking is it a buy, sell or hold at the price that the market is willing to bear. Tom DeRosa : We actively manage our business and like any business things change and we have to be able to be flexible to do what's in the best interest of the business which is ultimately in the best interest of the shareholder. The public markets were screaming at us to have taken a different approach with Genesis. I think we took the right approach. You may want to debate that with us and we're happy to debate that, but I think we took that we did the responsible thing for Genesis and for our shareholders. And I think that will prove out versus other roads we could have gone down. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Tom, I wanted to dive a little bit on your comments on the prosecute phase. What is your outlook on the reimbursement changes? Where do you believe we're in this transition and are the major shift from the prosecutor space, now behind us? Tom DeRosa : I think it's very difficult to predict what will happen in Washington, the only thing I can say is that you've seen the current administration look for ways to take some pressure off, suppose to space with respect to litigation. So, I think that we take some comfort in the fact that there is a recognition that we have to drive individuals into lower cost settings. If the government continued to try and put the skilled nursing business because of their reimbursement programs, then we would have a much bigger problem in this country because people would be stuck in very expensive hospital beds. I think there is a changing view in Washington and we hope that a rational thinking will prevail here. We need to drive people into lower cost settings. The health care industry, the hospitals are still trying to deliver valued based healthcare and fee for service build real estate that doesn\u2019t work. We're will our economy will ham bridge, if we continue to think we have to keep hospital beds sold, we need to drive people to lower cost settings and so that is why we have never abandon this skilled nursing sector and it will be bumpy but we think now with the restructuring of Genesis, we have the right coverage and credit profile to would stand potential choppiness. Shankh Mitra : And so Mike that\u2019s the most important point, there has been a lot of restructuring change, I mean lot of your reimbursement changes, other than RUGS-IV, none of them had been huge, they have been small, that 500 cut for sure, but why that has been amplified on a industry something that you know I would encourage all of you to think about, because of the massive leverage in the system, right. If you think about what happen 10 years ago, people got really excited about ill chase and massively levered all these entities. And what we have seen this cycle is unwind of that. Has there been -- would have been choppiness even if you let equity finance all these deals, absolute -- probably would be, but this operators would be a in a much stronger positions. And that\u2019s the key is post-acute industry like any other industry, but post-acute industry is a very interesting point in its lifecycle where they needs to be remained and recapitalized in a different way. Michael Carroll : And I just want to clarify, your guy's stance on the post-acute care space. When you say you're committed to it, does that mean you just fund to kind maintain your exposure to Genesis and maybe for good deal pops around, you could grow with them? Are you underwriting new deals or you're looking for new investments outside of Genesis? Or do you just happy with your Genesis exposure right now? Shankh Mitra : We look to capital like, deploy capital, to good quality real estate in the right markets with good operators, in sustainable structures. So if all those pieces line up, and it's an interesting new post-acute operator for us, we will consider that, we would consider that if we think it's in the long term best interest of our business and the long term best interest of our shareholders. But no, we will not red line the space, because of some confusion about what's happening in the industry that was largely due to bad capital structures. Certain people made a lot of money, when these post-acute care companies found their ways into the hands of REITs, and REITs until RUGS-IV had well covered real estate, the world changed. And what you've seen us do is fix what was the problem that we've been dealing with for years. We think we've largely addressed that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Turning to Page 11 on your SHO statistics, it looks like CapEx increased this quarter to 24% of NOI versus 22% in the third quarter. And I'm wondering A, why that occurred? And B, what is in the other CapEx, is that renovations or is that redevelopment CapEx? John Goodey : So, the answer is quarter-by-quarter it does vary, we tend to historically understand our budget in the first couple of quarters, an overspent relative to the pro forma in the second quarter, that comes out roughly where we think. And so I think we do see some reinvestment in portfolios I think we've said on a number of calls, part of having a great balance sheet as we can, drive growth out of existing buildings through CapEx. So as Shankh was saying, how do we look at capital, we look at the existing buildings on the buy wholesale mentality, for investing more capital, the capital doesn't come for free as you're well aware, so I think we do address capital requests in that way, and now the capital just -- it is added as other CapEx in those buildings in terms of our -- as I described, our I guess our significant reinvestment capital, as I described it I think. Shankh Mitra : Yes, and plus all the Vintage CapEx spent in the fourth quarter. John Goodey : CapEx is above all, so we expect more normalized run rate sort of back towards normal, next year we don't have a substantially different view of CapEx need, this coming year than last year. Because there are number of projects we wanted to drive growth, but I'd say it again, we do that on a sort of ROI based model. John Kim : So, redevelopment CapEx is a separate bucket, this is more kind of renovation type work? John Goodey : No, both. John Kim : You guys referenced Brookdale, the major announcement this morning. Can you just update us on your relationship with them going forward? Do you plan to reduce your exposure and sell assets or maintain it and also the rent coverage because I think last quarter you were mentioning that's 1.15 times just wondering given the outlook? Mercedes Kerr : Yes, our portfolio is very steady, so like I said in my comments earlier, we are satisfied as that we're holding. We are always in conversations together. We have a lot of business together, so we feel very close to one another, so I expect that to continue. Other than that I guess I could just -- there isn't any -- anything that is glaring right now. We -- as you know always have options with respect to our portfolio, I mean that\u2019s one of the real strengths of Welltower that we have such a diverse and geographically as well as in terms of different kinds of platforms you know operator based. And so we always have a lot of alternative, we feel always like we have a sort of a maybe a headstart in that perspective from that perspective compared to others so nothing here to report right now. John Kim with : And when does your lease expire with them? Mercedes Kerr : We have a couple of leases, few leases, three of them actually that are expiring later this year. We're not in a notice period with them yet, we again have had conversations with them about extending them. We have once again opportunities to put some properties with other operators and considering that the properties are you know -- these are covering of assets. We don't feel like there's any sort of friction that would come of it, if we had to move them to somebody else. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : First question Vintage, what was the contribution to same-store NOI in the fourth quarter? What's the impact for 2018 guidance? Shankh Mitra : The answer to your first question is negative 10 basis points in the fourth quarter, I don't have the '18 guidance with me but I'll give that that to you later, I'll give you a call. The Vintage was a drag for fourth quarter because as I said -- and John said, that we spent a lot of capital on the renovation projects are going on in fourth quarter. Tom DeRosa : There's a lot of reams active commission in the capital store as well. Mercedes Kerr : Which was part of our plan, Juan, let me just add something here we're talking about Vintage because if we're looking at this, we have to you know one of the value of that one portfolio was always kind of our long term outlook for the strains and the opportunities of having those really select markets, really markets that can be irreplaceable in some cases. And so just as they come in one of the things, even though we're working through all of the CapEx and [indiscernible] might be out of commission while we're working through all of that, I can tell you that the rate of growth in the Vintage portfolio actually exceeds the average Welltower growth rate which as you probably know exceeds the market average as well. So the cities themselves are the -- they're almost tenants holding out hopefully and that we think is an important driving decision for that investment. Juan Sanabria : So it's a benefit in '18 but it was a drag in the fourth quarter. Why was it a drag in the fourth quarter given the low occupancy starting point? Shankh Mitra : It\u2019s a lot of CapEx as I said is being spent on Vintage right now, their renovations are going on. I would not necessarily think it will be a benefit to '18, it will be a drag in few quarters and benefiting few quarters right. I would be hopeful that Vintage as its run rate starts to help the portfolio growth starting '19. But as you can see from the CapEx page most of the CapEx started to get spend in the fourth quarter. So that's been a drag in Q1 and Q2 and you will probably see the impact of that in towards the fourth quarter of the year. Juan Sanabria : On the dividend what are you guys thinking about going forward, it looks like on your fad guidance it\u2019s in the low to mid 90% payout ratio. So how should we think about that any risk of dividend cut at any point if you decide to sell more Genesis assets for whatever reason or are they high yielding assets? Shankh Mitra : No I think, when you look at our FFO pad ratio you know we feel comfortable with that, I think we\u2019ve done a great job in the last, we think about it this way I guess Juan which is given in our output not an input and I think there is component to that, the first component is the quantum of your income stream to pay them and second is the quality of your income stream and obviously our FFO guidance for this year is down, by roughly 20 penny to the midpoint but the quality of that income steam is gone up very dramatically elements that refining our portfolio through 2017, elements of taking the rent restructure and genesis excreta. So we feel very comfortable with the quality of that FFO given the stream which gives us comfort around paying the dividend that we proposed on both approved going forward. So we feel very comfortable with that, the other thing is we got a great deal of balance sheet flexibility, as you know we got a pretty much the lowest leverage balance sheet in the sector, so we have the financial flexibility on the balance sheet side as well. Tom DeRosa : I just amplify that in a very long-term based on the quality of the business model here because of the changes that we made, the asset quality, the improvement in the balance sheet and the strong cash flow from the decisions we made to improve the overall quality of that business, the dividend has never been more secure. Juan Sanabria : Okay just a quick question on genesis, is there any discussion with genesis with that formation with regards to dam tipping any equity or was part of this restructuring? Shankh Mitra : We talk to formation all the time, so I'm not going to get into any specific conversation about what we might and might going to have discussed with formation but you should assume that as majority on our sub genesis where in constant that information. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : I don\u2019t think I've heard this yet, but could you break down to your Shop guidance assumptions in terms of occupancy RUG-IV for and operating expense growth? And then may be how that occupancy comp should strength throughout the year given the strong flu season to start? Shankh Mitra : So I did -- I'll reiterate that for you. We\u2019re expecting a low -- no, we're modeling, a low 3% rate growth that\u2019s obviously we did, a 4% rate growth in '17, low 3% rate growth, 5,200 basis points of occupancy decline and a 3% to 4% expense growth. But as I said we will give you the, obviously this assumption at the beginning of last year, but we got to the same result, actually better than expected results using a different combination. So I would not -- if I were you, I would not assume these are all independent variables, right? And see where we end up like we feel comfortable, they will be in the range probably through different combination, the rates could be better or they could be worse, maybe occupancy we're thinking down 50 to 100. It could be worse than that or better than that but expenses will be better. So there are three levels that drive that number, so that\u2019s how I would think about and now focus on one variable. And your other question was about, how occupancy will trend, obviously given the flu, you will see low occupancy at the beginning of the year, hopefully which will ramp back into the end of the year. That\u2019s how, usually that\u2019s how seasonality was in this business, anyway, so you will probably see that more pronounce this year because of flu. Jonathan Hughes : Okay that\u2019s helpful and then just one more on Shop. So with the national average U.S. renter I guess REVPOR like 4,000 a month in yours is north of 7. Is the new product under construction really even they're competitive to your properties? I mean I am assuming most of the newbuilds are going to price it about, 125% of markets that would be roughly 5,000 a month, just curious as to your use on how serious the new supply thread is to your U.S. Shop assets? Shankh Mitra : There is absolutely no doubt that the new supply is impacting our performance, but obviously it's impacting our performance lot less, than the market average and our competitors and one of the reasons is what you outlined, the another one is what Mercedes talked about is the quality of our operator. We have the best assets in the best submarkets, not only the markets, which is not only difficult to build, but also they're premier assets, obviously the quality of care and reputation of those assets in those markets matter, and -- do we think it's competitive? Absolutely, do we think that we're positioned better than our competition, rest of the market? Absolutely, yes. Shankh Mitra : Think about what Mercedes said earlier about Sunrise, and J.D. Power, there're six categories, they rank number one in five of the six, and the one they didn't rank number one in was price, which means they're probably a little bit more expensive than others, so they didn't get the number one ranking there, but that is very significant, you've never seen J.D. Power the most respective research house for consumer research every rank senior housing operators, and it's pretty extraordinary that Sunrise was by far the number one name in the business. And I would tell you if you haven't seen that ranking, we'll send it to you because I think it'll be interesting to see where some of the other names have ranked. Operator : Thank you for dialing in to the Welltower earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation and ask that you disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President, Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, sir. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Kim. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower's First Quarter 2018 Results. Following the safe harbor, you will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; John Goodey, CFO; Shankh Mitra, Chief Investment Officer; and myself. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning's press release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release, you may access it via the company's website at welltower.com. And with that, I will hand the call over to Tom for further remarks in the quarter. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, Tim. Good morning. I'm pleased to report to you a solid quarter completely in line with our expectations. The Welltower business platform continued to deliver positive same-store growth through -- externally through completing over $600 million of acquisitions and developments, generated growth capital through profitable property sales and loan payoffs of approximately $1 billion and further delevered our balance sheet to a ratio of 35.3% net debt to undepreciated book capital, the lowest level in our history. We run this company for our shareholders and never lose sight of our goal to deliver high-quality, durable and growing cash flow. Our commitment to delivering results from our core business is self-evident in these results. That said, the current operating and capital markets environments make this hard. You have to make hard decisions about where you invest shareholder capital. These decisions do not always make you popular. Nevertheless, the easy money asset aggregation models of the past are not a strategy for the future. You have to work harder and you have to work smarter. You've heard me discuss our strategy of aligning Welltower's seniors housing and post-acute assets more closely with health systems. We believe this is an imperative if we are to drive down the cost of health care delivery and improve health outcomes, particularly in view of the aging of the population. This is at the core of our strategy. And today, we are excited to tell you about a transformational transaction that demonstrates our leadership position in driving the future of health care real estate. Before I turn the call over to Shankh to discuss our new ProMedica Health System joint venture that we announced in the wee hours of last evening, John Goodey will take you through the highlights of our first quarter. John? John Goodey : Thank you, Tom. And good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to provide you with the highlights of our first quarter 2018. As noted by Tom, we saw challenging conditions in our senior housing business in Q1, with new supply continuing to affect the U.S, which was also impacted by a tough influenza season. Canada was also challenged by flu, as was the U.K., which also had to contend with the worst weather seen there in over a decade. Despite these challenges, our high-quality real estate portfolio, superior operator relationships and the strength of the Welltower platform, managed to deliver solid growth for the quarter. Our SHO portfolio same-store NOI grew by 0.6% in Q1 with senior housing triple-net being 3.0%, long-term post-acute being 2.4% and our patient medical growing at 2.9%; overall same-store NOI growth was 1.8% for the quarter. As we have seen in previous quarters, our seniors housing operating portfolios geographic diversity helped to stabilize our overall performance, with the U.S. growing at 1% and Canada at 1.8%, partially offsetting weaker performance in the U.K. Within the SHO portfolio, strong REVPOR growth of 3.5% exceeded our expectations for the quarter but was tempered by higher-than-anticipated occupancy loss of 1.9%. [indiscernible] growth at 4.8% was at the higher end of our expectations, driven mainly by labor. This quarter, same-store growth was augmented with in-quarter acquisitions and joint ventures of $476 million, $59 million in development funding and loan advances of $43 million, alongside $987 million of divestments and loan payoffs. Total gross investments with existing partners accounted for 67% of capital deployed. Overall, we are able to report a normalized first quarter 2018 FFO result of $0.99 per share. I would like to comment on the particularly strong returns achieved on our $895 million of Q1 divestments. Aggregate gain on disposition was $338 million with an average unlevered IRR being 13%. In addition to this quarter's acquisitions, we completed developments totaling $137 million of total investment with an average projected yield of 9.3%, and anticipate completions of total investment volume of $384 million for 2018 with an average projected yield of 8.2%. We continue to focus on our operational corporate efficiency. Our G&A for the quarter was $33.7 million, being slightly elevated due to LTIP accounting charges. We are excited by initiatives our colleagues are working on to further automate numerous functions within the firm to further durably reduce our cost base. Our balance sheet remains in great shape. During the quarter we repaid $450 million of senior unsecured notes due in March and $183 million of secured debt. We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position with cash of $203 million and $2.1 billion of credit line availability. Our leverage metrics are at strong levels with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.4x and a net debt to undepreciated book capitalization ratio of 35.3%, while our fixed charge cover ratio remains strong at 3.5x. After the quarter closed, Welltower placed a new $550 million 10-year senior unsecured note. Despite volatile markets, initial launch of the bonds with a $400 million placement volume and pricing of [ T plus 1.70% ] area, generated initial orders in excess of $2 billion, facilitating upsizing of the bonds by $150 million and tightening of price to [ T plus 1.48% ]. This is the tightest spread the 10-year treasury's ever achieved by Welltower. Simultaneous with the notes offering, we executed a U.S. dollar to Sterling currency swap resulting in an effective rate on the bonds of 3.11%. With a committed bridge financing of $1 billion in place and our available credit line, we are fully financed to complete the acquisition of QCP and to complete our other business and investment plans. We anticipate turning out elements of the short-term financing structure, before and after the closing of the acquisition, by the bank and debt capital markets, dependent upon the availability of attractive financing. Completion of the QCP purchase, expected QCP dispositions and increased Welltower dispositions will see our expected pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to increase slightly to approximately 5.6x. This level is well within our covenants and the construct of our BBB+ ratings. So overall, despite tough senior housing operating conditions, we are maintaining our full year 2018 overall expected adjusted same-store NOI growth guidance range of approximately 1% to 2%. We are also maintaining our full year 2018 expected overall normalized FFO range of $3.95 to $4.05 per diluted share. Due to gains made on dispositions and other normalizing factors, we are increasing our expected net income attributable to common shareholders to $2.55 to $2.65 per share from $2.38 to $2.48, prior. As noted in our earnings release, the purchase of QCP and our increased disposition guidance are not factored into the aforementioned 2018 guidance due to timing uncertainty. We will update guidance once timing and financial impacts are more certain. On May 23, 2018, Welltower will pay its 188th consecutive cash dividend of $0.87. This represents a current dividend yield of approximately 7%. With that, I will hand it over to Shankh to discuss the exciting joint venture with ProMedica and purchase of QCP. Tim McHugh : Thanks, John. Shankh will take you through the ProMedica transaction and the positive impact it will have on Welltower. But before I hand the mic over to Shankh, I'm delighted to introduce Randy Oostra, President and CEO of ProMedica Health System, who will give you a brief overview of ProMedica and comment on our new joint venture. Randy? Randall Oostra : Great. Good morning. Yes, I'm very excited to be with you today. For those of you that don't know a lot about ProMedica, we are a integrated delivery system, a mission-driven system, that has really, historically been offering acute and ambulatory care. We have an insurance company with a [ dell ] Plan and have both post-acute and an academic of business line. We have a strong management team that has been together for over 20 years. And historically, we've operated our 13 hospital system. We have 17,000 employees. We work with about 2,700 physicians  and advanced practice providers, and then we employ more than 900 providers in our physicians group. And our core operations are in Ohio and Michigan and Indiana. But we also are in some other states as well. In addition, we have a payer -- an insurance payer, that has over 600,000 members, both with our medical and dental plans. So today, in our announcement of the acquisition of HCR ManorCare, which is the nation's second largest provider of post-acute and long-term care, it really allows ProMedica to become one of the top 15 largest health systems in the United States. And as you know, a lot about health care and some of the issues we have, it gives us immediate scale and really for us doubles our revenue to $7 billion and gives us an employment base of about 70,000 people, and really moves us from a Midwest 6-state footprint to 30 states. As we've looked at this acquisition, we plan to be investing $400 million into HCR ManorCare over the next 5 years. And really, I think, as we talked with Tom and his team, what this acquisition does, it really positions us to really invest in this next generation of care that we believe is the next step to be delivered. And we think we can do that in a very responsive, dignified and cost-effective manner. What's great about it is we have 3 Toledo-based companies. Welltower shares our vision of improving outcomes through these kind of partnerships. And really this is all about trying to drive efficiencies really across that whole continuum of care. So this -- the real estate capital and the transaction, the partnership with Welltower, really is really transformational for us. The partnership will enable us to expand our service offering. And it really offers the ability for us to provide unique wellness-focused strategies beyond our traditional acute care focus. And really, I think, helps us to really think about how we kind of redefine the settings in which health care is going to be provided in the future. So, as you can imagine, we're incredibly excited about the transaction. We're incredibly excited about partnering with Welltower, and we really believe that this partnership is really going to set up a very long-term profitable partnership for both organizations. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, Randy. Now over to you, Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tom. And good morning, everyone. When we last spoke at our fourth quarter call, we talked about the early offshoots of significant shifts in the post-acute sector with the recapitalization of Genesis and the acquisition of Kindred. In these transactions, we saw both unique and sophisticated players such as Humana, Welsh, Carson, TPG and Apollo, deploying their capital and expertise in this space. As we said, the post-acute industry needs to be reinvented with the proper capital structure provided by patient and strategic capital and health systems sponsorship that believes in the lower-cost care settings. Today, we are very pleased to announce the continuation of that trend with the first of its kind transformational transaction, which will define the future of this space. For the first time ever, we have a leading health system, ProMedica, and a major real estate investor, Welltower, entering into a partnership which spans the full spectrum of care, from self-acute, to acute care, to post-acute. It is an alignment between ProMedica and Welltower's vision of the future of health care delivery that brought us together. Yesterday, ProMedica announced their acquisition of HCR ManorCare in conjunction with forming a joint venture between ProMedica and Welltower to acquire the real estate assets of Quality Care Properties. As you may know, ProMedica is a A+ rated health system that is headquartered here in Toledo, Ohio with us. ProMedica owns and operates 13 acute care hospitals as well as many outpatient medical facilities, as you just heard from Randy. ProMedica is one of the 2 health systems in the country with 3 5-star hospitals, other than Mayo Clinic. After this transaction, ProMedica will have $7 billion of revenue, making it the 15th largest health system, an elite company of [ many market ] names in the industry such as Penn Medicine, Geisinger, Henry Fords of the world. As part of this transaction, ProMedica will acquire HCR ManorCare and simultaneously, Welltower and ProMedica will acquire QCP's ManorCare real estate in an 80-20 joint venture. This real estate spans across 18 states and 160 post-acute communities and 58 assisted-living facilities, with an EBITDAR split of 70% to 30%. ProMedica will enter into a 15-year master lease with the joint venture. This lease will be fully backed by ProMedica's corporate guarantee and will include an annual escalator of 2.75% after a year 1 escalator of 1.375% as ProMedica will undertake significant capital improvement plans of roughly about $200 million in the first 2 years. ProMedica's business plan includes investing $400 million of growth and upgrade capital into the portfolio over the next 5 years. Welltower is also -- will also wholly own the non-ManorCare part of the portfolio, representing less than 10% of the transaction value. The transaction provides Welltower with an 8% cash yield with an investment of $2.2 billion and an above-market EBITDAR coverage of 1.8x. We will enjoy double-digit unlevered IRR out of this investment due to good going-in yield, attractive growth and lack of CapEx in a base-case scenario. We'll also believe there is significant upside to this base case as occupancy at its cycle lows. This is demonstrated by the very attractive basis that we are investing into this portfolio. And we are doing this in a very accretive structure where we are protected by significant creditworthiness, A+, of our partner. This transaction will also be very accretive to our cash flow, to the tune of more than $20 -- $0.20 per share. We'll also enjoy a secure and growing cash flow for years to come. HCR ManorCare and Arden Courts have long been considered premier operators in the industry and now, with a substantial investment and a viable long-term capital structure, we are excited to see a performance of that management team that -- performance that their management team can drive. We can see this partnership as an avenue for growth between ProMedica and Welltower across multiple property sites and geographies which will be greatly enhanced by the combined scale and expertise of ProMedica and Welltower teams. As dispassionate capital allocators, we believe you, our shareholders, pay us to produce alpha. Alpha can never be produced by investing capital and consensus ideas. Consensus by definition is priced-in for risk and reward. At the same time, we need to protect our downside with an appropriate structure, rights and basis. We strongly believe that this transaction, which diverges from popular belief, delivers on that promise of outsized risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. We're extremely proud of our team, who pulled off one of the most complex transactions in the history of this industry by navigating the complications of 2 asset classes, a bankruptcy process involving an operator and 4 diverse parties ranging from publicly traded entities to a not-for-profit health system and a private equity sponsor. Our ability to creatively manage and navigate the challenges is what's allowing us to generate this significant outsized return for our investors. With that, I will pass it over to Tim who will walk you through the financing aspect of the deal. Tim? Tim McHugh : Thank you, Shankh. Before walking you through the sources and uses of last night's announced transaction, I wanted to emphasize 2 points that drove our financing strategy and our view of the levered economics of this transaction. First, we raised approximately $1 billion in equity over the 6 quarters from the third quarter of 2016 through year-end 2017 at an average net price more than 40% above where our stock closed yesterday. We took advantage of an excellent environment in the REIT equity capital markets over this period, despite the temptation to lever up to offset dilutive asset sales and tighter life-cycle acquisition spreads. This very purposely put us in a position to take advantage of a large, unique, off-market deal like this without having to raise value-destructive equity or putting our balance sheet at risk. Second, because of our excellent liquidity position and our ability to access efficiently priced flexible bank capital, we are able to pledge funding of this deal without taking any prefunding risk. But we did not underwrite this deal assuming short duration floating-rate financing. We assumed the entire $1.3 billion of permanent debt is financed consistent with our current long-term cost of debt. As highlighted on the sources and uses slide of the deck released last night, at $20.75 per share, total QCP equity of net debt equates to a $3.5 billion cash outlay. As an offset to this, the cash balance at QCP is expected to build significantly through the time of close as they execute on their previously disclosed noncore disposition program. They currently have 74 HCR ManorCare skilled nursing assets being sold, all of which have either signed PSAs or in later stage of negotiations. We expect proceeds from these sales to reduce our acquired cash outlay to approximately $3.1 billion. For the remaining portfolio, ProMedica will contribute approximately $950 million in cash through a combination of the payment of HCR ManorCare's outstanding deferred rent obligation and their 20% ownership in the real estate joint venture. After ProMedica's contribution, Welltower will fund its share of the joint venture and its 100% ownership of a non-HCR ManorCare assets, totaling $2.2 billion, through a combination of asset sales and debt. The details of Welltower's planned asset sales are as follows : As updated in our 1Q '18 earnings release from last night, we increased our full-year disposition guidance to indicate $895 million of further dispositions in the year. This number consists of $428 million of properties held for sale at the end of the first quarter, $40 million of expected loan payoffs through the rest of 2018 and an additional 2 portfolios of properties, identified postquarter, representing another $428 million of expected proceeds. While asset sales always carry risk, the disposition processes for the held for sale assets are all in very late stage, and the additional assets we have identified for sale after the quarter represent high-quality portfolios, which have already garnered significant institutional interest. For the remaining debt financing, we have a fully committed $1 billion bridge facility, in addition to our significant line capacity. And we will actively look to place permanent financing as the transaction progresses. In closing, this transaction highlights why we aim to run our portfolio leverage counter to equity capital cycles, which allows us to use the balance sheet as a countercyclical tool to ensure we can take advantage of cycle agnostic opportunities like today's as well as be prepared to take advantage of any significant pricing breaks, driven by capital market dislocations.  And with that, I will hand the call back over to Tom for closing remarks. Thomas DeRosa : Last quarter, I reminded you why we made the decision not to abandon the post-acute care sector. While the consensus view was to cut and run, we have always maintained post-acute is a critical component of the health care delivery continuum. However, we recognize that the broken capital structures of the past ultimately pushed over-levered post-acute operators to the edge. We also realized the sector needed sponsorship to reemerge and a health system could be the most impactful sponsor. That is why we are establishing our joint venture with ProMedica. My earlier remarks reflected on the challenges of delivering growing cash flow and earnings in this macro environment. However, as you have heard from Shankh, we are bringing you a large investment that provides safe and growing cash flow and is strategically and significantly earnings-accretive. Today, you just can't find accretion from bond-like health care assets sold through auctions. Opportunities like this come about through connectivity with the health care complex, innovative thinking, smart structuring and good old-fashioned hard work. That's what differentiates Welltower. We created and structured an investment here that is $0.20 accretive, backed by a A-rated health system. And in order to do this, you have to be creative, roll up your sleeves, understand real estate deal structures and, yes, understand health care. Last quarter, you heard from Shankh that we expect 2019 to be an inflection point for senior housing fundamentals resulting in accelerating Welltower NOI. What this transaction ensures, that 2019 will also be an inflection point for earnings growth. So Welltower continues to be open for business, our assets continue to perform and we continue to execute on our strategy of partnering with the best-in-class health systems and operators to transform care, while delivering superior returns to our shareholders. Thank you. Kim, now open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : It seems like a lot of work went into doing this deal, so congrats on getting it done. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, Vikram. Vikram Malhotra : Can you talk about, sort of the -- how you thought about the risk-adjusted return of this deal given what's going on in skilled today? And maybe more specifically, what does this mean for the Genesis assets? Shankh Mitra : Vikram, if you think about -- as you know, we're all about risk-adjusted returns. There are 2 ways to think about this investment. One, I would say from a cash flow view, and the other is a real estate view. The cash flow view is very simple. You can see that we are getting into this investment at a very attractive [ base ] yield and that cash flow grows about 2.75% per year. And it's an absolute triple-net master lease and the cash flow is extremely safe because of the credit rating and full backing of that credit rating to the cash flow, right? So it's very significantly accretive from a cash flow perspective. When you think about this transaction from a real estate perspective, we are getting into this transaction at a very, very attractive basis. So the way we thought about is upside/downside, that if we think we garnered that cash flow for the next 15 years and then we write off, in the worst case scenario, on the -- write off this real estate to the salvage value, we are still at a significant single digit IRR. In the base case scenario, as we talked about, if the cash flow stays where it is, it will be a low double digit IRR. But as you know, this -- as we -- I mentioned before, the occupancy of this portfolio is at all-time low. There's a significant CapEx need. We have a silver tsunami coming. And more importantly, now this health system and the operator will be backed by one of the top 15 health systems in the country. So all the upside and the synergies that comes with it and the cash flow upside that comes with it probably will put us into a very significant double-digit unlevered IRR range. So we are very excited about this deal and we think our shareholders will make massive amount of money from this deal. Vikram Malhotra : And just a follow-up on the Genesis? Thomas DeRosa : Yes, go ahead. Shankh Mitra : So we obviously do think that this is a very good transaction for the post-acute industry. The interest of the unique nature of this transaction is that acute care health system is showing its commitment to the post-acute sector. That's good for all operators, including Genesis. Genesis and -- we obviously hope that Genesis will benefit significantly from that. Now from our perspective, obviously Genesis is now roughly, before this transaction, is about 5% of our cash flow. It will -- this will make Genesis about 4% of our cash flow. So we are excited about what we retained with Genesis assets, and that's about 1.35x covered today. and we are excited what comes with it going forward. I don't have any more update on Genesis for you at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Knott, Green Street Advisors. Michael Knott : Okay, great. Just with the unusual nature of the QCP share price closing above the deal price yesterday. Do you expect any issues with the vote there? And then, can you just maybe just touch on the protections you might have with any termination fees and anything that would be relevant along those lines? Thomas DeRosa : Michael, I'm going to ask Matt McQueen, our General Counsel, to comment on that. Matthew McQueen : Mike. Yes, obviously you saw the spike in the middle of the day. But we think that because of -- there was a leak during the course of the day, that we're comfortable with all the deal protections. In terms of those specific protections, you'll see an 8-K later today that describes those in the agreements. So we'll refer you to that for now. Michael Knott : Okay, thanks. And then, if I can just throw 2 more quick questions out there for you at once. Tom, I'd love to hear you talk any more about implications of what you think this deal might mean for future opportunities with ProMedica and then, more broadly, in terms of investment. And then, also any comments you guys can provide on how you're thinking about the SHO business 3 months into the year, sort of a net-net basis would be helpful. Thomas DeRosa : Great. So Mike, I think this is a very compelling opportunity for both Welltower and ProMedica. ProMedica sees this real estate beyond the classic view of a skilled nursing facility. What these are delivering are new care sites for ProMedica to extend its health care delivery model now to 30 states. So they think about this real estate as well-located, efficient sites of health care delivery, not the -- in the -- using the pejorative -- what's become a pejorative term, of a SNF. And I would caution you to look at these -- this investment and compare it to other SNF investments. This is really a health system investment. We have extraordinarily strong EBITDAR coverage from -- at the asset level as well as the backing of a strong A-rated health system, who will join the likes of names like Johns Hopkins, Cleveland Clinic and Geisinger as one of the most consequential health systems in the United States. We also see the opportunity to link this network with our premium senior care operators. We see health care delivery moving out of the acute-care hospital. ProMedica sees this as an opportunity to, again, extend its footprint, but they're not buying hospitals. They're investing in lower-cost, efficient, consumer-friendly care delivery sites. You may have seen that one of the large health systems in the United States, Beecken, has announced that they will be admitting seniors with hip replacements directly into SNFs that they own, doing the surgery in the SNFs and keeping that individual for its rehab in that skilled nursing facility. So this is only the beginning. Health care delivery is changing. That's what's so exciting about this opportunity. Shankh Mitra : I'll make a quick comment. Just to follow-up on Tom's point, if you think about -- look at health care today, you are seeing vertical integration across the board. So ProMedica, as you heard from Randy, is not only -- is a provider, an extremely well-respected provider, and they will be a provider from self-acute to acute care to post-acute to home health and hospice. But they're also a payer. So that integration you're seeing across the value chain in health care. Now going to your question on the SHO. We have -- we still feel that the guidance we give you on a SHO in a -- about 3 months ago, we are still very comfortable with that. The story remains the same. Occupancy, we -- what we thought is worse, rates are better and expenses are better. So net-net, we're in line of what we -- where we thought and we'll see how -- what the rest of the year has for us. Operator : Your next question come from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital. Jordan Sadler : I appreciate you guys making your partner available to make some comments. Hopefully, I'll be able to address a question to him. But otherwise, maybe you can guys can answer. Just regarding the topic we just finished off on. I'm curious, one, what type of an expansion in these skilled nursing facility sector this represents for ProMedica? I know they own 13 hospitals. I'm not sure how many skilled nursing facilities prior to this. And then separately, as you're talking about the evolution of the delivery of care, what is -- what happens -- and is there the potential for a change in the payment mix as it relates to these facilities because of ProMedica's ownership? Thomas DeRosa : Well, Jordan, this is ProMedica's first major investment into the post-acute care and assisted living and -- sectors. So this is a significant new venture for them. We should also remind you that the management team -- the historic management team at HCR ManorCare, led by Steve Cavanaugh, will be staying in place here.  That's a key point here. So there's no change in management. I think, it's a little early to say exactly what ProMedica's plans are or how they might change what goes on inside these buildings. But I think you -- I could comfortably say that they're very excited to get their hands around this business with the HCR ManorCare management team and rethink the strategy for how you can drive service and profitable activities into these sites of care. Jordan Sadler : Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess one more for you, Tom. Just -- I'm curious on the thought process, this time around, you said something like this could make you unpopular. This -- you were on the board many years ago when HCN -- formally, HCN made the initial investment, a purchase of the Genesis portfolio. And at the time when HCP bought the HCR portfolio, I think you guys were close to that as well. I know the basis here looks like probably half the purchase price paid at that time, and that probably provides some level of comfort, so I appreciate that. But my question is more, what gives -- what's your comfort level in the direction of fundamentals here, right? I mean, the trend in occupancy has been pretty poor for a while, driven by obvious factors, despite the fact that the bed count has been declining for 20, 25 years. Any thoughts on that? Thomas DeRosa : Well, the first thing I'd say, Jordan is, these assets and this business has been capital-starved for years. The problem with the deals that were done back almost 10 years ago, is that, that was a time when health care REITs were valued on how quickly they could aggregate assets, versus what were the fundamentals of the business. And I'm not going to sit here and recount a lot of changes that happened that made it more difficult to be in the skilled nursing business in terms of reimbursement. But at the end of the day, Jordan, these companies were over-levered. I think we have looked -- we have maligned a business here based on profits that were made off of ridiculous levels of leverage. So I think you have to put that aside and think about, this is real estate where health care can be delivered effectively. You have to think about this differently. And yes, you're right. We are buying this at half of what HCP paid for it. Shankh Mitra : So if you think about, as we said, right, every business is cyclical. And we talked about this before, that post-acute dances to a different Washington cycle. And obviously, 30% of the business, of this cash flow is -- comes from assisted-living and [ memory ] care, that dances to a different -- more of a business and supply cycle. The key point is what we are paying for it, right? So if you think about, we are buying at the low point in the cycle and we're not trying to suggest to you that we bought exactly at the bottom. That's why the protection is for. We have very significant coverage at the property level. We have very -- and obviously, one of the best quality health system, that backing with A+ rated credit, is backing that cash flow. We also know that our view is not what has happened in the last 5 years but what is going to happen in the next 15 years. If you look at the demographics and you see what's coming from a demand perspective -- and, Jordan, you mentioned the supply has been obviously not a -- not an issue for the post-acute sector. We think there's significant upside to that cash flow.  For various reasons, the capital from ProMedica is spending on this, the sponsorship of ProMedica, which is the most important here, understand where the patients come from. They come from health systems, right? That will bring to this business, obviously there will be shift of market share as the brand changes as well as the capital gets improved. So we're very excited about it, but we're not going to sit here and tell you that we think on the fundamental cycle, this month, this quarter, is the bottom. And that's why we have the protection for. And we have confidence -- we have extreme confidence in Steve Cavanaugh and the team who runs HCP ManorCare as well as Randy and Mike, who runs ProMedica, to take this business at a very different level. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : A lot of questions on the deal have, I guess, been answered and asked. I guess one question, just in terms of FFO guidance. I know that you guys didn't change it and I can understand why you wouldn't necessarily put this deal into earnings guidance just yet, given the uncertainty on timing of the closing, plus the sales. But you guys did and were active in the first quarter on the acquisition front, and I'm just trying to figure out what kept you from at least changing for that? Is there something else? Or is it just kind of early in the year and you just kind of want to roll things in, maybe closer to midyear? John Goodey : Yes, I think that's the case, Steve. I think, 90 days doesn't give you a whole picture of how the year will run out. And obviously as you said, with uncertainties around timing and financial impacts of the transaction, it seemed premature to start changing the rest of the year's guidance when we will obviously have to update it for business evolution as well as transaction evolutions later on in the year. So yes, the answer is it's just too early really to make substantial changes after 90 days of operations. Tim McHugh : Steve, on the acquisition front, so the transaction activity in the first quarter was disclosed, as at the end of the year. So it was factored in. So the majority of that came through Sunrise CCRC transaction that was announced at the end of '17 and is closing in a few stages here. So -- and then Cogir was a new operator, we added up in Canada. That was about a $200 million investment that closed in the first quarter as well. So both of those were factored into full-year guidance as they were disclosed in our 4Q 2017 results. Steve Sakwa : Okay. And I guess, not to kind of beat a dead horse on this, kind of regional operator now growing national. But, I guess, Tom, just to kind of boil it down, is the comfort factor with having ProMedica expand into basically a national player, the fact that the HCR ManorCare management team is sort of staying in place there and kind of running the business under the sort of guidance of ProMedica? Thomas DeRosa : Exactly, Steve. This is -- HCR ManorCare has an excellent management team and this is breathing new life into their business model. The capital that ProMedica will invest in that business model and the real estate is -- will truly propel it to the next -- to its next generation of care. Steve Sakwa : And I guess, if you just sort of think of the risks, I mean, just sort of thinking about the downside, sort of what are the, I guess, obvious, or maybe not so obvious, challenges of sort of trying to take a regional health system and expand them and sort of do an expansion like this? Thomas DeRosa : Well, from the beginning, you've got -- again, you've got a business - an in-place business that has been capital starved. So we see investing new capital into the business will derisk the current business model. And as I said earlier, things are changing in health care delivery. Steve, let me just for a moment turn this to Mark Shaver, who I believe many of you have met, who joined us from -- he is our Head of Strategy, who joined us from the Johns Hopkins health system earlier this year. Let me just -- I think it'd be helpful to hear Mark's perspectives on it. Mark Shaver : So good morning, everyone. Mark here. First time here, just joined the team after being at Hopkins for almost 20 years. And what I'd like to share is, this is exactly the type of transaction that brought me to Welltower. We're spending time thinking about the integration of HCR ManorCare into ProMedica, a traditional health system. But the payer component that Randy mentioned earlier is important. And the combination of SNF plus memory care plus home health to create that integrated network, this national platform for integrated care, is very important. So while there's been some capital starving, as Tom mentioned, and some challenges in SNF, memory care continues to grow and we all know the demographics that are going to continue to grow nationally. So to have a 58-site, 12-state platform for growth for memory care is quite exciting. And the growth nationally in home health is significant. And what we're starting to see, both with our other operators and here, the opportunity to create integration across the health care delivery system, is starting to accelerate the savings but also improve quality and outcomes. So what I think the ProMedica team did and we're quite confident we will help accelerate, is the integration of care across that platform and the ability not just to work and coordinate with the ProMedica health system but other health systems across the country to really improve outcomes for patients. Operator : Your next question come from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Capital One. Daniel Bernstein : I wanted to go a little bit more into what kind of CapEx needs to be put into the facilities? And in particular, along the lines of that integrated health system, within Michigan and Ohio, ProMedica's footprint, what do you see of the integration opportunities with the skilled nursing and memory care facilities and home health? Is that bundled payments? Is that some other kind of integration and -- with managed care or other -- some type of insurance with -- in ProMedica? Just trying to understand the upside that ProMedica and Welltower are seeing in these assets. Shankh Mitra : Dan, so I think it's too early to comment on what the exact business plan is. But as you know for the last 10 years of various ownerships, the assets are capital starved. And frankly, this is not just a new fresh injection of capital but also investing in the people. So we do think that ProMedica, if you look at it across the board, we talked about how they're an integrated payer and provider network, and they have a business plan to significantly upgrade these assets and the various lines of businesses. But we -- it's important to understand that we believe that will drive significant amount of cash flow growth. However, we have not underwritten that in the numbers that we talked about. So with that, I'll just pass it over to Mark to make some additional comments on the business plan. Mark Shaver : Yes, Dan, it's Mark. I think you're exactly right in terms of the opportunity here. So ProMedica having Paramount, which is their insurance managed care payer entity, and the increasing role that both skilled nursing and home health have nationally and regionally with regards to bundled rates and value-based care initiatives of getting patients both seen surgically in the hospital then transitioned quickly to skilled nursing in the home, is absolutely right where the nation is going and where we need to go to improve outcomes and lower costs. So absolutely, we think ProMedica has those components. Daniel Bernstein : And then, I just wanted to quickly ask, the 1.8 EBITDAR coverage, is that pro forma, or is that in place? Shankh Mitra : That's in place. Daniel Bernstein : It's in place, okay. And then, one more quick question on the SHO portfolio. Obviously, there was an early flu season -- early peak of the flu season. Have you -- is there any information you can give us on, in terms of March, April occupancies?  Did you see a turnaround there? Just trying to understand some of the trends that we've seen early on in the first half. Thomas DeRosa : Okay, Dan. Mercedes, who's on the road, is going to answer that question for you. Mercedes? Mercedes Kerr : Yes, Tom, thank you. So the recent flu season, as you mentioned, was very significant. But we are encouraged by how our operators responded. Like we mentioned in the past, following the 2015 season, the company's really improved their way of -- the way that they respond and implement containment procedures. So in our portfolio, for the most part, I think we saw the greatest impact in the higher acuity portfolios located in the West, particularly in California and the Southwest. In some cases, vacancy due to death was higher this season than what we have seen before, and those operators will continue to be impacted, I think, for the short term. But by all the measures that we're monitoring, such as outpatient visits due to flu and mortality rates and so on, the worst of the season, like you mentioned, is behind us. The full impact will probably not be known to us until we collect April and May data. In the U.K., we can tell you that the outbreaks have declined in recent weeks, too, but still remain elevated compared to recent seasons. So our operators are having to leverage their referral networks and sales processes to minimize the impact on census. So we continue to monitor and we will report on a more definitive information as that comes in to us. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, Mercedes. John Goodey : And Dan, it's John. I'll just add one comment alongside Mercedes there, which is the way the actual industry works is, you don't -- as the flu season rolls down and infection rates drop, you don't suddenly see a deferred rush into the buildings because of multiple reasons.  One of them, obviously, is that the community infection rates, in the general community, not in the senior community, was extremely high this year. And deaths and hospitalizations in general community settings were extremely high. And you've seen that from some of the hospital operators in the U.S. and beyond. So it does actually affect the pool of new residents that would otherwise come into buildings in Q2. So overall, Q2 will still obviously be affected by flu as well as Q1. So again, we remain, as Mercedes said, watching like hawks the data from our operators and from the industry. But it is not a sort of very quick rebound in Q2 from Q1 because of flu. It does take a little time, in fact, often into Q3 or Q4 of a bad flu season for the operators to really get back to where they'd like to be. Operator : Your next question comes from Juan Sanabria from Bank of America. Juan Sanabria : Just going back to the CapEx that is planned to be invested in the ManorCare assets. Is there any return you guys expect to generate from that CapEx or that's fully being funded and paid for by ProMedica? And with regards to the CapEx, like what gives you guys a certainty that, that is in fact going to drive better performance? I mean, you guys had the history with the HealthLease and Mainstreet deal delivering new assets, and that didn't work out exactly as planned. So I'm just a little curious as to why the CapEx would change the weaker trends in skilled nursing? Shankh Mitra : Yes, so first one, that it's ProMedica is spending that capital. We're not spending the capital. I'm sure ProMedica is expecting return on that capital. They're very smart investors and very sophisticated investors. And that's just not return as in financial return but there are also strategic returns, investing in people, investing in systems and processes and buildings and different business lines. So I'm sure they are expecting that. The difference with the number -- I'm glad you brought up the HealthLease transaction. Again, as I mentioned in the last call, every asset is a buy, hold or sell at a price. HealthLease transaction was done at an extraordinary high basis. And I'm not surprised it didn't work out the way we hoped it would work out. This transaction is done at a very, very reasonable basis. And if you do the math, you will figure that out. That gives us the comfort that even in the worst downside scenario, we'll make high single-digit IRR, which you will not find in major -- most transactions these days. So that's sort of -- it's a caution of risk-reward, it's a caution of credit, it's a caution of what kind of salvage value even in the worst-case scenario you think you can get. And that's what we do. We invest capital. Investing capital always comes with some risk. It's just how you structure that and how you protect yourself from the downside is sort of fundamental tenets of our investing philosophy. Juan Sanabria : And then, just on the 1.8 EBITDAR coverage, does that include any income from the home health and hospice business that you guys -- I'm not sure if you're owning that as well as part of the joint venture. It's unclear what's in the JV and kind of what's wholly owned and why that was split differently. But curious on the EBITDAR backing into that 1.8, if it's just the SNF and seniors housing EBITDAR, if it includes some of the home health and hospice earnings. Shankh Mitra : Another great question, Juan. ProMedica will own 100% of the home health and hospice business.  And the coverage we mentioned is pure income from assisted living and post-acute business. It has no income above the line. So it is facility-level EBITDAR that has no other income from the home health and hospice business. Juan Sanabria : Okay. And then, just one last quick question for me.  Just switching gears to the RIDEA business. And just on the vintage portfolio, if you could comment on how that's tracking relative to underwriting and kind of where the current occupancy is in that portfolio. Any sort of update there? Shankh Mitra : Yes. Juan, as you recall, we talked about this last call. We're spending CapEx in the vintage portfolio right now starting from fourth quarter, so occupancy is lower. As we -- as I mentioned, the growth of vintage will be a detraction from our overall growth in the same store. But as we get towards the end of the year going into '19, vintage will be accretive to our growth. So obviously, that's how we are thinking about it from a growth perspective. Vintage, as we said, it will take about 5 years. These buildings were also extremely CapEx starved. In that case, we have obviously baked in the CapEx in our numbers. And as we -- and it's too early to comment it  will [ train ] relative to underwriting. Obviously, this is the first year we're expecting to see some growth in the second half. More appropriate question as we are sitting here next year, and we'll see how it's starting to play out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Tom, I know you said that you didn't want to run away from the post-acute care space last quarter. And obviously, you just agreed to buy QCP. But is the company interested in making additional investments in the post-acute care space after this deal? Or was this transaction just more of a good opportunity that you saw in the marketplace? Thomas DeRosa : We are long-term strategic investors in health care real estate. And you have to be -- you have to understand where the industry is going. And I don't think I would say unequivocally that we would not invest in any sector. The timing has to be right. As you heard, we're paying half for the real estate of what it was paid -- purchased for in the original transaction. So I would say that we will continue to look to deploy capital in the best interest of our shareholders, and that might be in seniors housing, it might be in medical office, it may be in post-acute. I'd caution you to think about this versus the post-acute care structures that exist today across the REIT sector. This is a very different investment. It has strong coverage and is backed by a high investment-grade credit health system. Shankh Mitra : One of the things, Mike, I'll add to that, is if you think about, from our perspective, the underlying assets are obviously post-acute and senior housing. But we are not receiving the cash flow from these assets. We're receiving the cash flow from our partner, ProMedica, who is an integrated payer provider health system. That's very important to understand that, that underlying asset base is important, the basis is important, purely as to think what's going to happen 15 years from now if the lease doesn't get renewed. But for at least for the next 15 -- and that's why basis is important, I talked about that.  But it's important to understand there's no deal like this in the marketplace if I can quote you. We created this opportunity with our partner. There was not -- this deal was not shopped. This deal was not in the marketplace. We and our partner created this opportunity for them and for our shareholders. Michael Carroll : Great. And then Shankh, on the 1.8 coverage ratio that was quoted, what does that imply in terms of an occupancy rate and a skill mix on -- their skill mix that's in the portfolio? Shankh Mitra : As I said, that's the current one. If you look at the coverage, that EBITDAR coverage is the current one. And as I also mentioned, that it is at the lowest occupancy it has been in probably more than a decade. So I will not go more into it. QCP is a public company. You can get into its financial and look at it. But from our perspective, as we think about, we think -- again, we're not going to comment whether this is the year of the lowest cash flow. But we do think that there's significant upside to their cash flow as we think about the next 5, 10, 15 years. Michael Carroll : Okay. And then, just last question, real quick, on the senior housing operating portfolio. Can you kind of describe what your team does researching supply within the portfolio? Were you surprised that NIC revised their supply data higher? And it does look like your supply within 5 miles of your communities jumped a bit this quarter. Did you expect that to occur? And then, does that impact your outlook for your portfolio here in the near term? Shankh Mitra : Yes, Mike, we probably will do an Investor Day at some point to introduce you to our data science team, as we have mentioned that we have assembled an extraordinary data science team from people from different backgrounds, from different industries. And jokingly, Tom said that we have hired more science and maths Ph.D.s in the last few months than finance types. So we do have a different view from NIC. You have seen 2 quarters ago, NIC has a different view. Then the view went up and now it has come back from where the supply is. Our view, NIC data is obviously one of the inputs, but obviously our systems and processes are not based on NIC data. We have a very granular view of where supply is. The jump that you saw in our supplemental that you're talking about is a pure function of assets going in and out. Remember, this is a view of what's under construction. So when things get delivered, that changes. I would not read too much into it. And as I mentioned to a previous question, our view of the year is still the same. Thomas DeRosa : You're in Cleveland, right? Michael Carroll : I am, yes. Thomas DeRosa : You should drive to Toledo and you'd spend a half day, and we'll -- you'll meet our data science team and they'll take you through the variety of sophisticated analytical tools that we use to manage our business. Happy to do that anytime. Michael Carroll : Great. Sounds great. Operator : Your next question comes from Vincent Chao from Deutsche Bank. Vincent Chao : I just had a bigger picture question. I mean, we've heard a lot about the sort of integration of health care delivery and how this is unique in that respect given the vertical integration of ProMedica. But at the same time, we've heard sort of a distaste for acute care, and I think someone mentioned that ProMedica is also not investing in the acute care side. But clearly, that will be a part of the health care delivery system to some degree. So just curious if a deal similar to this one, where the economics really made sense, would you consider investing in the acute care side of things? And if not, just what -- how is this different than, say, the post-acute investment? Thomas DeRosa : Well, I said earlier that we would never red line a sector of health care real estate because that's our business, is investing in health care real estate. We see the acute-care sector as one that requires significant investment and is changing dramatically almost at a rate that we're not quite sure where it will end up. So I think for us, we haven't seen investments in acute care that makes sense for us. We see the future more for acute care systems to rationalize their acute care portfolios. Most CEOs, like Randy Oostra, would tell you they have too many acute care assets because that's how they grew. They grew by acquiring acute-care hospitals. Now that the whole health care delivery model is changing, I think many would tell you that they need to rationalize that and look for other ways to bring their health care delivery system to lower-cost, more modern, consumer-friendly settings. That's the entire theme you are seeing across health care today; whether it's what Humana is doing, whether it's Aetna and CVS, whether it's Berkshire, Amazon and JPMorgan, health care delivery is being disrupted. Mark? Mark Shaver : And Vincent, if I could also add, if you recall last quarter, we announced a partnership with another top health system, with Providence St. Joseph's system, which is top 3 system, to help them develop a -- we call it an outpatient medical. But that facility is 100,000 square foot next-generation oncology center. So complex care in this country is still going to be important, especially with the aging population. And as Tom has mentioned, that our team continues to iterate, partnering with health systems to build out what that -- whatever that next generation needs to be, be it complex cancer or home-based skilled nursing and memory care, we're going to be there as a partner. Thomas DeRosa : Right. If there's a real estate component of it, we need to figure out how to invest in that real estate in the best interest of our shareholders. Shankh Mitra : Vin, to your second question, you asked whether we would invest in other post-acute assets. I do want to be abundantly clear. We would not do these transactions but for ProMedica. So again, every asset has a price. We would buy any asset at a price, but this structure is unique and we are only going into this structure because of our partner and the presence of our partner. Will we ever buy another post-acute skilled nursing asset? Absolutely, if the price makes sense. But you have to understand that it needs to be a risk-adjusted return, proper coverage and the balance sheet of the operator needs to be correct. None of those exist today, generally, in the post-acute industry. If we see something that we really like, we would. But we have never -- we have not seen something like that, at least today. If that changes, we'll let you know. Vincent Chao : Okay. And then, just one last question, just on the SHO portfolio. One of the reasons occupancy, I think, was worse than expected but expenses were a little bit better and just looking at the line items, it looked like the all other bucket was down quite a bit, which helped the overall number. I was curious if you could provide some color on what drove that bucket? Shankh Mitra : This continues to be the same story that we talked about.  Real estate taxes helped, workers' comp helped, also management revenue helped. I talked about that, obviously many of our contracts have provisions for outperformance, underperformance and obviously some of the underperformances on specific sectors and operators have also helped. So some of that -- those other line items drove that particular line. And other than that, I just don't think we have anything else to report. We would prefer that we capture that cash flow at the revenue line. But at least our contracts give us the protection that if it doesn't play out on the revenue line, we can gain some on the expense line. Thomas DeRosa : Okay. We're going to have to cut you off there because we have a long line of questions. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Karin Ford from MUFG Securities. Karin Ford : You are taking leverage up a bit with this deal. Is the long-term plan to bring that back down again and further ramp dispositions? Or are you comfortable with 5.6x? John Goodey : So I think, Karin, we've said before, we're very comfortable in the sort of mid 5s area. We were trending down into the lower 5s before, and that was a strategic move on our part to allow us the room to do exactly this type of transaction. So we're sort of navigating within the channel that we've described that we feel comfortable with. So we like being very solidly capitalized because it gives us flexibility to do things exactly like this. So I think over time, you'll see our leverage drift down from this point over time. But I think we're navigating very comfortably at this level. Shankh Mitra : Karin, I will just add, go back and read the transcript from the last call. I think Tom said very specifically we're at the end of our disposition journey from a portfolio mix perspective. Obviously, we have a large real estate footprint. There will always be things to buy, sell and prune. But overall, as we think where we have come in the journey, we think the major dispositions are all done. From an asset management perspective, we will always be selling some. And particularly, if we see very strong pricing, we might sell some. But overall, portfolio mix perspective, large billions of dollars of disposition should be considered roughly done. Karin Ford : Great. My second question is just on government reimbursement. You're taking up your exposure there again a little bit. What do you expect to hear -- what's your outlook on reimbursement and what do you think we're going to hear in the next few days -- weeks from CMS? Shankh Mitra : First is, I want to -- I'm glad you asked that question. We are not taking up that exposure. Remember, our cash flow comes from an A+ rated health system. This is no different from what you would expect a cash flow from an MOB business, except many MOBs, or medical office buildings, have physician groups who necessarily do not have this type of credit. So from our perspective, we receive the cash flow from ProMedica and ProMedica, as a integrated payer provider, is not thinking about it one quarter or one year of reimbursement. So I'm not going to predict. You're the expert and our partners are the expert, but we do believe that they have a significant plan for the improvement of the cash flow. Thomas DeRosa : Karin, this is a health system investment. Not a SNF investment. I think that is a very distinct point to make here. This is not like other SNF investments you see owned by health care REITs. This is a health system investment. Operator : Your next question comes from Chad Vanacore from Stifel. Chad Vanacore : So Tom, I don't know if you've touched on this but I just want to get this explicit in your view. What value add do you see ProMedica bringing to the table in skilled nursing, given that they're an acute care operator? Thomas DeRosa : Chad, I think that you have to think about these very well-located buildings that they will have a joint venture interest in and that they are investing in. And they see them as alternate sites to deliver care. So I've said this for now a couple of years : skilled nursing has to be reinvented. The real estate is very good quality real estate. And these -- this real estate is in compelling markets where ProMedica can extend its service offerings. So don't think of the old model skilled nursing. This is going to be an evolving asset class. Post-acute is a very important part of the health care delivery system. If you sat here with health system CEOs, they will say, \"I need viable post-acute partners to do what I do and not lose money.\" Because you can't keep people in acute care hospital beds because you don't have a viable post-acute option. So I would tell you that you should look at this carefully and watch what will happen with this real estate. Because it will be much more -- become much more consequential in the health care delivery continuum. Shankh Mitra : Chad, I would add that we need to stop thinking about health care in buckets. As you think about across health care [Audio Gap] going on across provider channels and across payer channels. So as we think about, sitting here, in the public real estate world thinks in buckets, people like Randy don't necessarily think about these things in buckets. They think about these things as a continuum of where they can deliver health care at the most effective cost setting. So with that, we'll go to the next question. Chad Vanacore : Okay. With -- is ProMedica on the line available for a quick question? Thomas DeRosa : No, they're not. They're meeting with their employees right now. Chad Vanacore : All right. So one other quick question for me then. You've structured the transaction, you've got 28 wholly owned assets. Can you tell us, what's the asset mix there? Are those rented to ProMedica or other operators? And then do you plan on retaining or disposing of those? Shankh Mitra : Those assets are -- there are skilled nursing assets, there's surgical hospitals and medical offices.  They will not be rented to ProMedica, will be 100% owned by us. Those assets are roughly 1.7x covered and we will decide what to do with those assets. But we, again, depending on asset and the basis and the locations, every asset is a buy, hold or sell. Operator : Eric Fleming from SunTrust, your line is open. Eric Fleming : Longer-term question, so with this venture with ProMedica and knowing that ProMedica -- rumors of them looking towards China and then also your Chinese JV partners on the post-acute side. Is China an expansion opportunity for you guys longer term? Thomas DeRosa : We don't see that in the near term as a place that we would deploy capital. We're very happy, though, to take capital from China and bring it into the U.S. as you've seen us do and also provide them some intellectual capital about how they can build a better health care delivery network back in China. Operator : Your next question comes from Nick Yulico from UBS. Nicholas Yulico : Just going back to the rent coverage, you say, 1.8x EBITDAR. I'm trying to reconcile that with the QCP numbers. Because they reported $280 million of EBITDAR 2007 (sic) [  2017 ]. At the facility level based on the new rent, it looks like that coverage then would be below 1.6, not 1.8. So how do we reconcile that? Shankh Mitra : I'm not sure I understand that. QCP is -- what QCP's rent with ManorCare has any -- what it has to do with this. We are -- if... Nicholas Yulico : No, no, sorry. Sorry, I'm just saying that QCP reported for ManorCare $280 million of facility level EBITDAR last year. If I use that versus your $179 million rent, that would be coverage below 1.6. So I'm trying to understand why you're citing 1.8, if there's some difference there, some assumption on operations improving or how should we think about that? Shankh Mitra : The total rent is $170 million. Our rent is 80% of that. So that's your difference of calculation. Nicholas Yulico : Okay, that's very helpful. I guess, secondly was -- you talked about the deal was not shopped. Can you talk a little bit more about how it came about? You do have 3 Toledo-based companies getting together here. Also looks like one of your directors, R. Scott Trumbull, is on your board and is also a trustee of ProMedica. Is that info up-to-date? Is that correct? And did he recuse himself from the board decision for the 2 companies? Matthew McQueen : Yes, this is Matt McQueen again. We're not going to get into the details of how the deal was shopped. There's going to be a proxy statement coming out in the next couple of weeks, which will have a detailed background of the merger. And so, I think, just stay tuned for that. Thomas DeRosa : Scott Trumbull is no longer on the board of ProMedica. Operator : Your next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman here with Smedes. I was wondering if you can just go through some of the numbers just going through the $0.20 of accretion, about $75 million of FFO, and can you sort of walk through sort of going from sort of the EBITDA down to how you're financing that to get to that FFO? And then, more of just a question, if you look on Page 11 of the slide deck, you have adjusted EBITDA for the transaction of $201 million on a $2.2 billion purchase, which is much greater than an 8% yield. And so I didn't know if that's a GAAP EBITDA versus a cash EBITDA. So just trying to tie that $201 million versus the yield that you're receiving. Tim McHugh : Michael, it's Tim here. On your first question on the FFO accretion, I think what you're getting at is just back of the envelope on -- you run numbers on our yield and put some financing assumptions, you end up with likely greater than the $0.20 that we've outlined. We put a number in there that we think is fairly conservative. We have disposition proceeds and financing that are both uncertain at this point. And 6 months to close on the actual deal. So I think that we view this as -- we'd rather put a number out there that underlines kind of a conservative approach to it. And then, your question on Page 11 of the presentation we put out last night, the footnote 1 says that the EBITDA is GAAP. So you're correct that EBITDA yield on this transaction is a GAAP EBITDA yield, which is higher than the cash. Michael Bilerman : So should we think about the cash then at 8%, and so the $0.20 of FFO accretion is really like $0.13 on a cash basis and that assumes in that $0.13 some level of permanent financing or floating-rate financing? And does that assume dispositions in terms of funding cost to get to those numbers? Shankh Mitra : Michael, $0.20 is a cash number. The GAAP number is the higher number. So it's not lower, it's higher. So the $0.20 we talked about is a cash number, and FFO impact will be higher. Tim, you want to answer the second question? Tim McHugh : For financing, we assume a rate of debt, as I said in my prepared remarks, $1.3 billion of permanent debt. That's at a rate consistent with our long-term cost of debt. And we do factor in the dilution from asset sales in our accretion math. Michael Bilerman : So from a leverage perspective on a cash basis, leverage will go up a little bit higher than the 5.6, given the numbers presented are on a GAAP basis? Tim McHugh : Correct. Michael Bilerman : Okay. And then, just one on sort of skilled nursing overall. We continue to hear from SNF owners and operators that smaller regional footprints are working better in the space. So what sort of gives you confidence that a regional player like ProMedica can operate a national footprint which clearly has struggled? And I get the fact that this has been overleveraged and hasn't had a lot of capital. But how do you sort of get comfortable with a difference in the way this business seems to have transitioned to much more successful pure-play regional focused operators versus someone trying to operate national in scope, especially someone coming into the space that doesn't -- isn't national today? Shankh Mitra : Yes, Michael, if you think about -- there's a lot of heuristics in our business and this is one of them, that we think that regional operators in -- as a group does better than national operator. But generally speaking, that is true in some states, not true in other states. But if I think about directionally, you are correct. You will see that ManorCare is exiting a lot of states. And just like you have seen in other national operators, and they're concentrating their footprint where they have significant local scale. So this is no different from what you have seen. Tim talked about the dispositions that ManorCare is undertaking right now. The 75 assets, that's what reflects sort of your -- the direction of the industry that you're talking about. But we do not believe there is any general rule that a national operator does better than local, vice versa. You need local scale. If a national operator has a local scale in the market, they do very well. Operator : Your next question comes from Todd Stender from Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Are you guys providing any financing to ProMedica for their acquisition of HCR ManorCare? And then, are you funding -- or are you going to be lending them any money for their growth in upgrade capital? Shankh Mitra : The answer to your first question is no, we're not financing ProMedica. The A+ rated credit which [ will lend ] also cash on their balance sheet. So suffice to say, no. The answer to your second question is no, we're not funding any of their capital. Todd Stender : Okay. And then, the rent escalators. They seem on the high side. Now they're greater -- they're not the 5% that HCP was getting and ManorCare couldn't cover those. But how did you guys arrive at the rent escalators, the 2.75% beginning in year 2? Shankh Mitra : So again, it is a master lease and it's a mix of both asset classes, senior housing as well as post-acute. You have to understand where the cash flow is today versus the historical level of cash flow and understand why that has been the case and what is ProMedica's plan of improving their cash flow. There are certain things that are very simple. You have to invest capital in this business. There's a cyclicality aspect I talked about. Certain things are not so simple. If you think about where patients come from in the post-acute sector.  They come from hospitals, right? So I think that's what we talked about the vertical integration. You also have to think about ProMedica is a major not-for-profit health system. There are significant benefits that comes with it that is obviously will drive the cash flow growth. So we are very comfortable, ProMedica management team is a very sophisticated and smart management team. They are obviously underwritten -- they are very conservative. They have underwritten it in a very conservative way. So we will feel very comfortable over a period of time. But you can see that first year rent escalator is half of that and that's because of the disruption that comes with capital improvement. ProMedica intends to invest a couple hundred million dollars in the assets, and it comes with it the same answer we gave you on vintage. So that 1.375% escalator reflects that reality. Todd Stender : Okay. And just the last question. I'm not sure if I missed this. Are you keeping the ManorCare name? Is there going to be a rebranding? Shankh Mitra : It is ProMedica's decision, not our decision. Todd Stender : And when do you think that'll be handed down? Shankh Mitra : We have no idea. Operator : Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Jefferies. Omotayo Okusanya : There's a lot going on here. I have a lot of questions, so please just bear with me. First of all, I definitely want the same deal you guys are giving Rob Carroll (sic) [ Michael Carroll ] to see your data groups. So I would love to come out with you. Thomas DeRosa : Anytime, Tayo. Please come. Omotayo Okusanya : Great. Then specifically, questions around the transaction. First of all, what -- on a pro forma basis, what would be your skilled nursing exposure? And the reason I asked that is, just going back to Jordan's question about, with increased skilled exposure and all the headwinds around the sector, what concerns do you guys have about a certain part of your business not being -- a lower valuation multiple being associated with the larger part of your company and the potential negative implications for the stock? Thomas DeRosa : So as I've said repeatedly on this call today, I would caution you to look at this investment as we just bought a bunch of skilled nursing assets. What we invested in is a joint venture with an investment grade A-rated health system. So this is -- you're not -- if you look at this as apples-to-apples with other REITs, SNFs investments, you're making a big mistake. Shankh, give Tayo some perspective on this structure. Shankh Mitra : So Tayo, think about it, you cover a lot of probably triple net companies. What do you think a BBB+ rated, CVS Walgreens triple-net lease trades for? Probably in the low 5%. And usually, those leases do not have an escalator like this. So you think about -- you can think about what they should trade at. I would think, with A+ rated credit, which will be now almost 7% of our cash flow, this will be a significant enhancer of the multiple, not the other way around. So think about an IRR, an IRR drives the cap rate. Cap rate is, obviously, inverse of a multiple. Or start from where the triple -- A-rated triple and absolute triple-net lease trades and derive from there what the multiples should be. You can go at it both ways. Omotayo Okusanya : And on a pro forma basis, what's the skilled exposure? Shankh Mitra : Pro forma basis, the skilled exposure is exactly the same. Health system will be about 7% of our cash flow. Omotayo Okusanya : So between that and Genesis, your total exposure still stays the same for skilled nursing? Shankh Mitra : It's because this is not a skilled nursing deal. Our exposure is not with skilled nursing operator. Our exposure at credit is a A+ rated health system. Just like you buy medical office buildings, your credit exposure to the health system behind it -- or a physician group. Thomas DeRosa : Consider this.  If every skilled nursing deal owned by a REIT was structured like what we just did, this would be the highest multiple component of our business. Where do you get this level of coverage and the full strength of a high investment-grade company standing behind that rent? That's what you're getting here. Omotayo Okusanya : I get that. But your rents are still being backed by skilled nursing cash flows from ManorCare's operations, correct? Shankh Mitra : No, it is not. That's the key. It is backed by a A+ rated credit and that is why we've repeatedly mentioned to you that we have the full backing of the balance sheet. Omotayo Okusanya : So there's a corporate guarantee from ProMerica (sic) [ ProMedica ]? Shankh Mitra : Yes. Thomas DeRosa : It's ProMedica. Yes, we have the full guarantee of ProMedica. This is not a SNF deal that you're used to looking at with other REITs. Omotayo Okusanya : Okay.  That's helpful. So that's my first question. Second question is on the SHO side. Could you talk a little bit just about the U.K.? It does feel like there was a little bit more pressure there with the negative same-store NOI growth that came out of the U.K. this quarter. John Goodey : Tayo, it's John, I'll give you just a couple of minutes. I know we're running short of time. So the U.K. had a bit of a perfect storm of operating environment. You've heard, obviously, the impact of the flu, which was global. We also had a particularly -- unfortunately, particularly virulent strain of essentially stomach viruses, which also impacted death rates and occupancy and tours and new entrants into those buildings as well. And you probably saw, unusually for us, we actually had extremely bad weather from a snow point of view in both Q1 and Q2, probably a decade-worst weather outcome for the U.K., which again was significantly disruptive to operations. And you can see, if you want to sort of have a look on the market, some of the retailers in the U.K. talking about their operating performance in Q1, you'll see how impacted they were by days of sales lost. So it's been a bit of a perfect storm there. And so that cumulates into that environment. I would also say that the U.K. had an extremely strong year last year, as you saw, including some quarters where we had double-digit NOI growth. So they have a pretty tough comparator this year across what is a fairly small collection of homes and buildings. Omotayo Okusanya : Okay.  That's helpful. Last quick one for me, on the triple-net senior housing side, again, just kind of given some of these pressures on same-store NOI, how do we kind of think about the kind of 5%, 7%, 10% of on your portfolio that has tight rent coverage today? I mean, should we be thinking about those leases potentially being restructured? Do you think they can kind of withstand the storm they're kind of going through? I'm just kind of curious about that. John Goodey : John here. Good question. I mean, I think they are also clearly impacted by operating environments that we've seen. We work closely with them as well as our senior housing operating portfolio as well. So we're obviously looking at how that will evolve over the course of this year.  Most of them are operating in a pretty decent way. Some are struggling a little bit, but it's hard to give your projections as to what may happen with individual operators at this stage. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : Do you see any risks to ProMedica's A-rated credit rating as they go from regional to national operator and move into a new, albeit related industry? John Goodey : I would say, Jonathan, that's not really for us to comment because we're not them or the rating agency. So we will see what evolves. Jonathan Hughes : Okay, fair enough. And then, just one more.  Curious if there was a similar Arden Courts demand-supply analysis done for the ManorCare assets, more so on the demand side, and maybe how those look relative to your existing post-acute portfolio? Shankh Mitra : Arden Courts is a senior housing operator, so the comparison would be our triple-net senior housing portfolio and it looks very favorably. Of course, you would expect, when we would invest that kind of capital, we will -- that will be one of the first things we'll think about. And it compares very favorably with our existing triple-net senior housing portfolio. Jonathan Hughes : Okay, fair enough. I'll jump off. I look forward to hearing more about the data analysis capabilities next month in Toledo. Operator : Your next question comes from John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : You had same-store growth in your SHO portfolio this quarter despite the 260 basis point loss in occupancy. Going forward, are you going to continue to push rents? Or at some point in your vacancy rates, do you give up some rates to gain some occupancy? Shankh Mitra : So if you think about this, this is -- we don't sit here in Toledo and make those predicaments (sic) [ predictions ]. We have very nimble operators and every market is different. Some market, you have very significant pricing power, such as Southern California. Some markets, you don't. Some markets, some assets come up very close to you. So there is no macro answer. This is -- we do it in a very analytical way with our operators on a daily basis. We'll see what the market holds for us. John Kim : Okay. And then, can you provide some color on the $142 million of impairment this the quarter? Is that related to assets held for sale or what asset types are they? John Goodey : Yes, if you look at the exhibit at the back of our financial release this morning, so the answer is there are some of those. We also had some significant gains, as we detailed, from sales as well. So there's a bit of a balancing act going on there. But it was a fairly regular [ weighted ] quarter from an impairment point of view. Operator : Thank you for dialing in to the Welltower earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation, and ask that you disconnect.",

Omotayo Okusanya - Jefferies Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2018 Welltower Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lori, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President, Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, sir. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Lori. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower's second quarter 2018 results. On the Safe Harbor, we'll hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Mercedes Kerr, EBITDA Business & Relationship Management; Shankh Mitra, Chief Investment Officer; and John Goodey, CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that this projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning's press release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release, you may access it via the company's website at welltower.com. Before I hand the call over to Tom DeRosa, I want to highlight a few significant points regarding our second quarter results. First, as announced last night, Welltower and ProMedica Health System completed the acquisition of Quality Care Properties and HCR ManorCare of $4.4 billion. Second, we are increasing our normalized FFO guidance for the year to a range of $3.99 per share to $4.06 per share from our previous guidance range of $3.95 per share to $4.05 per share. Third, as previously announced, we entered into a value-enhancing restructuring our Brookdale relationship, which will provide improved triple net lease coverage and operator diversification. We also converted our existing 27-property triple net relationship with Brandywine Living to an operating lease structure, which we anticipate will drive both long-term growth and value creation. And lastly, we've closed on a new $3.7 billion unsecured credit facility, improving pricing across our line of credit and term loan facility, extending maturities out to 2022 and 2023, respectively. And with that, I will hand the call over to Tom for his remarks on the quarter. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, Tim. Good morning. Earlier this year, I told you that Welltower was back in business. I hope you agree that last evening's announcement of the closing of our innovative ProMedica joint venture, our solid Q2 results and the increase in 2018 FFO guidance all validate that statement. It's no secret that the operating environment for senior's housing remains challenging. Nevertheless, the benefit of owning a premier major urban market-focused portfolio is that we still managed to deliver some growth over last year. Mercedes will give you some perspective on the current state of the senior housing industry and some insights into why Welltower's operating platform continues to outperform. Welltower is well known for owning the best quality health care real estate in the REIT sector. Owning great real estate allowed us to announce a value-enhancing restructuring of our Brookdale relationships that helps put Brookdale on a more positive path going forward and brings down our exposure to Brookdale from 7.6% to 2.9%. As part of this restructuring, we will move 37 buildings to a new operator, Pegasus, which is owned and operated by our friends and highly regarded industry veterans, Steven Vick and Chris Hollister. We're also bringing the Cogir team, run by the very talented Matthieu Duguay, down from Quebec to run 12 independent living billings in the U.S. We have also restructured our relationship with one of our long-term triple net senior housing operators to a RIDEA structure that will better enable Welltower to capture the long-term value in this excellent real estate located in the super-ZIPs of the mid-Atlantic. Shankh will tell you more about both transactions, but these are examples of how Welltower continues to deliver creative solutions to challenges in the market, thereby creating opportunities to drive long-term shareholder value. In both cases, we will sell nonstrategic real estate and hold on to some very good highly strategic real estate. When you own that real estate, you can only kick the can down the road for so long until you hit a wall, so we are willing to face some short-term dilution related to both restructurings now as these efforts will dramatically improve our operating platform in 2019 and beyond. We could not be more excited to announce the closing of our joint venture with ProMedica to acquire the operating business and real estate of HCR ManorCare and Arden Court. The structure of this transaction significantly improves the credit quality of our income stream and demonstrates how a health care REIT and a super-regional health system can work together to reimagine the settings where health care services will be delivered. You will be hearing much more about this in the coming months. As John Goodey will discuss, the accretive nature of this transaction allows Welltower to increase our 2018 normalized FFO guidance from $3.95 to $4.05, up to $3.99 to $4.06 per diluted share. We remain very excited by the prospects for Welltower in 2019 and beyond. Mercedes will now talk about the current senior housings environment. Mercedes? Mercedes Kerr : Thank you, Tom. Seniors housing operating performance in the U.S. market has been under pressure due to new supply, a severe flu season and growing labor costs. According to NIC MAP's second quarter data, there was an 80 basis point year-over-year decline in occupancy as quarter-over-quarter net inventory growth of 3.3% outpaced an otherwise strong absorption rate of 2.4%. Construction starts over the last 12 months have been trading at or below the rate of projected deliveries. Furthermore, construction as a percentage of existing inventory in NIC's primary markets decreased from 6.9% to 6.3% sequentially. These data points are consistent with the slowing trend in new start. While the market settles into this new supply offering, overall rates have continued to gain, with NIC reporting 2.7% same-store asking rate growth. While not immune to these supply trends, Welltower's operating portfolio continues to show the resiliency we expect from our premier operators in top markets and submarkets. Welltower's REVPOR growth has been strong and consistent throughout this challenging period and we expect that to continue. Construction as a percentage of existing inventory in our top 10 markets was 4.7% in the second quarter of 2018. That's 160 basis points lower than NIC's primary market statistics. In addition, our operating portfolio experienced 3.5% year-over-year growth in the quarter or 80 basis points more than the market average. In addition to these reported statistics, our own real-time data indicates positive momentum in certain previously supply impacted cities, such as Boston. That's a good example of this. As new supply is absorbed, best-in-class locations and care continue to be the most important factors in resident decisions. This helps us to maintain and drive rate while recovering occupancy. Our portfolio's solid footing on rate helps us to manage rising expenses more adequately, and we continue to work closely with our operating partners to leverage Welltower's scale and manage costs. For years now, we have grown our operator advisory services platform, expanding the service office -- offering and driving greater partner participation. These programs target key operating expenses of labor, food, utilities and insurance and drive improvements in service and resident satisfaction. We continue to expand and build upon this platform, and the results are clear. Many operating expense categories were reported to be flat or lower this quarter compared to last. We are encouraged by the decelerating pace of construction and city deliveries reported by NIC. These trends, combined, should result in more balanced absorption. Our operating partners have a disciplined approach to managing the business, and equally as important, they continue to provide best-in-class care for the residents and families that we serve. I'll turn the call now over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Mercedes, and good morning, everyone. I will now review our quarterly operating results across all of our business segments, providing details on our senior housing triple net business with additional background on Brookdale and Brandywine restructuring. As we have described to you, the peak impact of senior housing supply cycle is flowing through our numbers right now, given the starts and delivery details that Mercedes described. Though we're not happy with our senior housing operating results on an absolute basis, within the context of peak supply, we think 0.1% growth is respectable performance at the bottom of the performance cycle. It speaks to the high quality of our real estate we own and the quality of our operating partners. We will not venture to guess how 2019 might look like at this point in the year, but our sense is we're bouncing along the bottom right now. We're really excited about the growth trajectory of our cash flow when we come of this bottom as we are at 86% occupancy in our SHO portfolio. Our triple net portfolio growth has been consistent and predictable. I'll encourage you to look past the coverage change in the quarter as we have significant first quarter transaction that makes the number still, and we should see significant improvement next quarter. I also want to point out that we have significantly derisked that cash flow stream as we have only $28 million of triple net, senior housing and postacute combined, leases rolling before 2024. However, $22 million of that is a well-covered Brookdale Sally lease, and we have effectively taken care of that. Last quarter, when we discussed with you the QCP-ProMedica transaction, we encouraged you to think about the impact of the transaction beyond just a standalone deal. This transaction has been transformational for our strategy and afforded us cash flow growth to offset short-term dilution from portfolio restructurings that we are finishing up to position the company for maximum near-term growth and long-term value creation. Moving on to Brookdale. We applaud their leadership team for their win-win transaction that rightsizes the relationship and leaves us with a Brookdale portfolio that's significantly covered, 1.3x on EBITDAR and 1.51x on EBITDARM basis. For the 60 assets that we are transitioning away from Brookdale, we see significant opportunity for growth as occupancy recovers from around 82% and rent levels are enhanced through the implementation of the new operating plans. We're very excited that senior housing industry's most well-respected turnaround specialist, Steven Vick, is partnering with Chris Hollister to form Pegasus and take over 37 of these buildings. We're equally excited that one of the best independent living operator of North America, Cogir, led by Matthieu Duguay, is taking over 12 of the lower-acuity buildings. The remaining 11 buildings are moving to the six of our operating partners in structure consistent with their existing lease or management agreements. This way, we'll be able to maximize the upside potential by matching location, acuity and operating model to the appropriate operator. I'm also delighted to report that we have converted Brandywine Living from a triple net to a RIDEA structure. This portfolio of 27 communities centered around New York MSA is amongst the highest-quality real estate in our portfolio. Brandywine portfolio has an average of 13 years with a REVPOR, $7,500-plus. And through above-average margins, generates an annual NOI per unit of approximately $29,000, placing them at the top of our portfolio. Despite great operating metrics, the portfolio was over-leased and overleveraged from day one and essentially was covering at 1.0. We executed a classic debt-to-equity swap in the PropCo, OpCo and the management company. After this transaction, we owned 99.3% of the PropCo and OpCo and 34.9% of the management and development company. Brandywine will operate these buildings under next-generation management contract, but we'll share the upside and downside together. We believe this structure significantly improves the alignment of interests. We'll have near-term dilution, mainly due to the conversion of rent to cash flow in recently developed lease-up assets in excellent infill locations. We believe our shareholders will enjoy significant upside from this extraordinarily well-located real estate in the near to medium term. After this transaction, we'll improve the construction of our diversified and balanced portfolio, led by SHO at 47.8%, senior housing triple net at 19%, postacute at 10.4%, outpatient medical at 16.1% and health systems at 6.7%. With significant embedded growth prospects from our 86%-occupied SHO portfolio, well-covered triple net leases and a strong health system-affiliated OM portfolio, we will be positioned well to play both offense and defense. Our health system bucket, which is anchored today by ProMedica, is poised to grow in the future. We believe this investment-grade lease represents the highest quality of cash flow in our entire portfolio with substantial real estate value supported by our exceptionally low basis. As a reminder, we paid $93,700 per bed, blended for senior housing and postacute, and specifically $57,000 per bed for skilled nursing. We believe this is close to 1/4 of replacement cost and salvage values of these properties. As a newly energized HCR management team turns around the performance of this portfolio, with full backing of the capital, health care delivery expertise and the peer capabilities of ProMedica, our shareholders will enjoy significant value creation in this segment of our business. Over the last three years, we have made transformational improvement in our portfolio mix, asset quality, operating platform and deal structures. We have dramatically changed our investment philosophy, built world-class data analytics capabilities that are integrated in our capital allocation process and hired exceptional talent focused on our share, cash flow and NAV growth as opposed to the balance sheet growth. With this significant efforts that we have put into improving our platform, we're now poised to deliver outsized growth for shareholders. With that, I'll pass it on to John Goodey, our CFO. John? John Goodey : Thank you, Shankh, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to provide you with the financial highlights of our second quarter 2018. As noted, we continue to see some challenges in our senior housing markets in Q2. However, as Q1's tough influenza season and winter conditions abated during the quarter, we have seen a relative stabilization in sequential occupancy. Despite the challenges, the quality of our chosen markets of operation, our superior portfolio and operating partnerships continue to deliver good REVPOR growth at 3.5% in Q2 year-over-year. Overall SSREVPOR growth remained elevated at 5%, driven by wage growth due to strength of labor markets in general and increased demand for senior care staff. Overall same-store NOI growth was 1.4% for the quarter, near the midpoint of our full year guidance. And SHO portfolio same-store growth grew by 0.1% in Q2, which as you would expect, we are not satisfied with. Although it is within our full year guidance range of 0% to 1.5%, it is behind our midpoint expectation for the year. Senior housing's triple net growth remained solid at 3.1%, with long-term postacute being 2.3% and outpatient medical growing by 2%. This quarter, same-store growth was augmented with in-quarter acquisitions and joint ventures of $172 million, $75 million in development funding and loan advances of $5 million. 100% of our gross investments were completed with existing partners. We also placed four development projects into service, totaling $89 million in value at a blended stabilized yield of 7.0%. In addition, we completed $67 million of divestments and loan payoffs. Within Welltower, we continue to enact efficiency and automation programs and look for opportunities to focus and improve our operational excellence. These progressive measures enabled us to report G&A cost for the quarter of $32.8 million, being essentially the same as Q2 2017. Overall, we are therefore able to report a normalized second quarter 2018 FFO result of $1 per share. I would like to note that we do not include one-off income items, such as the $58 million lease termination fee received from Brookdale, in our normalized results. That alone could see a significant increase for this quarter's FFO. Turning to our balance sheet and capital activities. Our Q2 2018 closing balance sheet position was strong with $215 million of cash and equivalents and $2.5 billion of capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility. Our leverage metrics were at robust levels, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.4x and net debt to undepreciated book capitalization ratio of 35.6%, while our adjusted fixed charge cover ratio remained strong at 3.5x. In April 2018, Welltower placed a new $550 million 10-year senior unsecured note at T plus 148. This is the tightest spread that 10-year treasuries ever achieved by Welltower. Simultaneous with the notes offerings, we executed a U.S. dollar to Sterling cross-currency swap resulting in an effective rate on the bonds of 3.11%. Post our Q2 close, we executed a new $3.7 billion unsecured credit facility, improving the pricing across both the line of credit and the term loan facilities. The facility includes $3 billion of revolving capacity priced at LIBOR plus 82.5 basis points. We also signed a new $1 billion term loan B in preparation for closing the QCP acquisition. I would now like to turn to our guidance update for full year 2018. We are increasing our normalized FFO range to $3.99 to $4.06 per share from $3.95 to $4.05 per share prior. This is based upon closing of the QCP acquisition and ProMedica joint venture on 26 July, 2018, certain anticipated refinancing activity associated with the QCP acquisition; updated current operational expectations, with the full year 2018 overall expected adjusted same-store NOI growth guidance range remaining at approximately 1% to 2% and disposition guidance increasing to $2.4 billion with a blended capitalization rate of 6.0%, primarily due to Welltower acquiring HCP held-for-sale assets due to the accelerated closing of the overall purchase. As usual, our guidance includes only announced acquisitions and includes all disposals anticipated in 2018. Given the aforementioned projected changes in gains and losses from disposals and other normalizing factors, we're also increasing our expected full year 2018 net income attributable to common shareholders to $2.66 to $2.73 per share from $2.55 to $2.65 prior. On the 21st of August 2018, Welltower will pay its 189th consecutive cash dividend valued at $0.87. This represents a current dividend yield of approximately 5.4%. With that, I will hand it back to Tom for final comments. Tom? Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, John. Why don't we go right to questions. So Lori, please open up the line. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : Congrats on closing QCP and the other deals. I know that involves a lot of time and effort. So obviously... Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, Jonathan. Jonathan Hughes : Yes, sir. Obviously, QCP, and partnering with ProMedica was a pretty unique transaction. And you're very optimistic there, and I share your view. I noticed in the investor deck, and from this morning, this new slide about the increasing involvement of health care systems in postacute. I guess, my question is, have you had more systems call you looking to partner on postacute deals after seeing this one of ProMedica? And what would be your appetite or target exposure to health care systems within the postacute space? Thomas DeRosa : Good question, Jonathan. Well, first of all, I mean, we are very much looking to increase our business with large regional health systems. There are a number of health systems that are currently engaged in the postacute space and find it a very effective way of managing the path of their patients. We had one of those health systems, one of the largest regional health systems in the Northeast was in our offices here in New York yesterday. This health system does have a postacute care division, which includes assisted living and independent living. They are able to direct patient flow between the hospital and these assets and actually share staffing. So it's a very efficient way of managing health care delivery. Your question, have we gotten a lot of inbounds? Yes, we have. Many health systems are now calling us because they've seen the ProMedica announcement. They understand the power that ProMedica we now have with HCR ManorCare, having both a postacute care as well as an assisted living focused on memory care business. These are challenges for health systems. They also noticed -- have noted that ProMedica has a very successful insurance business, which also is something many health systems, if they're not already in that business, are looking to figure out how they have -- are able to offer Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid programs. Again, all with the idea of keeping the patient or consumer in a circle of wellness, to minimize risk in the future. So this is very topical. There are a number of large health systems that have -- are already doing this. You don't hear a lot about that, but there are a lot of health systems who are already in the postacute care, I think you're going to see many of them looking to partner with Welltower in assisted living. I think that's one of the big opportunities. It's all about health systems moving away from the idea that they treat disease solely, that they meet their customer in the emergency room. That strategy is fraught with risk for a health system, who have seen their margins increasingly compressed. You will start to see more cooperation, more collaboration, and Welltower is really the party that is convening these discussions as well as these opportunities. Jonathan Hughes : Okay, that's great. I appreciate the color there, it sounds like a pretty interesting opportunity going forward. Just one more for me and I'll cede the floor. With SHO, the operating portfolio now almost half of the company after the Brandywine transition. I know I would find it helpful if we could maybe get additional disclosure on your new and renewal leasing spreads within that segment, something we get from the apartment REITs pretty commonly. I know it's pretty single in the low single-digit range on an overall basis. But is this something you would be willing to provide us, either right now or going forward? Shankh Mitra : Jonathan, we'll -- absolutely, we always have considered the best disclosure practices. We definitely will consider that. We're very excited about where the business is going, given where it is in the performance cycle. So we'll definitely consider that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford of MUFG Securities. Karin Ford : I wanted to talk about the EBITDAR coverage on the triple net senior housing portfolio. It was 1.07x with just over 6% below the 1.05 level. How much will these numbers improve post the Brandywine and Brookdale restructuring? Shankh Mitra : So Karin, it will -- as I mentioned in our -- my prepared remarks, it will significantly improve. Just remember that Brookdale was above our average coverage for the portfolio, Brandywine was lower, as I mentioned. But net-net, you will see significant improvement when we report next quarter. Karin Ford : Give an estimate as to where coverage will go? Shankh Mitra : I'm not going to venture a guess, but I think once we will get there, you will like it. Karin Ford : Okay, great. And then my second question is can you update us as to the sources and the refinancings that are planned for the funding on QCP deal? John Goodey : Yes, certainly. So to close the transaction, we put in place the new, where we re-stacked our credit line and term loan package, but we also took on a new two-year-termed term loan B. So ultimately, that covers us for the transaction as it is today. You can imagine, we are not intend to sit upon a line drawn to that level and a two-year term loan B with, historically, been quite conservative of financing out acquisitions over time. We have great access to capital markets and we will look to access the markets as we see opportunity to get great pricing. But the good news is we're fully financed. We have no significant sort of financial issue with affording this and our go-forward business plan if there was not access to capital markets. But I think you can anticipate us during something in the future for obvious reasons. Karin Ford : And guidance assumes refinancing or no? John Goodey : It does. It does. Yes, it does. So it assumes refinancing. The transaction, given where the spreads in bond markets versus the spreads on short-term financing structures is not massively accretive to sit on short-term financing like it may have been in the past. So we've built that into our reset of our guidance range today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : I wanted to see if I could spend a second on Brandywine or if you guys could help explain to me little bit. I guess, my perception was that Brandywine, and this may still be the case, was among the highest-quality operators/owners in the space and within your portfolio. And I guess I'm struck by the fact that there's, I guess, yet another -- I don't know if the scenario was a default or some event that caused the restructuring here. And I'm just curious, how do we, and how do you, get confidence that now is the right time to be taking incremental equity exposure at this point in the cycle, from a RIDEA perspective, in senior housing properties? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So if you think about it, we talked about Brandywine. You are correct that Brandywine is actually, that real estate is the highest-quality real estate in our portfolio. I talked about how the NOI per unit, if you look at it, is $29,000-plus with a REVPOR of $7,500-plus is literally the highest in our portfolio. So you're correct about, absolutely, the view of the real estate as well as operating metrics. But as I mentioned, that deal was struck from day one, it was over-leased and overleveraged. And we absolutely have been talking to Brandywine for a long time about conversion from debt to equity. This was the right time we found because we think about it, you can -- not just a Brandywine conversation, you can imagine that we absolutely are getting excited about where we are in the cycle. Business cycles are different from supply cycles and need-based product like assisted living. So while I'm not going to tell you that I believe that we're exactly at the bottom, we believe we're close to the bottom. We're bouncing along the bottom. So that's when you get equity exposure, not debt exposure, right? So we absolutely -- we think this is the right time. We're not trying to time it quarter-to-quarter. Mercedes Kerr : Yes, well, this is a conversation, by the way, that we've been having with Brandywine for quite some time. This is a very precious business to them, and they were really considering all of the options. They recognize this was not a -- I think you asked if this was a default. This was not that kind of a conversation. It was a conversation about optimizing our relationship and the opportunity for growth together. It was about connecting the capital structure of that business in a way that really will drive growth. And so it's not a -- from that perspective, I think we see this as a great opportunity, and Brandywine is going to be a great partner. Jordan Sadler : This was not a default. Okay, so what was -- what were the terms under which Brandywine's prior ownership decided to sacrifice their equity stake to the shareholders at Welltower? So obviously wouldn't -- out of the goodness of their hearts. What's the driver there? Shankh Mitra : So if you think about it, 1x -- effectively, a 1x covered lease, is you're at 100% LTV, right? So from an equityholder, Brandywine equityholders' perspective, that equity obviously is not worth a lot if you are in that scenario forever, right? You also think about the growth opportunities in front of us, just I wouldn't want you to think that this is just Brandywine giving up. We have entered into a next-generation management contract so that if Brandywine performed, Brandywine's equityholders are going to make significant windfall. And as I mentioned in our -- my prepared remarks, now it's aligned, we'll rise and fall together, which was not the structure before. So I don't think they have given up the upside. They will have significant upside, more upside than they had before if they perform very well. Thomas DeRosa : And Jordan, there was an exchange. We have the loans in the Brandywine's management company, and we've converted equity as part of our stake, that 35% interest. So it's not -- there was a change of economics for the management company's estate that we've come on of this with. Jordan Sadler : Is there a senior housing triple net lease within your portfolio that will survive this cycle without a RIDEA conversion or a recapitalization? Shankh Mitra : I think a lot of our triple net leases will survive this cycle. Jordan Sadler : Should we expect more conversions? Shankh Mitra : Not in any material amount. We are always looking to see what assets we own in what structures. Where it should be a leased or a debt structure versus an equity structure. You can feel from our conversation with us in last 3 to 6 months, that we are getting excited about how the next cycle looks like, so we definitely think that there will be leases that, where our interests are aligned, will survive the interest. Thomas DeRosa : Let me just add to that. When we talk about the future of this business. You hear us repeatedly talk about how assisted living will become much more consequential in the overall health care delivery perspective. And we are very much driving that for our senior housing operators. So in a RIDEA structure, we can, and even our shareholders, can capture the value that Welltower is driving to that senior housing operator. In a triple net lease, we don't capture the value, and a lot of this is about our optimism about where this industry is going. If you look in the rearview mirror of the senior housing industry, an industry that was built by real estate developers who believed their wealth would be based on flipping real estate at low cap rates to REITs, that is not the future of this industry. So we are restructuring RIDEA relationships with the operating platforms that we believe have the best opportunity to increase in value because of the role this real estate will play in the overall health care delivery spectrum. Jordan Sadler : That's helpful. I mean, I think we all look to your guys' leadership and your voices and guidance on this topic because I think it is important and it is a little bit uncharted territory. But we are seeing, and as Shankh talked about, peak levels of supply at this point. And while we all want to have that optimism and we all know the fundamental framework and the demographics, I think at the same time, we're seeing a lot of these leases being restructured and we're seeing -- and who knows what happens in a downturn? This is a prolonged economic expansion. And so I think we're trying to understand the risk and gain comfort. Thomas DeRosa : Yes, Jordan, I appreciate that, and that's very valid. The issue here is that the population is shifting. This 85-plus demographic starts to increase at a rapid pace starting in about 18 months, is when you'll see the beginning of that. So I appreciate the view, and we're concerned about the overall economy like everyone else is, but if we don't have solution to manage the health and wellness of an increasingly aging population, we have a lot of problems as a society. And we believe that we are structuring Welltower to really capitalize on that threat and that -- and create opportunities around that. This is something that you'll be hearing more from us about. When you hear us say that we are talking to health systems, the major health systems in this country, about the assisted living business, that is a leading indicator that this business is changing. And it's changing, at least, with respect to Welltower. Operator : Your next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi. Bennett Rose : You talked about this a little bit, but I just want to understand a little bit better the change the guidance. Because your initial guidance was for $0.20 accretion from QCP, and it just seemed like it would be a little bit higher, given the timing of the closing. So is that accretion just being offset by some of the changes you just talked about with Brandywine? Or is it more to do with timing of asset sales? Or if you could just speak to that a little bit. John Goodey : Yes. Smedes, it's John. I can give you some guidance on that. So yes, basically, the answer is yes. So the long-term accretion we said would be in the range of $0.20 per share. The only slight change we have on that is we have a couple of extra dispositions. So we've got the $400 million that we're essentially warehousing on their way through, so we have to finance those, so that drags a little bit on FFO because, you remember, these are not particularly cash flowing to us on the income side, but we are having to finance those on the balance sheet side. We also put in an extra just over $100 million of dispositions. That we're not underway by QCP in their sort of tail portfolio, so that will give us circa another $0.01 of sort of dilution for this year -- for the remainder of this year. You're right, the Brookdale and Brandywine restructurings, and obviously, the below-midpoint performance to date of the SHO portfolio are what basically make up the difference and why, if your math was, why we're not at $4.08, but we're at $4.025. Essentially, they're the building blocks that sort of get you to that number. And I think we're being a little bit conservative just for reasons of conservatism as well. Bennett Rose : John, shouldn't you have a little bit more benefit, I think, in that $0.20? You had the 4.5% sort of long-term debt cost. And clearly, you're financing at least, additionally short-term, then you're going to go out. So that would have been a positive offset to warehousing some of these dilutive assets that you're bringing oat the balance sheet. It just seems like a pretty wide spread, that number should be closer to, call it, maybe $4.10 for the balance -- for the year versus the $4.025 midpoint. And maybe you can just be a little bit more specific in terms of the building blocks or each of the pieces of what's going on. And then wrapped around in that, I mean, as guys moved your earnings a week earlier, I don't know if that is indicative of being -- going out and being arguably in the market, either debt or equity -- and/or equity. So maybe just can you talk a little bit about bringing the earnings forward a week? John Goodey : Yes, sure, certainly. So I mean, warehousing the $400 million doesn't unfortunately give us any upside from an earnings point of view, only downside because these are not income-generating assets. We're just bridging the ownership of that. You're right, that if we were to hold on that line and the TLB, we would have a small pickup. And genuinely, it's quite small when your LIBOR's obviously expended quite a bit. And we're sitting at 82.5 on the line and 90 on the TLB. So there is a spread that's not as much as you'd think. So we've built into the $4.025 midpoint a refinancing of those through the various actions that we believe we need to take. Moving the earnings up was because, a, we have the announcement of closing and we were ready -- essentially ready to announce our earnings for the quarter, it seemed a bit discoordinated to have a closure of the QCP and ProMedica joint venture, update our guidance, because remember, we promised you once we closed and we knew the impact on 2018 full year, we'd give you guidance. So we'd end up giving you guidance a week before giving you our financials, and that's always fraught with danger. So we thought the best thing was accelerate it, were QCP to close before earnings, would have otherwise been released. So it gives us the opportunity to access the markets as we see fit. Again, I come back to my statement. We are expected to be judicious when we raise capital, and we've given ourselves a long window, technically, to be able to refinance the short-term borrowings. So as we see attractiveness in the various markets we can access, then we will do so. But the moving earnings up wasn't that we were anticipating doing something tomorrow, as an example. It was just to do that. Shankh Mitra : And Michael, I will just add that as we have told you, the equity portion of the ProMedica-QCP deal will come from disposition, and our assumption continued to be -- continued to remain so. So that's how we'll be thinking about it and will continue to think about it. We're not anticipating common equity to fund that deal. Bennett Rose : All right. The building blocks on the same-store [indiscernible] other transitions, that is like a $0.08 annual hit that we should think about for next year? I'm just trying to understand the accretion from the QCP transaction. I'm trying to understand the dilution this year, more importantly, to '19 from the Brookdale and other movements you've made that will obviously annualize into next year. Tim McHugh : Michael, from a building block perspective, I think maybe the easiest way to simplify it would be our original midpoint of guidance was $4. As John mentioned, year-to-date, we're the lower end of our initial SHO guidance range of 0% and 1.5% and that's kind of these variables if you think about our business lines and their impact on FFO. So that's kind of taking us from $4 down about $0.015. And we mentioned some Brookdale restructuring happening in July. We mentioned that was $5 million on a full year basis. That's a little front-end weighted, so about $3 million of that is impacting the second half of '18. And Brandywine, about $0.02 impact to the back half of '18. Importantly on that front, a little less than $0.01 of that is from the conversion of the loans I spoke to earlier, the Brandywine ManCo that we converted in equity in the management company. And a little over $0.01 is from essentially a roll down of rents to the actual cash flow level and a couple of very high quality developments that Brandywine has. So those will actually be accretive to where rent was by 2019. So if you take the fundamental performance of our SHO and the restructurings, you get kind of to the lower end of our initial guidance. And then to your point on this being a little more accretive than the original $0.20, given just the near-term financing, it probably does, where this would run on a $0.20 basis, this would run about $0.08 accretive to '18. You're right, it probably is closer to $0.10, just hasn't financed right now. But as John mentioned, warehousing $400 million in assets, that's about $0.01 drag. That goes away towards the end of the year even -- not even into '19 as we sell those assets. And then you mentioned, we sold $107 million former QCP assets that were part of the -- obviously, not part of the ProMedica side. It's about $0.01 dilutive to back end of the year and $0.02 dilutive to kind of that $0.20 original number, but obviously, also brings us to a lower pro forma leverage point than the 5.6 that we highlighted initially in the transaction. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore of Stifel. Chad Vanacore : So sticking with Brandywine for a second. Just -- I just want to get a few more details. You mentioned Brandywine covering about 1x. How has that coverage changed over the past 12 months? Shankh Mitra : So when I said Brandywine was covering at 1x, you think about that is the stabilized asset, not the development asset. New York, New Jersey, as we have just told you, has been under last six months or so, under pressure. So last six months, directions probably down. Or the one before that, if you go back and look at our calls, you will see those markets were doing very well. So it's up. So net-net, it's hard to pinpoint exactly in 12 months. But as you think about it, it's probably six months doing better and last six months doing worse. So net-net, we probably land in a slightly worse position, just I'm talking about the stabilized asset. Chad Vanacore : All right. And Tim pointed out that Brandywine, you expect a $0.02 impact with second half dilution, is that correct? Tim McHugh : Yes. Something in that order of magnitude. Chad Vanacore : Got it. And then if that's covering, well, I guess, between stabilized -- it's hard to get between stabilized and development. But that dilution does imply you expect further deterioration this year before improvement on that portfolio? Is that correct? Shankh Mitra : No, if you think about that dilution, that Tim talked about, we have three very large development asset that is dragging down that number. But on a stabilized basis, we do think that portfolio will be fine this year and probably will add to the growth next year. Chad Vanacore : So Shankh, fair to say, do you think, the stable portfolio is going to get better, the developed portfolio is going to get better from here? Shankh Mitra : Yes. Chad Vanacore : Okay. Then why not transition these properties to a new operator? And what levers can that current Brandywine management pull to actually improve those operations? Shankh Mitra : So if you look at the operations, I want to make sure that you guys understand. We're talking about fixing a capital structure, not operations. Brandywine is a very good operator. If you look at the CAGR NOI growth of the Brandywine assets, it outpaced our portfolio by about 190 basis points. So this is not a question of operation, this is a question of an over-leased, over-levered structure, the one that we fixed. So there is a difference. I want you to really focus on that. This is the highest-quality portfolio we have. Chad Vanacore : Well, presumably, it's a high-quality real estate. But what's been the trend in occupancy and rate with them over the past 12 months? Shankh Mitra : So again, I want to make sure that you understand, we don't make decision based on the last 12 month. If you look at the history of this relationship, their CAGR growth, NOI growth, has been about 190 basis points better than our portfolio average. So it has been very good, operating trends have been very good. Last six months, nine months, New Jersey, New York region had a lot of supply, so that has not been good. But we don't make decision based on the last six months, nine months. We think that Brandywine is a good operator, it's a great real estate and they deliver exceptional care. So we're very confident that you will see significant improvement in these assets. Thomas DeRosa : Chad, so Brandywine is just another example of fixing a broken capital structure that resulted from a period of time when health care REITs were valued based on how large they could grow their asset portfolios. And I think if you know look back over what we've been doing over the last two years, we have been fixing a lot of overlevered situations. This has been what has gotten many good operators in trouble. And what you have to do is figure out who are the good operators that overlevered and who the bed operators that overlevered? If you've seen us exit operators, it's been the ones that we did not believe will be able to participate in this next cycle in the senior housing industry. But when we see an operating platform that is over-levered, but that we believe can participate in this next operating cycle, we're going to restructure that so we and our shareholders can capture the upside. Shankh side, we're not making decisions based on the next 12 months. We don't run this company for the last 12 months, we run this company for the long term and for driving shareholder value. So I would ask you to look closely at what we're doing. We are being proactive. We're not acting out of desperation when we make these decisions and do these types of restructurings. It's all for how do we participate in the upside that we see coming just around the corner. Shankh Mitra : And Chad, if you go back and look at what we talked about when we did the Sagora restructuring, we mentioned that three of our best operators in our triple net business -- triple net bucket, Sagora, Brandywine and Legend. And we have told you, as our shareholders are well aware of, that we are always intended to have the equity upside in those assets, in those portfolios. And it always depends on the management team when -- where they are in their cycle of growth from an expansion perspective, from an operating perspective, it's relationship. We can't drive this decision just on our own. We have a great partnership with our operating platforms. And when the time is right, we do these transactions. But obviously, we're allocating capital, but the shareholder benefit to maximize shareholder value. And I want you guys to think about not just the business cycle, but the demand and supply cycle of a need-based product called senior housing. Chad Vanacore : All right. I've just got one more quick question. Tom, your desire to expand partnerships with health systems. Are these health systems calling you on postacute primarily? Or would these include hospitals and specialty hospitals as well? Thomas DeRosa : They're calling us -- very rarely does anyone bring up the idea of owning a hospital. And again, we're talking about the major super-regional health systems in this country. They're not really looking for us to partner around their hospitals. It's really everything but the hospital, is what they're talking about with us and exploring. So I would stay tuned on that. There's a lot of discussions on going on. ProMedica is the first real good example of what I believe you're going to see more of in the future. And again, it's important that we're positioned to participate in this next growth opportunity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of Mizuho Securities. Richard Anderson : So when I'm kind of listing to this call, it occurs to me, there's a lot of whack-the-mole type stuff going on here to kind of fix problems created by the REITs themselves. And I'm not just thinking about you, I think everybody is a little bit guilty of over-investing at the heyday of the expansion. But you have Genesis, wham! Brookdale, wham! Brandywine, wham! And I'm just wondering, are there any more large-scale sort of items like that, that have to be fixed? Or you think it's more smaller-scale stuff that has to get done to get through this cycle? Shankh Mitra : Rich, that's a great question. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we believe that we're towards the very end of that restructuring phase. So we wanted to talk about -- Tom mentioned the last quarter's call, and the call before, that we see 2019 onwards and earnings growth, cash flow growth, NAV growth. So we wanted to obviously accelerate a lot of these things this year so that we're not looking back. So as I mentioned and alluded to in my prepared remarks, we feel we're largely done. Just remember that from -- but your question was based on any large relationship were largely done? We're active asset manager. There will always be something that we'll look at and think about what is the right structure. But the crust of your question, we -- absolutely, we think we're largely done. Richard Anderson : Okay. Looking at the supplemental, I notice the same-store pool came down by 25 or so assets, 461 to 435. Can you just explain that to me, and what implications it had on your same-store guidance? Shankh Mitra : Yes, I'm really glad you asked that question. I say that in a bunch of notes. So if you think about 12 of those assets are in new England. New England, we have been talking about New England is coming back. That particular operator in New England has mid single digit growth this year. So obviously, if you think about the NOI per door of New England versus the other assets, which are effectively Brookdale assets, they're very different. So the New England portfolio would have been a positive impact, the Brookdale assets would have been a negative impact. I'm not going to give you the number exactly the impact would be, but I would like you to think about the NOI per door and the implications, and then you will get to the conclusion you are trying to gather. We -- specifically, that particular New England operator, and as Mercedes mentioned, the Boston area, is coming back strongly. It had the highest growth in our portfolio. Richard Anderson : Okay. And then maybe a broad question for Tom, I think earlier in the call, someone asked about enhanced disclosure sort of consistent with what we get from the multifamily rates. Do you think, let's just say you're 100% RIDEA, or let's just look at the 40-some-odd percent of your portfolio that's just RIDEA. Do you think that's worthy of a multifamily multiple? Or do you acknowledge that maybe there should be some discount to the multifamily multiple for those assets? Thomas DeRosa : I don't like to think any of our assets should trade at a discount to where high-quality real estate trades. I think give it some time, Rich. I think that, again, senior housing -- the senior housing business to me is still being looked at in the rearview mirror. You've heard me say that this is -- a lot of the senior housing assets in the country were built for a generation of people that died five years ago. The business is changing. So -- and we are in a transition phase. So it's hard to demonstrate the true economic impact of this real estate right in this market we're today. I'm going to tell you, I actually think this will trade at a premium in the future to many sectors of multifamily because of the demand around this -- the demand and need for this sector and for a new, a reinvented asset to meet the demands of that sector. So I think it's one, Rich, where there's a lot of upside. That's how we think about it. Richard Anderson : But when you think about new lease rate growth in multifamily, the reasons why there's a new lease is a different than why there's a new lease in senior housing. So you imagine that someone who leaves the senior housing asset, they're probably paying the most. And a new -- and anyone who comes in to replace that person is going to play sort of the least, the lowest acuity level until they kind of need more sort of care. So it's always going to be a headwind, the same-store relative to multifamily. Would you agree with that on that issue alone? Thomas DeRosa : John has me in a headlock here. So it's chomping at the bit to answer your question. John Goodey : It's a good question, Rich. I mean, mostly as in assisted living, you're charging, if you like, for room and board and care. And obviously, on average, people move in at a lower care need than when they move out because a lot of our move-outs were obviously, unfortunately, RIPs. But when you've got thousands and thousands of units, obviously, statistics apply. So on average, you are sort of at the average point. So we do look at -- and I noted down the question here. What is the re-leasing spread on the unit? On the room? Because if there is a supply issue in the market, sometimes, there will be a room rate discount, a transient room rate discount, to induce someone to come in. But I don't believe any of our operators ever discount care. I mean, would you want to be on discount care if someone was looking after you? I know I wouldn't be. So people don't discount care. So there's a sort of a two-part equation to the revenue that a room generates. But we do watch those statistics quite carefully because they're a bit of a diagnostic about how that individual building in that individual market, how that leasing is going. So you can look beyond just what is \"occupancy\". But on average, of course, as a senior leaves a building, they leave behind on a higher revenue stream than a new senior moving in mostly because of care. Again, you're talking about thousands and thousands of units from a statistical averaging point of view. Shankh Mitra : I'll just say that if you think about a cap rate or a multiple question, it's a functional IRR. It's an output, not an input, right? So if you think about an IRR is driven by growth, so think about that compares to a multifamily, is it's a higher-margin business. At the same growth rate, multifamily probably should have a higher multiple. But when the growth rate changes, that if you solve for the same IRR and lower downside as you are thinking, I mean, look at where we are in the -- at the bottom of the cycle and compare that where multifamily was at the bottom of the cycle. So you build IRR, at the growth part of that IRR cycle, you will get a lower cap rate or higher multiple. So there is not specific question, it's just where you are in that life cycle of a product. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Egan of Morgan Stanley. Kevin Egan : Just a quick question for me. So on the QCP deal, a sizable portion was Arden Court. Now that's definitely not in your core market, so I was just curious. Are you looking to tweak your strategy and maybe further expand into more of a mid-market product or a non-coastal market? Shankh Mitra : So QCP, you thinking about the Arden Court portfolio, you're right that it is not in the costal markets, but I would encourage you to think about that we do need a more affordable memory care -- I mean, affordable is a relative term. If you think about Silverado [indiscernible] which we loaned, is in the tens of thousands of dollars range and Arden Court will be $6,000, $7,000 range. So affordable obviously is a relative term. But we do need that product in affordable market. From our perspective, purely thinking about the cash flow, remember, it's an absolute triple net lease for 15 years with a growth rate baked into it. So from a cash flow impact perspective, that's how we think about both sides of the equation. Thomas DeRosa : Kevin, we have been looking for a mid-market memory care business for quite some time, and we have had our eye on Arden Court. In the memory care space, in the pure play memory care space, we have a very high-priced operator, which is Silverado. We really think Arden Court is going to become a very important platform for us because of the needs that will be dramatically accelerating over the next 3 to 5 years and beyond. And because we believe the co-location of Arden Court with the now ProMedica HCR ManorCare postacute care assets will help drive census to those assets. So we think this is -- we haven't talked a lot about Arden Court. We think Arden Court is a real, as John just said, hidden gem in this acquisition. So we're very excited about this. Kevin Egan : And then just in terms -- just now that the deal is closed, can you talk about when we should expect to see the revenue and cost synergies? Shankh Mitra : Can you say that one more time? You -- we couldn't hear you properly. Kevin Egan : Sorry about that. So just in terms of the cost synergies associated with ProMedica, now that the deal is closed, can you just talk about when we should expect to see those cost synergies being realized? Shankh Mitra : Kevin, we have nothing to add right at this point. I mean, you can imagine, the deal closed yesterday. So really nothing changed overnight. I mean, we're still thinking about synergies that we talked about before. But we'll have more to report soon. Just remember, the deal closed last night, so really, nothing changed overnight. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Juan Sanabria : Just wondering if you guys can clarify on the RIDEA sort of business, why the total number of assets went down in the same-store pool. I didn't get the explanation for that. And then secondly, as part of that, how are you feeling about guidance? You didn't change the range. Are you just more comfortable at the low end at this point, given the first half trajectory? Or are you expecting a ramp up in the second half to get to the midpoint? Shankh Mitra : So I will answer the first part of the question. So if you think about the 26 assets so, as I mentioned, that 12 of those are the assets that we are selling with the -- in New England. So they are held for sale, so that's why they changed. And the Brookdale assets, they're obviously being transferred to a different operator, so that's why they changed. And I think you got the explanation of how that will impact the NOI performance. Again, think about not just the number of assets, the NOI per door. As we mentioned to you, this particular operator with 12 assets that we're selling has that high single-digit growth rate, Brookdale would have been negative. And think about how that NOI per door calculation will impact our numbers. So you will get to a pretty good place. John, you want to answer those guidance question? John Goodey : Yes, Juan. And so on guidance, I think we noted in the remarks, and also Tim said, that we do not generally re-forecast the component parts of same-store NOI in total during the year. And we did say that with obviously a 0.6% print in Q1, a 0.1% print in Q2, we're not anticipating that we will be in the upper end of our range, but more likely to be in the lower end of our range. And that's why we said we'd probably be $0.015 or so behind expectations on NOI for same-store. So we're not anticipating. Our numbers do not include a rebound in the second half of the year to get us back to midpoint. Juan Sanabria : Okay, great. And then just a question for you, Shankh. You noted in the prepared remarks that you dramatically changed the acquisition focus. I think those were your words. So I was just hoping you could talk us through the pecking order of investment opportunities, where you'd like to invest incremental dollars across the different property types and kind of cap rates as you see them today. Any change there? I think you've talked about before an expansion in seniors housing and medical offices, is that still what you're seeing in the market today? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So Juan, when I talked about dramatically changing the investment philosophy, I don't -- that's -- I was not thinking about product types. We're agnostic of product, that we would buy anything that makes money on a risk-adjusted return basis for our shareholders. So from a product perspective, there is no -- absolutely no change. The change in the investment process is one where we're focused on total return, we're focused on per share growth, not just the balance sheet growth. We're focused on IRR. So we're a total return based investor. We're not just focused on what the cap rate investors -- or frankly speaking, from the go-go days of expanding balance sheet investor. That's what I intend to mean. Juan Sanabria : Any change in cap rates that you're seeing? Any evidence of that? Shankh Mitra : Cap rates have -- is, again, a very difficult thing to talk about because what you are capping is matters the most. Cap rate is a concept of stabilized asset, which I think most people miss in the public markets. We're not seeing much change in the IRR expectations. However, change in the growth rate assumptions of some of the models that we see in the auction field, where we don't necessarily participate, we do see that those are coming down. That would automatically imply that cap rates are going up. But from our perspective, we don't necessarily participate on those. But we do see cap rate pressure. We don't necessarily see IRR changes. Juan Sanabria : And just lastly, just fundamentally speaking, from the seniors housing perspective, I know you guys don't want to get into '19 and when exactly we'll trough, but hoping you could just maybe lay out the bull and bear case as we think about kind of medium term growth in seniors housing. Like, what's the bull case for '19 recovery? Or what's the bear case in your mind? And just how you're thinking about the puts and takes there? Shankh Mitra : So Juan, I mean, you know the answer. It's the supply, obviously, is the primary factor. Demand is starting to come back. Obviously, as Tom said, that you see bigger impact of that in '20. So it's very hard to say quarter-to-quarter. We do believe that we're seeing in the numbers that a lot of the markets that went into the supply cycle first is coming now. And we'll see where it lands. I mean, obviously, there's a law of large numbers on supply, but there's also large numbers on the expenses. They have been going up for five-plus percent CAGR for a long time. So we'll see where it already land together. It's very hard to comment where it will be exactly, but if we didn't think that we are at the bottom, then we will not have made some of the portfolio changes that we have made. Mercedes Kerr : Yes. And I would add two more things. First, I think I talked a little bit earlier about absorption, which continues to, frankly, be quite strong. And we think that some of the trends in the pipeline are going to be helpful if there's a slowing down, if you will, of new starts. So absorption should be taking hold, and I think that, that's going to be helpful. But then separately, I would also say that we really study this, and some of our comments are really, I think, from a perspective that is very individual for a portfolio as opposed to sort of the generalized metric that you might get from NIC, for example. You probably already know that we do a lot of work that is very individual in terms of just serving our markets. We look at new supply and study what the impacts of new supply might be on a very, very particular base as these are proprietary type of tools that have been created by our business insights team. So that's really what we're -- where we're coming from when we look at this, the comments that you've heard here today about the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Lukas Hartwich : Your valuation's improved quite a bit in recent months. I'm just curious if that's changed your view on capital allocation priorities. And if so, how? Shankh Mitra : Our capital allocation priorities have not changed. Regardless of our valuation, if there is an asset or a portfolio that's trading at a price that is -- that does not give us total return to improve long-term growth rate, we don't want to play the game. You have seen how that played out for a lot of these companies. We're not going to go back and do that. We only allocate capital if we can make money on a per share basis. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Stephen Sakwa : Most of my questions have been asked. I just wanted to focus on the dispositions. You guys did raise that guidance by $500 million, but the cap rate also on that blended average dropped about 100 basis points. Year-to-date, you've done about a $1 billion at a 7%, but you're now looking for $2.4 billion and a 6%. Can you just kind of walk us through kind of what's coming? And why the cap rates, I guess, are so low on the back half dispositions? John Goodey : Yes, certainly. So I think our original guidance ex the QCP held for sale and the extra $100 million, we've anticipated being still around 7% number. So the change entirely relates to the mathematics, including those sort of legacy QCP transactions into our overall dispersion guidance. Tim McHugh : Steve, on the QCP side, I'll also clarify this. So in our original transaction, when we outlined it, there's $500 million of assets that are former HCR ManorCare assets that are being sold and transitioned. So we talked about this in the original transaction, it's kind of the mid-$50,000 per bed that are largely under contract, going to be sold over the next 2 to 3 months. When we originally talked about the transaction closing at $930, a large majority of it will be closed and off of our balance sheet by then. And they're non-rent-paying in the meantime. So there's $400 million left of these former HCR assets. They will all be sold kind of between now and likely the end of October. But for the meantime, the impact on earnings will be a drag contract from essentially that balance sitting in our line. So when I outlined kind of the impact on guidance to Michael earlier, that was kind of the $0.01 drag. But it goes way, doesn't long-term impact to the accretion of this deal. But from a blended cap rate perspective, those are being sold with zero cap rate. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein of Capital One. Daniel Bernstein : Real quick question. I'm just trying to reconcile the increase in SHO versus comments about more collaboration or more interest from the hospital systems and assisted living. Are those hospital systems going to be thinking about triple net leases? Or maybe more RIDEA leases? And maybe from your investment philosophy, whether those should be in triple net or SHO if that happens going forward? Thomas DeRosa : Dan, I would say that we're discussing both structures with health systems that are interested. I think it's early days for those, who are not already in the business. But I -- and they don't really understand the RIDEA structure and this is all new to them. So honestly, I think the RIDEA structure, we were literally in a discussion yesterday with a major health system about an assisted-living project, and this was a new concept for them. I think they thought it was very interesting. And I think they come into the discussions thinking that we're talking about triple net leases, and I think they walk away with perhaps a better appreciation that -- for the fact that RIDEA may offer them a better longer-term return in that property. Shankh Mitra : And then I would also say that I don't want you guys to think that because we converted some triple net to RIDEA, that we think that RIDEA is the structure and triple net is not a good structure. What -- all we are trying to do is to align interest. A well-covered triple net lease, it has significant alignment of interest. Where you get into trouble, when it's not covering, the operator does, is not making money, they're not investing in the asset, so you are in sort of that vicious cycle, that's where the problem is. A well-covered triple net lease can be -- can have significant alignment on interest from both parties, and we're absolutely open to the structure. We're just not going to do cleanly capitalized [indiscernible] covered leases. That's where we're not interested. If it is equity, just call it equity. Just -- we don't want to put it in some sort of a fa\u00e7ade of debt, when it is really is equity. Daniel Bernstein : Okay. No, I would think, given the increasing leverage in the hospital space with all the mergers, they might be looking at ways to not over-leverage their balance sheet and over-monetize. So I appreciate the color. Mark Shaver : This is Mark Shaver. I just want to add one point. Part of what we're also discussing with health systems is how our senior living platform's more consequential to their care delivery. So some of the conversations are not necessarily about the hospitals owning their own assisted living or joint venturing with us, but how do they become more consequential to their postacute network. And so as we start thinking about the rise in dementia that we're going to see in this market, our operators, Silverado, Sunrise have seen, where they can provide care to patients coming out of the hospital in a lower-cost cutting to free up those hospital beds. That is an extension of how we're trying to create linkages between our senior living platform and health systems. So there's multi-phases to the conversations of how we're going to link these programs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Two-part question on your SHO results. First, I think Shankh, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that we're going to be bouncing along the bottom in the next couple of quarters. Do you think, from an occupancy perspective, that we will be going through a normal course of seasonality trends off of this lower occupancy base? Or will the impact to supply offset the typical pickup in the seasonality? And secondly, Canada also decelerated significantly this quarter. I just wanted some color on what was driving this. Shankh Mitra : So I'll take the first part of your questions. We are seeing seasonality and improvement in the occupancy. John, you want to talk about Canada? John Goodey : Yes, I think Canada equally had some tough flu and tough influenza. There is, in selected markets -- not like the U.S., there is selective market supply in Canada as well as, so you saw a little bit of rate pressure compared to a sequential prior quarters and a little bit of occupancy pressure compared to prior quarters. So the operating market there is just a little bit more difficult in the recent past than it has been in the longer-term past. John Kim : And secondly, on QCP, can you provide any color on who the competing bidder was? Shankh Mitra : Well, obviously, we're not going to get into the conversation of who. I'll tell you that, overall, it was a large private equity firm. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : I just have, I guess, a bigger question. And Tom, maybe you can answer this, is how do you guys think about your portfolio diversification? I know today, you have a pretty high concentration to senior housing assets. Is that still something that Welltower likes? Or is that some of the reasons why you pursued the QCP deal? Thomas DeRosa : Well, we like the senior housing business. And what differentiates Welltower is that it's quite -- our senior housing portfolio is quite diversified by operator. So it's a business we like, it's a business we believe in. The partnership with ProMedica to acquire HCR ManorCare is an example of how we're going to link this senior housing business more closely with the business of a health system which includes postacute care. And I think you just heard a little bit about how assisted living and memory care may become more consequential in how health system manages the journey of their patient or consumer. We're very focused on the fact that how health care is delivered, the settings by which -- where health care will be delivered in the future. It has to change, and it is changing. And the ProMedica HCR ManorCare partnership with us is the best example that one can point to. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Most questions have been answered. I was just wondering, can you give us an update on the 56th Street project, where you are in terms of that? And then are you also evaluating other sites in Manhattan as well? Mercedes Kerr : So we're very pleased with the progress that we've been making on East 56. And everything going according to plan. Timing is according to plan. I think one important milestone that we're looking forward to at the end of the this year is the topping off of the site, which is a lot of progress. But again, everything as planned, on time. Our partnership with Hines and the work that Sunrise has done in the design and everything else is going as we were thinking. And then with respect to the rest of the market, we're always looking for opportunities in markets that we think are prime for demand and so on. There's nothing to speak about specifically. But certainly, we look at New York, we look at Los Angeles, we look at Toronto, we look at all of those kinds of market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Jefferies. Omotayo Okusanya : Two quick ones for me. First one, again, around the whole senior housing. And again, we've had a very long discussion about it in the call today. But given that the NIC data is still forecasting well into 2019 additional occupancy loss, how are you guys really kind of thinking about that? How are you stress-testing different scenarios to ensure that your portfolio kind of does okay through that process? And again, the reason I ask is, clearly, a lot of concern around kind of credit portfolio restructuring, exactly what does that mean on a going-forward basis? Shankh Mitra : Yes, so if you think about it, we don't obviously make investment decisions based on NIC data. We have very sophisticated data and analytics platform that we think is unmatched, not only in the health care, real estate industry, we think it's unmatched in the real estate industry. So we have a very, very granular view of supply. So which clearly has a different -- can give you a different answer from if you're just looking at NIC data. So that is first, I'll tell you. That's the first answer. The second answer is philosophically, you think about you guys are concerned about a liquid asset, like stocks, you would probably trying to exactly time when the performance is going to bottom, when the performance can come up, that's not what we do. We're focused on long-term capital allocation and making long-term decision. If we're six months off, we're six months off. So there is a difference of the time horizon when we're allocating capital and making these decisions. We understand why you ask these questions, but I want you to appreciate, our focus is not, can we do this exactly at the bottom? We're a long-term capital allocator. That's not how we make decisions. Mercedes Kerr : Yes, and Tayo, I want to add two -- I just want to bring back two data points that I shared at the beginning of this call. And that is, keep in mind that, in our top 10 markets, the construction as a percentage of the existing inventory is 160 basis points lower in our top 10 cities than it is for NIC as an average, or their primary markets, I guess, is what they call them. In addition to that, I also talked about our rate growth, which is also superior to what is happening in the market. So consider that when we analyzed the next moves and what we're -- how we're addressing market competition and so, we don't only think about occupancy, we also think about rate, which we have been able to preserve and expand much, much quicker than the rest of the market is capable of. So we're always interplaying all of these different components to try to optimize what we think is the potential for each asset. Omotayo Okusanya : Okay, that's helpful. Number two, the $10.8 million of termination fees you had in the quarter, what did that relate to? John Goodey : So as I said in my remarks, we do not take through our FFO line unusual items like termination fees or financing fees that we receive. So on our cessation of the certain elements of the Brookdale transaction, as noted in the press release, we received $58 million in total. Some of that is offset against things like straight line, but that was essentially a net profit on a book sense, if you like, a net profit from the cessation of those. So we do not -- again, we do not book things like that through our FFO line. We take them through unusual items and normalize them out. So it's the Brookdale profit on lease termination. Thomas DeRosa : You agree with that? Do you think that matches your policy? Omotayo Okusanya : I agree with the policy for sure. I think, again, it's just that when you kind of take a look at the number, again, you have a nice kind of termination fees in quarter one. I guess that's just why I kind of asked. It is an unusual item, so kind of taking it out doesn't make sense. Shankh Mitra : Yes, if you look at our Brookdale press release few weeks ago, it actually lays out the details. It's $58 million offset by the straight line I've talked about. We do not think that -- and I think I probably say this like a broken record every call. We do not take any fees and onetimers in our same-store, in our FFO. We don't think that gives investors a more rounded view of the company. Thomas DeRosa : But my question for you, Tayo, is do you think we should take those onetime fees into earnings? Omotayo Okusanya : I don't think you should. I don't think it presents -- I agree with Shankh. I don't think it presents a clear picture of the underlying fundamentals. Tim McHugh : Well, thank you. Because we -- that's our perspective. I'm not sure that is shared, but you're on our page. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for dialing in to the Welltower Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your participation, and ask that you please disconnect.",

My name is Regina, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants will are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Senior Vice President, Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, sir. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower's third quarter 2018 results. Today, we will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Shankh Mitra, CIO; Keith Konkoli, SVP Real Estate Services; and John Goodey, CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that these projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning's press release and from time to time in the company's filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release, you may access it via the company's website at welltower.com. And with that, I will hand the call over to Tom for his remarks on the quarter. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, Tim, and good morning. I am pleased by the financial results and improvement in operating metrics that we report to you this morning. Continued positive NOI growth across all our business segments has given us the confidence to raise our 2018 FFO guidance by $0.03 at the low-end and $0.01 at the high-end or a raise of $0.02 at the midpoint from $3.99 to $4.06 to $4.02 to $4.07 and despite the fact that we raised $232 million in equity in the quarter under our ATM and DRIP programs at a weighted average share price of $66.07. We\u2019ve been talking for a number of quarters about dispositions and restructurings. These initiatives enabled us to delever and improve the quality of our cash flow. In 2018, we have shown our ability to reinvest accretively in assets and operator relationships that are aligned with our well-articulated strategy and will drive earnings growth. Welltower\u2019s value proposition which connects, senior\u2019s housing, post-acute and ambulatory sites of care to dominant, financially strong health systems is being embraced by the broader healthcare delivery sector and truly differentiates us from REIT and other capital sources.  A knowledge-based strategy aligned with our proprietary data and analytics capabilities is enabling Welltower to drive hundreds of basis points better relative operating performance from our senior housing assets even in a challenging new supply and labor environment. Shankh will go through our operating performance in greater detail but we are encouraged by our positive results in this part of the cycle.  Our strategy has enabled us to attract a next-generation of senior housing operators and assets as we have sold or restructured over 8 billion of non-strategic real estate on misaligned legacy operator relationships in the last 24 months. In a sector that is seeing little capital deployed into long-term real estate assets, Welltower has completed approximately $3 billion of high-quality accretive investments and developments year-to-date and the year is not over.  In addition to the $2.2 billion ProMedica joint venture that closed this quarter, today, we announced nearly $0.5 billion of new medical office investments including an expansion of our growing portfolio with the Johns Hopkins Health System and Provident St. Joseph Health. Keith Konkoli will tell you more about these investments. John Goodey will take you through our third quarter results and I hope you will agree that the investments we have made in people, and technology as well as having made tough decisions has best positioned Welltower to drive shareholder value as healthcare delivery transitions to lower cost sites of care that will improve health outcomes, particularly in view of the aging of the population. You will be hearing more about this at our Investor Day to be held at the St. Regis Hotel in New York City on December 4.  Now, over to your Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. I will now review our quarterly operating results and provide additional details on four topics. Number one, SHO results and trends, two, senior housing triple net business, three ATM managed care for medical joint venture and four capital deployed in the Medical Office segment. We remain confident in our ability to execute at this point in the cycle, especially given our unique data science capabilities and are excited about the path towards further value creation which I will detail you for here.  In our Q2 call, we told you that we are encouraged y the return of seasonality to our occupancy trends. Our year-over-year occupancy declines went from 200 basis points on Q4 of 2017 to 190 basis points in Q1 of 2018 to 110 basis points last quarter. I am delighted to inform you that gap is only 10 basis points in Q3 and it\u2019s actually up 10 basis points in the month of September. And perhaps more significantly, we have been able to effectively close the occupancy gap by holding the rate growth for overall portfolio as 2.8% driven by major U.S. markets which is up 3.2%. This speaks to the exceptional quality of our real estate and our operating partners. We had a strong summer where we saw seasonal strength not seen over last few moving seasons because of the heightened deliveries had absorbed typical seasonal demand.  To provide you some more context Q3 over Q2 sequential occupancy growth of 80 basis points is the best we have seen since Q3 of 2014. This allows year-over-year revenue growth of 2.9% which accelerated for the first time since Q3 of 2014 on a sequential basis. So, clearly, we are encouraged by the trend. Having said that, I would caution you not to draw any conclusion from one quarter of numbers, but focus on longer-term trends.  Senior housing is an operating business and we will continue to see some volatility as with any other cyclical business. But our extremely diversified portfolio across geographies, operators, product set and equity does provide the unique diversification benefits that others cannot even remotely replicate. A second topic I would like to discuss is our senior housing triple net leases. Many of you asked whether any lease will survive this cycle and how many leases will be converted into RIDEA structure. Our answer has been and remains that real estate and operators first and structure second. We continue to believe that in the triple net structure when a well-aligned lease exists by both operators and Welltower shareholder can make money.  In that context, we are delighted to inform you that Brookdale has agreed to renew our Sally master lease for next eight years. As I mentioned in the last quarter with $28 million of cash rent, this was our biggest exposure in our entire triple net business. The lease signed trending place to 1/1/19 at which point rent increases at the contractual amount thereafter.  Welltower has opportunity to fund some CapEx on a contractual market return as Brookdale remains responsible to fund CapEx at the existing terms of the lease after that. We continue \u2013 we think Brookdale, which makes money from the lease today will improve performance and will drive even more profitability as it leases out from a cyclically low occupancy. This renewal effectively eliminates any material REIT maturities for Welltower until 2024. This brings me to another topic and a rhetoric that if an operator has low EBITDA coverage and they will walk away from a lease. That sounds a lot like the pundits who predicted that anyone with negative equity in their house coming out of the large recession return their keys to the bank. I would like you to at least consider that the operators see their cash flow in terms of EBITDARM not EBITDAR.  They consider cyclically low cash flows relative to their long-term potential. Have G&A and scale implications to their broader business and often dealt great business over many years that this wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to give up right before a multi ticket of economy. A majority of the business that go through cyclical lows do not return their keys as this foregoes their ability to participate in the recovery. Well has a unique platform with many operating partners in all major markets. We have alternative plans for every asset and are happy to execute on those plans if need be. However, we will not put any asset in our SHO portfolio unless we believe they will have superior long-term growth prospect. There are definitely other tool sets of alignments as we have demonstrated from the Sally example. We can also leverage structuring right such as rent reset, which drove the senior housing triple net growth this quarter, subordination of interest or other tools that are available to us.  To the next topic, we are excited about the closing of the HCR ManorCare transaction in Q3. The integration process has started with a great plan and is on target. The only financial update we want to provide is that ProMedica and HCR leadership now expects higher synergies than we expected previously. You will hear more about this topic directly from Randy Oostra and Steve Cavanaugh at our Investor Day on December 4. We are encouraged by the green shoots in the skilled nursing industry and already improving occupancy pictures throughout the Arden Court portfolio even before our CapEx program is executed. We continue to believe it will create extraordinary value for our shareholders in the long-term from this transaction perhaps even more than what we anticipated.  And lastly, we are really pleased to highlight that after a long haircut we are in agreement to deploy about $0.5 billion of capital into very accretive medical office transaction and we are confident in some additional off-market transactions in Q4 and Q1. We mentioned to you before that we like medical office business very much but the pricing of recent trends has not made any economic sense to us, especially given many of these portfolios include as much as 20% to 25% of hospitals, and other assets that commend significantly higher cap rates.  We have been disciplined and invested all our efforts to build new relationships and expand existing ones, which we believe will bring additional opportunities to deploy capital in the near future. We are extremely happy we have under contract for approximately $400 million on a very high-quality portfolio of 23 Class A medical office properties affiliated with major high-quality healthcare systems with an average age of ten years.  Keith who had a longstanding relationship with the principals will provide you more details on the portfolio. While we are very encouraged by the going in cap rate and total return of this transaction we think the IRR will be significantly enhanced by the already identified development opportunities. In addition to the announced acquisition of high-quality medical office building on the campus of John Hopkins, Howard County hospital, we are also delighted to inform you that we have signed a development agreement with John Hopkins to develop new complementary sites of care on the land under bridge transaction and three other we currently have with the health system. Over the last two years, you have heard from us how we are positioned for cash flow and NAV growth. We trust all our actions this quarter demonstrated to you that we are squarely on the path to capture the next level of value. While we cannot sound the all peer on fundamentals we are encouraged that the outlook for value creation is getting better.  With that, I will pass it over to Keith Konkoli, Head of our Outpatient Medical business. Keith? Keith Konkoli : Thank you, very much, Shankh and good morning everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to spend a few minutes on our outpatient medical business. I recently joined Welltower after spending nearly 20 years with Duke Realty. At Duke, I oversaw all facets of the medical office business including development, leasing, asset and property management, consultant sales in June of 2017. Having led the very successful exit at Duke, I took the time to evaluate the right next opportunity. It was important to me to join a forward-thinking company and I was very intrigued by Welltower\u2019s mission, to partner with health systems to reduce costs and improve delivery of care across the continuum using creative real estate solutions. I felt fortunate to have the opportunity to be part of this team. I\u2019ve spent my first 180 days getting to know the portfolio, the teams and the systems that Welltower built over the last 17 years. I am happy to report that we have fantastic high-quality portfolio that is affiliated with some of the best healthcare providers in the country.  Naturally, as with any large portfolio, we have work to do. But we have a best-in-class team that can tackle any challenge and have built systems to provide best-in-class service to our tenants and health system providers as we drive growth in our future.  Our team truly understands how to operate a real estate portfolio in a way that balances client satisfaction and value creation. We build our portfolio by taking a very disciplined approach, sitting on the sidelines with pricing expectations became realistic and stepping our activity as we find the right, high-quality accretive opportunities.  I believe one of the most exciting things about our portfolio is the embedded opportunity. We have been very purposeful in partnering with financially strong leading health systems that will be the drivers of change in the evolving healthcare environment.  Shankh highlighted some of our recent activity in the outpatient medical space. Specifically, he mentioned the 23 properties portfolio that will be closing shortly. I am particularly excited about this acquisition as it strengthens our relationships with several of Welltower\u2019s existing partners and introduces new partners into our hold.  These represents some of the most financially strong successful and forward thinking health systems in the nation, all of whom have a history of partnering with third-party capital. I had the pleasure of working with all of these systems in my time at Duke Realty and look forward to making the full power of the Welltower platform available to them.  Shankh also mentioned our impending acquisition adding a fourth building and over a 160,000 square feet to our John Hopkins affiliated portfolio. This Class A building is in partnership with one of the nation\u2019s leading institutions in an outstanding network of distinguished positions. In parallel, and Shankh also mentioned this, we recently signed a development agreement with John Hopkins Howard County General Hospital calls for the exploration and development of alternative sites of care focused on meeting the hospital\u2019s growing need to care for the aging population.  This builds on our existing John Hopkins relationship and demonstrates how we are using our platform to help health systems implement their real estate strategy to meet the health and \u2013 the public health and clinical needs of their patient populations. I look forward to talking to you more about these transactions at our Investor Day.  And lastly, I would note that we believe the multiple recent partnerships that we\u2019ve announced are the precursor to future growth in the segment. Our discussions with the best U.S. health systems continue to advance and the pace of dialogue is increasing. Our partners look to us to help facilitate their broader real estate strategy and make connections with the best-in-class operators in adjacent sectors such as seniors housing and post-acute.  With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to John Goodey who will take us through the financial highlights of the third quarter. John Goodey : Thank you, Keith, and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to provide you with the financial highlights of our third quarter 2018. As you have just heard from my colleagues, Q3 has been a successful and very active quarter for Welltower whether it be investing, portfolio management or improving our income quality and balance sheet. This quarter was particularly active and investments completed.  In aggregate, we invested $2.2 billion in acquisitions and joint ventures in Q3 at the blended rate of 7.9%. We also placed three development projects into service totaling $96 million at the blended stabilized yield of 8.5%. Alongside these, we completed $256 million of dispositions and received $60 million in loan payouts. I would like to expand on Tom\u2019s comments as to the continued increase in the quality of our income line, over the last five years, we have divested $8 million of assets as we refined that portfolio towards future earnings stability and growth. In that same time period, we have recycled this capital and invested in and developed over $16 million of high-quality assets with financially strong best-in-class partners often in premium locations such as New York, LA, London and Toronto.  In addition, we have also significantly reduced our earnings from our loan portfolio. Welltower as an organization continues to improve our operational excellence and I would like to thank our colleagues that work judiciously on this every day. These efforts enabled us to report G&A cost for the quarter from $28.8 million, a continued reduction over prior year levels. Our overall Q3 same-store NOI growth was 1.6% for the quarter, slightly above the midpoint of our full year guidance. All our business segments grew in Q3. Senior housing operations, same-store NOI grew by 0.3% and as you heard from Shankh, we are encouraged by the recent occupancy improvements. Senior housing triple net growth was strong at 4.2% with both outpatient medical and long-term post-acute growth at 2.1%. Today, we are able to report a normalized third quarter 2018 FFO results of $1.4 per share. As in the past, we do not include one-off items such as lease modifications, or loan repayment fees in our normalized numbers.  Last quarter was also very active for Welltower on the balance sheet and capital fronts. Our Q3 2018 closing balance sheet position was strong with $191 million of cash and equivalents with $1.7 billion of capacity available under our primary unsecured credit facility. Our leverage metrics were slightly above trends. However, expected dispositions will reduce this number significantly in the coming quarter or two and I would reiterate that over time, our average plan sees our leverage returning to levels generally seen prior to the acquisition of QCP. In July, we closed on a new $3.7 billion unsecured credit facility with improved pricing across both aligned and credit and off term line facility. In August 2018, Welltower successfully placed an aggregate $1.3 billion of senior unsecured notes across five, ten and thirty year tenants with an average maturity of 15.4 years and a blended yield of 4.4%, again demonstrating our strategy of managing our balance sheet in a long-term durable way. In addition, during Q3, we raised $232 million through our ATM and DRIP programs at an average price of $66.07 per share.  I would now like to turn to our guidance increase for the full year 2018. We are increasing our normalized FFO range to $4.02 and $4.07 per share from $3.99 to $4.06 per share prior. This is based upon updated, current operational performance expectations with the full year 2018 overall expected adjusted same-store NOI guidance range remaining at approximately 1% to 2% and the reduction in anticipated disposition proceeds on $2.4 billion to $2.2 billion at a blended yield of 6.0% overall from 2018.  As usual, our guidance includes only announced acquisitions and includes all dispositions anticipated in 2018. On November 21, 2018, Welltower pay its 190th consecutive cash dividend of $0.87. This represents the current yield of approximately 5.3%. With that, I will hand it back to Tom for final comments. Tom? Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, John. So, as you\u2019ve heard from Shankh, Keith and John, broad strategic overhaul that we initiated at the start of 2017 prepared us well to manage the current operating dynamics of the senior housing business. So, we are bumping along the bottom of a cycle now. Our positive Q3 financial results, an improvement in operating metrics should give you some level of comfort.  The fact that we\u2019ve been able to identify approximately $3 billion in new strategic and accretive investments year-to-date demonstrates that we are further well-positioned for earnings growth as the cycle turns. Now, Regina, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Stephen Sakwa : Thanks, good morning everybody. I guess, I wanted to maybe just touch on the senior housing operating platform and kind of A, your expectations on sort of when that business turns, it sounds like it\u2019s picking up, but as you sort of look out how do you sort of look at the supply picture? And then, I don\u2019t know, Shankh or Tim, I know the pull changed a little bit this quarter from last quarter and I am just trying to see if you could give us a little bit more detail on how some of the maybe changing pull dynamics impacted same-store growth this quarter. Shankh Mitra : Sure. So, Steve, obviously, let\u2019s talk about, you have three questions and so we\u2019ll talk one at a time. First the pull change. If you look at, we don\u2019t talk about specific operators. We have a very strong same-store policy that you have to wait if there is an operator change, you have to wait for five quarters for assets to come in. Without getting into the specific details, I think there is some implication you guys think that we restructured another relationship and thus driving same-store. I would point out that if you go to the last quarter\u2019s call, Tim walked you through how the decline on those pulls that we have changed actually hurt our earnings. The second point I would point out that if you look at Page 3 of the supplemental, and look at the total occupancy growth of the cash SHO business, you will see there was a 100 basis points of occupancy increase while same-store is only 80. So that tells you it\u2019s a broad based strength we have seen and obviously it\u2019s a billion dollar for us. So, five x is going in and out really doesn\u2019t change the fact, but I am trying to look \u2013 point you to the Page 3 of the supplemental where you see that overall our shop business and you will there has been more increase relative to the same-store. And going back to 2019, supply question. This is a very broad topic and probably not suited for this call. We have a Investor Day coming up. We can tell you \u2013 we will have a very detailed discussion about this particular topic. I want to tell you how we see supply. It is just not market diverse supply we have a data science team that is very, very granular. We have build a metric called ACU which is adjusted composition units which is based on not only the number of supplies, but also the co-variants of different products, drive time, exponential detail of drive time and other machine learning algorithms into it. We have very specific view of how many of the new supply impacts us. Property we have shock factor. We will walk you through at the same-store all those details at our Investor Day. Needless to say that you are hearing that we are encouraged about the outlook. We are not necessarily saying and that we are calling for a bottom in any industry. But we are definitely encouraged by the outlook and we will have a broader discussion about this topic on our Investor Day. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Juan Sanabria with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi, just maybe a broader question for Tom. You kind of highlighted that you see yourself different as \u2013 versus altogether REITs out there. Do you consider your softer REIT and if not what\u2019s the key difference? Thomas DeRosa : I consider the company a healthcare delivery platform that\u2019s very real estate heavy. REIT is not an industry it\u2019s a tax selection and because we are a very property heavy company, it makes sense for us to elect REIT tax status. So, I don\u2019t think I have that much in common with other REITs in other sectors because they invest in different property types. We invest in healthcare assets. But, our business model is much more than eyeing and managing real estate assets in a fund like operating structure. We are intimately involved in the operations of this business, whether it be our senior housing business, whether it be our medical office business. But, I would remind you that REIT is not an industry, it\u2019s a tax selection. Juan Sanabria : Got it. Thank you for that clarification. And then just on the FFO guidance, are you including the MOB acquisitions that are scheduled to close in the fourth quarter and what was the cap rate on those acquisitions, that $400 million portfolio? Thomas DeRosa : I\u2019ll touch on the FFO aspect of it and Shankh can comment on the actual transaction. There is no impact from the acquisitions there from a modeling standpoint we should consider them occurring at the end of the year and having no material impact on 15 numbers. Shankh Mitra : On the cap rate, we have told you several times that we are not a cap rate buyer or a cap rate seller. We are total return buyer and total return seller. I am not going to talk about the cap rate because the deal hasn\u2019t closed and we have confidentiality agreement with the seller. But we will tell you that we said that we do not believe that it makes any sense to buy real estate less than 7% unlevered IRR and we believe that we\u2019ll hit 7% unlevered IRR in this particular portfolio. Juan Sanabria : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. Shankh, just to clarify on the Sally lease. Can you just clarify was there any cut to rent? Any restructuring to the bump? And when you said the CapEx from it, and if that\u2019s sort of a \u2013 is that sort of like a 7% market return? Shankh Mitra : So, Brookdale, is right now in a quiet period. So it\u2019s very hard for us to just talk about specifics and they are very \u2013 we don\u2019t want to \u2013 the opposite partner wouldn\u2019t want to get into that. I have mentioned on the call and once Brookdale is through their quiet period I am happy to walk you through all those. I think your market return comments that you\u2019ve seen in other restructuring with Brookdale is pretty much spot on. You are in the zip code, but you might be too low.  The second question is, I already mentioned, the rent is the same as it is. The escalator is changed and it\u2019s slightly higher, but I just don\u2019t want to talk about that on the call. Once Brookdale goes through it quiet thorough we are happy to answer any questions. The whole discussion is what I want you to focus on is, even at that level, we mentioned that Brookdale actually makes money. In any triple net relationship or even in our RIDEA, the focus of Welltower is not to grab all the economics we can, but have a healthy driving operator where they can make money and we can make money. Here Brookdale makes money as we are sitting under typically low occupancy and as they lease out these buildings, we think they will make significantly more money which is always good for us. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, great. And then just to clarify on the senior housing side. I know it\u2019s tough to call 2019 if it\u2019s a turn or not certainly the results are encouraging. But I want to maybe focus on the expense side, the comps were very higher. I think last year, you had a 0.8% increase year-over-year in expenses and that expenses sort of get easier, but can you just walk us through how you think about the structure today going into 2019? Like, are there other levers you can pull to control like, other parts of the expenses assuming labor continues to be a headwind? Shankh Mitra : So, labor continues to be a headwind. I am glad that you actually know this that we had a very, very touch comp. Q3 of 2017, we had a 4.1% NOI increase on back of a very low expense comp. Obviously, the expense growth this year, it\u2019s not just a factor of expenses, but also a factor of what happened Q3 of last year and so that is absolutely the right observation. So that Mercedes will add some comments on how we think about expenses, but we think the headwind continues. Mercedes Kerr : We both have talked about the initiatives that we have undertaken at Welltower to try to bring expense savings to our operators in work. Some are being down, some of those efforts I think pop up our mind right now is labor. It\u2019s something that is impacting a lot of industries naturally and certainly in seniors housing which is such a labor-intensive business. So, we are very focused on trying to bring efficiencies to our operators and trying to help them with our scale. Shankh Mitra : Just to add one point, I just want you to understand that the big part of the minimum wage increases have been flowing through our numbers. San Francisco went to $15 this year, that\u2019s flowing through the numbers. So, from here on, you will see more of inflation and increase. LA will hit $15 next summer. So you do have this, but I will say, looking at a more medium to long-term, a lot of the minimum wage $15 driven growth flow have been flowing through our numbers for the next four, five years. We feel encouraged about the long-term. But we are obviously, as you said, we are managing in the near term. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Thanks, good morning everyone. Congrats on the results. Thomas DeRosa : Hey, Steve. Steven Valiquette : There was an announcement in the industry and during the quarter about this additional $3 billion of senior housing development in various urban centers in the U.S. It wasn\u2019t a huge number in the grand scheme of things. But the headlines seems to draw some attention. And I guess, from your perspective, I am just curious, that sort of activity was already contemplated in your development plans when thinking about your focus on every markets in particular over the next several years. Just want to get your thoughts around the \u2013 kind of the competitor developments and how that\u2019s sort of being made? Thanks. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, Steve. I think that announcement related, clearly validates a thesis that we\u2019ve been articulating for a few years and have been at for a few years. I think there is demand for a next-generation of senior living product in major metro areas. You take a city like New York, which is made up of many villages that are densely populated that have an aging population. There is room for lots of senior housing property to be brought to this market. But I would say, it\u2019s a next-gen product. I don\u2019t see any of the product in a market like New York today being sufficient and meet the needs of the upper-end of this population. I am going to tell you I\u2019ve dealt with it myself personally. And there really are no options on the Island of Manhattan today. The first viable option will be what we were open in the end of 2019 early 2020 and on our Investor Day, you are actually going to have a chance to go into that building. It\u2019s coming out of the ground. So, in summary, Steve, I would say that we have a number of plans to bring that type of asset into the major metro centers. So, stay tuned. Steven Valiquette : Okay, that\u2019s helpful color. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jonathan Hughes : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time. I will skip the shop questions and it sounds like you\u2019ll address those in December. But this past summer, I recall you are saying, getting excited about maybe buying more senior housing assets. Shankh, I know you don\u2019t focus on cap rates, but could you maybe talk about where potential deals or marketed deals, senior housing deals out there being priced? What sellers are asking as compared to your replacement cost analysis, or your 7% required IRR threshold? Shankh Mitra : So from our perspective, look, we are product agnostic, as I mentioned, obviously, with different products requires different level of risk-adjusted returns. So, I don\u2019t want you think that the 7% is a hard and fast number. We talk about 7% as we have some a minimum return required for investing capital. And you said that, the senior housing market is a very, very robust market. We are seeing a lot of participants are coming in. Lot of core capital are being priced. So obviously, if you think about the option, they are very densely populated and the risk of the prices are very high. If you look at our investment sources and we give you these numbers on our supplemental, quarter after quarter after quarter, we are not in those options. We have a relationship based investment strategy. We almost pretty much 80% to 100% of what the acquisition done from our existing relationships. We were not in those option pens but they are very densely populated and we see cap rates in levels we can\u2019t make sense. But we are very disciplined and capital allocated. So, when it will make sense, we will be there. Mercedes Kerr : Yes, Shankh, this is Mercedes Kerr and I would add one more comment and that is, I think for the first time, really we are starting to see a real distinction between Class A and Class B assets in senior housing in terms of cap rates and that capital that Shankh talked about really very interested in that Class A quality which is I think generally what makes up the Welltower portfolio. But, so, happy to be sitting on the assets that we have and that we\u2019ve \u2013 perhaps distinction in cap rates wasn\u2019t as pronounced as it is today. Jonathan Hughes : Got it. And then just one more from me and I know I asked this last quarter. What\u2019s the trend on new and renewal leasing spreads in shop? I know, it\u2019s stable in low-single-digit range on an overall basis. But maybe what are you seeing on new versus expiring and adjusting for acuity, if that\u2019s at all possible. Thanks. Shankh Mitra : So, that is such a broad swath of numbers across so many operators. It is very hard to predict. It\u2019s dependent on, as you said, operators, acuity, as well as location. We are seeing significant positive spreads to negative spreads. Right. So it\u2019s very hard to generalize that comment. It is sort of a distribution that has no midpoints that I can talk about. So I\u2019ll just say I live from it I just want you to look at revenue growth and if you are looking for a more of a median outcome, that revenue growth picture that we gave to you should tell you what it\u2019s going to play out. Jonathan Hughes : Okay, I\u2019ll jump off. Thanks for the time. Shankh Mitra : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Good morning. So, I am aware there are certain things you want us to focus on, but if you will forgive me I\u2019d like to ask a couple questions that I am focused on. On the cap rate question on medical office, you gave a cap rate for the John Hopkins one, not a cap rate for the larger $400 million transaction. Is that something that the seller is requesting? Is the actual number below or above the 4.9 that you are willing to provide in the John Hopkins? Can you just sort of frame it a little bit for us? Shankh Mitra : So, we have a fee with the seller that we can\u2019t disclose it before the deal closes. But it\u2019s above to answer your question specifically, it is not that hard to think about what drives an IRR. We are already telling you that it\u2019s a very well leased obviously, portfolio. You know what the bump generally looks like. So, if I am telling you that we can solve on unlevered 7 that gives you a general number. We will give you the number next quarter when the deal is closed. Rich Anderson : That\u2019s good enough. Perfectly good answer. Thank you for that. On the Brookdale assets pulled out of the same-store pool. I know you are not \u2013 you have your reasons for taken the amount. HCP discloses how those transitioned assets have performed including into their same-store. Could you say if those transactions assets without putting numbers around them are sort of dialing down performance as the transitions are underway? Or are they held up relatively well over the transition process? Shankh Mitra : So, we talked about obviously, we have a same-store quality that an asset that obviously needs to wait for five quarters when this kind of transition happens, et cetera. However, Tim walked you through, last quarter, what is the implication of that decline in cash flow in those assets which I was trying to allude to you. So you have those numbers. They are just in the last transcript. Rich Anderson : All right. I\u2019ll take a look. Tom, question for you. You have your team in place now for your processors. So, since you took over as CEO, I am wondering if you can comment at all on succession. Is that sort of I assume a process that\u2019s very much structured within the four walls of Welltower? Any comment you can give on that would be great. Thomas DeRosa : Well, we don\u2019t comment on succession. Are you suggesting that it\u2019s time for me to go? Rich Anderson : Not, not. I have such a great response, but I\u2019ll let you talk at. Thomas DeRosa : Okay, great. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. No Rich, but we have a deep young, diverse, energized bench of people here that I would stack up against any company that is structured like ours. The last thing I would tell you and over my heart, you should be worried about with the depth of management of Welltower. This is a tremendous team and I\u2019d invite you to spend some time with us, whether it\u2019s in our offices in Toledo or whether it\u2019s our offices here in New York or in LA or in London, and I think you will be very pleasantly surprised. Rich Anderson : Okay. I am sure I would. And then, last question, you adjust your FFO range, but you don\u2019t adjust your sort of individual same-store ranges. Obviously, you are not going to get to 1.5% on the shop, original guidance at the top-end. Any reason for that? You are in the range and so you just leave those ranges alone or is there some sort of some possibility you can produce some massive number in the fourth quarter to make the top end of the shop range reasonable to still be at there? Shankh Mitra : So, we talked about, this is probably the fourth year we are talking about this. But we do not change individual ranges through the year. And so, we are not going to make. The problem of doing that, once you create the precedence and people keep doing, asking the question we think of our portfolio as overall portfolio that it\u2019s overall cash flow as you think about and what you are hearing from us that we are excited about the overall cash flow growth. We don\u2019t predict quarter-to-quarter numbers, but we expect fourth quarter will be better than the three quarters you have seen in the shop business. Rich Anderson : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Please go ahead. Karin Ford : Hi, good morning. Tom, just wanted to ask you if you see any potential implications of the mid-term elections on your business? Where there is word out that Congress may try to take another crack at Obama Care. How are you feeling about the political environment today? Thomas DeRosa : Really, that\u2019s some question, Karin. I really don\u2019t want to get into politics. I do think though this the questions about the mid-term elections are clouding so many things across our business and every business right now, Karin. I mean, I can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen. But what I do believe is that we will continue to see Washington try to reduce the cost of healthcare and that is by moving healthcare to lower cost settings and doing - and really making it a mandate to drive better outcomes. It\u2019s not just about cutting cost, but how do we improve the health and wellness and I underscore the world wellness, because Washington is starting to wake up that \u2013 our healthcare system shouldn\u2019t just wait for some of the dissects and show up in the emergency room. We need to prevent people from actually ever coming to the emergency room. So, whether the Democrats are in power or whether it\u2019s the Republicans, I would like to think we still live in a world and I question that every day, but sanity will prevail. That\u2019s the best answer I can give you, Karin. I want to talk about it after the election. Karin Ford : Appreciate that very much. Thanks. My second question is just on the senior housing triple net portfolio. It look like EBITDAR coverage sequentially uptick a basis point. Is that solely due to the Brandywine and the Brookdale restructuring? Or do you think it could mark an inflection for future senior housing coverage trends? Shankh Mitra : So, I think I went through a very long discussion of why, how you guys should think about at least consider the EBITDARM coverage is as important if not the more important than the EBITDAR coverage. We do think the business like our shop business, the occupancy levels in the triple net business is very low relative to the long-term potential. So, obviously, as those occupancies go up, the coverage will improve. So, that\u2019s only I can tell you. I am not going to sit and predict quarter-to-quarter coverage, because it just depends on so many things that come in and out and but we are not focused on a number, we are focused on driving profitability for us as well as our operating partners. Karin Ford : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead. Smedes Rose : Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a little bit more and I am sorry I might have missed some of your comments just on the John Hopkins relationship. And is your agreement with them, I guess, exclusive to build these alternate care sites? And could you maybe just talk a little bit about what that \u2013 what those are exactly and what sort of returns or development yields you would be looking for those and how much capital you would be investing to develop those? Shankh Mitra : So alternate types of care, we mean all sorts of our business that you have seen. It could be on medical office, it could be a senior housing, it could be a post-acute type. How much capital? Again, we don\u2019t sit here and predict how much capital at what rates. We only deploy capital if we can make money and we can obviously enhance the strategic nets of our partners as well as our goal to increase our energy and our cash flow. Mark, do you want to add something to that? Mark Shaver : Yes, Smedes, thank you for the question. It\u2019s Mark Shaver. The acquisition of the Medical Pavilion gives us four assets with Hopkins Howard County in that geographic market including, if you recall, we have a 30 acre campus that we acquired in 2015 that has two buildings. And so, as Hopkins, like many other leading systems are looking to move care out of the hospital into the community, there is specific incentives that Hopkins has to drive care and lower-cost settings. As Shankh said, we are working early days in terms of identifying and developing which sites of care we can develop with them either on their campus at Howard County General or our 30 acre Mill North Campus. So, there is more to come with that. But it\u2019s all reflective of Tom\u2019s comments of health systems needing to continue to develop alternative sites of care at lower costs. Smedes Rose : Okay, thanks. And then, just, I\u2019d be interested in your comments around ProMedica with their ratings from the agencies being downgraded after you announced venture with them. Because a big part of the second quarter call was talking about the A rated credit and how do you think about them now or just do you feel like your rents are structured such that it\u2019s less of a concern or just sort of any thoughts around that. Shankh Mitra : We\u2019ve talked about and if you go back and see that it is \u2013 and we talked about investment-grade credit and mostly what we talked about is where the playing the rent is going to fit and the capital structure. We have obviously a great system and we have the output guarantee. We don\u2019t specifically talk about ProMedica\u2019s ratings, ProMedica\u2019s bond is publicly trade. You can go and look at what that had an impact or not on those months. But, the only thing I would tell you that eventually ratings will be driven by cash flow and if you listen to my comments, you will see that I mentioned we would expect higher than anticipated synergy or distressed synergies. So that would mean obviously if you think through that that would mean higher level of cash flow and as ratings follow cash flow, you can come to your own conclusion. But because ProMedica\u2019s bonds trade in the public market we are not going to sit here and talk about \u2013 specifically about that. Michael Bilerman : Hey, Shankh it\u2019s Michael Bilerman speaking. Just, as you think about the initial yields versus you talked about underwriting everything at a minimum of a 7% IRR. How does like the John Hopkins outpatient medical building where you go in at a 4.9? What are the \u2013 what\u2019s the underwriting to get to a 7% unleveraged IRR? How should we be thinking about what you are putting in there for an asset as 100% leased. I assume under a long-term lease. Shankh Mitra : Yes, so, you are correct about the lease. We will not get the 7% unlevered IRR to buy an asset at 4.93% cap rate, which is it is. But this is why I said, you look at the development agreement we signed. This building fits right next to our charter building that has five acres of land. This particular building has ten acres of land and we told you we just signed a development agreement with them. So do we take we will get to 7% or higher IRR from the whole relationship we do. That\u2019s what we are focused on. Michael Bilerman : So it\u2019s not in each individual transaction. It\u2019s a holistic view about what that it fits making a strategic investment at a low yield on one hand, what benefits you may get on the other? Shankh Mitra : I want you to think about this is a covered land play. So we have \u2013 if you bought this land, obviously, that is a negative NOI, because you have to pay taxes and you service on all those things. This is a covered land play. So we are obviously getting pretty decent income. We\u2019ve part this asset \u2013 it\u2019s an absolute Class A asset and really one of the best system at higher cap rate than majority of the transactions you have seen, but we are still not satisfied with that. And we are going to get our required returns using the developments that I sort of discussed the land, aspects of the deal and the fact that it fits right next to our charter building. Michael Bilerman : And on HCR ManorCare, I am pretty sure that when you announced the deal on ProMedica, Tom, you told us, we shouldn\u2019t look at this as a skilled nursing deal. We asked about this is A rated health system deal. So, while, I know you don\u2019t\u2026 Thomas DeRosa : Investment-grade \u2013 we said investment-grade and we told you in fact, when we had the group here in our offices, that we expected that they could be downgraded to triple B plus. And they were downgraded to triple B plus by Fitch and Moody\u2019s, S&P put them to Triple B. Michael Bilerman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Todd Stender : Hi, thanks. Just shifting to dispositions. The guidance implies $800 million in Q4. But the cap rate would be in the mid 4% range unless that\u2019s being dragged down by some other non-yielding properties. So one of you just go through maybe the Q4 stuff? Tim McHugh : Yes, Todd, you are correct. So it\u2019s got of the $750 million in assets to be sold during the fourth quarter. But 225 are non-yielding and the remaining have a 6.4 yield on them. So, it\u2019s about $520 million of non-recourse dispositions at a 6.4 yield and then 225 at the zero yield. Todd Stender : Is it more QCP stuff or what\u2019s in that stuff? Tim McHugh : The zero yield? Todd Stender : Yes. Tim McHugh : Yes, so, going back, the original transaction, when we closed on it, there was - going back to when QCP was in its early restructuring with ManorCare. They designated about $500 million in assets to be sold. ManorCare stopped paying rent on those and all proceeds from sale got to QCP. So, we essentially, that agreement came to us when we bought the portfolio. So at the time of closing, since close we had less than $400 million of these remaining and we sold about a $170 million of them during the third quarter and we\u2019ve got $220 million remaining. Todd Stender : Got it. Thank you, Tim. And then, just shifting gears. The MOB portfolio deal you have under contract, is that something you had under contract for a while. You needed your cost of equity to improve or does this come along recently? We have just haven\u2019t seen that many portfolio deals this calendar year. Maybe you could just go through how long you\u2019ve been eyeing that. Shankh Mitra : We, obviously, we did not wait for our equity to come back. That\u2019s not how a real transaction works. As you think about, we mentioned that Keith has a longstanding relationship with obviously and the principals are \u2013 which owns the portfolio and I don\u2019t think at this point I can say much more than that. When the deal closes, we are happy to walk you through. But this is a normal deal going through a normal sort of channel, when you first bid, then you go through due diligence. Then it takes time for the documentation and a PSA or NBSA and then it takes time to close. I mean, that just where it is. No different for this particular portfolio. Todd Stender : Thank you, Shankh. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Lukas Hartwich : Thanks. Good morning guys. Post-acute coverage is still a market, but it has come down a decent amount last couple quarters. I was just hoping you could provide some color around that? Shankh Mitra : Yes, Lukas, as you know, we have handful of health-backed assets left and that obviously, there is a lot going on in that business. So that drove significantly the coverage down. The coverage for EBITDAR, coverage was still assets at still 1.7, 1.8 level. So we are not worried about that, but the change is primarily driven by that. Lukas Hartwich : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to touch on balance sheet. I think your leveraged net debt to EBITDA take up to about six times. I am curious, I re-imagine it\u2019s going to come down a little bit by year end as a result of the sales you have teed up, but can you maybe just refresh us on sort of what leverage targets might look like as we look forward? And what you are thinking on leverage and balance sheet in the current environment? Tim McHugh : Jordan, I\u2019ll start that and John can comment on the strategic side. The 598 that we printed this quarter, the debt-to-EBITDA can get a little skewed by timing of transactions. So I am glad you asked that, because we for 25 days at the quarter, we didn\u2019t have ProMedica as \u2013 or the entire QCP transaction, our cash flow. The way we present debt-to-EBITDA is an annualization of the quarter, since it's essentially a simple time for us. The 25 days of additional income we\u2019ll get on the fourth quarter bringing down that leverage, 0.17, comes down to 5.81 and then, the remaining $225 million of QCP non-yielding assets was essentially to the liquidation, right. There is no EBITDA on them. So it just can be cash. It\u2019s going to bring it down another 0.1 of a turn. So, our runrate leverage right now, it\u2019s reflected in our kind of 3Q earnings and then, the in fact three a little bit of drag from those non-yielding, I mean it\u2019s 5.71. So it\u2019s not as much of a gap when you think about \u2013 when we talked about kind of mid to 5.6 is being the pro forma leverage. We are almost there right now.  ProMedica income left in that transaction and we expect to keep. John Goodey : Yes, I was going to reinforce, Jordan that we are nearly or very close to where we said the pro forma would be when we announced the QCP acquisition. You heard in my prepared remarks, that overall, we see us capturing over time coming that levels generally in the order that we saw prior to the acquisition. I\u2019d know obviously, last quarter we were at 5.4 times leverage that gives you some guidance to what we conceptualize as sort of normal course. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then, just a follow-up on QCP. I noticed, I am just trying to piece the numbers together a little bit. I think in the original presentation, you had 74 non-core assets to be sold prior to year end from $475 million, I would imagine maybe a couple of those probably closed before you guys got the deal done. But I am just, you guys sold 19 in the quarter, I think you have 40 teed up that would be 59. So, there is \u2013 that\u2019s the difference of about, I don\u2019t know, 15 assets, 16 assets. And then, you guys sold some non-core QCP assets. I am just curious will there be additional non-core sales from the QCP portfolio to come? John Goodey : No, Jordan, we don\u2019t expect that this time. We sold, so any quarter, we sold post-acute portfolio. We will sell another building in fourth quarter that\u2019s in our guidance and between those two assets, of the $28 million of non-ProMedica NOI that came with the QCP portfolio, that\u2019s roughly half of it. So, there is very little left with non-ProMedica income from that transaction. And we expect to keep the rest of it for the foreseeable future. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Please go ahead. Chad Vanacore : Hi, good morning. So, I was just wondering, why the reduced guidance expectations by $200 million? Is that a change in what you consider non-core? Is that merely timing and we will see some dispositions pushed into 2019? Tim McHugh : Yes, that\u2019s a great question. That\u2019s merely timing. We just wanted to give what we want in our guidance was we expect to close in the year end or early 2019. And from an earnings standpoint, I just want to make the point that we raised more than $225 million of equity in the quarter that wasn\u2019t in our initial guidance. So, from an accretion or dilution perspective of moving those off of our dispositions. We are still actually in a net dilution perspective from the equity raise versus the pushing out of dispositions. So that was not. In short, that was not accretive to our guidance. Chad Vanacore : All right. Thanks, Tim. And then, just thinking about guidance, you increased CapEx assumptions by about $6 million in FY 2018. How much of that is Brandywine conversion versus the MOB acquisition we made and then what\u2019s a good runrate given the increase in operating assets that you have? Tim McHugh : Yes, I think, on the \u2013 I\u2019ll just comment on the \u2013 on your observation on the 2018. We actually, some of that is outpatient related, not tied to the properties, we are talking about acquiring. We moved forward some projects that were going to be occur in 2019 into 2018 that made us give or take around $3 million of that. And then about $1 million of it was tied to RIDEA conversions of just some extra projects that we thought in 2018. Shankh Mitra : And I will answer the second part of your question, as you think about CapEx, just think through the normal items in our CapEx. One is the vintage-related CapEx spends, call it about $55 million flowing through our numbers and then is fourth Sunrise buildings we bought from S&H. You recall, what we aid, we bought those asset sets and what \u2013 S&H they sold the assets. Those assets add to the $25 million difference and that is the $25 million CapEx that we talked about. These are two abnormal numbers that are flowing through this year and sort of first half of next year. So that will significantly negate the CapEx required due to the increase of our SHO as a percent of the overall portfolio. Chad Vanacore : All right. Then, Shankh, if we think about this quarter, is that a fairly good runrate for CapEx? Or should we expect that to go up or down? Shankh Mitra : No, it\u2019s not, because, the whole vintage situation is still playing through. The Sunrise situation is starting to play through. So you are going to get eventually probably 2020 will be a better sort of 15 runrate. But I am hopeful maybe towards the end of 2019 it starts to happen. So, we have really good CapEx because of those two transactions. It\u2019s a fairly large number relative to our overall CapEx budget. Chad Vanacore : All right. And then just one quick update on the repositioning, you had about the 60 assets or so. Have you transitioned any of those assets at this point? Or is the whole portfolio left to be done? Shankh Mitra : No, it\u2019s in the process as we talked about, like, obviously, license transfer takes time. And particularly, California and Washington, they are all in process, they are actually teed up to closing next. Some of them have closed and some of them have teed up to close in call it next 90 to 120 days. They are exactly on plan and we are very encouraged that our future operators also are working very progressively with Brookdale. And we have been able to retain a lot of the staff. So we are very encouraged. It\u2019s still early to comment. But we are very \u2013 we are grateful for the support Brookdale has provided us. We are also very encouraged by the new operators who are getting involved in the transaction and the process. Chad Vanacore : So is it fair to think that, we won\u2019t see any impact in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s really a 2019 impact? Shankh Mitra : No, you are seeing the impact is flowing through earnings, right. There is no impact from the same-store because those assets will not even be in same-store. Chad Vanacore : I am not talking about the same-store, I am talking about the whole portfolio. Shankh Mitra : And if you are talking about earnings, then, yes, you are seeing the dragging down earnings and Tim walked you through the quantum of every one of them last quarter. Chad Vanacore : All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. Shankh, I want to touch on your prepared remarks regarding QCP. I believe you said that you saw occupancy pickup sooner than you expect without the CapEx being invested within that portfolio. Can you kind of quantify the occupancy pickup and the reasons why you think that trended higher? Shankh Mitra : I specifically talked about Arden Court which is the memory care business. Remember that we got 150 skilled nursing assets or post-acute assets and 55 Arden Court assets. My comment was very specific to Arden Court, which as you know, we talked about that will go through it \u2013 obviously both sides of the business was significant CapEx. My comment specifically is, we have seen occupancy increase in the Arden Court business. It\u2019s too early to comment how much, why that happened. But it is not very hard to imagine why that happened, right. We are seeing across the board in the senior housing spectrum. Look at our entire RIDEA portfolio, it\u2019s a $1 billion business. It\u2019s almost 550, 600 assets. That sort of gives you a sense of the industry, obviously high-quality end of the industry. But there is occupancy growth. So, we have seen a lot of the seasonal patterns of the business has been really eaten up by new deliveries as deliveries are starting to come down the impact obviously is getting on the margin better. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. And then, you also mentioned that you expect to see stronger synergies than you thought previously. Can you highlight what those synergies are? Shankh Mitra : I walked you through all the different aspects of the synergy one that \u2013 two quarters ago and as I mentioned that Randy, and Steve will be on our Investor Day and they will talk about this particular topic. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for me to get through a blow-by-blow the bonds or public funds. I don't want to talk about it, but, we expect better numbers across the board in all those synergies and perhaps, one or two niche categories of synergies. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Sarah from JP Morgan on the line for Mike. Quick question, the development pipeline is about 70% senior housing and 30% office. Do you see that mix changing through the year in the next three to five years? Shankh Mitra : It\u2019s opportunity-driven, Sarah. I mean, we are not trying to target a mix. It\u2019s surely driven by opportunity. So I would not look for any trends quarter-to-quarter. This is purely deal-driven and opportunity-driven, so now, we are very, very focused on development on both sides of our business. It just whatever comes into a quarter, how big the size of that building that matters. So, I will not look for a trend or I think there is anything specific way or the number that we are trying to steer it. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Please go ahead. Daniel Bernstein : Hi, good morning. Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about the earlier comment of the alignment of interest in a triple net lease and maybe go into that a little bit more? And in the context of coming out a nick, we didn\u2019t really hear too much in the way of enthusiasm from operators for triple net lease. So, maybe you could comment about what you are seeing out there in terms of a the inclination of operators to want to lease versus RIDEA? Shankh Mitra : Dan, you didn\u2019t attend my panel. I talked about that for an hour. Daniel Bernstein : No I did miss your panel. I heard about it, but\u2026 Shankh Mitra : Okay, so that now I really know, I am honest. So, look, there is \u2013 at the end of the day, I think there is too much focus on, whether it\u2019s RIDEA, it\u2019s triple net, I mean, how different tools. The idea is very simple. We need our operators to be making money. We want the thriving operators. At the end of the day, I wanted to understand this is people business, right? We want our operators to invest in the people, in that system and that enhances the value of our real estate. So, whether we can do that in a well-covered lease, whether we can do that with other alignment features, I think I mentioned additional four in the call already. So, I am not going to repeat myself or we do a pure equity transaction called RIDEA, that\u2019s a moot point, right? So we want - at the end of the day, what we want you to know that we are very, very focused. We think it\u2019s an operating business. And the senior housing - obviously senior housing operating side and we want our operators to do very well. And we think that enhances the value for real estate and we think there are several ways to get that. There is just not only one path. Daniel Bernstein : Okay, okay. I mean, there is a difference in the risk profile, I think investors perceive a difference in risk between the operating and leasing nets, which we talk about some more offline. The other question I had was on the Columbia Maryland property that you are buying which is my backyard. When you get to the kind of \u2013 from the cap rate to the 7% IRR, you talked about it more of a land play. What are you thinking in terms of the buildable square feet? Or if you\u2019ve gone that far at this point? Shankh Mitra : Yes, we are not going to make comments on that. I think I said, that the significant land, right, on our building right next door, there is land obviously there. There is 10 acres of land and are no assets that Mark mentioned we bought. So, there could be significant expansion of this relationship in those places as Hopkins figure out what their needs are. This is not just we are going to build a building. Right, we will build a building with our partner to meet that need. So, but, if you think about and I would encourage you, it\u2019s in your backyard, go and look at the land. You will realize this is a covered land play. Daniel Bernstein : Okay, okay. I appreciate. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Fleming with SunTrust. Please go ahead. Eric Fleming : Good morning. I had a question on managed care. You got Anthem out there talking about their Medicare Advantage and some of the rules are coming in 2019 and how they are increasing their interest in the senior housing. Is that something you guys are looking to expand any payer relationships? Or is that something with the ProMedica relationship that could be an opportunity for you? Mark Shaver : Yes, this is Mark, Eric. So, yes, absolutely. So, nationally, we see a rapid acceleration of Medicare Advantage. Some of the payer methodology is being more value-based in the post-acute it\u2019s EDPM which we\u2019ve mentioned a fair amount when we did the ProMedica partnership that our partners both at ManorCare and ProMedica are pretty bullish that the new methodologies should lead to better enhanced care and from a reimbursement perspective, Shankh used the term green shoot that is increased reimbursement on that side. I think you will see us in the future talk a bit more about opportunities with payers. Our senior housing platform is providing a great amount of care to the senior population and increasingly they are becoming greater sites of care and greater linkage both to the delivery system partners, but also to payers. So there is more to come in that aspect for sure. Eric Fleming : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tayo, your line may be on mute. If you are on a speaker phone, please pick up your handset. Tayo Okusanya : Hello Tim McHugh : Yes, we hear you. Tayo Okusanya : Okay. Sorry about that. I am having some phone issues. The MOB transactions that were done during the quarter. Could you just talk a little bit about, I mean, a bunch of the pure play would be guys actually pulling back on acquisitions, but you guys are seem to finding some really good opportunities. Can you just talk about what would be different what you are looking at versus what they may be looking at? Keith Konkoli : Yes, so, this is, Keith Konkoli speaking. And I will just, I guess, reiterate what I said earlier in my comments. We are really focused on looking for opportunities and to do more health system business. So, as we\u2019ve looked around the market and we\u2019ve evaluated what\u2019s available, and we look at the broader opportunity across all of the different spectrums of ways that we can help deliver care in a lower cost setting. We just \u2013 we believe that we found some unique situations that we believe will be accretive as we are \u2013 as we continue to look to grow our portfolio. Shankh Mitra : Tayo, that is not any different from what we have seen in the senior housing business. If you go back, I\u2019ll not be surprised, if you ask the same question I think you asked me three, four years ago, right. We have a relationship-driven investment strategy and we are execute \u2013 obviously we are very well known to have executed that on the senior housing side and we are executing that on the medical housing sector. Thomas DeRosa : We spend a lot more time in the offices of the leadership of the major health systems in the United States than we do trying to put ourselves in the way of properties that are being auctioned off by different brokers. We are generating new business opportunities for our shareholders by knowing the needs of the health system and connecting the other assets that we are traditionally have expertise in like seniors housing and post-acute to their broader healthcare delivery networks. That is our unique investments thesis that this quarter, you should see some indication that that investment thesis is working. Keith Konkoli : Yes, and just to follow-up on that. When I was with Duke, we really we were a singly focused medical office in which the division that I was responsible for and we didn\u2019t have a lot of synergies across the business between the industrial space and the medical office space. The real opportunity herein, what really excites me about this business is we have those synergies that enable us to really be able to serve our clients in a very, very effective way. Tayo Okusanya : So the accretion you just talked about a second ago, Keith, I shouldn't actually kind of think about that just accretion based on the MOB asset is accretion that will accrue to be entire ecosystem you are building in one way or another. Keith Konkoli : Absolutely, yes. Absolutely, it is, that\u2019s the thought. Thomas DeRosa : It\u2019s a relationship, this is a relationship investing model with the health system. Tayo Okusanya : Interesting. All right. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for dialing into the Welltower earnings conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2018 Welltower Earnings Conference Call. My name is Nicole, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants will are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President of Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, sir. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower's fourth quarter 2018 results. Following the Safe Harbor, we will hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Shankh Mitra, CIO; and John Goodey, CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed Forward-Looking Statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurances that these projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning's press release and from time to time in the Company's filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of this morning's press release, you may access it via the Company's website at welltower.com. Before I hand the call over to Tom DeRosa, I want to highlight a few significant points regarding our fourth quarter results. Welltower achieved 1.6% total same-store growth in the quarter. We are particularly encourage by the 40 basis points year-over-year occupancy increase in our Senior Housing operating portfolio, and the sequential coverage increases in both our triple-net Senior Housing and long-term post acute portfolios. Fundamental performance in the quarter was consistent with our expectations, partially offset by delayed timing in investment activity and equity issued to prefund announced acquisitions, resulting in $1.01 per share of normalized funds from operations. In the fourth quarter, we issued $552 million of equity at a weighted average share price of $68.41. And with that, I will hand the call over to Tom for his remarks on the quarter and the year. Tom. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, Tim. At our investor day on December 4th, we took the notable step of announcing 2019 FFO guidance. Based on our Q4 results and our confidence in our outlook for 2019, I'm pleased to reaffirm that guidance this morning. Our guidance of $4.10 to $4.25 in normalized FFO per share represents a 4% increase at the midpoint in our guidance range over our 2018 results. As Tim highlighted, our continued strong operating results in Q4 reflected the positive momentum in our seniors housing business that we talked about throughout the year. Most notable in the quarter was the fact that we completed 559 million in acquisitions at a blended yield of 5.6% nearly 90% of which are medical office buildings associated with investment grade health system. These investments help drive total investment activity to over $4 billion for the year. Our ability to source accretive investments that continued since 2019 with the announced acquisition of 55 outpatient medical buildings from the CNL Healthcare property for $1.25 billion. Further enhancing our ability to deliver growing high quality and sustainable cash flow growth. Given that T&L and the majority of our announced investments will close by mid-year, we expect FFO to accelerate in the second half of the year, setting us up well for 2020 and beyond. In the fourth quarter, we raised $552 million of equity driving down sequential average and prefunding late quarter and early 2019 investment activity as we continue to manage our business with a focus well beyond the current quarter. This included a $300 million direct investment by the Qatari Investment Authority, one of the highest quality and most resilient Capital partners in the world. This is part of a broader investment partnership that was a long time in the making. We are honored to have entered into this partnership with the QIA, which illustrate their belief in Welltower's unique business model and strategy for driving the future of healthcare real estate. Now, I'm delighted to pass the mic to Shankh Mitra, who will give you a closer look at our operating performance and investment activity. Shankh? Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. I will now review our quarterly operating results and provide additional details on two topics. One operating results and trends, two recent investment activities. We are cautiously optimistic about the recent performance of our Senior Housing portfolio. On last quarter earnings call I discussed the narrowing on occupancy GAAP in year-over-year results. It appears that occupancy has reached an inflection point this quarter, specifically in - show, occupancy increase 40 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially fourth quarter over third quarter occupancy and revenue growth has been the best we have seen since Q4 2015, while one quarter does not make a trend, we are particularly encouraged by the 120 basis points of occupancy increase in our Assisted Living segment, as the impact of new supply is starting to wane and the demand is beginning to pick-up. We also saw a sequential occupancy increase of 90 basis points in our Senior Housing triple-net portfolio driving coverage of one basis point. Our reported growth rate of 2.2% in somewhat masked by lower growth in international market whereas core U.S. market experience 2.7% growth. Expense growth remains elevated driven by labor. We continue to look for greater use of technological and analytical solutions such as on shift, arena, smart winner amongst others to drive greater efficiency in the labor model. We are beginning to see the results. For example, since implementing arena, sunrise have seen a 27% decrease in 90 days employee turnover, and 40 day decrease in 20 month employee turnover. While we are working actively to mitigate labor challenges, the demand side of the equation is starting to look brighter. While it is true that the explosive growth of that 86 plus population is still a handful up here to weigh, medium age by definition suggests an equal number of our customers are below that age mark, and the population will begin to grow significantly starting later this year and into next year. We are also getting confident in post acute business, while it is unlikely to be a V-shape recovery it appears that the industry fundamentals are under-met. Meanwhile pricing of skilled nursing assets have materially increased due to the slot of Capital deployed in that space. For example, during the first quarter of this year, we sold 22 Genesis assets that were below market coverage for $252 million at 8.95% yield. At market coverage and rent that represents $40 plus million of value creation. As you would recall we bought [indiscernible] assets only few months ago at a significantly cheaper price and in a materially better credit structure. While we keep reading about how skilled nursing facilities should be around two times EBITDA on coverage, this Genesis transaction highlight the significant gap between theoretical [indiscernible] worth as how practitioners behave. This is no different from the Senior Housing triple-net coverage rate, I described during the last quarterly earnings call. While Genesis assets selling Genesis assets is short-term earnings, diluted to the tune of $0.025 per share, we believe our shareholders achieved significant value and an improved growth profile for the enterprise going forward. Roughly 4% of our [NY] (ph) currently is attributed to Genesis down 70% from peak and a significant portion what remains is in PowerBack format. We continue to invest in the model, through corporate skill development. PowerBack Piscataway, we just open 13 months ago is currently 64% occupied demonstrating the power of that product. As we have consistently told you our investments philosophy is driven by price and total return. Not a desire to solve for specific operator or segment exposure. This bring me to my last point. Since last quarter earnings call, we have announced $2.25 billion of acquisition comprised of $1.5 billion in medical office and $725 million in Senior Housing, bringing our total announced or completed medical office transactions to two billion over the last six months. This has prompted speculation in the research community that Welltower is actively trying to tilt its asset mix towards medical office. As we have consistently said, we like the medical office business, but at a price. We have buyers and sellers of almost any asset at a price and implied IRR. The Cap rates at which MOB portfolios have traded during the frenzy of 2017 did not make any economic sense for Welltower's shareholders. We passed on everyone of these opportunities and would do so again at those economics.  As Cap rates have expanded, we are determined to often and have since executive $2 billion plus of Class A medical office at a blended Cap rate of 5.7% resulting at 7% plus IRR. This diligent approach add excellent value for our shareholders. While we feel very bullish about our acquisition pipeline, we will not buy any asset unless the total return makes sense regardless of current advantages of the Capital. We remain disciplined and look for off market or broken market transactions at sellers increasingly focused on [indiscernible] and reputation more than just price in this volatile Capital markets backdrop. Increasingly highly reputable developers and operators are joint venturing with Welltower by recapping their current portfolio and forming mutually beneficial growth plans by leveraging our data analytics platform. While we remain very selective on opportunities to [pause] (Ph) on, we are delighted to announce that we have locked-up in $3 plus billion under developments and under construction pipeline across seven separate relationships in both Senior Housing and medical office over the last six months. This pipeline is not an obligation, but our options to deploy Capital at an attractive returns and benefit with first look and last look and will create enormous amount of value for our shareholders. The first project of this pipeline is in the developments of two Class A trophy medical office building in midtown of Charlotte with Pappas property. These two buildings are 100% leased to Atrium Health for next 15 years and will been an anchor as we build out [Indiscernible] project with our partner. On the Senior Housing side, we are delighted to inform you that since our last call, we have committed to roughly $725 million for acquisitions at a blended Cap rate of 6.6%. This acquisition have an average age of 4.5 years and will be managed by three different operating apartment. Our pipeline remains strong in Senior Housing across both existing and new relationships. Our data analytics product Capabilities, Senior Housing and health system relationship and our team\u2019s creativity, reputation and integrity are the main reason why more and more highly reputable partners are reaching out to us today. While historically it was primarily us who reached out to them. We are very proud that we compete on this Capability and not on cost of Capital. In summary, while the fundamentals of many asset classes and industries are starting to mature both the internal and external growth prospects of Welltower are accelerating. We remain disciplined, vigilant and cognizant of the fact that we exist to create value for you our shareholders and we feel the prospects have never been better. With that, I will pass it on to John Goodey, our CFO. John? John Goodey : Thank you, Shank, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to provide you with the financial highlights of our fourth quarter and for the full-year 2018. As you have just heard from my colleagues, Q4 has been a very successful an active quarter for Welltower as has 2018 overall. Before I proceed with usual commentary, I wanted to highlight three points. One, we are confident in our continued growth in 2019, and reaffirm our 2019 guidance given at our Investor Day, with growth expected in all our business segment. Two, our strong, proactive and efficient writing of invested Capital in 2018 and in 2019 to-date has enabled us to reduce financial leverage and improve funds for all announced acquisition. Three, we are fruitfully investing $4.1 billion in 2018, making it one of the most active years in the Company's history. Our overall Q4, same-store NOI growth for Q4 2018 was 1.6% for the quarter and 1.6% for 2018 overall. This being above the midpoint of our full-year guidance. Senior Housing operating same-store NOI grew by 0.6% in the quarter and by 0.4% in 2018 overall. As Shank noted earlier, we are encouraged by another quarter improved occupancy. Seniors housing triple-net grew by 4.3% in the quarter and by 3.7% for the year, again with improved occupancy, outpatient medical grew by 1.8% in the quarter and by 2.2% for the year. Finally, long-term post acute grew by 1.4% in the quarter and by 2.1% for the year. We continue to focus of Welltower's operational efficiency even with significant investments in technology enablement and data science and the hiring of additional high-quality colleagues to our team. Our G&A expenses relative to the size of our portfolio is the protector. Overall G&A spend was $31 million for the quarter and $126 million for the year. Today, we are reporting a normalized fourth quarter 2018 FFO result of $1 per share and $4.03 per share overall for the year. These numbers reflect the increased Q4 2018, [indiscernible] total and as in the past, we do not include one-off income items or fees in our normalized numbers. Last quarter and 2018 overall, we are very active for Welltower on the balance sheet and Capital raising front. We continue to be efficient and proactive raisers of equity Capital to fund the growth of our business. During Q4, including the $300 million strategic investment made by the Qatar Investment Authority, we raised $552 million of gross proceeds from common acquisition at an average price of $68.41 per share. This included $129 million raised after at our Investor Day in Q4 originally modeled to be in 2019. Overall, for 2018, we raised $795 million of gross proceeds at an average price to $67.51 per share. In addition, since January 2019 we have raised $195 million of gross proceeds at an average price of $73.97. During the year, we issued a total of $1.85 billion of senior unsecured notes at the blended yields of 4.34%, with an average maturity of 13.8 years. We also closed on a new $3.7 billion unsecured credit facility with improved pricing across both our line of credit and term loan facilities. Our Q4 2018, closing balance sheet position improved with $215 million of cash and equivalents and $1.9 billion of Capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility. Our net debt to adjusted annualized EBITDA improved from last quarter and stood at 5.85 times at year-end. In summary, Welltower continues to enjoy excellent access to a polarity of Capital sources. During the fourth quarter, we completed $559 million for acquisition at a blended yield of 5.6%. The majority being in the outpatient medical [indiscernible]. This brought us to a yearly total at $3.4 billion in aggregate across all segments the blended yield of 7.3%. Including developments funding and other activities, total gross investments for the year were $4.1 billion making it one of the most active years in the company's history. During the quarter, we completed $349 million dispositions and received $46 million in loan pay-offs 2018. Overall for 2018, we can see dispositions sourcing $1.6 billion with $209 million of loans being repaid. I would now like to turn to our guidance for the full-year 2019. We are reaffirming our normalized FFO range at $4.10 to $4.25 per share. Starting with same-store NOI, we expect average blended same-store NOI growth of approximately 1.25% to 2.25% in 2019, which is comprised of the following components. Senior Housing operating approximately 0.5% to 2.0%. Senior Housing triple-net approximately 3.0% to 3.5%, outpatient and medical approximately 1.75% to 2.25%, our systems approximately 1.375%, and finally, long-term post acute care, approximately 2% to 2.5%. As usual, our guidance includes only announced acquisitions and includes all disposals anticipated in 2019. On February 28, 2019 Welltower will pay 191st consecutive cash dividend being $0.87. This represents a current dividend yield of approximately 4.5%. And with that, I will hand back to Tom for final comments. Thomas DeRosa : Before we open the line for questions. It's important that I mention that in 2018 Welltower achieved significant milestones in our environmental, social and governance initiatives. Highlight for the year include being named to the Dow Jones world sustainability index, one of only two North American REITs in this most prestigious index. Furthering our commitments to climate change, Welltower continues to be recognized for the number of new green building certifications added this quarter and throughout 2018. With respect to social impact the Welltower foundation and our employees donated over $1.5 million in 2018 to organizations engaged in health, wellness, arts and education. We were also recognized by the National Diversity Council, as one of the Top 15 companies, for diversity in Ohio. With respect to governance, I\u2019m pleased to announce the appointment of Catherine Sullivan to our Board of Directors. Catherine has had a 35 year career in the health insurance industry and was most recently, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s employer and individual local market, and operating division of United Health Group. Catherine join Dr. Karen DeSalvo, former acting Assistant Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Johnese Spisso, President of the UCLLA Health and CEO of UCLA Hospital System, who both joined our Board in December of 2018. We are delighted to bring these three recognized healthcare leaders to the board of Welltower. At the same time, we are sad to see Judy Pelham, and Jeff Myers retire from our Board in May. And on behalf of our shareholders, we thank them for their guidance and stewardship. Welltower seeks the model accessible American corporations. In order to be counted among the truly excellent companies, we need to be a leader in ESG. I\u2019m pleased by the fact that with our recently announced board appointments 60% that 60% of our independent are women and minorities. The diversity of our employee base, our leadership team and our board continues to be a priority at Welltower. This is not only a key component of good governance, but it has been proven driver of higher returns to shareholders. This is something we should all be proud of. At Welltower, we deploy capital in the most relevant sectors of healthcare real estate to deliver sustained cash flow growth all with an eye towards maximizing long-term shareholder value. We were the top performing large Cap REIT in 2018, delivering 15.3% of total shareholder return. This reflects not only the high quality of our differentiated business model, but the fact that we have articulated a path for growth. As you will see in 2019, we have positioned the Company, we position to continue to deliver for our shareholders. Now Nicole, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. Can you break down the components of your 2019, same-store NOI guidance for the shop portfolio between occupancy rate growth and expense growth expectations? Thomas DeRosa : Nick, at this point in the year we would like to give flexibility on how we think those would play out, but obviously we are very encouraged by the occupancy growth. We think that we will continue to have moderate rent growth and expense are challenging. So we will see how the year plays out. As you understand that we are trying to maximize our revenue not one component of the revenue, we will see how the year plays out. Too early to comment on specific breakdown. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. And can you provide an update on ProMedica's integration of the skilled nursing assets, at the Investor Day you mentioned that trend so far were better than expected? Thomas DeRosa : You have heard from the leaders of ProMedica's and HCR ManorCare on our Investor Day and you have heard from them directly that now the leadership team expects better synergies in the short-to-medium term. We are encouraged overall by what is going on in the post acute sector, I'm not going to make too many comments given that Genesis as a public company, but looking for the release and see how obviously that sector is playing out, but we are definitely encouraged by the fact that - . just remembered that about half 45% to be exact of that each managed care transaction is attributed to Senior Housing with seeing occupancy in that Senior Housing both triple-net as we mentioned, both triple-net and the shop segment is starting to come back. So those are some of the data points I would point to you as you think about overall ProMedica, HCR ManorCare construct. Nicholas Joseph : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Karin Ford : Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about your Senior Housing portfolio, your same-store NOI guidance is over 200 basis points higher than your peers on both the shop and the triple-net portfolio. Why do you think you are seeing superior performance and can you confirm that there is no incremental rent relief or portfolio transitions expected in your triple-net portfolio? Shankh Mitra : So I think that should not be a surprise. If you look at the history, you will see that how our portfolio has generated data growth and that sort of the Alfa if you will has widened as the cycle got tougher and tougher. And the second thing I would mentioned that if you look at, we have very granular view of where our portfolio or asset should, you have seen our data analytics presentation and how we are thinking about asset management, very active asset management, you kind of seen that we have taken a lot of proactive steps to sell asset and not afraid of the delusion on a short-term basis. So we are encouraged by the business, now it's very hard to comment on this things on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but we are encouraged where that population growth is coming and the supply is staring to roll over. John Goodey : Karin let me just add that it's no secret that we have sold a lot of Senior Housing assets over the years. I think what you are seeing is a plan dedicated critical view of what we own from an asset management standpoint and when we see asset in Senior Housing that we do not believe have long-term viability, we will exit those assets, we will take the short-term dilution that you get from that and all with an eye towards owning the best-in-class asset for the long-term and as Shank said in the right market. And I think you know particularly Karin, we take a very granular view of how we define the markets that we want to own Senior Housing assets in. I think what you are just seeing is the benefit of an active asset management program with the view to the future of the business and were just trying to manage FFO per share on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Karin Ford : That is a good color, thanks. And my follow-up is more of the bigger picture question on Senior Housing. You talked about the demand, the demographics and the timing. Do you think technology is allowing for greater autonomy for seniors later in life, - grocery delivery, wearable monitor is improving focus on wellness. Do you think that might delay the demand for Senior Housing? John Goodey : If you look at the demand growth for last three years for example, I mean Nick has a lot of this data, you can look at it. You will see that demand has been running particularly in the Assisted Living IO plus AL minus seg brand 3x of population growth. So there is no evidence that we have seen that is the case. Do we think that technology will change this business for better and that will be very helpful for senior in their home environment? Absolutely, but just recall that as lot of senior home is our communities as well, right. Those technologies and I mentioned a bunch of them in my prepared remarks will help us drive the margin as well. So we will see how this plays out. It's very difficult to sit here and predict what might happen. But there is no doubt that in the recent past at least we have seen the demand have been running 3x of population growth. Thomas DeRosa : You know Senior Housing provides an environment for the aging population to live safely. A lot of historic housing in this country works against seniors health and wellness. So you could put some new technology in a obsolete residential environment and I'm not sure at the end of the day you are achieving the goals of improving health outcomes at lower costs. As John said, we are very much on the forefront of bringing new technology into our settings and also thinking really hard about what the settings of the future look like. And that is why we are so focused on the markets that we are in. Because Senior Housing is a very expensive product. As I always say, it's a luxury good that no one aspires to own. But it's a necessity, but it's actually out of reach for the majority of the population. So we have been very careful about where to own that real estate, because the cost of delivering the care as you all know has been growing significantly. So you need to be in places where people can pay. Overtime, I am hopeful, we will figure out how to deliver a much needed environment, a much needed real estate settings at a cost that is not without reach for the majority of the population. So stay tuned on that Karin. Karin Ford : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the like of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. Shankh, I know you don't want to give components of the guidance, but is it safe to assume that within the guidance expenses of about 4% are baked in and that you are like to see the trajectory improve given the expense comps get easier through the year? Shankh Mitra : As you know, as you look at our numbers, you will see the expense growth has been challenging for last five years, so this is nothing new. I would expect that 2019 we will continue to see that, maybe we will see some moderation in 2020, because a lot the California markets by then will actually have $15 of wage growth. So which is driven a lot of those increases. By 2019 will continue to be a challenging year and obviously, hopefully we will be able to mitigate that like we have using some pricing and some occupancy. You are correct about the trajectory given obviously year-over-year growth is not just a function of what happened this year, because the function of what happened last year. So you are correct about the trajectory. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. And then just my follow-up, just your comment on not really looking at portfolio composition, but sort of looking at what is available and what the price is. Your reference to skilled nursing sort of pricing moving up, does that sort of make you more a seller today versus a buyer and how would you sort of describe just pricing across your different subgroups? Shankh Mitra : I'm not just suggesting by any means that we don\u2019t have a view of what our ideal portfolio should be constructed. I will also say that view is evolving, so it's not a static view, but what I was trying to drive that most importantly we deploy Capital to make money. Even if we assume that we had a long-term view of some percent of asset from some segment or some operators, we are not prepared to get to view, to execute that view, to realize that view, we are not prepared to pay a price that does not make sense from a total return perspective. That is what I was trying to drive at. As you have seen within 12 months we have turned from an opportunistic buyer to an opportunistic seller right. Every asset this Company owns is for sale at a price and total return. So that is no different from skilled nursing, no different from any other billings we own in any other segments. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. If I may just sneak one more in, I was a bit surprised or maybe it\u2019s also early in the year, but the $2.25 billion of acquisitions you have done, obviously you have closed Hammes and specifically CNL, it seems like it's modestly accretive. You have talked about the trajectory improving for FFO, but it is also suggest that maybe your midpoint could move up, just given the amount of acquisitions you have done for this year? Thomas DeRosa : Yes, background in 10 year. I think the pre-funding that we pointed to at this point makes sense for us to think about that from conservatism on the closing side of these acquisitions. So as John mentioned in his prepared remarks, not only did we have the issuance from the fourth quarter, but we continue to issue 195 million of equity into the first quarter and had $270 million disposition that have already closed as well. So, when you think about kind of where we are at from at from a funding perspective our balance sheet is actually in a very good spot to start closing on a lot of the acquisitions that we have spoken to and the combination of the timing of our closing the acquisitions, plus the seasonality of our Senior Housing, which steps down in first quarter, but then picks up throughout the year is what is driving that acceleration of earnings from the first quarter through the end of the year. So, understood on your comments around where we are at that midpoint, at this point we are maintaining a range because that makes the sensitive what the properly announced information. Vikram Malhotra : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Tayo Okusanya : Hi, yes good morning everyone. Congrats on the quarter and the outlook, it\u2019s been definitely looking up. A couple of things, the guidance, I'm just trying to understand kind of what is in and what is out given the large amount of transactions that are being contemplated at this point. It sounds like the CNL transaction is in the numbers and all the acquisitions announced pre-CNL, what I'm trying to understand is $725 million of deals in the first line that Shankh talked about are those in the numbers and it also seem like this full guidance went up from 800 to about 1.4 billion, is that increased also in the guidance? Thomas DeRosa : Yes Tayo, Tim again. Answer is yes and yes. So on the acquisition side, we have $1 billion acquisition we announced on our Investor Day, which 180th, which had closed in the fourth quarter and the remaining of which will close during 2019. And then as you said, we announced CNL on January 2nd and its $1.25 billion. So between the Investor Day announcements and the CNL announcement, you are getting you are your acquisition, your publicly announced acquisitions. And our disposition of $1.4 billion that we revised this morning is all included into our 2019 number. John Goodey : I would just add one more. If you think about it, we have raised the equity already. But as you know, real estate transaction takes time to close, right? You have a six month gap between when you are raising capital versus when you are deploying capital, which is the prudent thing to do. We are not going to take that kind of market with, we have big balance sheet to maintain. But that is sort of driving the dilution this year, but sort of, you can refer from Tom's comments that we don't think, that impacts the run rate earnings growth. So you are going to see a good chunk of the run rate earnings growth shows up in the second half and then flows through 2020 and beyond. Tayo Okusanya : Yes I understand. Okay that is helpful. And number two, again, the $3 billion of development pipeline that you announced. I found that pretty interesting. Can we just talked a little bit about again the timing around when all that could be deployed, whether again I know - you just kind of like row for first look, last look, type situation, but of that $3 billion, how much realistically do actually think, you guys could execute on that over what timing? John Goodey : Yes. So we do think that the number I mentioned is ones that we can execute on. And as I said that we want to do it, we have several different structures. And we don't want to do a role for just we mentioned. But we are deploying capital in various ways equity that different parts of the capital structure. And when not equity, and we fund a portion of our capital stack to mezzanine, back in mortgage, participating mortgage. You can think about in structural, provisions that is available that we use. Then we get a role for [indiscernible] and a participation that is defined on the front end. So we are very careful about our basis. We are very careful about our IRRs that we achieve. But more importantly, as I said, that is our options and not an obligation. So obviously we would hope when we deploy the capital, where the cost of capital, if not we wouldn\u2019t. so that sort of gives you a sense of how we think about this. Thomas DeRosa : But there is high visibility Tayo to that number. This is a number that we know where those opportunities are. John Goodey : Yes. That is a good point I should have mentioned that. So Tayo I can sit down with you and walk you through building-by-building what those opportunities are and unidentified opportunities that is a very good point Tom. Tayo Okusanya : Okay. Excellent. One more you would indulge me. I would take a look at the sub and then in regards to properties under construction on the shop side for your top three markets L.A., New York and Boston. Still like there are a couple of more properties under construction now on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Just what is your viewpoints in regards to supply. Is that kind of shifting back to primary markets, is it's still really more of an issue of secondary markets at this point in the cycle? Shankh Mitra : So, Tayo we do give you those stats, because that is what you guys have asked for and we continue to give those stats. Well our view of supply as it relates to our own portfolio is very granular and much granular, we have shown you some of the facts on our Investor Day, which you know we see a supply is an ACU or Adjusted Competition Units and our view is competition or our portfolio will be lower in 2019 than in 2018. But that we will see obviously things fall off from it 2018 to 2019 that I also think go from 2019 to 2020. We are encouraged by what we are seeing particularly as you recall, I mentioned in Assisted Living segment, which is a very large portion of our U.S. business we have seen 120 basis points in occupancy increase. That is one of the best uptick we have seeing in years hopefully that is helpful. Thank you. Tayo Okusanya : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the time in earlier remarks. Kind of a higher level question. Maybe for Tom or Shank, but in the last recession obviously we didn\u2019t have the sharper [Indiscernible] structure at least not that meaningful ways of today. So how do you expect shop to perform in a recessionary environments since you are not protected by the least payments, but are instead exposed to premarket supply and demand fundamentals. I'm not saying that is - the broader macro picture is going, but you should just trying to understand your views there and how that businesses should perform in a recessionary environment? Thomas DeRosa : Yes. So you are asking for something that we have absolutely no upside, either than predicting what might happen. I will just mention it to you that as you know our Senior Housing business, which is an e-driven business. Right. So if you look at the Assisted Living data, over those timeframe you will see a business stage, lost a couple of 100 basis points of occupancy, but the rates growth remains resilient and expense growth is obviously helpful in that kind of environment. I'm not going to venture a guess of to exactly how things are going to play out. I will also mention to you that it depends on when you go into such an environment, what is the supply more importantly what the demand side looks like. So it's a complicated answer than you would like, but I would like to point out when you think of our portfolio Senior Housing is a very broad term. When you think about our portfolio, think as you know it's a very much that particular portfolio and our idea says is very much the new driven product. Jonathan Hughes : Yes okay. That is helpful. And then I will just try to have one more, but looking at the capital stack you have $720 million of preferred sitting on the balance sheet at a 6.5% coupon that I believe are redeemable. Any plans to call those and maybe refi with debt or pay down with common equity embedded in 2019 guidance? Shankh Mitra : Thanks Jonathan. So the preferred you are referring to, you are right there, they are convertible and are actually convertible at all right above 73.54. So even trading above that for some time, and there is a trigger on that that if the stock stays where as that or above that it will hit in the near future. I think the way you just think about that is that the way we manage our balance sheet is always to continue to position it, in a better long-term position, and we will be in the unique position if those remains convertible to not only further exercise the balance sheet, but do it in a cash flow accretive way. So I don't want to speak to where the stock price may or may not be in the coming weeks, but you should think of us making the right long-term decision from a balance sheet perspective on this. Jonathan Hughes : Yes. Okay, that is it from me, I will jump off. Thanks for the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : Thank you. Good morning. Can you guys offer a bit of granularity on the 1.4 billion of sales that are in guidance at a 6.2? I think the Genesis sales or $252 million at a nine Cap. So I'm just kind of - if you can help us get to the other residual amount or maybe what that [indiscernible] price of the deal? Thomas DeRosa : Sorry Jordan, last part of your question got cut off. Jordan Sadler : Sorry. The residual amount there would be helpful whatever is in that basket? Thomas DeRosa : Yes. So far to-date you are correct. The Genesis transaction close now its $252 million and we had another $16 million of transactions close year-to-date. So we have closed on 268 million dispositions at a little less than a nine cash cut. So the remaining call it $1.1 billion should be spread out through the remainder of the year. I will think about it kind of being in mid-year from here as far as timing. Jordan Sadler : Can you tell us what it is? Thomas DeRosa : Yes. The remaining assets or mix of medical office buildings and Senior Housing. And I would think of that being, so getting about the blended Cap rate overall you see the remaining $1.1 billion is being done in much lower Cap rate than what has been sold. And it's more in the category of what we have talked about in the recent past, which is outside of opportunistic continued kind of calling in the portfolio and some of the higher [indiscernible] sectors, there is not much of that left. So when we think about capital recycling going forward it's really lower Cap rate non-core assets in our business that are higher quality, but there is institutional demand for it, that aren\u2019t necessarily part of the Company's long-term strategy. And that is going to be reflected in the Cap rate. But it kind of goes back. Jordan Sadler : Mathematically it seems almost sub five based on what you saw Genesis? Thomas DeRosa : Yes. Correct. Your math is correct, an abundant Cap rates of what is remaining. So I think it will be from a quality perspective, from a sales Cap rate perspective it will fit again in that bucket of higher quality assets just don't fit into our necessarily our long-term strategy. John Goodey : Jordan. We are not definitely just building a math, we can only tell you that the demand for healthcare assets both in Senior Housing and medical office is extremely robust. It's clearly Senior Housing, we are seeing medical office have Cap rates have come up from the cross of 2017, but in seniors housing there is an absolute bidding frenzy from institutional investors. People are seeing where the demand growth curve is going and there is a true demand for this assets. So we obviously like to recycle our portfolio and our balance sheet or working in those time. So that is what we are doing. Thomas DeRosa : I would was just add that Jordan. This is kind of back to the Karin\u2019s question from earlier. But the math on kind of our dispositions throughout the year adds to the part of that to the acceleration of earnings into the year. So your mouth is correct, we are being accretive sales in the back half and to put that I think Vikram said anything as the run rate likely during the year would be towards the higher end of what our guidance is out there. But throughout the year, we will have a low remember at the start and partially due to some of the sales currently going to be it. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then just a couple of quick clarification. So, looking at your Senior Housing triple-net rent expired - last quarter there was 40 million-ish expiring in the rest of 2018 and there was zero in 2019 and now outlooks like - I'm curious what happened to that, I don\u2019t know if that was Brandywine or something else, now it looks like there is about 28 million that is set to mature into 2019, and it's expected to be converted in addition to Senior Housing operating. So just could you confirm that Brandywine? John Goodey : No, Jordan, it's a Brookdale transition that is still happening. A lot of those assets \u2013 California, a lot of Brookdale assets are in California and those obviously the licensing transfer takes time, so those are happening right now. There has not been any additional triple-net to write their conversant other than Brandywine and Brookdale that we have talked about though the year - last year. Jordan Sadler : And the other clarification is for the show guidance for 2019, all transition assets are in the guidance Brandywine and Brookdale? John Goodey : Brandywine is, because it is not a change of operators. Brookdale assets are not because it is a change of operator. Jordan Sadler : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. Shankh, I wonder if you can provide some additional color off of the $3 billion predevelopment pipeline. Are these with new and/or existing relationships and could you provide a breakout between MOB and Senior Housing assets? Shankh Mitra : Yes. I mentioned seven relationships, three are in MOB, four are in senior\u2019s housing, all but one is a new relationship, one is existing relationship. Michael Carroll : Okay. And I'm sorry if I missed this from a Tayo's questions. But is it safe to assume that you guys can break ground on these projects over the next one to two years or should we think about this more of a longer-term type pipeline? Shankh Mitra : No. We have broken ground already on the largest project we mentioned, which is a [Indiscernible] property. I also said these are not just development, they are under construction project as well. So, obviously they are coming up and obviously at the right point in the lifecycle we will execute on those opportunities. But they are as I said, as you can look at, it is very typical for this company to have this kind of arrangements that is why we have always executed in relationship investment strategy with our operators, so there is nothing new that I'm telling you. But we are very encouraged that six of the seven new relationship with highly reputable developers and operating partners and a very interesting part of that trend which is a change as I mentioned in my script out of those seven, four has reached out to us instead of us reaching to them. And so that sort of gives you a sense of how we compete in the marketplace today is shifting. Thomas DeRosa : I had mentioned in an answer to Tayo\u2019s question, that there is tremendous visibility here. Now anything can happen in the development world, lots of reasons why things will be delayed, but I can\u2019t underscore more that we know where these opportunities are and the timing of them is not something that we are going to predict for you. But let's just say, this is not 10 years out in the future. These are things that we are actively engaged in right now. Michael Carroll : Great and I guess last question and it seems like a pretty attractive pipeline. Should we assume that the Company's focus on developments will increase from this point forward is? Are you seeing more opportunities out there, I guess it was highlighted by the $3 billion of deals you kind of just highlighted? Thomas DeRosa : You know I think what Shankh said is that we are engaged with some of the most successful developers in the U.S. today. And they are presenting us with many attractive opportunities that are very strategic for us, because these are opportunities with some of the nation's leading health systems. And I think you have gotten a little flavor for that. If you look at what we have done and what we have announced in 2018, and some of the projects, for example, with Providence St. Joseph Health system, the projects that we talked about today with Atrium, a very highly rated system in North Carolina. These should give you an indication of where a significant amount of growth will happen to Welltower. We are not going to give you any more granularity about that, other than we showed you with real examples of what we are doing and we have articulated a $3 billion pipeline you should assume a big percentage of it is more of that. Michael Carroll : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Lukas Hartwich : Thanks, good morning. So for Shankh, the UK portfolio has put up two quarters of high-single-digit NOI growth. Can you provide some color and the drivers there? Shankh Mitra : It's driven by significant occupancy ramp in UK. Lukas Hartwich : Okay. And then I think in your comments Shankh, you mentioned that you are working on something like $600 million Senior Housing acquisitions. Can you provide more color on the quality market mix versus the current portfolio? Shankh Mitra : I think Lukas, you might have a start, I think, I said that we have announced $725 million worth of Senior Housing portfolio across three operating partners. And these assets are new assets, young assets 4.5 years of age. But there is nothing else I have to add to that, except that we think that we did this transactions at a very attractive returns of 6.6% Cap rate. John Goodey : The question of quality is hard to answer. Quality to us is what is strategically relevant to our long-term plan. We are selling and you have seen us sell assets that many people think are high quality. We talked about where Cap rates are in this space. These are high quality assets to some people, but they may not be strategic to us. So it's hard to answer that question. When you see us deploying capital in senior's housing going forward. Understand it's in markets and the types of assets that are relevant to the broader well tower strategy which is connecting Senior Housing more broadly in the health and what is increasingly becoming a wellness continuum. That is what we are driving here. So that is what we think of this quality, because we sell something it doesn't mean low quality and we are getting good price for it, because to some buyers they are great assets, just they don\u2019t fit necessarily our long strategic plans. I hope that is helpful. Lukas Hartwich : That is yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning everyone, thanks for taking the question here. So the main question I wanted to ask was to just touched on a couple minutes ago, but just to kind of ask on the same subject, anyway really as a follow-up on the overall pipeline. In the U.S. market right now, we are actually seeing real-time that many hospitals and health systems are actually posting stronger than expected earnings results exiting 2018 and in 2019. That should give health systems more confident before the trigger on acquisitions whether it's in post acute or other types of assets. So again you are kind of touching this a little bit, as we think about your pipeline of opportunities with health systems you know I'm curious if you are getting that same sense that pipeline could actually be accelerating a little bit ProMedica ManorCare type deals as we think about Welltower's opportunities with health systems or just pipeline will be accelerating in other asset types that with health system just given their what seems to be strengthening balance sheets? Thanks. Thomas DeRosa : Good question Steve. Let me take some of that and maybe Mark Shaver will have some comments on this, because he spends a lot of time with the health systems as to why. One of the comments I will make is that as health systems start to see a future to their business model that is different from the very focused acute care model that drove so much of their real-estate investment in the past, I think that open-up opportunities for partners like Welltower. So I would say what you see particularly from the non-profit health systems is a little bit of a mixed bag in terms of performance, because some of them are very well positioned to face a great new world, where data, new technologies and an ambulatory focus will have a big impact on profitability. Those that are attached to an acute care in patient bedded hospital models will struggle, not to say that there aren't markets where there is an undersupply of acute care. But on balance, there is a lot outmoded acute care beds that fit in all of these health systems that are well packed or useful life. So when they look at capital going forward, many of them are now seeing that a partnership with Welltower helps them to accelerate the transition that they need to undertake. Mark do you want to make a comment\u2026 Mark Shaver : Yes. Tom and Steve thanks for the question its Mark Shaver. I would maybe add two points. I think with health systems, we are going to continue to see two very important trends that we are positioned well to help with. One is there are going to continue to need to right size their critical delivery systems, this is a lot of what Tom said. we continue to move away from the acute care and maybe some specialty care environment in the in-patient setting and build out there ambulatory outpatient and other sites of care footprint. So we continue to be very active in those dialogues, and I think while their balance sheet is maybe strengthening a bit, the ability for them to fund that clinical growth on their own is going to continue to be challenged. That is a great opportunity for us. And then the second piece, which is really where I think your question was starting, there is going to continue to be vertical integration with health system partners, like you see across the health spectrum. And so that is going to create these ProMedica type transactions where they are looking to grow additional margin businesses. And again, I think we are very well positioned to support that. Thomas DeRosa : And I would just add one last comment. Majority of the pipeline today, if you look at with health system though. It is on what you understand as traditional outpatient ambulatory care medical officer segments. Steven Valiquette : Okay. got it, okay. alright, thanks everybody. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. This is [indiscernible] on for Chad. It's my first question on the increase disposition guidance going from 800 million to 1.4 billion. What changed since December that lead you guys to increase this so significantly? Thomas DeRosa : Yes. It's Tim here. We are always talks talk, as Shankh mentioned as part of his prepared remarks and as we are consistently saying with interested parties in our assets. And you shouldn't think of discussions between now in December having been something changed, but things firm up and it got to the point where we have to putting it into guidance now than we would have been back in December. Unidentified Analyst : Alright. Thanks. And then just looking at the triple-net Senior Housing portfolio. It does look like, you have about 2% of your portfolio under one times coverage. Should we still think about any triple-net to write their conversion going forward? Shankh Mitra : So, well I think, if you look at last quarter earnings call, you will see that I have going through significant details about how to think about that segments, I'm not going to repeat that. I mean, I think, I answered that question before that you are not going to see something of material size. But we have to say it, we don't think about is a triple-net better than idea, or idea better than triple-net and that is not how we do this business. We think about alignment of interest with our operators. So if it is the right alignment, we will take ideas into triple-net, if it is the right alignment to do it the other way, we are going to do that. But just to answer your question very specifically, please go back and read the transcript from last call, you will see there is a major discussion about that topic. I don't want to waste everybody's time to get into that. But we do not expect anything aside change from triple-net or idea as of today. Unidentified Analyst : Alright, thanks. And just on the segment guidance for 2019, the outpatient medical guidance budgets declined 25 basis points of the midpoint verses 2018. Can you just give more color what drove that decrease year-over-year? Shankh Mitra : Yes. Absolutely. This is also something we talked about in details and our Investor Day. We have a couple of lead test role in this year that would have downtime. We always underwrite downtime. And that is what you are seeing, sort of gets caught in that calendar site. We are very, very excited about that business as key towards taking over the business and is making lots of change. So starting towards the end of this year into next year, you will see the fruits of those efforts that key just putting in and bringing and hiring a lot of really good talent there. And also empowering a lot of our existing talent. So we are very excited about the business. What you are seeing the 25 basis points, it\u2019s just a function to lease role that we described on our Investor Day. Unidentified Analyst : Alright, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Hi, two questions. First, what do you see is being your average annual development spend over the next five years, given how the pipeline is ramping up. And then second, the billing for disposition target, should we think of that as that is what you want to sell this year. So if you are more active on the acquisition side. We should be thinking of equity for incremental funding or could we see that disposition number scale-up more? John Goodey : First is I'm not going to venture to give us on what average development spend will be, it is safe to assume it will be higher than where it is, it's a question of risk reward. As you know that we for example in the medical office segment, we already put shovel in the underground when it's close to 100%. We don't go and build a building if we have say a half of that as a commitment, so that sort of to answer to what the question you asked, it\u2019s probably going to be higher, but it is a function of lot of other factors. The second, answer is, as we think about the ramp-up of the acquisition portfolio, we should also think that equitization of those assets will come from both common equity as well as the assets we own. Tom talked about how we think about asset dispositions, we have lots of very high-quality assets that has a significant bid in the marketplace today. And we will continue to recycle capital and the most important point that you are not going to see the diluted capital rates that you have seen before, so whether it's from common equity, it\u2019s from the assets we own, we do think that we will very prudently manage the balance sheet. Thomas DeRosa : You know Mike I want to make one comment. I think you should expect that developments will accelerate in this next cycle, including the fact that there we are bringing forth a new asset classes that didn\u2019t exist, I mean a lot of that have been Senior Housing models like that we have announced on 56th Street which by the way was tapped off just last week right Mercedes? Mercedes Kerr : Okay. Thomas DeRosa : But we announced on 85th in Broadway, this is a product that is never been delivered. I think what healthcare real-estate offer investors is the opportunity to invest in a next-generation class of real estate that they have not seen before. It's going to take a lot of capital, that is what we are positioned to do. I don\u2019t know how you do that if you are not investing with Welltower. And Shanks comments about all this incoming calls now, a lot of it has to do that, we met with an institution who realize they would be much better off investing with us than trying to compete against us. Because there are - just you have heard us talk a lot about our data analytics capabilities. No one can compete with that, so there you go. Michael Mueller : Okay. That is helpful. Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Eric Fleming with SunTrust. Eric Fleming : Good morning. Just wanted to ask a question on how are you guys looking at potential Medicare advantage opportunities. I know Sunrise talked about their plan at the Investor Day, you have got the ProMedica relationship. When do you think you can start getting any contribution and what do you think the total market opportunity is for the NA plants? Mark Shaver : Yes Eric. This is Mark Shaver. You know I think Medicare advantage continues to grow as the trend in country it's about 35% adoption nationally in MA plants. The larger plans for straightforward Medicare really looking at the earlier younger population that the middle 60s to early 70s of population. A lot of the residents living in our community are older and more frail. And some of the more specialized programs, the institution programs, really, which is what Sunrise and some of the others are playing. It's actually a much smaller percentage adoption of that nationally. We are talking about less than 100,000 individuals across the country in those plans. So we are very active in those conversations with some of the major payers and there is, as Tom says often early days with regards to MA and the adoption. But we are very active and we think there is going to be an important role in partnering with payers years in this front. Thomas DeRosa : We think there actually will be develop of products by the payers that will address the needs of the population that will likely enter the Assisted Living sector. Again, generally a wealthier population. Historically, we don't think of MA as a product that was geared for somebody paying $8500 a month for Senior's Housing. But I think that is going to change in the future. And as Mark said, we have a lot of discussion with the major payers, you just heard that a very senior executive from United Health Care came on our board. We just announced it today, as well as Dr. Karen DeSalvo, who was with the largest payer in the world CMS and he is the larger payer in the U.S. CMS. So we have got a lot of good knowledge and experience of both inside the Company and sitting on our board. Eric Fleming : Okay. Thanks a lot. Thomas DeRosa : Thank you. Operator : And with no further questions, we thank you for dialing to the Welltower earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation and ask that you please disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2019 Welltower Earnings Conference Call. My name is Nicole, and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, sir. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower\u2019s first quarter 2019 results. On the safe harbor, you'll hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa, CEO; Shankh Mitra, Chief Investment Officer; and John Goodey, CFO. Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances these projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in this morning's press release and, from time to time, the company's filings with the SEC. If you did not receive a copy of the press release this morning, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at welltower.com. And with that, I will hand the call over Tom for his remarks in the quarter. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, Tim. I'm pleased to report a strong quarter completely in line with the expectations we laid out for you at our Investor Day last December. These results are the product of consistent growth across all of our business segments, in particular seniors housing, where performance is being driven by an ongoing stabilization of occupancy which Welltower began to benefit from in 2018. We expect this to continue through the rest of the year. We also continue to benefit from excellent access to capital which allowed us to both fund our contractual investment pipeline and position the balance sheet for opportunistic investments going forward locking in long-term value creation for our shareholders. Our differentiated strategy and approach to capital allocation has resulted in a total of $2 billion in new investments, closed or announced, since the start of 2019 bringing accretive new investment volume to over $6 billion since early 2018. This is enabling Welltower to deliver the earnings growth we report to you today. Simply put, we run Welltower to deliver sustainable and reliable growth to our shareholders. Our results demonstrate that our strategy works. Shankh Mitra will now give you a closer look at our operating performance in the quarter as well as our new investment activity. Shankh? Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I will now review our quarterly operating results, provide additional details on performance, trends and recent investment activity. At our Investor Day in December, we gave you a detailed look into our view of senior housing supply and how adjusted competition units and yet-to-open inventory shocks impacts our best-in-class portfolio within our specific micro markets. While pundits proclaimed supply headwinds for years to come using their gut feel as it suits their story at a given moment, our data analytics team of statisticians and computer scientists, armed with machine learning, not gut feelings, informed our prediction of the turn in our operating trends that I have discussed with you over the last three quarters. However, I have to admit, our first quarter SHOP results exceeded our expectations in all three main drivers; rate, occupancy and labor cost. Same-store NOI for the SHOP portfolio is up 3% year-over-year, driven by 60 basis points of occupancy growth, 2.9% rate growth, partially offset by a 3.6% labor cost growth. These are the best fundamental results we have seen in a long time. Sequential results are even more encouraging. Sequential revenue growth of 0.4% in a usually seasonally weak first quarter is one of the best we have seen in years, and is driven by both strong rate and occupancy. More interestingly, this quarter, for the first time in five years, we saw sequential revenue per occupied room growth of 3.3% outpaced compensation per occupied room growth of 2.8%, resulting in a positive spread of 50 basis points. One of the most underappreciated aspect of our company is the strength and diversity of our senior housing operating platform, which has 23 operators in three countries. In any operating business, growth is not always a straight line as many of us wish it was. However, due to significant diversity of our operating partners across geographies and through these spectrums, that volatility is softened in the aggregate. Over the last few years, we have routinely seen parts of our portfolio results that resemble the challenges of the industry at large. But, these operators have consistently been pulled up by other operating partners who serve a completely different customer need in another part of the country. Having said that, this quarter, we experienced broad strength across majority of our operators. Exceptional UK results are driven by significant asset management efforts by our UK team headed by Justice Skiver, a deep negative comp in prior years and the lease up of a couple of low occupancy assets. We expect UK results to normalize as we move through the year. On the other hand, the Canadian platform facing a tough comparison year is expected to normalize upwards as the year progresses. We continue to be encouraged by our U.S. portfolio this quarter. NOI is up 2.2% year-over-year driven by 40 basis points of occupancy increase, 2.8% rate growth and particularly encouraging 3.8% compensation per occupied room growth. We have seen broad-based trends across larger and smaller market. From a product-type perspective, our industry leading assisted living and memory care portfolio drove results with 4% NOI growth. While a handful of quarters does not make a trend, we are cautiously optimistic that our portfolio is positioned for significant cash flow growth for years to come. While results were in line in our other lines of businesses, I want to highlight a few things to help you understand the trend. First, in our senior housing triple-net segment, the reduction of progress is driven primarily by the removal of StoryPoint portfolio, which we sold in the quarter, and somewhat by Brookdale underperformance. As you know, we consider StoryPoint to be one of our best and most strategic operating partners yet we sold this asset at an offer we could not refuse. We sold this 20-year-plus-old asset at a 4.6% yield at an unlevered IRR of almost 19%. For our eight-plus years of ownership, we achieved an NOI CAGR of 7.2% in face of significant supply headwind. We continue to grow with StoryPoint through a new RIDEA joint venture with two brand new assets that we just bought, several in development and are transitioning many more community to Dan and Brian that we believe we\u2019ll see cash flow growth similar to that experienced in the portfolio that we just sold. While we are not working on any lease restructuring in our senior housing triple-net portfolio at this moment, we have plans for every asset. And frankly, we'll be happy to get back many of these assets so that we can transfer them to the operate like StoryPoint so that you, as our shareholders, can enjoy significant upside. Secondly, our post-acute portfolio is declining coverage is driven by a handful of L Tax [ph] we own, which is less than 1% of our asset base. Skilled nursing license asset which constitute a vast majority of our post-acute bucket either in the traditional sense or in the short stay category are stabilizing as I have described in our last quarter earnings call and you subsequently heard from Genesis. While mix shift is still a headwind, we're encouraged by occupancy growth, recent reimbursement announcements, and upcoming PDPM implementation in Q4. Third, we're very happy with the capital deployment plan, ProMedica HCR ManorCare assets. ProMedica HCR ManorCare team is working diligently with our data analytics team to prioritize capital deployment. We have 45 assets slated to go through this CapEx program in the next two to four months. And last, as I have no noteworthy update for our outpatient medical operating results, we\u2019re very encouraged by 2.1% net rent increase in the quarter and the dramatic changes that Keith and Ryan are making in that platform to position us for growth next year and beyond. On the capital deployment side, we're busier than ever. We have closed $778 million of investment so far this year and have significantly more that are closing in coming months. These investments have been made both in senior housing as well as medical office segment. In senior housing segment, we continue to grow with our existing partners such as Chelsea and Discovery. We are very excited about our new joint venture, RIDEA relationship with Frontier Management that we established this quarter. Portland, Oregon-based Frontier is one of the finest operator in the high acuity segment of the senior housing business. Greg Roderick, who is the CEO and majority owner of Frontier, is a third generation operator and leads one of the most operationally-focused teams that we have seen in this industry. We have significant plans for growth with this team in the future. As we continue to acquire attractive assets with great operating partners or health systems, we will fund this capital need through disposition and common equity. We expect the supporting yield on disposition will be similar, very similar to the initial yield on acquisition, but our thesis is to drive higher total return, or IRR in that trade, through higher growth rates and lower CapEx. Whether through disposition or common equity, we only allocate capital when we believe this thesis holds. However, there can be a timing difference when the capital is raised and an acquisition is closed. This timing difference, which has no impact on our run rate earnings, can impact quarterly earnings, but we're willing to make that trade-off in order to minimize the balance sheet risk and locking in long-term value creation, as Tom described. We are not interested in rolling the dice in this volatile capital market by playing a short-term game, a short-term earnings game, but rather driving long-term cash flow and NAV growth. Beyond our significant organic acquisition machine, we are beginning to see the emergence of value-add opportunities. By definition, these transaction are not accretive to cash flow day one, but they come at a significant discount on all real estate valuation metrics, such as price per door or price per foot, and will drive significant IRR and NAV growth. We believe our acquisition of South Bay portfolio with Discovery that we closed subsequent to the quarter end fits in this bucket. We\u2019re exploring a few opportunities in the medical office space in this category as well. We are looking for the right opportunity, but we\u2019re very much like the idea of what these assets can become in hands of kith and kin. In summary, we are very encouraged by accelerating prospects of both internal and external growth opportunities. This will be a very busy year for us on all fronts. With that, I'll pass it on to John Goodey, our CFO. John? John Goodey : Thank you, Shankh, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to provide you with the financial highlights of our first quarter 2019. As you just heard from my colleagues, Q1 has been another successful and very active quarter for Welltower as we\u2019re highlighting our differentiated portfolio and corporate capabilities. During the quarter, we completed $367 million of gross investments including $259 million of high quality acquisitions at a blended yield of 6.3% with twice that value already closed today in 2018 Q2. We also completed $612 million of dispositions in the quarter at a blended yield of 6.7%. In addition, we received $14 million in loan payoffs. Q1 was especially active for Welltower on the balance sheet and capital racing front. During the quarter, we successfully raised $538 million of gross proceeds from our common equity issuance via our DRIP and ATM programs at an average price of $74.69 per share. In addition, we elected to affect the mandatory conversion of all our outstanding 6.5% Series I cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock into common stock. During the quarter, we successfully accessed the senior unsecured notes market issuing an aggregate of$1.05 billion across 5- and 10-year tenants using the proceeds to redeem an aggregate $1.05 billion of existing notes during 2019 and 2020. In doing so, we increased our average debt maturity profile by 6 months to 8.1 years at the quarter end. Finally, we initiated an up to $1 billion unsecured commercial paper program providing us with an alternative source of short-term financing. In summary, Welltower continues to enjoy excellent access to a plurality of capital sources to fund and pre-fund our acquisition pipeline and future growth opportunities. Our Q1 2019 closing balance sheet position was strong with $249 million of cash and equivalents and $2.6 billion of capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility. Our leverage metrics improved from last quarter with net debt to adjusted EBITDA falling to 5.47 times. Moving on to earnings, today, we're able to report a normalized first quarter 2019 FFO result of $1.02 per share representing growth of 3% over Q1 2018. As in the past, we do not include one-off income items such as these bifurcation or loan repayment fees in our normalized numbers. Our overall Q1 same-store NOI growth was an encouraging 3.1% for the quarter with all our segments recording solid growth. Senior housing operating same-store NOI grew by 3.0% in the quarter with the UK delivering a standout result. Senior housing triple net grew by 4%, outpatient medical grew by 2.3%, and long-term post-acute grew by 3.2%. I\u2019d now like to turn to our guidance. For the full year 2019, we are reaffirming our expected normalized FFO range of $4.10-$4.25per share and our previously announced expected average blended same-store NOI growth of approximately 1.25% to 2.25%, with growth expected in all our business segments. We are also reaffirming our segmental guidance of senior housing operating, approximately 0.5% to 2%; senior housing triple-net, approximately 3% to 3.5%; outpatient medical, approximately 1.75% to 2.25%; health systems, approximately 1.375%; and long-term post-acute care of approximately 2% to 2.5%. As usual, our guidance includes only announced acquisitions and includes all disposals anticipated in 2019. Finally, on May 28, 2019, Welltower will pay its 192nd consecutive cash dividend being $0.87 per share. This represents a current annualized dividend yield of approximately 4.8%. With that, I'll hand back to Tom for final comments. Tom? Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, John. Now, Nicole, please open up the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. The first question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Daniel Bernstein : A good quarter. Wanted to expand on the comments about value-add opportunities that you first opened up your comments with. What sectors are you seeing that in and maybe what is causing those opportunities to pop up? Is there a private equity pulling back? Is it simply developers have kind of hit the end of their line on their development funding and now need to go ahead and sell assets? Just wanted to kind of understand kind of the scope and extent of that. Thomas DeRosa : Good question, Dan. I'd say it's all of the above. We're seeing opportunities across all of the sectors that we have focused in historically. And there are value-add opportunities we see outside of our portfolio, and we've talked about value-add opportunities we see inside the portfolio. Shankh, you want to expand on that? Shankh Mitra : Yeah. I think, Dan, you\u2019re right. What happened is if you think about \u2013 we think about supply as it impacts operating portfolio, right, operating results. And also, you think about supply, you think about a lot of inventory that you can either acquire or inventory that people have built, people who are not from this business. Think about multifamily developers. People who have never been into an operating business have built, and now they can lease up, right. So that's sort of the point. They\u2019re hitting a wall, so you can buy these things at 40%, 50%, 60% occupancy at a very, very good price door. I'm talking of seniors housing segment. And you can do very well with them. On the medical office, they\u2019re few and far between. As I said, we're looking at a couple of opportunities. A great price per foot. And the ownership of some of these buildingseither have changed their strategic objective or they just could not maintain a capital structure that will require ongoing investment like we do in our portfolio, and great owners, other great owners are doing that portfolio. So, we're seeing that more in seniors housing but we have some significant opportunities in medical office as well. Daniel Bernstein : Okay. But will those opportunities require a significant amount of CapEx or is it more of an operational improvement that needs to happen just trying to understand \u2013 I know it\u2019s not accretive from day one, I\u2019m just also \u2013 just trying to understand\u2026 Thomas DeRosa : Sure. Daniel Bernstein : How much do you need to put in and how long is that going to take? Thomas DeRosa : Yeah. So, if you buy a 60% leased senior housing portfolio, it\u2019s not going to be accretive day one, we know that. Daniel Bernstein : Okay. Thomas DeRosa : Some of these assets are newly built. So, you don't have to do anything. Some of these assets are older that you need to bring in operational improvement and refresh the physical plans. So, it can be both. So, if we do require \u2013 if some of these things require CapEx, that will be part of our underwriting, right? We\u2019re not going to think, okay, if you think about what we do with the four Sunrise assets we bought from SNH, it was a great value-add opportunity. We put the capital and we underwrote as a part of it. So, it can be both. We are seeing \u2013 now the one portfolio we did with Discovery, it's a newly built portfolio. So, you don't have to put any CapEx in it, and we're seeing opportunities that we do. We\u2019re seeing both. John Goodey : And if the value-add is bringing in one of our operators into a, let's just say, less than optimally-managed portfolio of senior housing assets, understand that doesn\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s not like flipping on a switch. It takes some time. There is always going to be some level of disruption. So, that \u2013 and we\u2019re seeing many opportunities like that where we\u2019re seeing assets and the types that Shankh was referring to or actually, our operators are seeing assets in their markets that are struggling where they know that their management template could significantly turn the performance around. So, it's a little \u2013 it\u2019s coming from lots of different directions there. Daniel Bernstein : Okay. One more quick question if I could. Just want to ask about how you saw the flu impact in the season? I know it's just a quarter and there's normal seasonality. But, the flu season did start late, it's ending late. How did that impact 1Q and how do you see that rolling through your same-store numbers as we get into second quarter? Thomas DeRosa : So, I will just start and then Mercedes will add color to that. So, first is that, we're very encouraged by, as I said, we're seeing in rate growth, occupancy growth as well as first time in the expense growth. So, I would not characterize our first quarter results driven by flu. Having said that, we have, as I said, we expect UK to normalize down and Canada to normalize up as we go through the year. We have high hopes for rest of the year as we have seen. But, Mercedes, you want to comment on flu? Mercedes Kerr : Yes. Something specific I would say that it\u2019s been a slightly longer flu season that we traditionally see. Having said that, we haven't had any reports from any of our operators particular impact that it\u2019s noteworthy. Daniel Bernstein : Okay. Okay. Appreciate. Thank you. I'll hop off. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. So, Shankh, just wanted to expect \u2013 I just want to get more color on sort of value add not only product but just thinking about geography as well? Obviously, I know you focused more on micro markets and sub markets. But, as these opportunities come about, how do we thinkor how should we think about sort of your focus on the traditional coastal markets that you have focused on versus maybe newer markets or newer opportunities in the new markets? Thomas DeRosa : Vikram, it\u2019s a very good question. So, we're seeing these opportunities across all markets. As you know that we don't focus on just what the headline major MSA looks like. We're focused on micro markets. We believe there are seniors that you need to pick up in every market. It just needs to be the right price point. And as you\u2019re getting into that investment, it needs to be the right price per door. So, as you can see, that even in Michigan, Ohio portfolio on StoryPoint, we sold that asset at 19% unlevered IRR. I want to repeat, it\u2019s unlevered IRR. So, you can make significant amount of money if it\u2019s the right assets with the right basis with the right operator. So, no change on template. Across the U.S., we are seeing this kind of opportunities. We're seeing sort of emergence of certain opportunities in UK. We're seeing certain emergence of opportunities in Canada. We're just \u2013 we're interested in all three of our countries across all products. Vikram Malhotra : Okay. Thomas DeRosa : What I would add to that, Vik, is that when you see us go outside of the core coastal markets or the major metro markets in Canada and the UK, it\u2019s very operator specific. We cannot underscore enough the operating excellence of companies like StoryPoint who faced tremendous competition from new supply and have outperformed consistently because of their focus on operations. These are not real estate developments that are trying to participate in what's considered a new sector of real estate. These are people that come from really the health and technology sectors who have a differentiated product, again, in not first tier markets and they perform consistently. That\u2019s who we align ourselves with. Vikram Malhotra : That makes sense. And then just second question, we've obviously seen you be fairly active on the MOB side. But maybe, Tom and Shankh, can you sort of remind us or update us? You've talked in the past about opportunities with health systems and sort of opportunities both that could be specific to health system but also to senior housing. So could you remind \u2013 can you maybe update us on what sort of opportunities you were seeing with health systems and tie that back to the ProMedica deal? Mercedes Kerr : I will just talk about the medical office cost aspect of your question, and Tom will add on the health system side. If you look at \u2013 we have seen as we have described in last call of 18 months, really we have seen sort of air pocket in that aspect, that part of the capital market where the cap rates have become more reasonable and we have done a lot of transactions. As we told you that we need to hit give take 7% unlevered IRR to do any transactions, so we are still seeing opportunities to do that. And there's many ways to get there, but we're focused on unlevered, not levered returns. And if those pricing changes, then we will see that we will get out of the market again like we have two to three years prior to that. Thomas DeRosa : What I'll say about health systems is that when I came here or I came into the CEO spot here five years ago, I came with a knowledge and relationships about the large not-for-profit health systems. I have been engaging in that space over the last five years initially by myself and then I brought other people to the company like Shankh and Mark Shaver who have helped really develop the dialogue and relationship. And the one thing I will tell you, as major health systems start to consider their futures, they are thinking much more outside of the acute care hospital space about where they will meet their customers. And I'm saying \u2013 I said that word specifically, not necessarily patients because patients means that you are sick, where they will meet their customers as their models evolve more towards health and wellness of the population rather treating sick people in acute care hospital beds which is simply not sustainable. So that is leading to multi-level discussions with major health systems. And what I can tell you is it takes a lot of time to develop these relationships. This does not happen overnight and we're making very good progress. Vikram Malhotra : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital. Jordan Sadler : Thanks. Good morning. Thomas DeRosa : Good morning. Jordan Sadler : Wanted to just start on the same-store performance and particularly relative to the guidance, it seems like you guys came in very strong particularly relative to the guidance and particularly within the senior housing operating portfolio. Can you maybe just comment on sort of what the expectation is that's embedded in the rest of the year's performance for\u2026 Thomas DeRosa : Yeah. So\u2026 Jordan Sadler : \u2026the overall portfolio but SHOP, in particular? Thomas DeRosa : Yeah. So, as you know, by policy we do not update segment level guidance for the year. We are \u2013 you are right, Jordan, that we are very excited about the same-store performance, really, in the SHOP, but also medical office also outperformed as well. So, we are excited about with how sort of the year will shape up, but it\u2019s too early to change overall same-store guidance, but just remember that we do not change segment level guidance through the year. Jordan Sadler : Well, have you just a guide\u2026 Thomas DeRosa : Yeah. Go ahead. Jordan Sadler : I was just going to say, is there something we should be looking at that will soften up the trajectory like \u2013 so, in other words, you did 3% in the SHOP portfolio in the quarter versus your guide of 1.25%. But as I look out to the next three quarters, is there something either comp-wise on the revenue or expense line item that should cause a meaningful slowdown that I may not be focused on? Thomas DeRosa : No, I'm not going to comment on that. That will be giving you guidance. I would say that we are just focused on different three countries. I expect UK will normalize down, Canada will normalize up, and I expect continued and I\u2019m very, very encouraged by the U.S. performance. Just focus on what I said on a sequential basis, right? First time in five years, we saw RevPAR growth that outpaced ComPAR growth, right, if you just think about that? What that does for the P&L rest of the year, I will leave you to that math. But I will just say \u2013 answer to your question, I don\u2019t see anything that dramatically slows down the performance of the SHOP portfolio except the UK and UK dynamic that I just read \u2013 just described. Jordan Sadler : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then could you maybe just talk about the character of the StoryPoint buyer so we can get an idea of who\u2019s out there chasing assets like this? Thomas DeRosa : I can\u2019t because of NDA, but I can tell you that it\u2019s everybody and anybody. We are in the public markets that\u2019s focused that we know when \u2013 many participants are focused and when those business exactly times, which quarter, which year, private lives or not. We are seeing a multiyear trend that's coming and people are excited to deploy capital. So, from private equity to all the institutional investors that we are seeing, everybody's interested in the asset class but this is obviously \u2013 there's an operating aspect of the business. So, people are trying to partner with the right types of operating partners or people like us. Jordan Sadler : Okay. My last one is just regarding the provision you took in the quarter. Is that something based on something that's already happened? I just was confused by the footnotes, $18.7 million charge related to a planned restructuring of seniors housing triple net. John Goodey : Jordan, its John. Is that exhibit you\u2019re looking at the Exhibit 2. Jordan Sadler : I guess your normalizing adjustment, yeah, correct. John Goodey : Yeah. I mean, that was a provision for -- second provision for a loan loss and the restructuring of a couple of triple nets loss and are restructuring a couple of triple-net buildings or in special purpose entities. Thomas DeRosa : That was \u2013 yeah, that occurred barely in the quarter and there was no \u2013 the income impact in our restructuring was out there in the quarter. Jordan Sadler : Okay. So that was just another like a conversion when you say restructuring a\u2026 Thomas DeRosa : No. You think a provision. This is a provision in case something happens, right. So, this sort of provision you had a lot\u2026 Jordan Sadler : Oh, okay. Thomas DeRosa : It\u2019s provision against the loans that we provided for a non-full recovery on. Then, we did not recognize interest income on that loan in the quarter. Jordan Sadler : Oh, got you. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Chad Vanacore : Right. Since we touched on StoryPoint a couple of times, it looks like the \u2013 you sold the triple-net portfolio but you actually expanded your idea of a relationship there. So, could you tell us what was the coverage on a triple-net portfolio and then what is the rationale behind selling it to the operator of a purchase option if you want to reduce Michigan exposure or is it something else there? Thomas DeRosa : Yes. So, we did not expand on RIDEA portfolio created a new RIDEA joint venture\u2026 Chad Vanacore : All right. Thanks for clarification. Thomas DeRosa : So that's sort of the first one. Second is the coverage was almost 1.7 times. The reason to sell the operator \u2013 those particular assets is what I told you in my prepared remarks. If you can hit 20 plus years building or buildings, you can hit a 4.6% yield to get to 19% unlevered IRR. You do that all day. Every asset is for sale at a price. So, we sold assets because we thought we got a fantastic value. There\u2019s nothing to\u2026 Chad Vanacore : Sorry. Did you go to the operator? Did the operator come to you? Thomas DeRosa : No, we got an unsolicited offer. Chad Vanacore : Okay. All right. And then just thinking about the shop portfolio, you've got Brookdale assets. Looks like you transition about 18 of those. What's the expectation of performance there? What's left to also transition there? Thomas DeRosa : So I'm glad you asked that question. Our same-store pool has for our shop portfolio has not changed. It was 473 assets. It is still 473 assets. A total number of shop assets changed to 599. Why? Because the restructuring of Brookdale that we talked about last summer got done, finally got done, some of that assets in California and other places this quarter. So you saw those transition from Brookdale to Vegas has happened this quarter, actually on the one. So that changed the overall number of show assets. But I want to reemphasize again that our same-store pool did not change. What is the expectation? We told you that we're pretty happy when we did the Brookdale transition. We transitioned the assets so that we have good coverage, right. Our EBITDARM coverage for the Brookdale assets is not the 1.3 times, right. Having said that, is it \u2013 I don't want to talk about specifically about Brookdale. Any assets we have an operating portfolio. Just think about it. Just our idea portfolio has 23 operators. Our triple net portfolio has several operators. There are assets that can be maximized. The value can be maximized in different operators. So we have plans for every one of these assets, and I went through this in detail two quarters ago, how we think about it, how we look at it. We're more than happy to transition any of these assets if we need to is now about 2.5% of our total operating \u2013 our total income. So, it is very, very manageable that its cover and we think that under the current leadership is turning the business around. If not, we have other operators who deal to transition their assets too as we have done in last year. Tim McHugh : \u2026we have 10 more buildings from the transition portfolio to transition from Brookfield to other operators and we expect that to be done over the next few quarters. Chad Vanacore : All right. Thanks, Tim. And then just one more question on there which is the 10 more building, is that outside of you had a restructure agreement I think that's about $5 million or so of rent. Is that outside that? And then when would you expect that to be a factor? Thomas DeRosa : Now, that is \u2013 so these are still part of the original restructuring plan. There's been no further asset after that since the original transaction. So, it's just a matter of we gave that as kind of a pro forma when fully transitioned with the difference in income would be and that 10 assets from that originally described transaction. Chad Vanacore : All right. And I just want to sneak one more question in here which is labor costs looked like they were down quarter-over-quarter shop. Is that seems to be often the senior housing market you're seeing. So what was the contributor there? And then what's your expectation going forward through 2019? Thomas DeRosa : Labor cost is not down, Chad. Labor cost is up significantly. The trajectory for the first time we saw is on demand. So, if you look at what I talked about that if you -- in the first quarter sequentially\u2026 Chad Vanacore : One second. OpEx from last quarter to this quarter and it looks like it was up like 24% which is flattish, right? And that probably shouldn't be the expectation there going forward, right? Thomas DeRosa : I'm sorry. I don't understand the question. Occupied unit the labor cost is up 2.8% sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Chad Vanacore : Okay. Thomas DeRosa : And which rate is up 3.3%. You understand what I'm saying? Labor cost is still up significantly year-over-year. I'm talking about\u2026 Chad Vanacore : Yeah. Should we expect \u2013 you got rate going up much higher than OpEx and labor cost. Thomas DeRosa : No. What's higher? Let\u2019s not be dramatic. Chad Vanacore : No. I mean that\u2019s a pretty good portion of growth right there. Thomas DeRosa : For 75 years, we got a positive spread. I will take it. But just let\u2019s not be dramatic. It\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s 50 basis points. But look, as we talk about labor cost has been increasing. In our portfolio of 5-plus percent on an occupied room basis for last five-plus years. I mean now you see in the market \u2013 I'll give you an example. Let's just talk about New Jersey where labor cost is a problem. New Jersey is not slated to be a $15 market until 2021. If you look at our portfolio across the board it's $15-plus today. So maybe the regulatory side in many aspects hasn't changed but the actual labor market because of competition has already moved there. Recall that I talked about some of the regulatory driven change, which is a 15 move to the $15, let's talk about California. L.A. has hit $15 last summer. San Francisco has hit $15 last summer. L.A. is doing that this summer. To offset that, you\u2019re going to get more of a market driven increase rather than just a big move from 11 to 15 or on a percentage basis the big number. So, I'm not suggesting the labor cost is not going to be a problem. All I'm saying is I'm happy that finally that has been undermanned for the first time. Too early to comment whether that continues or not. Chad Vanacore : All right. Good quarter on that side of the expenses but maybe changes going forward? Thomas DeRosa : We'll see. Chad Vanacore : All right. Well, thanks for your time. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. The occupancy gap between senior housing, triple-net and SHOP has widened over the past year. I think a year ago was basically the same. And I'm wondering if this is the reflection of the quality difference between the two portfolio, sort of difference in CapEx spend and what do you think happened as the year progress? Thomas DeRosa : So, look, I mean we have our SHOP portfolio in the market in better locations. Generally, that's true. And we also have some really good operators in the triple-net portfolio, right? We talked about different operators over a period of time. I think it's just different. If you think about the recovery, this is a fundamentally a local business, different parts of the country is participating in the recovery in different times. So, I wouldn't suggest there is fundamentally something different about senior housing business. We're encouraged by the first quarter results. But this is not yet the time to take a victory lap. But we do think, if you think about it longer period of time, we think that you will see improvement in both sides of the house. John Kim : Okay. And then on the supply in a 3-mile, 5-mile ring around your assets, I know that's not really how you look at it, but it has increased sequentially. And I'm just wondering how much of a headwind do you think this will be this year given you have maintained your guidance with your\u2026 Thomas DeRosa : I think you, of course, you have the answer John. That's not how we look at it. We give you how we look at it which is adjusted competition unit and you need to open SHOP and we described that we expect roughly 15% to 20% reduction this year and walk you through the details of that on Investor Day, we still expect that. Now what happens is delays happen some 2018 flows into 2019, and then 2019 flows into 2020. So, obviously, all of these things can be stretched out. But, as you can see from our results, the thesis that we had directionally is playing out. John Kim : That level of supply increased the price use given it seems like it's impacting your markets more than the national average? Thomas DeRosa : We -- again, we don't look at it that way. The way we look at it it's actually down which is on\u2026 Shankh Mitra : Oh, we're not surprised. John Kim : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Karin Ford : Hi. Good morning. Thomas DeRosa : Hi, Karin. Karin Ford : I appreciated your decision to over equitize the balance sheet again this quarter and keep your powder dry. Just was wondering if the capital markets stay open will you continue the strategy and how do you expect leverage to trend over the balance of the year? Thomas DeRosa : Yeah. Karin, on the \u2013 I\u2019ll take the leverage side first. So, beginning in our Investor Day, we talked about keeping leverage flat throughout the year. You\u2019ve obviously taken it down significantly. As a just a quick note on that, at the time of the Investor Day, we spoke about that from a debt-EBITDA perspective, and it was not part of our plan to convert our preferreds. In the first quarter given our stock was trading, we were given the opportunity to force a conversion on those, and we did, so we now expect our leverage on a preferred basis to come down significantly during the year, as it already has. Karin Ford : And then I'll just add to that. We think about the impact when you \u2013 when you act to raise capital, whether through disposition or ATM [indiscernible] acquisition, there's a gap because \u2013 not because we did not know what we'll do with the capital, but because it takes time, right? So, if we generally think about match fund when we signed the PSA, but you think about the diligence after that. And you know if you think about a medical office building, you have to think about a role for a process which a health system is on the side. They don't respond in seven days because we'd like to close the deal. On the senior housing side, you have to think about just look at [indiscernible] and Pegasus this transaction. In California, it takes six to nine months for you to get the license transfer. So, these are the reasons that things change. We're not looking at our either stock or an asset to stay. That's a pretty good level. Let's just do that. We are doing a match fund basis. The difference of timing comes from all these things that are just part of life if you do real estate transaction. I hope that helps you to understand. We do match fund. We're not looking at our stocks. We\u2019re not looking at a price of an active and say, that looks pretty good. Let\u2019s just do it, right? We are match funding, but when you sell a stock on a given day, you got the money that day. When you got the license, ultimately, in California to transfer to close a deal, it probably takes six months. We're not going to roll the dice to think what the capital markets will be six months from now. Thomas DeRosa : Okay. Just to finish that, we expect leverage to come back up as we close on our under contract pipeline not more than expected and then on ATM, as Shankh said, we've got nothing planned as of now, but you should expect that to continue to match on as we see opportunities and we're very optimistic on that front right now. Karin Ford : Understood now. That's helpful. And the second question is on ProMedica and HCR continuing integration. I think you said on your comments that you're happy with the way that's going. Can you give us any metrics on that front, can you talk about what trends are in occupancy, margin or synergies just to flesh that out a little bit? Thomas DeRosa : Well, I think you heard about many of those on our Investor Day directly from Randy and Steve, so I'm not going to get into too much. I was trying not to do it. I'll just give you one so that you are happy that your question was answered. We\u2019re looking at occupancy both on the skill side as well as on the Arden Court side which is the city housing occupancy up in both sides of the house and still it's up 100 plus basis points. And it\u2019s in the housing side, it\u2019s close to that but less than 100 basis points. But I'll just leave it at that. These things take time and we are focused on what the long term looks like, but we're happy, very happy with how the short term has played out whether that's on the reimbursement or on the cost side, on the synergy side. So, we are excited about it. And obviously, the part of our thesis was these assets we bought at a very, very low basis that was capital starved and I touched on that finally that program, it takes time to do this thing. Finally, that program is on the way. We have 45 assets or so. Actually, really exactly 45 assets to go through that program in next two to four months. So very, very excited what will happen then. Some of them are complete, some of them are catch-ups, some of them are in between. So it\u2019s just going through a whole series of renovation program both on the skill side as well as on the senior housing side. Karin Ford : I appreciate your answering the question. Thomas DeRosa : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Lukas Hartwich : Thanks. Hey, guys. Just a quick one for me. On the StoryPoint sale, was there a near-term rent reset or something like that that explains the low cap rate? Thomas DeRosa : No, it doesn\u2019t. Lukas Hartwich : All right. That was it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Yeah. Thanks. I wanted to touch on the long-term post-acute coverage ratios. And, Shankh, I believe you mentioned that the sequential drop related to the LTACs which is a small part of the portfolio. Can you kind of go through what's actually happening with those LTACs? It seems like it had to be a pretty big drop to impact coverage that much. Shankh Mitra : Yeah because you can't see what's happening in the LTAC industry that would suggest that you are right about your assumption. Michael Carroll : So what's the plan for the LTAC? Is that something that you guys are going to have to address here in the near term or do you expect that they have some things that they can pull to help improve the results or what's the outlook with that part of the portfolio? Shankh Mitra : Well, I could comment on that. But as you know that we are \u2013 it's a very, very small part of our portfolio, right. We own a handful of assets. We look at everything from a total return perspective. And if we have budgets, we'll address, but I just want to remind you again that it is a very, very small part of our portfolio. That's why I wanted to have the differentiation. Post-acute is now less than 10% of our overall cash flow. From a value perspective, it\u2019s much lower than that. But 10% \u2013 less than 10% of our overall cash flow. Primarily, that is skilled nursing license businesses, which means also Genesis rehab short stay with its technically skilled nursing but obviously it\u2019s a completely different business, but also traditional skilled nursing. That's primarily what that bucket is. With the handful of packs that we own, we\u2019re thinking about how to maximize value there. Michael Carroll : Okay. Great. And then just to touch on my question on the value-add projects that you're looking at, what size of the pipeline does value add represent right now? Shankh Mitra : I couldn't even tell you what the pipeline size looks like. We just don't do business that way. So, everything is a function of total return. And if we see opportunities that are great, we'll do it. Is that 100% of the pipeline or 5% of the pipeline, that is \u2013 we\u2019re not trying to sort of put those things in the bucket. Michael Carroll : All right. Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Oh, thanks. I just wanted to go back to the SHOP same-store pool, just a clarification. I think you said the pool did not change this quarter versus the fourth quarter, is that right? Thomas DeRosa : Yes, I did. Nick Yulico : Okay. So, what I\u2019m confused about is that if I look at the supplemental, why did the numbers change now versus the fourth quarter in terms of revenue and expenses for that pool? Shankh Mitra : I'm not sure I understand the question because there was growth? Thomas DeRosa : It\u2019s a different quarter. Nick Yulico : No. I just mean if you look at the historical results of the same-store pool in the fourth quarter supplemental versus in this supplemental, those numbers are different, the revenue, the expenses and some NOI. And so, I'm just wondering if there was a change in accounting or if there's something else, if this is \u2013 since this supposed to be the same, I guess the same pool seems a little strange? Thomas DeRosa : There was no change in accounting. They're exactly the same 473 assets. The only thing you have to think about the change is FX. Remember, we owned assets outside the United States. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thomas DeRosa : But what makes you do raise a very important question that just sort of I hear a lot of noise in recent months about our same-store policy and our same-store and there\u2019s just a lot of wasted time on it. So, I would like to address that question. John? John Goodey : Yes. Certainly. I think Nick we essentially disclosed to same store premises. One is the one that we spend a lot of time talking about our Non-GAAP sort of supplemental disclosure. That is essentially our economic participation in those same-store buildings. And what do I mean by that? I mean that is prorated for our ownership position as you know with our 23 RIDEA partners. We often have joint venturing agreement. So, we're not a 100% owner of those buildings, and therefore, not 100% owner of the income stream, whereas for GAAP disclosure, we are required obviously on the GAAP to do a consolidated view. So, we have to take all of the buildings where we have greater than 50% ownership, consolidate that and then report on 100% basis. So, we actually have to two different pools, which is why you see two different numbers between the supplemental sort of business view that we use and we talk about with you because we believe that's the one that drives our view of how we're performing and drives your view \u2013 should drive your view on how we're performing versus the GAAP, which is essentially a mathematical equation that we have to produce to comply with our GAAP accounting requirement. So, that's why it's different. Sometimes that number is above. Sometimes it's below. It doesn't have necessarily a consistent trend over time. Nick Yulico : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : All right. Thanks. Just to drill into the Chelsea acquisition. Obviously, it shows you still have an appetite for triple net. But can you share some of the decision behind that? I guess not going RIDEA? Is it the growth trajectory, labor cost or maybe just some of the rent coverage in underwriting? Thanks. Thomas DeRosa : So, Mike, if you look at \u2013 I believe two quarters ago I addressed this issue in holistically on our earnings call. We completely believe in the triple-net business. I cannot emphasize that enough that we're sitting here trying to say RIDEA is the only way to go. Of structure is secondary. Primary focus is the quality of assets, the quality of markets, and an alignment with an operator. Several ways you can get to that alignment. You can do it in what we call RIDEA Trio. Obviously, it's a different bells and whistles on a normal RIDEA contract, which makes it very, very different. You can also do it on a triple-net lease structure. And as we obviously have different bells and whistles around it. So, we continue to believe in that business and we think CLC is a good operator and we're going to continue to grow that business. Todd Stender : And, Shankh, how about the rent coverage it was underwritten at and how about the maybe the CapEx responsibilities at Chelsea? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Yeah. So, rent coverage, it was underwritten at \u2013 roughly, what we do is we under \u2013 when we underwrite a new triple-net assets, we're underwriting at it north of 1.5 times EBITDARM basis or 1.2 times EBITDAR basis. As you know that we \u2013 I believe in our Investor Day, we talked about that some of the assets that we're buying, that a $1 billion pool has an average age of four-and-a-half years. Some of the Chelsea assets that we are buying, they were just developed so, if you think about it, from that perspective, the NOI, the EBITDARM is still ramping up so \u2013 but the stabilized coverage, we believe, will be in that range that I described. Todd Stender : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on these results. So, there's been some\u2026 Thomas DeRosa : Thank you. Steven Valiquette : \u2026a lot of big picture questions so far. I guess I have another one here for either Tom or for Shankh. Basically, over the past month or so, I mean, the Medicare rate updates for 2020 from CMS have been pretty strong for most healthcare facilities\u2019 business models. But I guess I'm curious to hear whether it feels like this has helped to keep momentum going with health systems and other partners just regarding development projects and other transaction activity in that context. And also, conversely and maybe more importantly, my guess is that Medicare, for all proposals and discussions, are probably way too preliminary to give anyone pause or hesitation on development or planned projects, and I'm wondering if you're just able to corroborate that view as well. Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Yeah. Steve, I would definitely agree with you on the Medicare for all you point. That is not driving up the strategic thinking at the health systems today. I think it's very early and I'm \u2013 I sit on the side of \u2013 I think it's a completely something that would not work, but we will get into that in another time. But, I'm going to have Mark Shaver who spends a lot of time with the health systems comment on your earlier point. Mark Shaver : Hey, Steve, thanks. This is Mark. I think we track pretty closely what's happening at CMS. In fact, Tom and I were just at a session with administrative maybe two weeks ago. And I think we \u2013 the country holistically is moving more towards valuable EDPM that Shankh alluded to on our post-acute side and new CMS reforms last week around primary care. We feel it's moving in the right direction. But, just like all of our businesses, in certain markets, value is accelerating in certain markets fee for service and the traditional commercial business is very important. So, we continue to work with the health systems in different markets that we think are progressive. Understand where value is going but also understand reimbursement under the traditional form as well. And as Tom mentioned, we're working pretty closely with the systems on alternative sites of care and lower cost than use of care. Everything that we do is outside the four walls of the hospital which we think bodes well for how reimbursement is moving in the country. Steven Valiquette : Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph, Citi. Nick Joseph : Hi. I just want to clarify one question on guidance. In terms of the segment same-store NOI, do you plan to update that throughout the year? Thomas DeRosa : No. Nick, I addressed that before on this call. We, by policy, we don't do that. We don't update segment-level, same-store guidance. We will update, if necessary, the total guidance for the same-store pool. And, honestly, you can look at the trends and you can come to your own conclusion. The problem of updating guidance in segments is that over emphasizing any segment, we're not \u2013 we don't have a favorite children among the segments, right? As a buyer of Welltower stock, you get to buy all of them, right? So, we are trying to de-emphasize any part of our portfolio and have you focused on are we good capital allocators? Are we good manager of the portfolio? Those are the decisions. But if we look at the numbers and the trajectory and sequential, you should be able to get pretty close to what those numbers look like. Nick Joseph : Right. But why give segment-level guidance and not update it throughout the year if you're going update other line items of guidance? Thomas DeRosa : Because we don't want you to emphasize on any particular segment. We will update the total if it's necessary. We do think that market to focus too much on one segment versus the other when we, as the manager of the business, don't focus on one particular segment versus others. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC Nikko. Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hello? Thomas DeRosa : Good morning. Rich Anderson : Okay. So, Shankh, I know you don't want to talk about ProMedica in advance the real numbers coming out, but I just wanted to make sure I understand the starting point as we get closer to the time where you have some more real-time info. The coverage that was identified when you did the deal I think was really \u2013 if you look at the math, there\u2019s really something higher than that or should be based on I think a function of the 8020 joint venture on the real estate. Am I thinking about that correctly about how the coverage is in reality from a real cash flow perspective? Shankh Mitra : I'm not sure I completely understand the question. I will give you two answers which hopefully will help you get to the answer. One is Karin has been able to get me to talk about it. So, I actually gave some real time sort of feedback on how the portfolio is performing and I don't want to repeat myself but I did say that occupancies are both on the skill side as well as on senior housing side. And we're just starting the CapEx program, which we think will dramatically change the businesses. Going back to your question, 20% - we 80% ownership in the real estate and our partner Promedica is the 20% owner and our cash flow is \u2013 rather their cash flow is subordinate to our cash flow. And that\u2019s how the\u2026 Rich Anderson : Okay. Okay. Maybe I'll take a little bit more offline later. Shankh Mitra : Yeah. You can always can go back \u2013 Rich, by the way, welcome back. You can go back to the call we did or when we did the deal and I walked through line by line of how that is calculated. But anyway regardless, welcome back. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Second question is on medical office. I think I recall you saying something about cap rates drifting up and it got you guys more interested in doing deals on the outpatient medical and you obviously did with CNL very early this year. Is that an observation that you would agree with that there has been a trickle up on cap rates that have made the asset class more interesting to you. Just some clarity on that, please. Thomas DeRosa : Yes, Rich. We think the cap rates, I forgot two years ago or 18 months ago, I can\u2019t keep the track of time, got to an unsustainable level. And since obviously it has gotten to a level, it definitely has trickled up. I think I mentioned that probably last few calls, every call, we have done not just P&L. We have done 2-plus billion dollars of medical office acquisition in the last 12 months. So, they have come to a level \u2013 they have come to a level where we think that IRR now makes sense. We kind of give you a guidance, but we think we need to hit a 7% IRR to get through the transaction. It\u2019s still there. But as I said, if they go down again because people want to be aggressive again, then we will get out of the market again. Rich Anderson : Right. So, what does that say about this investment in particular? Like, to what degree is the over under that cap rates still trickle up following the closing of the transaction and perhaps making the investment you made less effervescent or something, you know? Do you worry about that going forward? Thomas DeRosa : I don\u2019t. No, I don't. We're trying to get the total return. We're not a buyer or seller of any assets on a cap rate. We are not trying to top-tick the market, bottom-tick the market. We're trying to get to a total return and IRR and fund it through capital, whether equity or asset, but the total return would be lower, right? And that's sort of what we're trying to drive value. That\u2019s the difference. Rich Anderson : But if cap rates go up in your IRR calculation on the terminal value change, and that's the part of the concern perhaps you \u2013 I guess, you don\u2019t have\u2026 Thomas DeRosa : No, we don\u2019t, because we will continue to deploy capital. And remember, that would be a concern we will continue to deploy capital and remember that would be a concern if we debt finance the deals. We\u2019re not debt financing the deals, right. We\u2019re equity financing the deal. So even if that's the case, A, we will continue to deploy capital. We hope that happens. And if it doesn't happen, then we\u2019ll just wouldn't do it. You understand my question is if it is equity-financed transaction, the value of what we just bought on a spot basis does not matter. We locked in a difference off a total return on what we bought versus what we sold. Rich Anderson : Okay. Got it. Thanks very much. Thomas DeRosa : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Sarah Tan with JPMorgan. Sarah Tan : Hi. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m on for Michael Mueller. Just had one question regarding the development pipeline. I think last quarter you guys talked about the $3 billion development pipeline locked up across the seven different project. Could we get an update on which other projects have been underway? Thomas DeRosa : So I will just say I think you probably misheard. It\u2019s not seven different products. It\u2019s seven different operating partners. Sarah Tan : Yes. Thomas DeRosa : And I'll just say many of that you will start to see later this summer. So let\u2019s just \u2013 today\u2019s call is not the appropriate time, but more to come. Sarah Tan : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Jefferies. Austin Caito : Hi. This is Austin Caito on for Tayo. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just a follow-up to that. I saw that the New York development project was pushed out the conversion date another quarter, and at the Investor Day, the expectation was that construction was done by 1Q and, just curious, any new updates with that project? Thomas DeRosa : Yeah. I mean, everything seems to be proceeding according to plan, both in terms of costs and time line, up to this point. So, there's no real update to\u2026 Shankh Mitra : I don't know where \u2013 there's been no announcement of any change. Thomas DeRosa : I don't know. Where do you saw that? I mean, our expectation is still pretty much what it was during the Investor Day. Shankh Mitra : Yeah. Austin Caito : Okay, great. Thank you. Thomas DeRosa : Thank you. Tayo Okusanya : Yes. This is Tayo. Could I just actually ask one more follow-up question? Thomas DeRosa : Go ahead, Tayo. Tayo Okusanya : Yes. It\u2019s actually more around, again, your data analytics platform. Again, I think you guys really put that on display during the Investor Day, and I'm just kind of curious, just kind of given the micro level analysis that you do, if your data analytics platform is telling you anything different about operating trends today versus your Investor Day, whether across senior housing or any of your other business segments? Thomas DeRosa : Oh, the \u2013 our data analytics platform did give us that insight, which is why we started talking about three quarters ago that the business is turning when the topic du jour was it's going to be really bad for the next five years, that's what I hear. So, it's hard to talk about stuffs that already happened and take a victory lap. That\u2019s just not a display of humility, I would say. But, as you can see, these people are very, very good, and they have called a turn, and you are seeing the results, you're seeing that turn in the results. From December to today, Tayo, we\u2019re making 10, 15, 20 decisions. I mean like, from December to today, it\u2019s \u2013 we don't change our views like that. Shankh Mitra : Remember, we're not making a call on the industry sector with our data analytics. This is very specific to the Welltower portfolio, our operators and the locations of our assets. As you learned at our Investor Day, we do look at the country on a micro-market basis. So, we have been managing our portfolio over the last five years and are making tough decisions that always didn't reflect well in quarterly performance, but they were the right decisions for the long term, and that is what you're starting to see flow through our results. So, yes, our data analytics gives us what we believed to be unique and proprietary insights into the way we run our business. But again, we are not \u2013 do not think our results and what we're seeing in our portfolio is a call on the senior housing industry changing. Tayo Okusanya : Got you. I appreciate the explanation. Thank you. Shankh Mitra : Thank you very much. Operator : And thank you for dialing in to the Welltower earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation and ask that you please disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the second quarter 2019 Welltower earnings conference call. My name is Zutania and I will be your operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. If at any time during the call you require assistance, please press star followed by zero and an operator will be happy to assist you. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the call over to Tim McHugh, Vice President, Finance and Investments. Please go ahead, sir. Tim McHugh : Thank you Zutania. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Welltower\u2019s second quarter 2019 results. Following the Safe Harbor, you\u2019ll hear prepared remarks from Tom DeRosa Chairman and CEO; Shank Mitra, Chief Investment Officer; John Goodey, CFO and myself.  Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made during this conference call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although Welltower believes results projected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors and risks that could actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement are detailed in last night\u2019s press release and from time to time in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC.  If you did not receive a copy of the press release, you may access it via the company\u2019s website at welltower.com. With that, I will hand the call over to Tom for his remarks on the quarter. Tom? Tom DeRosa : Thanks Tim. I\u2019m pleased to report our second quarter results to you this morning as they demonstrate that the Welltower platform is delivering on the optimistic outlook and growth plan we presented to investors over eight months ago at our investor day. Outperformance from our core real estate portfolio across all business lines, most notably led by our U.S. portfolio, is driving this growth. As we reported last evening, FFO per share of $1.05 represents 5% growth over the second quarter of 2018. Behind this growth is same store NOI growth of 3.1% in the quarter and 3.3% same store growth in our senior housing operating portfolio. These results once again demonstrate the resilience of owning the highest quality senior housing and medical office portfolio in the industry as well as a management team that had the conviction to make a series of tough decisions over the past few years that are clearly benefiting our shareholders today.  With respect to new investments, we had a busy quarter, completing $2.4 billion in accretive acquisitions. This brings the total for the first half of 2019 to $2.7 billion. Shankh will take you through a deeper dive on the quarter\u2019s operations and investment activity, but I wanted to take a moment to call out a few noteworthy items.  First, you have seen us deepen our relationships with names you already know, like Sunrise, Discovery, and Summit Medical, demonstrating our commitment to being a reliable, value-added partner. Next, I\u2019m excited about some new partners who have joined the Welltower team this past quarter.  Balfour Senior Living, led by co-founders Michael Schonbrun and Susan Juroe, develops and manage some of the highest quality senior living communities I have ever seen. Mike Joseph, founder of Clover Management, develops and manages independent living communities that deliver a quality experience to seniors at affordable monthly rents. I\u2019m also pleased that we significantly expanded our relationship with Greg Roderick of Frontier Management, who has stepped in to take over the management of many of our legacy memory care communities. Frontier\u2019s state-of-the-art operating platform is already generating significant NOI growth from this portfolio. I\u2019m thrilled to welcome Michael, Susan, Mike and Greg to the Welltower family.  This quarter, we also announced a joint venture with the Related Group and Atria. Like the other operators I mentioned, Related and Atria were motivated to work with Welltower not for our ability to provide capital but for Welltower\u2019s unique capability set that truly differentiates us from any other REIT engaged in this sector. I\u2019m also pleased to tell you that much of this growth was financed by the successful sale of our portfolio of senior living assets managed by Benchmark Senior Living. The proceeds from this $1.8 billion sale have enabled us to bring our leverage levels back to our 2019 target range. We have a lot to talk about this morning, so I will now hand the mic over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you Tom, and good morning everyone. I will now review our quarterly operating results, provide additional details on performance trends and recent investment activities. We came into this year expecting a slow and steady recovery to take hold in our SHOP segment; however, I have to admit for two quarters in a row, our SHOP results have exceeded our expectations. Strong revenue growth of 4.4% was driven by both rate growth and occupancy growth. Same store NOI for the SHOP portfolio is up 3.3% year-over-year, the best fundamentals we have seen in years. This significant [indiscernible] growth has been broad-based. Our U.S. portfolio has been a standout performer this quarter with our largest operators, such as Sunrise, Belmont, Brandywine, and Mill Gardens all contributing to the outperformance. Rate growth of 3.7% has been consistent and broad-based. The lowest rate growth we have seen is 2.5% with one operator and 5.4% growth being the highest with another operator, with central tendencies around the mid to high 3% range.  On the expense side, contract labor and benefits are the main drivers of compensation growth. This has been especially true in the U.K. as the operators chase occupancy ramp. Insurance was and will continue to be a headwind for the rest of the year throughout the portfolio. To give you more specific color on product types and market segmentation during the quarter, we have seen significant outperformance in AL versus IL and in major markets versus other markets. To repeat what we mentioned last quarter, we expect U.K. performance to trend down and Canadian performance to trend up as we get to the end of the year. Our excitement around strong SHOP results was only matched by significant transactions within the segment. We welcomed Atria, Balfour, and Clover Management to our family in Q2. We are excited about the announcement we made in late May to partner with Related and Atria on 1001 Van Ness development in San Francisco. This triple-A plus location in the heart of San Francisco is fully entitled and we expect to start construction in Q1 of 2020.  We also welcomed Denver-based Balfour to our family this quarter. We initiated this relationship with six great buildings in the Denver area that have spectacular design and resident experience. One of these buildings just opened in May and is already 40% leased; hence, our initial yield is low on our $308 million investment but we expect Year 2 cap rates to be north of 6%. Balfour entered into Welltower\u2019s next generation management contract, creating optimum alignment between the partners. As part of the portfolio purchase, Welltower has received exclusivity on Balfour\u2019s future acquisition and development pipeline as well as an option to acquire up to a 34.9%interest in Balfour\u2019s management company. As a part of the agreement, Balfour has signed $1 billion of development agreements with Welltower already. Several development initiatives are currently underway in high barriers to entry east coast markets. We are committed to grow this platform prudently over the next decade. We are pleased to announce the acquisition of five newly developed Sunrise communities in the high barrier to entry markets of Washington DC, San Francisco, and San Diego this quarter. These recently opened buildings are 67% leased now and leasing up rapidly. Our investment of $218 million in the quarter represents a 5.8% yield after Year 2. As a result of our 34% ownership in Sunrise, we funded 34% of the development at cost. Our acquisition of the remaining 66% will bring the total dollars invested to $285 million at a blended stabilized yield of 6.8%. To continue that theme, we have expanded our relationship with Discovery Senior Living with the acquisition of South Bay\u2019s development portfolio. These high end campus settings have condo-quality finishes and have product offerings including IL, AL, and memory care. We bought the portfolio at 72% occupancy excluding the last phase of the Alliance Town Center in Fort Worth, which will open in Q2, bringing the total investment to $237 million or $273,000 per unit. We expect these buildings to stabilize in Year 3 in the mid to high 6% cap rate range. Importantly, as part of this transaction, Discovery agreed to manage the existing portfolio that we bought in 2016 as well as the new portfolio in our new incentive-driven management contract and signed an exclusive development agreement of $1 billion. We are already considering two projects under this development contract in Discovery\u2019s core footprint of Florida.  Speaking of Discovery\u2019s backyard of Florida, we are also under contract to fund three newly developed buildings that received certificates of occupancy in Q2 for $92.7 million or $255,000 per unit. While the cap rate of newly opened building in lease-up is a matter of opinion and lies in the eyes of the beholder, what is not debatable is price per unit numbers. Our buildings are all steel-concrete I2 construction and not stick-built construction, and represent a significant discount to other Discovery transactions we have seen in the marketplace recently.  We also welcomed Clover Management to our family of operators with $343 million of acquisitions in Q2 with an average age of 4.5 years. These independent living seniors apartments are for younger seniors and have in excess of 95% occupancy in stable portfolios. We funded this significant investment activity with the disposition of the Benchmark portfolio in the beginning of July with gross sale proceeds of $1.8 billion. As part of this recapitalization, Welltower has fully exited the portfolio, realizing a gain on sale in excess of $450 million and is entitled to an additional $50 million earn-out proceeds subject to certain future hurdles. We are very pleased with the recap of Benchmark by this strong institutional capital partner which agreed to further invest a significant amount of capital in these 19-year-old communities in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  To summarize all the activities above, we bought some newly opened spectacular assets in lease-up and funded it with mature assets. While the side effect of this capital recycling is a drag on earnings in the near term, we believe these transactions as a whole are significantly accretive from a capex, growth, and hence total return in medium to long term. In addition, I encourage our shareholders to think about these new or expanded relationships not just in terms of the dollar amount we invested this quarter but as vehicles of significant future growth of development and acquisitions.  Our aligned operating partner model also comes with another avenue of growth, maximizing cash flow in assets we already own. This is where you get maximum return on invested capital. Specifically, we transitioned 20 Silverado assets to our partner, Frontier Management this quarter. At 67% occupancy and mid-single digit margins, we saw a tremendous opportunity for improvement in the financial and resident experience in these communities. Silverado retained 11 assets in their core California market and will operate them under a triple-net lease.  Moving to our medical office platform, we had a really active quarter. Same store NOI was up 2.3%. We feel our team under Keith and Ryan have created tremendous momentum in the business and positioned the portfolio for 2020 growth. Our team has been very active, having recently closed nearly 5 million square feet of medical office assets this year, and I\u2019m pleased to report that we had a great deal of success in integrating those assets in our business. We have extended the ground leases and termed out significant tenant credit.  We are also very pleased to inform that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a 43-acre, six-building, 270,000 square feet medical office campus in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey for $140 million. This off-market transaction as a part of a proposed merger transaction between Summit, Medical Group and CTMD is a testament of how healthcare delivery is moving to low cost consumer-friendly settings. The campus will be master leased by Summit Medical Group, one of the nation\u2019s premier independent multi-disciplinary medical practices under its new 20-year absolute net lease. This campus is the largest and most comprehensive of five hubs in Summit\u2019s 80 location hub-and-spoke model and will bring Welltower\u2019s total Summit lease footprint to about half a million square feet. We are also pleased to inform you that we have approximately 3 million square feet of additional medical office transactions that are at various stages of negotiations at an anticipated blended cap rate of 5.6%.  While it is fun to discuss the transactions that we are consummating, it is equally important for capital allocation discipline to contemplate on the transactions that we decided not to do. At the risk of sounding like a broken record every quarter, I want to remind you that we are not a cap rate buyer or a seller. We are focused on total returns, which is heavily influenced by capex, growth, quality, credit, and price per unit . We have passed on significant transactions, including the ones where we have contractual legal rights on where the pricing, quality of underwriting assets, or the collateral did not meet our underwriting standards, or we liked the asset but could not get comfortable with the growth rates at the given price.  The backdrop for both senior housing and medical office transactions has become very vibrant. Our shareholders should remain confident that we will not compromise the quality nor will be swayed by our spot cost of capital in a given day. We remain laser focused on building new relationships with the best-in-class senior housing operators and health systems while realizing growth opportunities with these partners one asset at a time. With that, I\u2019ll pass it to John Goodey, our CFO. John? John Goodey : Thank you Shankh, and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to provide you with the financial highlights of our second quarter 2019. As you\u2019ve just heard from my colleagues, Q2 has been another successful and very active capital allocation quarter for Welltower. During the quarter, we completed $2.6 billion of gross investments, including $2.4 billion of high quality acquisitions across eight separate transactions at a blended yield of 5.4%, making Q2 one of our busiest ever for investment. We also announced that in July, we sold our Benchmark senior living portfolio for a gross value of $1.8 billion, booking a capital gain in excess of $450 million. Tim McHugh will be detailing our updated views on acquisitions and dispositions for the full year in a few moments, along with revisions to our full year guidance. During the quarter, we successfully raised $295 million of gross proceeds from common [indiscernible] issuance via our DRIP and cash settled and forward sales ATM programs at an average price of $80.28 per share, and we saw strong demand for our new commercial paper program. Welltower continues to enjoy excellent access to a plurality of capital sources to fund our acquisition pipeline and future growth opportunities. Our Q2 2019 closing balance sheet position remains strong with $269 million of cash and equivalents and $1.1 billion of capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility. With net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 6.33 times, our leverage metrics remain strong, albeit with some increase over Q1 2019\u2019s close. This increase was temporary, cause by the timing of recent sizeable acquisitions and dispositions. With the closing of the Benchmark transaction, we have already seen leverage return to be in line with 2019 guidance levels, and as at July 31 our cash and equivalents balance has risen to $340 million and our primary capacity to $1.7 billion. Moving on to earnings, today we\u2019re able to report a normalized second quarter 2019 FFO result of $1.05 per share, representing strong growth of 5% over Q2 2018. Our overall Q2 same store NOI growth was an encouraging 3.1% for the quarter with all our segments recording solid growth. Senior housing operations same store NOI grew by 3.3% in the quarter, driven by solid growth in the U.S. and the U.K. Senior housing triple-net grew by 3.7%, outpatient medical grew by 2.3%, and long term post-acute grew by 2%.  I\u2019d now like to turn to our guidance for the full year 2019. We are increasing our full year total portfolio same store NOI growth range to 2 to 2.5% from 1.25 to 2.25% previously, this reflecting the strong performance of our core portfolio. In addition, we are tightening our expected normalized FFO range to $4.10 to $4.20 per share from $4.10 to $4.25 per share previously, reflecting the change in our 2019 disposition guidance. As usual, our guidance includes only announced acquisitions and includes all dispositions anticipated in 2019. Finally, on August 22, 2019, Welltower will pay its 193rd consecutive cash dividend, being $0.87. This represents a current annualized dividend yield of approximately 4.2%. With that, I\u2019ll hand over to Tim for a more detailed walk-through of our updated guidance. Tim? Tim McHugh : Thank you John. I\u2019d like to provide some additional details of the change in 2019 outlook provided last night. Starting first with property level fundamentals, our core portfolio has performed above expectation year-to-date, driven by our senior housing operating portfolio. This has allowed us to increase our total portfolio same store guidance for the year to a range of 2 to 2.5% from our prior guidance of 1.25 to 2.25%. With all the moving pieces in the quarter, I wanted to add a bit of color on the same store and full year guidance. Our continued focus on improving the quality of our portfolio from a real estate and operator perspective can result in sequential changes to the same store pool. In 2Q, we have 47 asset sequential change in our senior housing operating same store pool from the first quarter. We added 12 properties to the pool and we also removed 59 properties from the pool comprised of 43 properties that were moved to held for sale during the quarter and 16 properties transitioned from Silverado Senior Living to Frontier Management. If the 59 transitioned and held for sale assets had remained in the pool for the quarter and for the year, SHO same store would have 2.8% in the second quarter and full year total portfolio expectations would be approximately 10 basis points lower. A few other comments regarding sub-sector growth in the back half of the year. For our senior housing operating portfolio, back half guidance anticipates a drag from the insurance premium increases which Shankh previously mentioned. For our senior housing triple-net portfolio, performance should normalize to approximately 3% in the back half as we anniversary rent resets tied to the stabilization of development properties. For our health systems portfolio, the Pro Medica lease enters the same store pool in the fourth quarter with a 1.375% annual increase during Year 1 before stepping up 2.75% annual increases for the remainder of the lease. Now turning to our updated acquisition outlook, year-to-date we have acquired $2.7 billion of properties at a 5.5% initial yield and we have invested $232 million in developments with expected stable yields of 7.4%. Our acquisition spend to date has been fairly evenly split between stable MOB assets at a 5.7 average yield and newly built, high quality senior housing assets currently in fill-up, equating to a 5.2% going-in yield with expected stable yields of 6.4%. There are no further acquisitions in our current guidance beyond what has been closed to date and the $140 million Summit Medical acquisition detailed in our earnings release last night. Moving onto dispositions closed to date and our updated full year outlook. To the end of the second quarter, we have disposed of $641 million of properties and loans at a 6.8% yield. As we disclosed in last night\u2019s earnings release, we have increased our full year guidance on dispositions to $3.1 billion at a 6.3% yield from our prior guidance of $1.4 billion at a 6.2% yield. When breaking down this incremental $1.7 billion increase in guidance, I want to highlight that 11 of the 48 benchmark senior living assets sold in July had been previously held for sale. This sub-portfolio represented approximately $300 million of our previous $1.4 billion in full year disposition guidance. This leaves the two main drivers of the $1.7 billion of incremental disposition guidance as the remaining $1.4 billion-plus of our proceeds from the July sale of our Benchmark Senior Living portfolio and an under contract legacy LTAC portfolio.  Furthermore, breaking down the $3.1 billion of full year disposition guidance into sub-asset classes, it is comprised $2.5 billion of senior housing and MOBs at a weighted average cap rate of 5.5% and $600 million of long term post-acute in the high 9s, which includes $330 million of skilled nursing facilities traded at an average of 8.8% cap rate. After these sales, as reflected in our Q2 supplement, we now have 8.6% of our in-place NOI in the long term post-acute space, representing a 22% decline from our investor day. Approximately 95% of our remaining long term post acute exposure is now concentrated in the lowest cost post-acute setting of skilled nursing.  Lastly on the balance sheet, leverage on a net debt to EBITDA basis has remained in line with our target of mid to high 5s with Q1 equity funding of our Q2 acquisition activity taking leverage to sub-5 times before increasing to above 6 times from mid-May to the close of our Benchmark disposition in July, which decreased leverage to our target discussed at our investor day in December.  In summary, stronger than expected fundamentals and a robust acquisition pipeline have validated our initial positive outlook coming into this year. We have continued to take advantage of the constructive capital market backdrop, keep our balance sheet strong and to improve our asset mix through capital recycling. The short term impact of this higher than expected capital recycling has been a tightening of our 2019 guidance from $4.10 to $4.25 per share to $4.10 to $4.20 per share, however we believe in the long term impact of this substantially value-accretive investment. I will now hand the call back to Tom before opening it up for Q&A. Tom DeRosa : Thanks Tim. If you take a step back from the results we just reported, I hope you see that the quarter was not driven by a bunch of deals - deals, a word that has become a pejorative around here. Welltower is a value-added platform that can efficiently and effectively address the capital needed to move health and wellness care delivery forward, particularly in view of the aging of the population. This is generating exciting investment opportunities like the ones we\u2019ve already announced year to date. As Shankh just told you, we also decided to pass on billions of dollars of other opportunities because, while they might have driven short term results, we believe they would not have delivered long term sustainable cash flow growth for our shareholders.  Before we open up for questions, I want to take a moment to recognize and say thank you to the tens of thousands of caregivers who work in our senior housing properties every day. They are truly unsung heroes who are doing their part to improve the many lives we care for to the benefit of our residents, their families, the overall healthcare system, and our shareholders.  Now Zutania, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. You obviously had a very busy quarter and I understand the taking the upfront dilution to the future benefit, but could you give more color on the expected growth profile difference between the acquisitions and the assets that you sold? Shankh Mitra : We had relative difficulty hearing you. I think you were asking about the growth profile of the assets that we are acquiring versus what we\u2019re selling - is that the question? Nicholas Joseph : Yes, that\u2019s right. Shankh Mitra : If you look at the assets we bought, we bought spectacular assets in great locations, newly built assets that opened in 2017, \u201918 and \u201919. If you look at the average ages, they primarily opened in \u201918 and \u201919 on an average basis. Of course, these assets are high 60s to low 70s. From a leasing perspective, they\u2019re leasing up rapidly, so obviously there is going to be significant cash flow growth as you think about the marginal impact on profitability relative to the fixed cost of the community, right? You still need to have an ED, you still need to have sales staff, so there\u2019s a significant amount of fixed cost in the community, and as they lease up you start to break even at a percentage above 60%, and then obviously the margin expands significantly from there. There is significant cash flow growth from just leasing up, but the other point is very importantly, these are newly built assets in exceptional sub-markets in a very high barrier to entry market relative to the markets around them, so you will see the capex mix of these assets versus assets that we are selling will also be different.  As you think about the growth profile, I don\u2019t want you to not only think about the NOI growth, I want you to think about cash flow growth, NOI minus capex growth, which we think will significantly surpass what we sold. Nicholas Joseph : Thanks. I guess longer term once they\u2019re stabilized and when you think on a cash flow basis, what is the spread between those new acquisitions versus the dispositions, do you think, longer term? Shankh Mitra : Obviously we think there is a significant difference, right, and that goes back to our micro market analysis, but it\u2019s kind of hard to talk about it in general terms. But I can tell you that our internal model suggests that on a stabilized basis on what we are selling versus buying, there\u2019s a significant spread, but it\u2019s obviously a deal by deal basis and hard to talk about anything specifically on the call. I\u2019m happy to take it offline with you. Nicholas Joseph : Sounds good, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : Thanks, good morning. I want to just touch on the pipeline. It sounds like there\u2019s a good amount of activity, and I think you referenced 3 million square feet of MOBs, which seems like a big number. You guys have been pretty active in that space, so I\u2019m just curious if you could shed some additional light on what you\u2019re seeing, what\u2019s driving the activity. I think we\u2019re more familiar with the senior housing [indiscernible], but if there\u2019s anything there to sort of flesh out, that\u2019d be great too. Shankh Mitra : Thanks John, good morning. I talked specifically about the medical office pipeline because most of my comments are focused on senior housing in the earlier part, so obviously our senior housing pipeline is very strong, we\u2019re very bullish on the business If you think about how we grow in that business, we grow with our existing operators and we also grow our family of operators, so we have significant opportunity for growth through development as well as acquisitions. We are seeing--like, you see in the Discovery example we mentioned, there\u2019s a lot of product in the market that has been developed by multi-family operators that we\u2019re seeing increasingly coming to the market. We\u2019re seeing lots of people have been able to lease up their assets 50%, 60%, but not above that, so bringing in best-in-class operators like Discovery and others to lease it up and create value for our shareholders, we\u2019re seeing that. On the other hand, the medical office, we have seen tremendous activity, as we talked about. There was an air pocket of capital 18 months ago and we have been able to negotiate and structure a lot of transactions. As you know, John, a real estate transaction takes a lot of time from beginning to finish, and then you have to go through a rofer [ph] process with the health system, so it takes an additional amount of time for medical office because of that. But the transaction that I talked about is a reflection of what the market was end of last year, beginning of this year, and you will see we\u2019ll be able to consummate these transactions going forward.  It seems like some of the frothy capital markets in medical office is coming back in recent times, some of the transactions we have seen. I want you to know that we\u2019re not only focused obviously on cap rates, the credit, the lease and the details behind it, also price per foot. That\u2019s very important. We\u2019re not willing to buy assets in a location where the price per foot reflects a significant premium to replacement cost.  So we\u2019re very, very active on both sides of the house; however, we\u2019ll only do transactions if we think--if we can make money on a total return basis. If not, we\u2019ll walk away, like you have seen us in \u201917 and early \u201918. Tom DeRosa : The other thing I\u2019ll add, Jordan, is our pipeline is largely off market. I think that\u2019s a characteristic of what you see us buying. We are generating these opportunities from our deep relationships in both the health systems and more broadly the medical office sector. Jordan Sadler : The assets you talked about, the 3 million square feet, did you say those are under contract or just LOI? What\u2019s the stage? Shankh Mitra : There are some under contract, some are in [indiscernible] negotiation. Jordan Sadler : Okay, then just on Silverado, can you explain what all went down there? I think we typically think of Silverado as a best-in-class operator in the space. What played out there, and what\u2019s left of the relationship? We typically don\u2019t see the transitions back from ridia [ph] to triple-net, but we did obviously in this situation. Shankh Mitra : Okay, so I think I\u2019ll first address the structure. I think three quarters ago, my prepared remarks were all focused on triple-net, where I described how we look at triple-net leases and how we\u2019re not opposed to triple-net leases, we actually like triple-net leases in certain constructs. I want you to understand that we have no bias for one structure or the other, we are open to any structure between triple-net and ridia [ph] and obviously including the two.  Silverado is a fine operator, really great operator in their markets in California, that they kept the building in California and we removed the non-California assets to Frontier, which we think will be able to create significant upside to the cash flow and, more importantly, resident experience in these buildings. These buildings are not lease-up buildings, these buildings have been open for a long time, but obviously they are 67% leased and have a margin of, call it 6.5%, 7%, so of course we think there is significant upside for both our shareholders and the residents that Frontier will be able to get to. That\u2019s the view. It\u2019s just a view of senior housing is not a national business, it\u2019s a local business, so you have to think about some operators are very good in certain regions and not so much in others, vice versa, so that\u2019s all. There is no more secret than that . It\u2019s just a simple thing, people are very good in certain footprints. Jordan Sadler : Can you shed any light on what the catalyst for the transition was? They obviously lost a bunch of properties here, and I\u2019m kind of curious-- Shankh Mitra : The catalyst for the transition is very simply I told you the performance of those assets. We are very much of a performance-oriented organization and we thought that Silverado should focus on their core California market and some other operator, namely Frontier, will be able to drive more performance out of those assets outside of California. Tom DeRosa : And as we mentioned, Jordan, we\u2019re already seeing positive results of that transition. Frontier is doing an excellent job managing these assets for us, so it was clearly the right decision for Welltower and allows Silverado to focus in its historic core market of California. Jordan Sadler : Okay, thank you guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim with BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Thank you. Tim, thanks for the additional color on the impact of the assets taken out of the SHOP same store pool. Is it fair to assume that Silverado was the main drag and Benchmark held up okay, or can you just maybe provide some color between those two operators? Shankh Mitra : Yes, Benchmark was a positive contributor, Silverado was not, so net-net Tim gave you the impact. John Kim : On the Benchmark sale, can you just discuss a little bit more on how the transaction was originated? Did you put these assets up on the markets or did the buyer approach you, or did your partner approach you on the transaction? Shankh Mitra : We put 11 of that, as Tim mentioned, that we had in held for sale, that those assets were looking to sell. We got significant response from the marketplace. We got several bids, double-digit number of bids from there, and three of those entities, all of them are highly, highly qualified institutional investor private capital. They approached us and said, would you sell the whole portfolio, and as you hear from Tom that everything we own is for sale at a price, so we thought it was a good transaction for us, for the private capital who obviously replaced us, as well as Silverado communities and their residents. All in all, it was a win-win-win for everybody involved. John Kim : If I could just ask for my second question, Pro Medica looks like their occupancy increased this quarter to 85.6%. Can you just remind us if you\u2019re going to provide EBITDAR coverage, and also if you could provide maybe some commentary on the CMS Medicare increase of 2020. It looks like they bifurcated between for-profit and non-for-profit as far as the increase [indiscernible]. John Goodey : I\u2019ll start with the coverage and hand it to Mark for commentary on the CMS policy. We will add Pro Medica to our [indiscernible] health system coverage and then it will roll into total company coverage when we\u2019ve owned it for four quarters, so it will come into our fourth quarter coverage. Mark Shaver : Then as you mentioned CMS\u2019 increased rates, actually it was the week after we announced the transaction, those rates are going into effect as is the change in payment methodology in the fall to PDPM, which I think as many of you know, is not going to be incredibly accretive in terms of economics but also not negative at all, but what it would allow both Manor Care, Genesis others in that industry to do is be more focused on patient care. I think the team at Manor Care and Pro Medica continue to allow them to grow their business and provide more cost efficient care to the patients they serve. Tom DeRosa : And John, just to remind you that Manor Care is now in a non-for-profit status. John Kim : Great, I just wanted that clarity. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. Just two around senior housing. Maybe first on the Benchmark portfolio, if I just look at the run rate NOI last year, given just the number of assets, is it safe to say, or is my calculation correct that the cap rate is around a 5, and can you give us some context on Benchmark as it fits in with your data team? How did the capital allocation versus the fundamentals fit in, in your decision to sell? Shankh Mitra : Vikram, we can\u2019t specifically give you a cap rate. I think you found NOI for all 48 assets, so safe to say that you have to think about a couple of things, right? You\u2019ve got the Q1 2018 NOI and you have to think about the growth o that NOI, whatever your assumptions are. We talked about that we sold the assets at a very significant gain, the impact of relative taxes, that will get you to a nominal cap rate, and then obviously the additional capex, whatever assumptions you have will get you go more of an economic cap rate or a cash flow view of how we look at it.  So we\u2019re not going to get into the details, but you are following the right track, and needless to say that we\u2019re extremely pleased with the assets. Obviously we\u2019re not looking to sell the assets. We got a price that we thought we can\u2019t refuse, so that\u2019s one thing; and second thing is we can sit here and debate, obviously, about cap rates, but I want you to look at the price per unit. That\u2019s not debatable, and that will tell you--and you can see what we bought these assets for, and that will give you a sense of how we feel about this, obviously the price. We do think, as I said, that the price will--obviously this transaction is good for us, good for the buyer and good for Benchmark, so we do think that there\u2019s a great story all around. We also think obviously that the buyer who bought the assets will be able to generate the level of return that we think they have underwritten, otherwise we would not have signed off for that $50 million earn-out, so that sort of gives you a sense of the portfolio. From our perspective, you know that we don\u2019t look at markets, we look at micro markets, and obviously if you have very detailed granular micro markets, you can build a story of sub-markets in any great detail that you want to. We think about these issues deeply, we do think that this improves the quality of our portfolio. We also think the buyer that bought is a very sophisticated, very smart buyer. They\u2019ll also do very well. That it was not a strategic fit for us doesn\u2019t mean these assets are not strategic. Vikram Malhotra : That\u2019s fair enough. Your comments around per-unit make sense. Second question, building off of that, the Discovery portfolio, I was sort of intrigued - the per-unit costs in the 270 range seems to be lower than several deals we\u2019ve seen in the 350-plus range. I know the occupancy is 72% so that\u2019s interesting as well. Can you talk about maybe what differentiates the assets or the return profile, and then also expand a bit upon the billion-dollar development program? Shankh Mitra : Look, I\u2019m just not going to sit here and talk about transactions that other parties in the marketplace have done. I just pointed out simple facts that these assets have traded at a significantly lower price, 50, 60, 70% than different transactions, not just one. Price per unit, as I said, is not debatable, and I also pointed out that these assets are concrete and steel construction, I2 construction, so they are not stick-built assets so there is significant differentiation.  For certain of those transactions, what you might or might not know that we had the contractual right to buy those, the Discovery assets, and we passed on it purely because of price. So it is a question of difference, it doesn\u2019t mean some of those transactions are bad transactions, it\u2019s in our opinion we\u2019re just not willing to pay that kid of premium to replacement cost to buy assets in a market that it\u2019s relatively easier to build. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy to build, just relatively easier to build. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about this topic. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JP Morgan. Tom DeRosa : You there, Mike? Michael Mueller : Can you hear me? Tom DeRosa : Yes, we hear you, Mike. Shankh Mitra : Now we hear you. Michael Mueller : Sorry about that. Just thinking about all the new development agreements that were announced, when you look at what\u2019s been in place before, what\u2019s being added, what do you see as the average annual development spend potential over the next three to five years? Shankh Mitra : Mike, these are long term development agreements, so when I talk about--let\u2019s just say that we have done--we signed a billion dollar development agreement with Balfour, that\u2019s not what\u2019s going to happen in the next three years, right, so these are 10-year development agreements. We are not looking to put X-amount of money out - that\u2019s not our focus. We\u2019re trying to find the best micro markets and not only with the population and the wealth and the willingness to pay is there, but also what we think is going to happen five years from now, six years from now when these properties will lease up. So think about the announcement we made in San Francisco - it will start next year, it will take two years to build at least, and then obviously these assets will lease up, so this is a five to seven-year time horizon. We are thinking of where markets are going and obviously we want to grow one asset at a time with our partners, so what we are doing is we are finding these growth rate deals and making decisions one asset at a time.  Likelihood is our development spend will be robust, but it will be very targeted and very, very focused. Tom DeRosa : You know, Mike, one thing I wanted to add, which I think is a bit different, is that we\u2019re partnering in the development process, so these operators are looking to us to help them identify those specific micro markets where it makes sense to bring their product offering. That\u2019s a bit different than the historic disconnected relationship between the capital provider and the developer - the developer is going off developing assets, and then you hope to be able to acquire those assets at some point. This is really a much more collaborative model that you\u2019re not used to seeing, so these are long term arrangements. We are thinking jointly about where it makes sense to bring new product and in which markets. Michael Mueller : Got it, okay. Makes sense. That was it, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Daniel Bernstein : Good morning. I actually wanted to go back to the buy versus build question. If you look at your SHO development, you\u2019re up over $500 million and you\u2019re building a significant number of relationships on exclusivity on the development side that you announced this quarter. Should I read that just generally, and knowing that somebody approached you for the Benchmark portfolio, but knowing all that, is it better to build versus buy? Are you seeing advantages to build versus buy in seniors housing to improve your portfolio? Shankh Mitra : Absolutely not. It just purely depends on pricing. Let\u2019s take an example that we pointed out in great detail in the press release. With Discovery, we are buying as well as we are building. Obviously we understand development comes with a certain set of risks, so we need to make better returns that we otherwise would in an acquisition; however, we are very, very conscious of price per unit and price per foot, and we\u2019re seeing pricing in the marketplace that doesn\u2019t make any sense to us relative to what we can do on the build. That\u2019s the decision - it\u2019s not one versus another, it is a cascade of decisions, do we want to be in this location, who do we want to be in this location with, and then it\u2019s a question of do we buy it, do we build it, do we buy recently opened buildings? There\u2019s a lot of product that has been built in \u201915, \u201916, \u201917, \u201918, including by a lot of people who are not necessarily from this business, and they might have underestimated how difficult it is to run these communities. This is an operating business, right, so we are squarely focused on growing our platform with our operating partners one asset at a time. Daniel Bernstein : Okay. I guess the other question I had, and maybe we could take this offline afterwards, I just wanted to understand more specifically how the portfolio, the senior housing portfolio has changed from a statistical point - you know, age of the portfolio, demographics, etc. You look at the supplemental, it doesn\u2019t seem like the numbers have changed that much, but again maybe that\u2019s something we can take offline if you want. Shankh Mitra : Yes Dan, I will just give you a couple of data points for you to think about. We are squarely focused on several layers of the decision making process, right? You talked about age of the portfolio, obviously location is important as we said several times that market and sub-market does not tell you the story. You need to understand what micro markets you are in, what neighborhoods you are in, and how those neighborhoods are changing, then you can reconstruct the sub-markets and the markets back up. It\u2019s not the other way around. Those change, so you need to understand that.  The other layer that you need to think about is operating partner and the alignment of interest with the operating partner, so that\u2019s something we should have a conversation. Contracts are changing, and they are changing not in our favor. Contracts are changing for alignment of interest. We are not trying to do contracts that are just one-sided contracts. We are trying to do where we\u2019re aligned, right, so I want you to understand there\u2019s a series of decision making. Location is one, operator is one, the contract with the operator is another one, all going to the direction of we are in this, from our perspective, to make a great return for our shareholders and to enhance resident experience. That\u2019s [indiscernible]. We\u2019re happy to take that question offline and walk you through. Daniel Bernstein : Yes, that would be great. Thanks Shankh. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karin Ford with MUFG Securities. Karin Ford : Hi, good morning. We were a bit surprised that the dispositions accelerated again this quarter, putting up over a $3 billion number this year. We were under the impression that the portfolio was more or less roughly where you wanted it to be. Was there anything about the Benchmark portfolio that did not fit your next generation healthcare model, and how much of the remaining portfolio would you say falls into that category? Shankh Mitra : Karin, I want to be very specific. As we said, we\u2019re only looking to sell a very small part of that portfolio. It\u2019s important for you that you focus on the fact we\u2019re only looking to sell a very small part of the portfolio. We got a get price that we couldn\u2019t refuse, so we sold the portfolio. As you think about as capital allocators, we have to think about--the capital allocation process is not just what your short term cost of capital is relative to your stock or bond price that day. Everything we sell, whether that\u2019s assets or equity, has an IRR that is attached to it, right? IRR is not even the right word - it\u2019s total return that is attached to it, so we look at the total return of everything we sell, including equity, and we look at every asset we own and we have a forward IRR associated with that asset, and the difference between the two is the value creation for our shareholders.  So we are not looking to rethink what we told you. We stand by that. We own the majority of the portfolio that we want to own going forward, obviously. However, we got a price that we couldn\u2019t refuse and we acted in what we think is in the best interests, long term best interests of the shareholder. We\u2019re happy to do that over and over again, but we\u2019re not looking to sell. There is not part of the portfolio that we want to sell, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at. This is not a non-core portfolio that we\u2019re sitting on that we want to dispose of at this point in time. We are past that phase of our life cycle. Karin Ford : Okay, fair enough. My second question is just on SHOP. Can you update us on how supply is trending in your markets? Are your data analytics still telling you that it\u2019s going to be coming down 23 to 25%-ish, and anything you can share on how the portfolio has been trending so far in July? Shankh Mitra : We talked about on investor day with very specific details that we believe that total ACU, or adjusted competition units [indiscernible] for our portfolio is down roughly about 20% this year, and we have not seen much change from there. Just remember what I described last call, is you always see \u201918 deliveries flow into \u201919, and as we get to the end of the year you will see \u201919 deliveries will go into \u201920. That\u2019s just the normal life cycle of developments that we see, but overall there\u2019s not much of a change. Obviously you know how the demand and supply pattern is changing from 2020 and onwards, and it\u2019s very favorable on both ends; but we\u2019re confident that we will be able to deliver growth from our portfolio. Our portfolio, as we thought would turn, has turned, and we\u2019ll see what market gives us going forward. Karin Ford : Do you have an early estimate on how much supply will be down next year? Shankh Mitra : We\u2019re not prepared to discuss that yet. Karin Ford : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Thanks, good morning. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about that Summit Medical transaction. Are you characterizing that as an MOB or a health system deal, and maybe just the genesis of how that deal came out. Tom DeRosa : Hey Steve. We are categorizing it as an MOB, although it now is part of a broader relationship with Summit. This is an example of how we\u2019ve been redirecting our business. We are engaged very deeply in building relationships with health systems and large multi specialty physician groups like Summit and looking for ways to help them transition their business models to make them more competitive in the future and improve consumer focus. When Summit and CityMD came together, it opened up an opportunity for us to look for ways that we could help facilitate the capital side of that combination, so that\u2019s where the acquisition of the Berkeley Heights campus came in. One of the things we didn\u2019t mention is this is probably one of the best large healthcare sites in the New York region, very affluent area, very high barrier to entry market. I think you and Sheila know it pretty well. We\u2019re excited that there is the opportunity to help them think through that campus. There may be other MOB opportunities on the campus, there may be even opportunities for housing on that campus at some point, so again off market, very strategic opportunity for us, and an example of where we\u2019re taking the business in the future. Shankh Mitra : Steve, that merger is--the live merger process is going through right now, we expect this to close next month or so. Post that, we\u2019re happy to have more conversations about this particular transaction, but as Tom said, clearly you can see that we\u2019re talking about healthcare is moving to a lower cost consumer setting, you are seeing the examples of that in many places, and that changes how these physician groups and the health systems are thinking about on-campus versus off-campus, so that\u2019s an important thing to think about in relation. The other one to think about is very simply that how we\u2019re helping our partners to achieve their strategic objectives. Obviously this was [indiscernible] process, a very important M&A process for them, for both parties involved in that merger, and they obviously trusted us that we will be able to quickly move, execute and be there. That reliability and that trust is very important.  So post completion of the merger, we\u2019re happy to have more conversations about it. Steve Sakwa : Okay, and just second question - if it\u2019s too long winded here for an answer, we can take it offline. You talked about this new management contract with the operators and trying to better align their fees and your performance. I\u2019m just trying to figure out, does this in any way, shape or form potentially slow the SHOP growth over time as they have better economics and maybe the upside of the performance of the assets? Shankh Mitra : If you think about it, if we have designed it, we\u2019re not going to get into it - it\u2019s a proprietary structure, so we\u2019re not going to get into the call to describe to the world how it works. But definitely if we have entered into those constructs, and we believe we\u2019re the only ones to do that - maybe other people are doing it as well, but we think that provides upside for our shareholders. As in any operating relationship, you would expect the financial cap partner will be aligned with the capital partners. If there is significant upside in this property, we would like to share that upside with our operating partner, but it also will be a fact on the other side, on the downside protection as well. I want you to think about as these are not--these structures, which I\u2019m happy to walk you through and there are several versions of those, are not designed to take growth down. It\u2019s quite the opposite - for an operator, it is to incentivize operators to focus on the ops and make sure they understand that running a building exceptionally well can be as profitable as developing the building. That\u2019s what the focus is. Tom DeRosa : Let\u2019s have a longer conversation about this, Steve. You and Sheila should come by one day and we\u2019ll walk you through it in greater detail. Steve Sakwa : Sounds good, thanks . Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I just wanted to go back to the guidance on same store. Did you talk about what is embedded for senior housing operating and if there was any change there? I think there is still some--even if you hit the high end of the old range, there\u2019s some deceleration in the back half of the year. If you could just kind of remind us what\u2019s driving that Tim McHugh : Yes, I\u2019ll start with your question on the guidance change. We do not update sub-sector guidance throughout the year, so we didn\u2019t change that. That being said, the SHO part of our total portfolio is, as you know, typically the most volatile as far as upside-downside, so it\u2019s fair to assume that the biggest piece of moving that in our comments today, talking about how our SHO portfolio has outperformed our expectations, are consistent with that. It\u2019s fair to say that that is what is moving total portfolio up. Nick Yulico : And is there some deceleration we should expect in the back half of the year versus first half of the year? Shankh Mitra : As you know, Nick, we do not run the company from quarter to quarter. We feel very good about where pricing is. You can look at pricing and you can make your own assumptions. Only thing we would tell you, that there\u2019s two things we want you to consider. One is the insurance cost, which is a headwind for the back half of the year - it was a headwind for this quarter as well, and you have to think about the operating leverage, and we also told that as we get towards the end of the year, U.K. should moderate down and Canada should go the other way, so you put all of those things, you decide where it will land. Clearly we can\u2019t sit here and tell you what we want the Q3 or Q4 will be. We\u2019ll see that the market gives us, but needless to say that if you think about the pricing economics, the occupancy and expenses will get you a number. We\u2019ll see where we are in 90 days. Nick Yulico : Okay, thanks for that. Just last question on capex. I know you have talked about your focus on looking at capex for the portfolio, and it\u2019s kind of hard for us to see that other than if we look in the supp and you have the page on senior housing operating and you give your recurring capex, your other capex, and it looks like the per-unit recurring capex was up year-over-year in the second quarter. Can you just talk about what\u2019s driving that, and as well I think your guidance for overall company capex went up a little bit. Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Let\u2019s take a step back and think about capex. Obviously capex will change as the portfolio construction is changing, right, so you\u2019re seeing that we are selling a lot of the older assets that will help capex. I also want to remind you that you have two non-repeating items in our capex - one is the vintage capex we talked about that is finally getting flushed through the system now, and the other, four assets we bought from S&H that we discussed is finally--those monies are being spent right now. I just want you to think about capex but in relationship with how the portfolio is changing. The third piece as you think about capex is we talked about when we announced the Brookdale transition that we think these properties have significant upside and some of them will need to be refreshed, so that\u2019s also flowing through the numbers now. But there is no question, Nick, as we talked about, we are extremely focused on capex. We\u2019re focused on total return - capex is a very big part of that, and some of our portfolio decisions are made because of that. On the other hand, I will tell you that on the medical office side, Keith and his team has done a tremendous job on the capex side and we are starting to see the benefit of that. So stay tuned, there\u2019s a lot to talk about this topic as we get through 2020 and beyond. Tim McHugh : As you mentioned the full year outlook, Nick, we\u2019ve sold Benchmark so we have gotten rid of some senior housing operating assets, but we\u2019ve also added quite a few, and then on the transition side when we moved stuff from triple-net to SHO, the capex obviously flows through our numbers then, so that\u2019s a cause for some incremental pick-up in the guidance. Nick Yulico : All right, thanks everyone. Shankh Mitra : And Tim, you are referring to the Brookdale transition, right? Pegasus and [indiscernible] now they are starting to flow through our [indiscernible]. Tim McHugh : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Steve Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning everybody. Congrats on the various transaction announcements. For the acquisition of the newly developed Sunrise communities in DC, San Francisco and San Diego, I think in your prepared remarks, if I heard you right, you characterized these markets as high barriers to entry. I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re able to remind us again, or just give us a little more color around the nuances that make these particular markets high barrier to entry from your perspective. Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Thanks Steve. If you think about some of these markets, I\u2019ll give you an example. First, let\u2019s talk about--Sunrise is a very example for you to understand how to create value. In Sunrise developments, we fund 34% of all development, so whatever the yield on cost on the development, a third stays with us, and that two-thirds that have rights on that we bought, so from an economics perspective I gave two numbers. For the two-thirds, the stabilized yield as we talked about is close to 6%, but I also said the overall stabilized yield for 100% of the portfolio is close to 7%. What\u2019s the difference? It\u2019s the third where the yield on cost obviously is very high. Now, that goes back to why the yield on cost is so high. If you do the math, you will see it\u2019s a big number. It\u2019s because these are legacy lands that Sunrise owned for a long time. Some of this goes back 10 years, 11 years, and it takes that much time, in some of these cases five, six, seven years to get through zoning, get through permitting to build these assets. So these two are very well connected, so obviously because of our ownership in Sunrise, and we talked about in other situations that we own up to 35% of different operators, what comes with it is an investment in those assets at a basis. Now, it takes time to build those assets, right, in these high barriers to entry markets because of zoning and permitting, but what you get at the other end is obviously spectacular assets at a great price, great yield, if that makes sense. Steve Valiquette : Okay, got it. Yes, appreciate the extra color. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Chad Vanacore : Thanks for fitting me in. I just want to understand the Benchmark sale a little bit better outside of the price aspect. Shankh Mitra : Can you speak up a little bit? We\u2019re having difficulty hearing you. Chad Vanacore : Sorry about that. Is that better, Shankh? Shankh Mitra : That\u2019s significantly better. Chad Vanacore : Excellent, all right. I want to better understand the Benchmark sale outside of price. Maybe you can contrast the difference in terms of asset and operator quality or growth profile between Benchmark and then some of the new acquisitions that you closed year to date. Shankh Mitra : We\u2019re not going to get into an operating quality conversation. Benchmark is a highly reputed operator, so we\u2019re not going to get into that. We give you in-place NOI every quarter, so you can look at those numbers and you can decide what the in-place NOI and the growth has been. I\u2019ll only point out to you that what we are buying is newly built buildings and a very specific micro market. The decisions we bought into when we bought these assets were not at the portfolio level. They are asset level, one asset at a time decisions, so of course we think the difference of age and the location, which is not just a question of demographics but also a question of typographics and willingness to pay will have significant better growth, not just NOI but also NOI minus capex. Chad Vanacore : All right. Thinking going forward, if you\u2019re looking at just newly built buildings in specific micro markets, does that limit your growth profile going forward because it\u2019s going to limit which portfolios you can invest in? Shankh Mitra : No Chad. We are a happy buyer of assets if it is in the right market with the right operator with the right alignment. Tom DeRosa : And the right price. Shankh Mitra : And the right price. The point is not that we are only focused on new buildings. The only focus was--I was trying to explain the trade of what we bought versus what we sold this quarter. Tom DeRosa : Chad, you know, if you think about the history of the REITs acquiring senior living assets, there was a period of time when a healthcare REIT bought Benchmark, you were buying a large diverse portfolio of assets created by that operator over time. I think what Shankh is also saying is that as we move forward, we\u2019re much more deliberate about which assets we buy. If there are large diverse portfolios and the price is right, and most of the assets fit our criteria, we might be a large portfolio buyer. But we\u2019re not going to pay up for assets that we really do not believe are critical to our focus going forward, and I think there was a time when there was lots of asset gathering between the historic senior housing operators and the REITs. I think that times have changed and I think we have a very different approach to acquiring assets today, but we\u2019re as aggressive in finding tremendous opportunities to deploy capital I think that should be one of the takeaways from today\u2019s call and our earnings release, is that we are driving a tremendous opportunity to deploy capital in assets we think are sustainable for the long term, not just getting bigger for the sake of getting bigger I think there was a lot of that historically, and a lot of what Welltower has been doing is working through that, so I think you\u2019ll see going forward--I think we think we have a much better construct and a much better asset portfolio going forward than we had four years ago. Chad Vanacore : All right, thanks Tom. Adjacent to your comments, just thinking about what you\u2019ve invested in this quarter and what you\u2019ve disposed of, is now the right time to take more of a risk in lease-up in newer assets rather than stabilized assets? Shankh Mitra : No Chad, that\u2019s what I want to mention, that we are more than happy to buy stabilized assets if the price is right, not just from a capital perspective but from a total return perspective and price per unit perspective. We\u2019re more than happy to do that. It is not a question of are we looking to buy stabilized assets. Let\u2019s take the example of Balfour. We bought six assets. Five of them are relatively stabilized assets, one just opened, and if you think about what happens when a building\u2019s just opened, you have negative NOI. That\u2019s how the buildings flow through. That\u2019s what brings your cap rate down. Quite obviously, you lease up the asset, you go the other way.  We\u2019re not looking to buy just lease-up assets. It just happens to be some people have built a lot of senior housing assets in markets who are not senior housing operators. That\u2019s not an easy business to be in, and many multi-family developers did not understand there\u2019s an operating model behind the building which they do not necessarily have to think about when they build multi-family buildings. So we are finding those opportunities to step in with our operating partners, exceptional operators such as Discovery, one asset at a time. We\u2019re not looking to do big portfolios. Now if we find a big portfolio of stabilized assets that we think we have a different view, we have to have a different view from the seller otherwise the asset will be priced for perfection, then we\u2019re happy to step in, and we do that every day. It\u2019s just we need to have a different view from the seller either on the revenue side or on the cost side.  How do we know--what is an example of that, what we have recently done ? CNL. Look at what happened in CNL. The biggest credit part of the CNL portfolio was Novant, and that has only three and a half years left in the lease term, and see what we have done since we have taken over. So we have a different view from the seller or the other potential buyers when we can step in and create significant operational value. Chad Vanacore : All right, thanks. That\u2019s it for me. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Lukas Hartwich : Thanks. You guys have talked a lot about selling assets with high capex needs, but won\u2019t that get factored into pricing, or do you think there is an inefficiency here? Shankh Mitra : Every trade has two sides, a buyer and a seller, right, and everybody has their reasons to buy and their reasons to sell. As I said, we think this particular example, this particular transaction is an example of win-win-win. We do think the buyers who have bought these assets will make money, and how do you know we believe that? Look at our earn-out structure. We also think this is very good for the assets. These assets will take reinvestment and then be revitalized as Tom raised in his comment in our press release, so we are not necessarily predicting there is a significant inefficiency here. We are only telling you that we\u2019re extremely happy with the price, otherwise we would not have sold, and we are not looking to sell. We are only looking to sell a very small portion of this portfolio and we got a price we couldn\u2019t refuse. Lukas Hartwich : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. I just want to talk about the dispositions a little bit, and I think you guys did a good job on the first half sales. Can we talk about the second half sales? It seems like you have another billion, and I believe Tim mentioned some of that was the LTAC portfolio. What else is in there, and did you recently put those in there and have you identified buyers for those properties? Tim McHugh : Of the incremental addition to guidance, it is primarily the Benchmarks. I mentioned that $300 million of the 1.7-plus of proceeds from Benchmark was already in held for sale, so the $1.7 million increase in dispositions, 1.4-plus is Benchmark and all of the remaining is that LTAC portfolio I spoke of. Shankh Mitra : Just to make sure of one thing, Mike, to get to the heart of your question, we don\u2019t put something in held for sale or talk about selling a property or changing or guidance unless we have a handshake on a transaction, so of course we have identified the buyer, we have negotiated the price, we have agreed on what the structure should look like, and that\u2019s why the disposition guidance has gone up. Now, if we\u2019re loosely thinking about should we sell an asset, obviously we don\u2019t change disposition guidance on that. I just want you to understand the process. For an example, let\u2019s take the other side of that. When I talked about the 3 million square feet of medical office portfolio--not one portfolio, several medical office transactions, that\u2019s not what we are--you know, that\u2019s not the pipeline we are discussing with different sellers, do you want to see, does it work. That\u2019s not the characteristic of the pipeline. We talked about 3 million square feet because we have agreed on the price, we have agreed on the structure, now we\u2019re exchanging documentation, we\u2019re going through the PSA, going through all the legal, etc. So both acquisitions and dispositions, when we talk about pipeline and we talk about disposition guidance, you should assume the economics and the structures have been set and hands have been shaken. Michael Carroll : Great, appreciate it. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Rich Anderson : Sorry for keeping you so long. I was just curious, Tim - I appreciated the color on the make-up of the same store pool. I\u2019m curious, what amount of assets are not in there now? I think it was 48 transitioned and then I know the held for sale, I\u2019m fine with those being out of there, but then there was the Brookdale transitions from a while back. I\u2019m wondering when the same store pool will be fully loaded with all the transitioned assets, and at what point do you make the decision to add them back subsequent to these transitions? Shankh Mitra : Yes, so we did not--there are not 48 assets that went to transitions. Tim specifically mentioned 16 were removed for transition, the rest obviously we sold Benchmark, which is 48 assets. To answer your question specifically, only when there\u2019s a change of operator, it moves from same store. If there\u2019s just a change of construct, it does not change the same store, so it\u2019s very easy to understand. The operating performance of a building doesn\u2019t change necessarily because fundamentally behind your systems, you have a triple-net construct or a ridia construct. When it does, when the management\u2019s changing, the flags are changing, it\u2019s massively disruptive for those properties. That\u2019s the source of our same store policy. When do they come back is the question you asked. When we own the properties at least for five quarters, so that you are not lapping easy comps. That does not create same store, so we\u2019ve got to own the properties for five quarters in the new construct, with the new operator for it to come back to the same store. That is true for our new acquisitions and for development that needs to be opened for X-amount of time, or they need to be stabilized for them to get to the same store. The idea behind all of those is same store is supposed to give you a sense of how an average portfolio on a stabilized basis is doing. All these changes, including that if you move the assets out when you are not doing well, then you put the asset back in, obviously presumably when you stabilize it, that does not give you a sense of same store, hence the five quarters. Hopefully that answers your question. Rich Anderson : That\u2019s perfect. Second question for anyone in the room, Ventas put out their five-year outlook on SHOP. I suspect you look at that and think you can beat it, but maybe a different angle to the question is, is there an implied ceiling on your ability to move rate up simply because you\u2019re dealing with the elderly population and to milk every last penny from that perspective is somewhat politically incorrect, or something like that, so I\u2019m just wondering if there is some sort of ceiling to same store growth just because of the nature of the business that you\u2019re in. Thanks. Shankh Mitra : I\u2019m going to try to answer that question. We\u2019re not going to specifically get into a five-year outlook by another participant in the overall space. We gave you our own five-year outlook that explains our view of what we think the portfolio is going to be. You probably have noticed that the demand drivers are very easy to get your head wrapped around, right, and we think the same presentation you talked about has done a fantastic job of doing that, but you\u2019ll never hear us talk about a five-year outlook on a generic basis beyond what we know in our portfolio. Tim talked about on investor day of five-year outlook of our portfolio and how the lease-ups and all the construction in progress and everything flows together for a cash flow construct. Why that is the case despite the fact we have so many people whose sold job at Welltower is to do predictive analytics. Why we don\u2019t that, because we don\u2019t know the supply response. The demand side is relatively--not easy, but you can wrap your head around it. I can\u2019t tell you sitting here what the supply is going to look like five years from now. I will point out to you, not talking about any specific company, if you look at the history you will see the Welltower portfolio has outperformed in general the broad industry, as well as all other participants in the industry who own diversified portfolios. There is no reason that I would think that the future will be much different, especially in light of how we curated this portfolio in the last four years. Tom DeRosa : Let me just speak to your point about affordability. This is a business that is very high human touch, and that\u2019s why I made the comment about the hundreds of thousands of people that work in this industry. It is a very labor intensive business, and that explains the cost side of it and why the prices are high. I think the only way we\u2019re going to reduce the cost of a high touch, high labor component business is through technology, and that\u2019s something we\u2019re looking at. We don\u2019t think that broadly you can continue to charge a price that will compensate you for the high costs of delivering this product. You can in certain markets, and that comes back to our micro market approach because like there are people who will always want luxury products, there\u2019s always going to be a market of people that want--that demand that high service model, that\u2019s where we can deliver that. But I think more broadly, Rich, I think we need to be thinking about how we can lower the cost side of this so the cost to the consumer can be lower, because a lot more people are going to need this service in the future. Rich Anderson : All right, great question. Thanks Tom and everybody. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it\u2019s Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Tom, I just wanted to ask you about the succession planning and how you and the board are sort of approaching it. I remember when you stepped in for George, at the time you talked about how that was a process that the board endorsed and that was how things had gone. I\u2019m just curious what is the tenor today about should you--I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re deciding or not, I recognize you probably still have a long runway, but how is the board approaching succession planning? Would it be another board member, would it be someone internal, would you seek to look external? How should we think about the framework that you\u2019re [indiscernible]? Tom DeRosa : Great question, Mike, and it\u2019s something we talk about with the board a lot. I think the best answer I have for you is we have over the last five years brought in a next-generation management team at this company. Sometimes we get criticized for changing seats in management roles. I think we\u2019re a company, and with the support of our board we\u2019re constantly evaluating what are the skill sets that will be needed to run a business that would be different five years from now than it is today. So being able to recruit a very high caliber junior team of professionals all the way up to the NEO level is how you ensure good succession planning in a company. You\u2019ve also seen us move people into different jobs here, and I think that\u2019s another key piece. I just talked about this last week at our board meeting. The idea that you always--when you change a job, you need to get a new title, really doesn\u2019t work. It works in some cases, but that should not be--that should be an exception versus a rule, and we\u2019re really looking at lateral promotions. You saw someone like a Justin Skiver who was a senior vice president of investments has been moved to London, moved his family to London and he\u2019s had a tremendous experience He\u2019s going to come back to the U.S., but this has really made him a more viable leader in the company because he\u2019s had diversity of experience, and that\u2019s something - and we\u2019re happy to talk to you more in depth about this because it\u2019s something that we\u2019re proud of - we\u2019re really moving people around the organization and cross-training people, and that\u2019s the best way I know to create a viable succession plan for a company. Michael Bilerman : So it sounds like a number one choice would be use your internal talent, give them the right skills, different skills, move them around so that you have a roster of people that you can choose from internally, that would be choice number one. Tom DeRosa : Yes. Michael Bilerman : Choice number two and three, well, it sounds like a board choice, like when you came on, would probably be lower than getting someone from the outside. Is that fair? Tom DeRosa : Yes. I mean, I\u2019d say that we are very focused on having a deep bench here, so when there is a need for succession, that there\u2019s a deep pool to select from and which is as least disruptive, I think, for shareholders as possible. Understand, when I stepped into the role, the board did not have the confidence that there existed that deep pool inside the company at that time. If you spoke to our board today, they have a very different view of the pool that exists inside the company than they did five years ago. Michael Bilerman : Makes sense. I appreciate the color, Tom. Tom DeRosa : Thanks for the question, Mike. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for dialing into the Welltower earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation and ask that you disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir. Matt McQueen : Thank you, Shelby and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tom for his remarks on the quarter. Tom? Thomas DeRosa : Thanks Matt. Back at our Investor Day in December of 2018, I laid out a growth plan for 2019. I'm pleased to say that we have met or exceeded this growth plan year-to-date and today, we again reported strong results, which are enabling us to raise the midpoint of our 2019 FFO guidance. The optimism that I articulated last December had less to do with NIC data and more to do with a deliberate and often painful complete restructuring of all aspects of a company formerly known as Health Care REIT. We made considered and sometimes tough decisions regarding Genesis, Brookdale, health lease and other legacy investments that could best be characterized as last generation real estate, bad capital structures, misaligned operating agreements, misguided private equity investments or frankly simply paying too much for real estate. It was sometimes painful for our shareholders, but this management team took actions that were in our shareholders' best long-term interest. While we will never stop optimizing our investment portfolio, the dispositions as well as the acquisitions made in the last 3 years have significantly de-risked the enterprise. That is why today, our senior housing assets have positive growth, our long-term care assets have strong lease coverage, and our industry-leading MOB portfolio continues to perform and grow through acquisition and development. Welltower has unique strategy that fundamentally views our health and wellness care delivery real estate as a platform like all successful platforms, this platform is able to deliver another level of value far beyond the value of the real estate. This enables synergistic collaborations like CareMore Anthem, which we recently announced, attracts new senior housing operators this year alone like LCB, Balfour, Frontier, Atria, and Clover and has enabled our medical office portfolio to grow by approximately $2 billion this year and the year is not over. As we continue to grow, we have strengthened our balance sheet, so we can continue to drive shareholder value in a measured way. Tim McHugh will now take you through a closer look at our third quarter financial performance. But first, I need to mention that this is Tim's first official earnings call as Chief Financial Officer. I've had the pleasure of working side-by-side with Tim over the last 4 years and could not be happier to see him ascend to this leadership role at Welltower. A role we've been grooming him for since we stole him away from RREEF. Over to you, Tim. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Tom. My comments today will focus on our third quarter results, our balance sheet and updates to our full year 2019 guidance. Welltower reported normalized FFO of $1.05 per share. Results were primarily driven by strong fundamental performance in our core portfolio and continued accretive capital deployment, slightly offset by $2 billion of property dispositions outlined last quarter, as part of our guidance adjustment and $62 million of loan payoffs yielding 9.4%. Now let me provide you some details around our major segments. Starting with Seniors Housing Triple-net, with another consistent quarter was positive 3.4% year-over-year same-store growth driven by several development leases with fair market value step-ups. EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverages were flat and down 0.1 times respectively. Turning to medical office. Same-store growth, a positive 1.4% in the quarter was below long-term run rate, but above our short-term expectation. We are encouraged by recent leasing velocity as back of vacancies resulted in a 40 basis points sequential increase in occupancy. Importantly, we expect same-store growth return to trend next quarter as cash rent commences in our newly leased space. Next for health systems, which is comprised of our HCR ManorCare joint venture with ProMedica. This portfolio enters the same-store pool in the fourth quarter. We reported HCR ManorCare's trailing 12-month rent coverage of 2.15 times in the footnote on Page 1 of our supplement this quarter. The presentation is consistent with ProMedica's latest public presentation of the metric and is trailing 12-month coverage from 06/30/2019. The coverage includes revenue and expenses under HCR ManorCare's core business lines including home health and hospice. This is consistent with how HCR's lease coverage has been presented by other public landlords in the past, and more importantly tied to how ProMedica itself reports coverage of Welltower's lease to its public stakeholders. While a reported coverage does not and will not reflect any profitability beyond the cash flow of HCR ManorCare itself, the guarantee in our lease is pari-passu with the senior most claims on its parent company and our joint venture partner, ProMedica. Turning to long-term post-acute same store growth was positive 2.5% in the quarter in both EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverages declined 0.01 times respectively. Lastly, our senior housing operating segment continued to perform above our expectations. The same-store growth of positive 2.8% in the quarter. As Tom alluded to, these results are a reflection of our continued focus on improving the quality of our portfolio from both the real estate and operator perspective. As I noted last quarter, our active approach to portfolio management may result in sequential changes to our same-store pool. In 3Q, we had an eight-asset sequential change in our senior housing operating same-store pool. There were 15 assets removed made up of 11 Silverado properties in California that were transitioned to triple-net lease structure and four Revera properties in Canada that were moved to held for sale and subsequently sold in early October. If these 15 assets had not been removed from the pool, same-store growth would have been positive 70 basis points higher than what we reported. Additionally, we added 77 properties to the pool this quarter, consisting of five acquisition properties, one redevelopment and one transition property, which all reach their fiscal quarter of operations for our same-store policy. At quarter end, we had a total of 75 senior housing operating assets classified as transition properties. These assets began transitioning in the fourth quarter of last year, we'll start to re-enter the same-store pool in the first quarter of 2020; 46 of the 75 will re-enter the pool by the second quarter of next year in virtually all 75 will be in the pool by the start of the fourth quarter next year. While a roll down in rent to EBITDAR has created short-term dilution over the past five quarters, we continue to expect these properties contribute meaningfully to cash flow growth in the coming years. Turning to the balance sheet, we remained disciplined in our capital raising efforts taking advantage of historically low yield the investor grade debt market. In August, we came back to the market for the second time this year raising a $1.22 billion of debt with over 8 years of duration and a weighted average yield of just 2.87% proceeds from this issuance were used to refinance our 2021 and 2022 maturities. As a result of this activity, we extended the average maturity and our entire debt stack by one full year. Additionally, we continue to access the equity markets during the quarter via our DRIP and ATM programs. We believe that our disciplined approach through these mechanisms provides us with maximum efficiency and flexibility in match funding both our development and our highly visible investment pipeline. As such in the quarter and through early October, we issued approximately 4.5 million shares at a weighted average price of $88.54 per share for estimated proceeds of $395 million. As of today's call, through our afford ATM program, we have sold 6.1 million shares of common stock, but have yet to settle, representing $528 million of estimated proceeds. This methodical approach to capital raising, a long-term asset recycling activity has allowed us to concurrently improve our leverage metrics, while further strengthening the quality of our portfolio. With a closing of the Benchmark senior living portfolio this quarter, we ended the quarter at 5.79 times net debt to EBITDA, which represents a roughly half churn reductions from the end of Q2. We continue to be encouraged by the strong bid for our assets throughout our entire portfolio. We continue to view the disposition of non-core assets, as the efficient and effective way to capitalize the growing opportunities that we see. I reinforce that we are more than adequately capitalized to our capital raising efforts and asset recycling activities finance all near-term investment and development opportunities. Lastly, I want to address last night's update to full year 2019 guidance. As indicated in our press release, we are tightening our full-year FFO guidance to a range of $4.14 to $4.18 per share, from our prior range of $4.10 to $4.20 per share. With that change, the midpoint of our guidance has been lifted to $4.16 per share, which reflects better than expected portfolio performance, particularly from our senior housing operating segment. Further details regarding our guidance are contained in last night's press release. And with that, I'll now hand the call over to our Chief Investment Officer, Shankh Mitra. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim and good morning everyone. I will now review our quarterly operating results and provide additional details on performance, trends, and recent investment activity. We're delighted to inform you that every segment of our business has either exceeded our met our expectations this quarter. We came into this year expecting a slow and steady recovery to take hold in our senior housing operating our SHOP segment. However, I have to admit for three quarters in a row, our SHOP results have exceeded our own expectations. Relative to our initial expectation - 2.5% to 2% NOI growth in SHOP for 2019, we have year-to-date delivered a solid 3% NOI growth, driven by strong pricing power. Q3 was no exception driven by significantly better-than-expected U.S. results. Overall, same-store NOI was up 2.8% in Q3 driven by 3% revenue growth and partially offset by 3.1% expense growth. Though we experienced a slight decrease in occupancy, year-over-year, primarily driven by a Canadian portfolio were increased by overall sequential occupancy growth. We continue to achieve very strong pricing power differentiating our extremely well-located and diverse portfolio. While labor cost inflation continues to be challenging with 4.8% year-over-year growth, we're encouraged by 4.4% compensation per occupied room or ComPOR growth in U.S. Particularly noteworthy was 30 basis points of sequential ComPOR growth, which is the best we have seen in the last five years. Though, we have not and will not provide monthly results, in anticipation of questions, I want to point out that we did not experience sequential decline in NOI or occupancy on an intra-quarter basis. Occupancy continued to build through September following normal seasonal patterns. Our U.K. business continues to perform as expected. Although same-store portfolio growth moderated, as we discussed last call, our overall U.K. SHOP NOI growth was close to double-digit. Canadian SHOP portfolio is still trying to find the bottom. This quarter we have been impacted particularly by new deliveries in Quebec. We're cautiously optimistic about our Canadian portfolio in 2020 from a growth standpoint. Our U.S. portfolio shined through all the rhetoric around supply and labor cost inflation with 4.3% NOI growth in the quarter. We continue to see significant outperformance of assisted living relative to independent living and the gap widened to a multi-year high. Top markets had a particularly strong quarter primarily driven by solid pricing power. Washington DC, Seattle, Chicago, San Diego, all experienced double-digit NOI growth this quarter. Several of our operating partners contributed to this industry-leading growth and I want to thank them on behalf of our shareholders. As we have said repeatedly, we own the best assets in the best markets; however, the hallmark of our portfolio is our 25 best operating partners. The strong structural alignment between us and our partners is especially important when the industry fundamentals are not necessarily lifting all the boards. To paraphrase Warren Buffett, in these times of low tide, you get to know more about other people swim suits. To continue the team of operating partners, we are delighted to inform you that we have initiated a RIDEA relationship with New England based highly-reputed operator LCB Senior Living. We bought one asset together and transitioned two former Brookdale properties to LCB. We have strong growth plans for this relationship. As such, we have negotiated - fully negotiated a RIDEA 3.0 management contract and aligned development contract with LCB. This is our fifth new RIDEA relationship this year and we are very excited to welcome Mike Stoller and his team to Welltower family. In this quarter, we expanded our relationship with SRG by adding one asset in the San Francisco Bay Area for a pro rata investment of $35 million at a valuation of $360,000 per unit, which is a significant discount to the replacement cost in that market. While we have seen this kind of far unit pricing in Florida and Texas, recently by other market participants, we're excited to achieve such remarkable pricing in the San Francisco Bay area. We are also delighted to inform you that we continue to grow with our existing operating partners such as Frontier and Oakmont. Subsequent to the quarter end, we have closed on two additional SHOP assets with Frontier for $39 million or $197,000 per unit which is also a significant discount to replacement cost. As a result of overbuilding in last few years we are starting to see more capital deployment opportunities in the Memory Care segment. We are also incredibly excited to grow with Oakmont in California. We signed a definitive agreement to buy six newly built Class A properties with approximately $297 million. The initial cap rate is in the low 5% range on the current NOI, as one of these assets, just opened in the third quarter of this year. We expect the yield will grow into the high 5% range as this assets stabilized over next 18 months. Oakmont will take 10% of the proceeds in OP units or Welltower stock at approximately $91 per share. We will continue to grow with Oakmont in California markets. Turning to our post-acute business, we significantly de-risked our enterprise this quarter by divesting a majority of our LTAC exposure. As part of this process, we sold our Vibra portfolio for $265 million. We're delighted to inform you that we have effectively manage through the Life Care reorg process and re-tenanted the building with two operators. We have lost approximately $2 million of annual rent as a part of the restructuring process, but we have improved coverage and credit that back these assets. Though income loss and high cap rate sale are dilutive in near-term, we have strengthened the quality of overall portfolio by minimizing the exposure to this property type. These experiences - this experience highlights the detailed discussion we provided on triple-net leases a few quarters ago. The key to value preservation is to have the right basis or price per unit, credit support, and alternative set of operators, while keeping the overall exposure to a manageable level. Both times we have given rent concession in case of Genesis previously and last year and now we did not have many or all of these boxes checked. However, we believe that today we're in a different position in both Senior Housing Triple-net and skilled nursing space after the many restructurings that we have done in time through last three years that Tom mentioned. We now have manageable exposure, low basis and our credit and the ability to turn to our operating platform to protect our shareholders. This point cannot be over-emphasized. Turning to our health systems business, we're pleased with the investment we made last year with our partner ProMedica Health. Since that time, the regulatory environment has turned more favorable and asset pricing has soared. We believe the outlook for total return or forward IRR has materially improved in the last 18 months since we announced the transaction. We have received multiple unsolicited offers for many assets in the last six months in that portfolio. Though we have no current desire to sell these assets in size, we are considering two specific deals. One, with one transaction for handful of assets, in which the buyer has gone hard on the deposit. These offers present evaluation in excess of $150,000 per bed versus our combined basis of roughly $57,000 per bed. The sheer magnitude of this price increase hopefully gives you a sense of what we think the total return looks like today versus when we made that investment. We own real estate at a very low basis with cash flow that has great support and term. Speaking of cash flow, when we set the range for this portfolio at $143 million versus pre-org rent of $474 million we did this precisely because we did not want to guess when the cash flow will turnaround. Though I will refrain from commenting on other people's opinion on our partners credit, I want to put things in perspective. ProMedica has a net debt of approximately $800 million with a revenue of $6.8 billion with billions of dollars of unencumbered assets on their balance sheet. One might argue that systems 20% ownership in our JV along with a reasonable market multiple to the home health and hospice business, the system would be able to pay off all of their outstanding debt. In the past, we have talked about $75 million or so of synergies when the transaction was announced. We believe roughly $46 million will be achieved this year. We are pleased with how the integration has gone so far and continue to anticipate the system will achieve significant synergies of above our target. We continue to believe this rental stream, which is roughly two times covered at HCR level will improve, as we look forward in the near to medium term. We also remind you that we have significant structural protection beyond HCR level coverage. However, instead of rehashing what we have said before, I'm delighted to inform you that our collective business case has only gotten better. HCR ManorCare leadership is engaged with several not-for-profit health systems to partner with to solve the need in this critical, but not easy to execute part of the healthcare continuum. We look forward to discussing many of this with you next year. For our outpatient medical business, same-store NOI growth of 1.4% was ahead of our budget, though in-quarter growth remains muted for reasons we described previously the leasing velocity has been brisk. Based on this leasing velocity, we believe this segment is prime for growth in 2020. We remain very active in the capital deployment side in this segment. In this quarter we closed 9 Class-A assets for $193 million and expanded our relationship with Novant, Summit Medical Group, Baylor Scott & White, and TriHealth. Summit and Novant are two prime examples of how we have replicated our relationship business model into medical office sector. Post quarter end, we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire 18 outpatient assets for $258 million, which will expand our relationship with several systems such a CommonSpirit, University of Texas Health, Henry Ford, and UPMC. This portfolio is approximately 98% leased, has remaining weighted average lease term of 8 years. The portfolio is owned by a private owner, which has directly negotiated the transaction with us instead of going to the market due to our reputation and certainty of close. This once again shows the power of our platform and how we can create significant value in a competitive industry through executing on completely off market transaction. We have a handful of other capital deployment opportunities in a similar off market fashion that we have been negotiating over last 9 to 12 months. In Q3, we have funded approximately $141 million of developments and an expected accretive yield of 8.1%, while we are encouraged by a robust cost and access to capital, we remain disciplined and will deploy capital only if we do - and do so on a long-term total return basis. To illustrate this point year-to-date, we have closed $2.95 billion of acquisitions at a blended 1-year yield of 5.5%. As described in our last earnings call, we expect many of this newly built assets to stabilize in next 12 to 24 months and consequently that 5.5% will grow above 6%. In addition, we announced today an additional $594 million of post quarter acquisition in a similar mid to high 5% cap rate range. And as Tom said, the year is not over yet. At the same time, we've sold $2.675 billion of assets this year at a cap rate of 6.2%, which includes $558 million of high cap rate post-acute transactions, which implies we have sold $2.1 billion of senior housing assets at a cap rate of 5.35% including benchmark disposition described last call which resulted into a $520 million gain. The operating environment and the market for all of our assets remain incredibly vibrant and we think thoughtful capital allocation can create significant alpha for our shareholders. We are focused on building new relationships with the best in class senior housing operators and health systems while realizing growth opportunities with these partners one asset at a time. With that, back to you, Tom. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks Shankh. Before we open up the line for questions, I wanted to say that when I stepped into this role in 2014, the company was known as the seniors housing relationship REIT. Admittedly, it took me a bit of time to realize that many of those relationships we're very one-sided, based on paying the most for an operator's real estate with few rights and they were clearly not in favor of Welltower and its shareholders. That is not who we are today. Welltower's platform people, real estate and healthcare knowledge, great operating partners, data and technology, access to capital and other capabilities provide us with a competitive advantage to drive growth from our current asset base as well as create new investment opportunities. We are optimistic about our future. Now Shelby, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Just first question around ProMedica, you mentioned the coverage of 2.15 is not necessarily comparable with the 1.8 that you originally outlined in the transaction. Assuming you can't give the comparable number, could you at least - could you give us a sense of what the original cash flow that you were underwritten or the decline in cash flow, which I think was about 10%. How is that cash flow trending today? Thomas DeRosa : Vikram, thank you for your question. As we said that our desire we want to respect our partner's desire to keep one metric that is consistent across both platforms. I'm happy to give you the cash flow that we have underwritten, we usually don't talk about our underwriting models on the call, but for once, I will give you that and hopefully this will stop this constant conversation on ProMedica, which hopefully you guys understand. We believe that a significant assets more than its liabilities is debt and how we think about the credit. But anyway, going back to your specific question. In 2018, if you look at the normalized EBITDAR from the continued operation, which is effectively is what we bought and what we own. The total EBITDAR was $316.156 million, I'm giving the numbers up to 3 decimal point, $316.156 million. So far this year, ProMedica has achieved $230.1 million of EBITDAR and we believe, we expect they will achieve at least $300 million of EBITDAR. You can calculate the difference, you can calculate the decline and come to your own conclusion, but that's how much I'm going to say about our underwriting model. Hopefully, that answers your question. Vikram Malhotra : And just then as a follow-up, not necessarily related, but on senior housing, pretty strong results in the U.S. again for the second quarter and you outlined the pricing power. Just to give us a sense of kind of how widespread the performance was and you have a lot of different operating partners, what was the range of your RevPOR growth across your operators and if you can even give us a sense of the range of NOI growth that will just be helpful to get a broader industry trend? Thomas DeRosa : Yes. So Vikram, it's - I'm not going to get into too much details on operator-by-operator, it's not a quarter-to-quarter 90-day business, but if you look at the pricing range, majority of the operators, we had couple of operators in the 1% range, but majority of the operators are between 2.5% and 4.5% range with couple of large operators have clocked 5.5% rate growth in U.S., which is remarkable. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Sakwa of Evercore. Steve Sakwa : Tim, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on the 75 assets that are in transition within Senior Housing. I know in the Investor Day, you sort of outlined a $29 million kind of maybe upside from the assets and transition, but I think that pool has changed since December. So can you just help us frame out sort of the size of that drag this year and just maybe how we can think about that improving moving forward. Tim McHugh : Yes. Thanks, Steve, so you're correct at the Investor Day, we outlined the transition bucket mainly that point just being Brookdale. So in addition to that, we transitioned a number of assets from Silverado to Frontier in the second quarter of this year. That number from $29 million has incrementally grown and with that, we will update that year-end as we give 2020 guidance. I'm looking across the portfolio. But it's fair to say that year-to-date, they've had a negative impact on our FFO. But as I said in my comments prior to the beginning of the call, we remain very confident particularly with some of the early results from Frontier that these assets will be very accretive to our 2020 cash flow and beyond. Steve Sakwa : And as a I guess a follow-up maybe Shankh or Tom, can you maybe just talk about sort of the information flow that you get from your operators on a kind of daily, weekly, monthly basis and maybe how that's changed over time. Shankh Mitra : So Steve, as you know that we have a significant focused on data and data flow and then analytics on top of the data flow that's sort of what the core of this organization is along with our focus on healthcare knowledge and how that sort of impacts the physical real estate in the setting around it. So we have a tremendous obviously focus, we have real-time information on how things are flowing. I mean on so if it - when I say real time, I mean we have weekly view of occupancy, NOI, expenses how sort of that's flowing and we're in a constant dialogue with our operators and how we act on it with our asset managers with our investment people with the dynamics people, it is a very collaborative process between us and our operators and we continue to refine and improve on the process every day. Tim McHugh : Steve, the thing I would add to that is really fundamental to the way we run this business is to have boots on the ground in the significant market. So we have a very strong team based on the West Coast. We have a strong team in New York, we have a strong team in Toledo, we have a strong team in Toronto, we have a strong team in London. By having boots on the ground, we not only just looking at spreadsheets, but we are in the buildings, we are at the operators offices. We are all over this portfolio because we are trying to as much as we can anticipate opportunities or anticipate problems and try and work with the operator to mitigate those issues or expand upon the opportunities and that's just a unique aspect of how we run this business. I don't think you can sit in an office on one side of the country and have any idea about what's going on in a portfolio that's in the West Coast and it's the same thing with our medical office business. Keith, we have 14 offices - 14 offices around the U.S. and we lever those offices. I think you're going to start to see even more leverage between the folks that are located in those 14 offices even interacting with our folks who are on the senior housing side. So again, I can't stress enough that if you're going to be in a business like this and take the risk to get the opportunities that are there in the senior housing space, you have to have boots on the ground, you have to have a physical presence. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : First off, congrats Tim on the new role and John on his other opportunity. Just going to SHOP. When do you expect the negative supply impact in Quebec to bottom and stop weighing on occupancy? Thomas DeRosa : Well, Jonathan, I'm not going to get into this call and be specific about what's happening in Quebec and what that's going to sort of will be behind us. As I said that we're cautiously optimistic that our Canadian portfolio will return to growth next year, but we'll see how that plays out. There is a lot of new competition, a lot of new buildings in Quebec. Some of our buildings that have performed for 15 years had consistently and through that whole time had and looks great have great product to sell, but has been impacted. It's just - the market needs to get absorbed and when it does like any other market, a great market over a period of time, it will come back, but overall as a portfolio which we manage and we have a fantastic team in Canada, and with a remarkably strong leadership there, we think that we will expect the portfolio will return to growth hopefully next year. Jonathan Hughes : And then just one more for me and a bit higher level. How discussions with perspective SHOP operators gone since roll out of RIDEA 3.0. I know you signed up five new operators this year, but have some perspective operators that they don't want to be subject to potentially losing their properties like one of your West Coast operators this past summer, just any color you can share there would be great. Thomas DeRosa : So, Jonathan if you think about it. As you can see that we have plenty of strong operating partners to do business with and many of them or probably all of them attracted to our platform, because of our strong capabilities, both on our data side as well as on a health care capabilities. And if you look at who these people are, and you will see the list of capital partners that have worked with. They have absolutely no issues with getting money into their building, that's not the issue. They have come to us for the specific capabilities that we have that you will not find in any other place. Having said that, if an operator doesn't want to take the bet on themselves about and doesn't have the confidence to do so from an operating capability perspective, then I guess that's a very good tool to figure out, and the very front-end who you should not do business with. We have plenty of people to do business and at the end of the day that tool will help us and is helping us from an adverse selection perspective, if you will. Tim McHugh : The next generation of senior housing operators. Those who see the model changing in the future want to be with Welltower. That is who we see are requesting meetings. I think that if you're just interested in monetizing your real estate, you're not - we don't want you and you don't want to us, because we're going to be all over year, we're going to make your life miserable. So, but those who see that there is another iteration in this business that the senior housing business of the past and in some cases the current is not the senior housing business of the future. The people that are aligned with us about where we're headed, where the future is going to be for this asset class want to work with Welltower. Operator : Your next question comes from Nick Yulico, Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : First question on senior housing operating segment. I realize it's not the same pool this year as it was a year ago for the total portfolio. But you had occupancy down 90 basis points in the total portfolio same-store was better, down 40 basis points. Can you just explain what is driving some of that difference? Shankh Mitra : What you are seeing on total portfolio is the transition assets Nick and that sort of time Tim talked about, how we think those transition assets will play out and they are going through that particular phase. So there is not much to add other than the fact that when you change an operator, as you know and I know and everybody in this business knows that you have a significant disruption at the building level we only change, we only keep assets out of the pool when there is a change of operator not when there's a change of structure such as triple-net assets become RIDEA. So that's what you are seeing. Thomas DeRosa : Nick, I would just add that the benchmark portfolio that we sold during the quarters in all prior quarters and that was a above 90% occupied portfolios that brought up prior quarters occupancy relative to current. Shankh Mitra : And obviously as you know, that is a very significant portfolio. So that will drag your overall occupancy to up significantly. Nick Yulico : And then, you talked - Shankh, you talked about the $150,000 per bed offer for some of the ProMedica assets was that for the assisted living assets. Shankh Mitra : No. That was for skilled nursing assets. Nick Yulico : And then just one last question, you do have from master lease, you have this investment grade covenant annual lease with ProMedica, essentially it's that ProMedica cannot be rated less than investment grade by 2 ratings agencies, you now have one that has gotten closer to non-investment grade, not yet there. I guess I'm just wondering, you just remind us why you have that provision in the lease and if there is a scenario, where you got those downgrades over the next year or so, how would that work in enforcing the provisions of the lease? Thomas DeRosa : So, Nick. Let me answer that. First of all, we really cannot comment about the opinion of the rating agencies, but credit rating agencies are there to assess credit risk. So with respect to our joint venture, the first point is we own real estate at a low basis with good lease coverage and you've heard us say that throughout the call this morning. The JV provides us with right that enhance our credit risk and you've heard us talk about that. And behind that stands a large non-profit health system that has $6.8 billion in revenue who is the leading health system in Northwest Ohio. They have $800 million in net debt and they've got $1.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet. So we feel good about the position that we're in and I think we've given a lot of metrics that support why we feel good about this investment. Shankh Mitra : And I'll just add, Nick, if you think about it, that's our option, that's not an automatic trigger and also our partner has cure rights. Right. So this is not - I don't want you to think this is like an algorithmic trade that they get to a level for whatever reason, and then it's an automatic sort of action on our side. So that's not how the real world works. So it's an option that we kept to protect our shareholders. However, as we - as we told you that we think we know how the asset create risk and we feel comfortable that where our assets are. And as I said, I cannot overemphasize we feel the total return or IRR of that investment as it stands today is significantly higher than when we underwrite that. So hopefully that sort of gives you an answer, but ProMedica does have cure rights. Thomas DeRosa : But one other thing, I just want to add. Nick, essentially we have the right to bring them to the table. As Shankh said, it's not a gunpoint at their head, this - there is a structure around this investment that brings us to the table to work together to solve whatever bumps in the road may occur over a very long period investment. Historically, REIT set in positions where the operator could you show them the hand and where you have no ability to sit down at a table and work out a rational solution. I mean, we have no idea what the world is going to look like in 10 years or 15 years or in 20 years, but if you have a construct that aligns both the operator with the capital provider and allows you to sit down and make rational business decisions. I think that puts us in such an advantageous position. So again, we feel very good about this investment. Operator : Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : So I just wanted to follow up on the overall same-store portfolio guidance and basically just compare where you are year-to-date now, I know you don't give segment level updates, but you are raising the guidance for the full year. And so my question is in the context of that. Your same-store SHOW or show, same-store performance for the year I think you said Shankh was 3% on a year-to-date basis, and I'm looking at your triple-net performance over the course of the year, as Senior Housing Triple-net portfolio 4% in 1Q, 3.7%, 3.4% very good performance but also markedly above 3%, so now we've get 70% of your same-store portfolio coming in at 3% or better year-to-date, how do we get to the 2.5%? Shankh Mitra : Jordan, we're not going to give you quarter-to-quarter guidance. This is not a 90-day business as we have said several times. All I will tell you, you can come to mathematically any amount of - any number of conclusion you want to but as we said, we feel very good about the year. We thought we have a pretty good handle on the business, turns out business is better than what we thought, both in our medical office business as well as our senior housing operating business, right. And we think next year is going to be a good year. But it is - I'm just not going to get into right now on this call, what next year looks like if that's what you're trying to\u2026 Jordan Sadler : No. I don't even mean about next year. I'm really just - I guess what I'm commenting on Shankh. I don't want you to miss my point. Tim said that the MOB business is going to accelerate from 3Q to 4Q. Shankh Mitra : You're talking about fourth quarter. Jordan Sadler : Yes. I'm just talking about fourth quarter and guidance updated for the year is basically inferring that 4Q same-store is going to be very low. Shankh Mitra : And as I said, Jordan, you can infer what do you want to infer, we're not going to get into quarter-to-quarter numbers, but we'll tell you, we want you to think about this business beyond 90 days. There is seasonality of revenue and there is seasonality of expenses, right. And those seasonalities don't come together. So as you think about that, just think about the business and Tim will explain you the numbers, but just think about the business, you will get to the right answer. If you look at any 90 days, good or bad, you're going to get to the wrong conclusion. Tim? Tim McHugh : Yes. I just wanted to add Jordan that we part of - there will be an addition of our health system bucket to the same-store pool in the fourth quarter as well. If you remember that lease was 1.375% for the first year. So that caused a bit of mixed change in the 4 billion in 4Q. Jordan Sadler : And then just a follow-up, the strength that you guys saw in the Brandywine portfolio sequentially and year-over-year to your point Shankh, I know this was a portfolio, you called out, I think, a few quarters ago struggling with sort of some occupancy issues post flu and then some operating or personnel issues. Can you maybe just speak to the significant upswing that it saw sequentially and year-over-year, just anecdotally. Shankh Mitra : So, Jordan if you remember the first part right, which is we talked about the flu in the New York area particularly Long Island and Northern New Jersey, Brandywine has a very stable leadership and it has - we have never mentioned that it's a personal issue, Brandywine had a capital structure sort of reorganization that was needed and we thought the much better aligned relationship with the RIDEA 3.0 management contract with significant skin in the game from Brandywine. Brandywine is one of the best senior housing operators that's out there. It has beautiful real estate. As we said that it is the best real estate, we have from an NOI per door perspective and Brandywine leadership is really committed to perform and that's what you are seeing in the marketplace today and in our numbers. So I don't have much to add, I don't want you to think that our numbers were just driven by Brandywine, several of our operators six to be specific, have driven massive outperformance. Brandywine is obviously one of them and we're extremely delighted, how much focus that Brandywine leadership team has put to drive performance and we think there is a significant additional upside to that portfolio, which is one of our best real estate we own with one of our best operator in the business. Jordan Sadler : Lastly, can you maybe just comment on sort of what the acquisition or investment pipeline looks like for you guys obviously, you've had a pretty busy year so far, but it seems like you've got your sites and some other stuff, just interested in sort of what the flavor, looks like that's coming down the pipe. Tim McHugh : Jordan, we're seeing real opportunities both in the senior housing space as well as in the medical office space. So I would just say stay tuned. Operator : Your next question comes from John Kim of BMO Capital Markets. John Kim : Shankh, you mentioned on the prepared remarks the failure of the Vibra LTAC portfolio. Can you discuss what the cap rate was on the sale and also how much LTAC NOI you have remaining? Shankh Mitra : So I want you to think about that as a 10% range double-digit cap rate. And Tim, how much is our LTAC remaining? Tim McHugh : We'll have roughly $18 million of run rate LTAC or some non-SNF post-acute rent going forward. Shankh Mitra : Which includes LTACs and ARFs, right. Okay. Thank you. John Kim : Is your intention to sell the remaining soon or\u2026 Shankh Mitra : It's hard to say John, as you know that we are seller of every asset at a price, we feel that now the portfolio operator and the credit has stabilized. We taken pain as I mentioned that we have given, obviously $2 million of rent concession, not technically a rent concession, but lower rent in the new construct versus the old construct, we feel pretty decent about it, but every asset that we own is or sell at a price, so we'll see how that plays out. John Kim : Similar question on your total SHOP portfolio approximately 78% of your revenue is in the same-store pool and that's due to transitions and assets held for sale, is this figure roughly a good run rate going forward or do you see it potentially riding for the same-store pool and captures more of the total SHOP? Tim McHugh : Yes. John, it's Tim. I gave some of this color in the call, but we expect the transition portfolio which is 75 assets for virtually all of it to be in the same-store pool about fourth quarter of next year and actually 46 to 75 assets to be in the pool, about the second quarter. So you should see when we gave - Steve asked question earlier, just around updating our outlook that we gave at our Investor Day last year around the Brookdale transitions and correctly pointed out that that pool has grown from when we gave that initial color and you should expect when we give our guidance next quarter, we'll give color around how those 75 assets will impact the pool if they enter throughout the year, but we expect to be back to where we've been historically, which has kind of 90% plus of our same-store pool captured in that. Operator : Your next question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Michael Bilerman : It's Michael Bilerman with Nick. Tim, maybe sticking with same-store, I think most people know that you have a different definition in your SEC 10-Q and K's than you do in the supplemental. And I wanted to know whether you are going to give any thought to providing a road map, either in the supplemental or in the 10-Q about the differentials in terms of getting from point A to point B and I recognize that your supplemental is pro rata ownership, constant currency, which reflects more of your economics, but there is a difference between how long the assets are in your pool, longer in the queue and quicker in the south. And so I'm wondering if you're able to provide that reconciliation for investors, so they can understand the impacts of each of the differences between your SEC Q's and K's in your supplemental. Tim McHugh : Yes. So thank you, Michael. I think the way Nick has been doing great work on this and I've been talking to him quarter-to-quarter, you're correct to point out, given our, both our international ownership and the fact that virtually every one of our senior housing relationships has a joint venture component to it, there is a big difference that we met fully consolidated number in the pro rata number and our intent to the supplement, is to give the absolute best reflection of the economic impact or performance of these assets to Welltower at our share. Two notes just on kind of how that's evolving, one is we are adding the disclosure, you will see in our Q, when we file it of both our year-to-date and five-quarter pool. So we'll have a pool in the queue that will closely reflect from just - from an asset perspective our supplement pool and that's largely in response to feedback we've gotten from yourself and others just on tying these closer and my comments earlier on the transition that should also help kind of tie these pools together over the next year. They should come together, but absolutely, we'll continue to work to disclose that information to give that to Nick on a quarterly basis and if need be, we absolutely can kind of walk that from one of the other. Again, we think that gap closes and a lot of it's temporary over the last years, we've been pretty active on the asset management front. Michael Bilerman : And then Tom, at the beginning of the call, you talked about how you've dramatically changed your senior housing portfolio and gotten a lot out of Genesis and Brookdale and health lease and that cap structures are misguided, operating agreements are misguided, private equity and I think you also mentioned just repaid, where you or at least Health Care REIT had paid too much for real estate. You came into the CEO seat in April or early 2014, you had been on the Board for 10 years prior to that, so I sort of wanted to get inside your head about those 10 years being on the Board, and I guess getting information and approving a lot of those deals as a Board member how much information you were given to then come in and sort of restructure everything after the fact. Thomas DeRosa : Yes. Good question. A Board - sitting on a Board, you're only as good as the information that is either publicly disclosed or provided to you by the management team and there is the role of Director, Michael, is not to run the company. It is there to protect the shareholder and your principal responsibility is corporate governance and to make sure that the right systems are in place at the company to protect the shareholder. It's very different when you cross the line to be part of management and you see things very differently. And I don't think you'd get a very different answer from anyone who transitioned from a Board seat to an operating role, and as I said earlier, it took some time to figure that out. And at the same time, I had a different view of what this business this company should be and I did not see us as a asset aggregator. And that was the strategy beforehand, when I asked the management team, what business are we in, they said we do deals and when you do deals, some of your deals are going to be good and I don't want to say that some of the deals, weren't good, but many of them were not good and again, the information you get as a Director is different than the information you see - sometimes, not in all cases - I'm not saying that about every company, but I will tell you I saw different things once I was inside the company, you have a very different look and a company structured as a Health Care REIT, for example should not be making private equity investments. That is not our business and when you are paying, when you are seeing yourself as doing deals and your strategy is to show up at auctions and win the deals, you can wind up paying too much and you don't have the opportunity to insert the kind of rights that we know are important to a sustainable business model. So yes, the view from the Boardroom in this case was very different from the view once I was sitting in the seat. Michael Bilerman : Has that changed with your Board today in terms of the information you're providing them or more so the questions that they're asking of you, because I would assume sitting in the Boardroom for 10 years before you were CEO, you could've questioned all of these things and asked for more information to be able to understand what the company was doing. Thomas DeRosa : Again, it's always only as good as the information you're provided beyond the publicly available information and does my Board ask difficult questions, do they put high hurdles to achieve, yes, they do because I work at their pleasure, they can hire me, they have the right to hire me and they have the right to fire me. So the Board has turned over quite significantly here. We have a Board, whose skill sets represent the many verticals that are important from a corporate governance standpoint to sit on the Board of a company like Welltower, so there are people that represent the Health Care industry, there are people that represent the real estate industry, there are people that represent the insurance industry. These are all verticals that allow them to provide a level of oversight and guidance from a Board table, but they are not here to run the company. Directors do not run the business nor should they. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Anderson of SMBC. Rich Anderson : So, Tom, I appreciate you are not in a position to or have any interest in commenting on other people's opinions, but with regard to the Moody's recent downgrade, the language is quite, let's call it interesting, and I have a comment and my comment is there are some complexities associated with the structure with ProMedica namely the JV and how that's all situated into the economics of the transaction. Is there an interpretation issue, potentially when you juxtapose Moody's to the other two rating agencies that is impacting this viewpoint or is that something you don't also want to comment on? Thomas DeRosa : Yes. It's hard for me to comment on that, Rich, but I'd say that we may not agree with interpretations on some of the intricacies of the joint venture structure. So it's - again, it's difficult to be in a position, they also rate our company. So it's difficult to be in - to really start critiquing too much here. I'd prefer not to do that. Shankh, do you want to add anything to that? Shankh Mitra : I'll just add, you can have different opinions on what things are right and how you calculate them. So I'll give you an example, if I were to calculate cash margin of a place, I would do at a place like ProMedica. This is my opinion, not necessarily that is the right opinion, it's just a different opinion. I would only do 80% of the rent, not 100% of the rent because ProMedica pays only 80% of the rent and for cash margin, I will do cash rent not the GAAP rent, which you know can be significantly different, given the 15-year lease with the 2.75% escalator, right. So that will be a massive difference of what the cash margin will look like if it just make those two differences, is that a difference of opinion, difference of interpretation, I'll leave that to your opinion. But from our perspective, as we said, we feel very good about the investment, we think that return prospects have gotten better.  The regulatory prospects have gotten better and to put things in perspective, this is an organization, which is an extremely important organization for this part of the country at $6.8 billion of revenue and $800 million of net debt. I hope that put things in perspective. Rich Anderson : And then second, unrelated follow-up, when you talked about the asset sales that you've done in the past, and I know that you guys are - in meetings that we've had together, aligning yourselves with your operators more, increasingly at the NOI level so that they're also incentivized to control costs. To what degree would you be willing to part ways with real estate that you love? But otherwise, the operator has an unwillingness to kind of go this way and to sort of you have a stake in the game in terms of the cost side of the equation, have you sold assets simply because - not because you're in like the real estate, but because you didn't like the unwillingness of the operator to kind of go your way. Thomas DeRosa : So let me answer that because we've sold portfolios associated with operator relationships, you should assume there has been real estate inside those portfolios that we would have otherwise loved to hold on to, but that was not an option. So in those portfolio sales, but I will answer the other question that if we had an operator with real estate that we loved, who was not willing to align with us around a construct that, as we've described, and only saw us as someone who could pay the most for their real estate, it's very likely we would part ways, we would not be - we would not be afraid to part ways because generally in markets around the country there are very attractive markets, we have more than one operator and so people might have thought we were exiting New England, when we exited Benchmark, but actually what we did is we aligned ourselves with a premium operator who is in the right markets in New England and we're hoping that we're going to have to growing business with LCB. We see them as the premium operator in the market and who is also much more Boston. So that's an example, sometime - we're really, it's not - it's not a black and white decision and sometimes we are giving up good real estate, and we're not afraid to give up good real estate obviously at a price too. If we can sell - there is up hot market for high quality senior housing assets today and if they're not strategic for us, we pretty likely can redeploy that capital with a more strategic operator in a more strategic construct. Shankh Mitra : I'll just add one thing Rich to a pretty comprehensive answer Tom gave you, I don't want you to think that this is some sort of a - this construct only favorable to Welltower. There is a reason that we say the alignment thousand times, it helps our operators to make significantly more money than they otherwise do from other capital partner. There is no one in this business at least to my knowledge, who pays more to their operators than Welltower. All we are trying to do is very simply, we rise together, we fall together. Our operators who perform have a significant opportunity to economically gain significantly more than what a standard operating agreement would be and thus that helps them to get better people and that obviously produce better results. So it's a circular reference, if you will, but it's a virtuous cycle and not everybody will agree to that, but I don't want you to think some sort of this connotation as I hear this question, it feels like we just sort of have something that's only favorable to Welltower shareholders and it's sort of something against our operating partners, that cannot be farther from the truth. Alignment is not a one-sided relationship, whether that's to the operator or to the capital partners, it is very simply that you rise together and you fall together and many of our operators, who are confident in the ability to run this business over long-term are more than happy to do that and they can get paid significantly more, they are getting paid significantly more and the leadership of this organization are hiring the best people to deploy that capital and attract the best talent into their organization and hopefully, that sort of gives you a sense of how we do it. We cut it so many ways, we have talked to you, so that this flows through the economy flows to the very bottom of this community, not just the leadership of this operating partners, but also people who are providing the services who our customers are seeing on a daily basis. Rich Anderson : I wasn't implying that it was a one-way street, but I appreciate the color. Thanks. Thomas DeRosa : Thanks, Rich. Operator : Your next question comes from Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Lukas Hartwich : Can you guys provide some specifics about how your SHOP operators are outperforming their competitive sets? Shankh Mitra : I mean, I'm not sure what exactly that means, you can - you probably have your own view of what the market is doing and whether that's rates are NOI or revenue or and then you compare our results to that, I'm not exactly sure I understand. Lukas Hartwich : I guess I'm trying to gauge how much is supply, an easier supply comp versus other factors? Thomas DeRosa : You know, Lukas, one of the things I think we got in front of a while ago was labor cost. This is something we have been talking with our operators about for now years and I often think senior housing results are often too associated with NIC data and the supply issues. I actually think not enough attention is focused on the operating expense side, and I would say it - again, I can't speak to our competitive set, I can speak to our operators. I think we are on top of operating expenses including labor costs, what's happened senior housing is many operators have taken higher and higher acuity residents, in which they are not really staffed to manage that has led to often shorter length of stays and higher expenses because the operators need to hire more people, sometimes contract labors to manage that senses and that's something we are very on top of. So again, can't speak for folks that are not in the Welltower portfolio, other than the elements that we've spoken to like location and operator quality, I think the expense side is something we've just been focused on a long time and I think that answers some of that. Tim McHugh : I'll just add Lukas. If you - you have been at our Investor Day and we have shared with you, what's our sense in our data analytics presentation, what's your view of our adjusted competition unit and year-to-open SHOP looks like, which is a cumulative impact of supply over the years. And obviously, we got less impact this year than last year, but also the results you are seeing is a result of hard work of our operators and our people who are working with the operators, we're partners and the alignment is important because we come together on the table, not as the operator against capital or capital against operator, but just true partner to solve problems. As Tom alluded to that, when we discussed ProMedica, it's no different in our business in senior housing business, in medical office business and that's why probably you are seeing, but there's just no doubt that we have, we feel like we have the best assets in the best market and the best operating platform that helps you to create more value than some of the individual assets would. Lukas Hartwich : And I know it's really small, but can you talk about the 4-6 cap rate on the SHOP acquisitions, are those unstabilized or just really high quality, can - any color on that? Thomas DeRosa : They are unstabilized, both of the senior housing operating assets that we bought particularly talked about whether it's LCB or SRG, they are unstabilized properties in the turnaround situation. So it is - it is very difficult to talk about cap rates when you don't have a lot of cash flow to cap, which is why we specifically talked about and we think it's the best way to look at it for on stabilized properties to look from the perspective of price per unit. As I said, you can sort of convince yourself what a cap rate is, whether it's stabilized, non-stabilized, future, today, next year, what you can't is price per unit, and that's the way to look at and we believe in all of those cases, we have bought these assets at a significant discount to replacement cost. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Carroll of RBC Capital. Michael Carroll : Shankh, thanks for your comments earlier about the senior housing operating environment. Can you probably add some color on what's the overall competitive set, are operators being more competitive on price in some of your markets in an effort to gain share or is that something that you're not seeing within your portfolio? Shankh Mitra : Of course, Michael, thank you for your question. If we were to see that Mike, then we would not be talking about close to 3.5% pricing increase, right. So we are not seeing that, is there a difference in different markets, yes. We've talked about how our U.S. major markets has a remarkably strong quarter, that would translate obviously some of the smaller market hasn't done so well and that's what you want to portfolio for, you can go back and look at four quarters or five quarters ago, I talked about the difference between the large markets and the small markets were surprisingly not wide enough. Different times, different portfolio, different parts of the portfolio work, but as you know our portfolio is very much weighted towards this large high, very high barriers to entry market and they're performing very well. We have strong pricing power. I don't want you to think that we are here, we have a favorite sort of a statistic in a week and today that's pricing, tomorrow that's occupancy, the day after that it's labor cost. We're trying to optimize all those three variables pricing, occupancy, and labor cost. And as Tom alluded to, sometimes it's easy to understand the dynamic between pricing and occupancy, but not so much between those two versus the labor cost and we're trying to optimize the three and hopefully you agree that so far we have been successful. Michael Carroll : Yes. And then, I think you made in your prepared remark comments that you had really strong growth in what DC, Seattle, Chicago, San Diego, due to strong pricing power. Can you talk a little bit or add some color on that, where does that pricing power come from, is that on your ability to push rate on your existing residents, is it pushing, gaining better spreads on new residents, where is the pricing power coming from? Shankh Mitra : In those specific markets, I specifically talked about, close to a double-digit growth that comes from existing residents, new resident, and obviously controlling expenses as far as you can. So in specifically those markets, you had all the levers playing out. But generally speaking, to get to an average close to a 3.5% pricing, you got to do both. You got to put street pricing as well as existing residents as well. And just to remind you Michael, the reason you don't see almost just thumb rule half of our portfolio is in January 1st and half of our portfolio is in sort of when you have the, sort of the anniversary, that's when we sent pricing and this is a constant conversation, our operators are very focused on it and they're getting results. Operator : Your next question comes from Chad Vanacore of Stifel. Unidentified Analyst : This is Tom for Chad. So my first question is a follow-up on senior - senior housing. So Shankh, you mentioned that SHOP occupancy actually expanded intra-quarter, what is the magnitude of the pick-up you see at the quarter end and also, this quarter you broke three-quarter streak on year-on-year occupancy gains, so understanding one data point is not a trend, do you see a return to year-on-year growth for the same-store pool in 4Q. Shankh Mitra : [Technical Difficulty] because it's a really good number to talk about, but that's sets the precedence. I don't want to talk about monthly performance. It is very difficult for us to even talk about 90-day performance, I think I say that on a - like a broken record, I don't want to start the precedence of talking about the monthly number, but as I can tell you, we have seen the normal seasonality play out and we have build occupancy through the month of September. Having said that, just remember, we're not trying to build occupancy, we're trying to drive bottom line results, which is a function of pricing, occupancy, and labor cost primarily. Unidentified Analyst : [Technical Difficulty] quarter up by 1.4%. Are there any seasonal trends that you're seeing with the increase in expenses this quarter? Shankh Mitra : Can you hear us? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, we can. Shankh Mitra : Can you repeat the question again. I think there's something happened to the phone system. Can you repeat the question again. Unidentified Analyst : Sure. Your MOB same-store NOI grew 1.4% this quarter, that kind of accelerating from the prior quarters, are there anything seasonal, which maybe sequential changed any expenses? Shankh Mitra : What happened is if - you have to look at the occupancy to get the answers. We had a lot of leasing and what happened is you are in free rent burn off situations period and as Tim mentioned, specifically, if you go back to his part of the script, you will see that we expect as the cash rent starts coming in - we'll return to the normalized growth in this business. So there is nothing specific other than, obviously you have the, when you have a lot of leasing and you have - you have to give the time to the tenants to build out the space that sort of flowing through the numbers, but not the cash front. So that's sort of what you're seeing and you can see that in the sequential occupancy growth. Unidentified Analyst : Just lastly, quickly, could you remind us again the size and timing of the two potential ProMedica deals you just talked about? Shankh Mitra : No, I wouldn't. As we said, real estate transactions take a long time, right. I sort of indicated to you where we are and as things play out. Well, obviously, I said that one of those transactions, the deposits are hard at this point. They will play out. Unfortunately, real estate transaction is painfully slow because it takes a lot to do it. We have a lot of extraordinary professionals who are doing it and we will tell you, we'll give you the update when they close. But we are excited about it. Just know that every asset we have is on sale at a price, and we are interested in that particular price at this specific time. Operator : Your next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : Just curious to learn more about your CareMore Health partnerships. How did that come about, what are your goals with partnership and is this something you can expand across your portfolio? Thomas DeRosa : Good question. It comes back to a view that there is another level of value that can be delivered in the types of settings that are built to manage the needs of frail to demanded seniors. So let's start there. Me, personally, and other members of the team have spent a lot of time, meeting with players across the healthcare continuum, including payers. So this has been an evolutionary process to work with one particular payer that has a clinical enterprise associated with it, who agreed that our settings could enable them to deliver services to our population that would be mutually beneficial both to Welltower as well as the payer. So this has been a process. We are already expanding this model across our portfolio. And I'll ask Mark Shaver, who joined us now, almost two years ago from Johns Hopkins, who's - he and his team have been on the ground working not only with CareMore but also with our senior housing operators here. Mark. Mark Shaver : So as we announced publicly about two months ago, we integrated CareMore and Anthem's I-SNP net plan into our L.A. and Orange County seniors housing communities with Belmont village and SRG. And that continues to go well. And as Tom has mentioned many times, we continue to want to make our sites of care more consequential and linked to care delivery. So that pilots up and running to two months in, a lot of good progress. Starting in 2020, we're expanding to two other major metro markets in the Southwest and adding and growing our operator pool to four in this specific partnership. This is one of several strategies we have to work with payers and provider sponsored plans, which are the health system enabled health plan. So more to come here, but very good progress early on. Thomas DeRosa : And at the end of the day, from our perspective, it makes the real estate more valuable. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Steven Valiquette : So, I was originally going to ask a high-level question around 2020. But I think based on one of Shankh's answers earlier, I'm going to go hold off on that. And maybe just to shift gears here a little bit, I don't think anybody touched on this really in detail yet, but \u2013 and one of your major peers last week talked about some major differences and performance in assisted living versus independent living properties. And the peer last week suggest that they're seeing pressure in AL from new supply. But that their IL portfolio was still doing okay. Last quarter, you guys mentioned Welltower was experiencing the opposite with significant outperformance in AL versus IL. It\u2019s really the question is for us just to confirm that that you guys saw that same trend in 3Q that occurred in 2Q, I'm assuming so. But more importantly, just any additional color you can provide on your better performance in AL versus IL? Shankh Mitra : We are, I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. We are seeing significant outperformance of AL and memory care segment relative to IL. And that gap has reached a multi-year high this quarter. Again, this is not a quarter-to-quarter business. I don't want you to take some portion of the statistic from one quarter and think about the others in a different quarter. But that's a consistent trend we have seen. I believe I mentioned that for last four quarters. And we saw that gap continued in favor of our assisted living portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Looks like you have about $600 million of SHOP development underway. Can you talk about what sort of timeframe you underwrite for the properties to stabilize in? And has that changed over the past couple of years? John Goodey : Mike, it just hasn't changed from an underwriting or from the yield perspective. Timing hasn't changed much. We have a lot of assets in that pool and we believe that you will see majority of them will get delivered between 2020 and 2021. And Tim has walked you through what that cash flow impact is on our Investor Day. So you can look at the slides and look at the impact. I can tell you that the other aspect of the development platform is about 750,000 square feet medical office. That's eight assets. And all but one will get delivered between now and end of next year. As obviously, all of those assets are leased. So you will get also, from a run rate perspective, second half of 2020 and going into 2021, you will get good growth there as well. So you will have the deliveries of senior housing assets when they get delivered. Obviously, you are going through the lease up that's dilutive to the nature, just how the business works because of lease up losses. On the other hand, medical office, they're leased and they will get delivered and you can figure out how those interact with each other. Michael Mueller : And 2020 is obviously a chunk year with about $800 million of deliveries. If we're thinking out over the next three years to five years or so, I mean, what are you thinking about for an a average annual pace of development investment? Tim McHugh : Michael, we've been averaging kind of $300 million in deliveries over the past four or five years. As the enterprise has grown, we have a little bit more capacity on the balance sheet side to support development as a complement to our normal acquisition activity. So I think what you're seeing now is that probably move towards more of a $500 million annual delivery pace next year. You're correct to point out, it's a little more front-weighted. But you should expect that to normalize more than $500 million range. Operator : Your next question comes from Daniel Bernstein of Capital One. Daniel Bernstein : I know you had a very good performance this quarter in your particular portfolio. But from an industry perspective, want to just think about if you're seeing any additional pressures from rate or occupancy out there? And particular, if you look at the merchant builders, they're two or three years into a lease up there. They're probably not able to refinance throughout the end of that lifeline and the construction loan. Are you seeing any additional industry pressures from those merchant builders and maybe are those the opportunities that you're seeing on the acquisition side as well? Shankh Mitra : We can only speak for our portfolio. It's hard to speak about the industry in general. We are always extremely focused on our portfolio. And, kind of, that's the answer you would expect from us, given how far our knowledge sort of goes. And we are not seeing significant pressure from any one of these industry participants that you mentioned. In general, I would say that some of the earlier over development that we have seen, I mentioned couple of quarters ago that we're seeing emergence of opportunities in Texas that sort of one of the first place that had the over building. I mentioned this quarter you are starting to see that in the memory care segment. So obviously you are picking up that point. But remember, we are very focused on something very simple : Is this an asset that is well built, has great bonds? Can we get a great operator to run it, to create long-term future value? And is that at the right basis, right? We're not focused on what the initial cap rate looks like. We're focused on what the right basis and long-term returns looks like. We're starting to see opportunities, but it's too early to talk about how big, when that can transpire? So stay tuned. Operator : Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya of Mizuho. Tayo Okusanya : It's good to be back. Tim, congratulations on the new role, very well-earned. Just a couple of questions from me. I wanted to go back to ProMedica for a quick second. We're now just maybe four weeks post implementation of PDPM. I'm just wondering if they are giving you guys any feedback around how that's going? And for the, again, some longer-term thoughts around PDPM, Shankh, given your comments that you guys are definitely feeling better about your investment case, partly due to some of the regulatory changes. Shankh Mitra : I'll tell you, first is, we're feeling better about investment case because the terminal value of what we thought the investment would support purely from a price per bed perspective has gone significantly higher. And I talked about the case about valuation or exit multiple, right? So if you think about even if everything else is same, I gave detailed view on what the cash flow might or might not look like relative to underwriting to Vikram. But just if you think about the sheer magnitude of change on valuation will change massive increase in IRR. Having said that on PDPM, you are correct, that we are obviously very close with our partners. We talk in a very regular basis. So I do have a view on how the team thinking about it. But it's too early to comment. Let's just say that they feel pretty optimistic that it will add to the cash flow as we move forward. Just, overall, just remember what I said, that we had $316.156 million EBITDA for 2018. So far we have achieved $230.1 million. In skilled nursing business, seasonally, fourth quarter is a strong quarter. On top of that, you have the rate increase this year and you have PDPM, which is obviously sort of a variable. We think that will land on the positive side, but we'll talk about that more, next quarter's call. Hopefully, that was helpful. Tayo Okusanya : And then on the SHOP side, I think you gave very good commentary around Canada. I'm just trying to understand, the U.K. in particular, the big change in the SHOP same-store NOI between 2Q and 3Q. Specifically what was going on there, whether it's just a very tough comp versus 3Q 2018? Shankh Mitra : So, Tayo, if you look back last couple of quarters earnings call, I have talked about that in detail. So I don't want to repeat that. But I do think that our U.K. portfolio is doing well. So it is obviously same story is what same store is, we can't change what the definition is. And just because the rest of the - out of same-store portfolio is doing better, we can't put it in same-store, right? But if you look at the overall U.K. SHOP portfolio, it's actually up close to double-digit. But the pool that we have is up 1.8% or so that we reported. I mean, it is what it is. It's just a number if you get to take the good and the bad. But we feel optimistic about the business. Tayo Okusanya : One more if you'll indulge me. Just taking a look at your triple net portfolio, you gave a nice stratification of all the rent coverage. And I'm just looking across all the names where you have less than 1x coverage. And I think in 1Q that total sum was about 4.7% according to the sub. And as of 3Q, that number is 6.1%. Just curious if that's just one or two tenants that are doing incrementally worse on the triple net side or what's kind of driven that increase and how do we kind of think about that just with regards to managing those leases? Shankh Mitra : Yes, very good question : How you think about managing the leases? If you go back four quarters ago, I had a long conversation on this earnings call about how we think about that. I added significantly more color commentary this quarter on my prepared remarks, that you need to have the right basis, right structure; more importantly, the right follow on operators. We feel a lot of these assets have significant opportunity of cash flow upside with the existing operator or with a different operator. We do not anticipate any significant changes as we sit right here. But if there is an opportunity to maximize asset values and cash flow, we will do that. You have seen us doing that in last three years. We'll not go back from there. However, as we sit right today, right here, we do not see a significant change. We'll see how things change. Just so you know, we have a very large group of professionals who do this day in and day out. And every one of our assets has an alternative operator and an alternative to an alternative operator, right? We, and that's how we set it up. We're not waiting for someday we'll get some call and then we'll act to it. The game plan, the business plan is built around all of our assets including the assets you mentioned. And if there is, needs to be, we'll execute. And hopefully that you believe that we have executed so far well. Operator : Your next question comes from Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : I just had a follow-up, I think you guys talked about last quarter, the 3 million square feet of MOBs under negotiation. It looks like you closed some. Is there - can you sort of speak to that? Shankh Mitra : Jordan, we closed or we announced post quarter activity of just exactly a million square feet, so far, of the three. And as Tom said, the year is not over yet, so stay tuned. Jordan Sadler : So that's still under negotiation essentially, mostly? Shankh Mitra : Yes, they are. And that pipeline has expanded. We have a lot to talk about that in next few months. Jordan Sadler : Okay, more MOB. And then another question\u2026 Shankh Mitra : Not necessarily. This is just - your question was MOB, so we talked about MOBs. We're not, as Tom said in answer to a question, we feel great about both our senior housing business as well as our medical office business, and there are opportunities to grow with our existing relationship, whether that's on the MOB side or with our senior housing side. We're optimistic on both of our businesses, not necessarily just have more MOBs. Jordan Sadler : No, and I'm not trying to pin you down. It just sound like you said you closed on 1 million of the 3 million. It sounds like you still have a couple of million left in the pipeline or more. And then on ProMedica, is there something helpful on a property level metric basis that you can offer up to us that sort of - give us a little bit of a better indication on the four wall EBITDAR coverage, or just property operating level metrics? I mean, you're now giving occupancy, but we really, I think we only have a few quarters of it from you. But is there anything else you can offer up? Shankh Mitra : We will only offer you what our partner is willing to offer to the marketplace. Needless to say that I understand your questions because majority of the investments that you have seen in the triple net side with operators that have no credit; or have seen significantly, was credit. As I pointed out that our view that our partner has significant credit, and I hope you understand that the lease sits at the top of the capital structure and not on a sort of SPE vehicle. So, I do understand the question, but we want to be respectful to our operating partner and their desire to obviously have consistent numbers and message is out there. However, we give you enough, hopefully, on the cash flow side which tells how it's sort of - how things are going relative to what we talked. Jordan Sadler : What's the denominator in the 2.15, is it your 144 of rent or is it the 100%? John Goodey : It's all rent. It's the senior obligation in the [indiscernible]. Jordan Sadler : The 144? John Goodey : Yes. Operator : Your final question comes from Nick Joseph from Citi. Nick Joseph : Just for the ProMedica asset sales that have gone hard, how many beds are in that portfolio? Thomas DeRosa : I'm not going to get into that, Nick. Investors and analysts are not the only people who listen to these calls. I only want to talk about transaction when they're ready to talk about. Given all the noise around ProMedica, I wanted to mention this to give you a sense of how we are thinking about the total return of the portfolio is. But we're not going to talk about transaction between two parties was supposed to be at this stage in the conversation is supposed to be private. So I only disclose how much I was allowed to disclose by my partner. Nick Joseph : And that was added to 150 a bed? Thomas DeRosa : That's what the market is today. If you look at what we have sold, our Genesis assets are about significantly higher than what we bought our ManorCare assets. If you look at where markets are trading overall, we are seeing somewhere between 120 and 180 per bed, it's what we are seeing the marketplace. We'll look at - not just these assets, but that's what these - we're seeing overall. That's where the business has gone. Operator : There are no other questions in queue. Thank you for dialing into the Welltower earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation and ask that you disconnect.",

Shankh Mitra - EVP & Chief Investment Officer Matt McQueen - Senior Vice President, General Counsel Keith Konkoli - Senior Vice President, Real Estate Services Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Welltower, Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participant lines are in listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Mr. Matt McQueen, Senior Vice President, General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir. Matt McQueen : Thank you, Liz and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tom for his remarks. Tom. Tom DeRosa : Thanks Matt and good morning. I'm pleased to announce our Q4 and annual results to you today, as they reflect the strategic path to growth that we outlined in our Investor Day in December 2018.  Simply put, in 2019 we did what we told you we would do. As the clear market leader and dominant provider of real-estate capital to the health and wellness care delivery sector, Welltower has redefined this asset class in terms of quality, operating models, technologically advanced building design, data insight, deal structure and transparency. This has placed us on a sustainable growth path that has generated $4.16 in FFO per share in 2019, a 3.2% increase over 2018 and fuels the optimistic outlook for 2020 we report to you today.  The $5 billion we deployed into new investments between January 1, 2019 and today, was not generated by playing the old game of overpaying for real-estate through auctions or being the passive take-out for old school senior housing operators more focused on their personal development profits than running an operating business. For Welltower, that game is over.  We are the partner of choice for a next generation of residential senior care operators who enter into aligned structures that rewards strong performance, yet don't leave REIT shareholders holding the bag when things don't go according to plan, and in business as in life, things don't always go according to plan.  We have also become the partner of choice for health systems. I'm sure you saw Jefferson Health\u2019s recent announcement of a broad partnership with Welltower. Jefferson, one of the nation's largest urban academic health systems has elected to work with Welltower to advance its strategy of health care with no address. This partnership will help recapitalize Jefferson's existing ambulatory assets, build and capitalize their next generation of ambulatory assets, connect Jefferson health delivery capabilities into our existing greater Philadelphia Senior population of over 20,000 lives and together conceive new models of housing and wellness care that can drive better outcomes for an aging and at risk urban population.  We are honored to be working with Dr. Steve Klasko, his team and the Board of Jefferson. They are truly redefining the future of healthcare delivery.  Our platform approach is demonstrating that there is value that can be captured in our real-estate beyond collecting rent checks. Our CareMore Anthem collaboration is a great example of this and illustrates that third parties can bring clinical care models into assisted living communities, and with modern Medicare advantage products, reduce out of pocket costs for our residents, enhanced resident experience, improve outcomes and increase occupancy and length of stay. What was a California pilot last year is now being rolled out into other markets. Stay tuned for other innovative models like this one.  For an example of how Welltower is driving the next generation of residential care design, I point you to our building on East 56th Street and Lexington Avenue opening in late spring. When this building opens, it will be the most technologically advanced residential care facility in the world for seniors suffering with conditions of frailty to memory care. Not only is this purpose built building designed to meet the needs of this population, but it will incorporate state of the art Phillips Technology that will enable more effective and efficient care, as well as enhance the experience for our residents and their families.  Welltower conceived this project and has driven the development process from day one. This will be followed by our next Manhattan Project on Broadway at 85th St, new urban models we will deliver in Hudson Yards and San Francisco as part of our related Atria joint venture and in Boston with Balfour.  These are just a few examples of how we have positioned Welltower to redefine and reimagine the built environment that can deliver better healthcare outcomes and lower costs, particularly in view of the aging of the population. We have largely moved beyond the issues that would have slowed our growth and that enables the optimism you hear from me this morning. It is our job to deliver a path of sustainable growth. In our 2020 outlook of $4.20 to $4.30 and FFO per share illustrates that. And I will remind you, this does not include any new net acquisitions or investments that have not been announced.  Now Shankh Mitra will give you a closer look at our Q4 operating performance, as well as discuss new investments. Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you Tom and good morning everyone. I will now review our quarterly and annual operating results, provide additional details on performance, trends and recent investment activity and new operator relationship.  A year ago when we set our guidance for 2019, we told you that we felt cautiously optimistic about our senior housing operating portfolio or SHOP and set the same store guidance at 0.5% to 2%. We are delighted to inform you that we have achieved 2.7% growth for the year, primarily driven by stronger pricing power and better than expected labor cost inflation.  We want to remind you that our SHOW portfolio consists of 600 communities spread across 25 portfolios of different operating partners focused on different price points, acuity levels, geographies and operating models. We quantitatively manage our SHOP portfolio to drive low cross correlation, which creates real diversification benefits.  We have added a new disclosure on slide 39 of our corporate presentation that gives you a snapshot of our ability to do this. If you compare it to randomly chosen operator from that disclosure and compare the long term NY growth rate by occupied room, you will get a median correlation of 0.23. This remarkably rose statistical correlation in a business where casual observers believe all operators in the same genetic business called senior housing is debunked. We provide further context using 2019 performance. We had three operating partners that experience mid-single digit to double digit NY decline, and we had four operating partners that experience double digit NY growth, with all other operators where in between. This demonstrates our unique business model and portfolio that is able to absorb downside volatility of certain operating partners with the contribution of others.  Other specific highlights of 2019 include significant outperformance of assisted living over independent living, and out performance of large core U.S. markets above smaller markets. We have built a highly differentiated and uncorrelated portfolio of assets by using a barbell approach a portfolio construction focusing on high end senior housing and more affordable communities with limited service, while exiting the product in the middle. 2019 saw addition of several new operators to the Welltower family; Atria, Balfour, Clover, Frontier and LCB. We are delighted to mention to you that we're off to a great start in 2020 and have already welcomed three new operators to our family, who we have been working with to come to terms for the last six months. Let me give you some details here. We are delighted to partner with Michael Glynn, Andrew Teeters, [inaudible], along with Mark Stephens [ph] to offer a lower acuity, differentiated lifestyle based, highly amenitized and stunning housing solution to seniors under the Monarch brand. We also partnered with Arun Paul of Priya Living to offer a highly differentiated and relatively affordable product targeting a [Audio Gap] and tremendously under sub market in large core U.S. MSAs. In both cases, our exclusive relationship spans multiple years and will provide a multi-billion dollar investment opportunity in the next decade.  Reflecting on the fourth quarter specifically, I will mention that we are positively surprised by few trends. First, with respect to the seasonality within senior housing business, occupancy typically peaks in late fall and trends down through the winter months. However, we did not see that seasonal drop-off this year and occupancy has been pretty much flat sequentially through the year and into this year. Second, I'm cautiously optimistic about what we have seen on the labor inflation side. While a couple of quarters does not make a trend, sequentially compensation per occupied room was flat in Q4 and is the best we have seen in the last five years.  This, taken together with consistent pricing power, gives us the confidence to provide a guidance of 1% to 2.5% in SHOP, relative to 0.5% to 2% this time last year. We have a long year ahead and we need to execute diligently, but we remain relatively optimistic today as compared to this time last year. We believe demand is increasing in assisted living business and impact of deliveries is improving on the margin. A couple of other notable items from Q4 would be significant increases in insurance cost that I discussed during the Q2 call, as well as $2.4 million increase in incentive management fee in Q4 due to significant outperformance, one of our operating partners in our RIDEA 3.0 construct that was previously not contemplated. In terms of our 2020 guidance, we assume a $4 million increase relative to the incentive management fees.  I would like to now shift to our health system portfolio. On our last quarter call we told you that we're expecting $300 million of EBITDAR in our HCR ManorCare ProMedica portfolio for 2019. I'm delighted to inform you that HCR has achieved $307 million of EBITDAR in 2019. This resulted in a full year 2019 EBITDAR coverage of 2.13x. More importantly, for the first time in seven years all three business lines of HCR ManorCare had year-over-year increase in EBITDAR in Q4.  While the Q mix shifted in skill nursing continues to be a headwind for the business, we\u2019re seeing length of stay flattening, occupancy starting to build, cost remains under check, synergies are getting realized and Arden Courts and home health and hospice business is firing with all cylinders.  In addition, HCR is an active negotiation with several health systems to help meet them, their post-acute needs. I'm optimistic I'll be able to share with you some of the success stories in 2020. ProMedica which is an absolute pioneer in the social determinant of health side will drive significant value from the HCR platform for years to come.  One the MOB side, we have significantly upgraded both our operating platform and asset portfolio in the last few quarters as we have acquired or announced roughly $4 billion of high quality MOBs under Keith and Ron\u2019s leadership. We now own the largest commercial platform of medical office released in the U.S.  We have used an air pocket in the capital markets to scale up this business in the last few quarters. However, it appears though some of the pricing frenzy of 2017 is resurfacing. If our reading of tealeaves is correct, we will be largely absent from the acquisition of MOBs this year and instead focused on privately negotiated deals with the owner such as our health system partners.  Overall on the transaction side we had the most active year in the company's history with $4.8 billion of high quality investment and $2.9 billion of disposition. We have discussed this transaction with you in detail and they are listed on our earnings release. I would like to note few general observations that drive our capital allocation strategy and market trends.  One, we invest capital to make money on part share basis for our existing shareholders as opposed to solving for any exposure or chasing the latest and greatest asset class. To the contrary, we buy assets when they are out of favor at the right price in the right structure.  Our investment in HCR skilled assets as $57, 000 a bed, just 18 months ago and the disposition on this quarter of three older non-core assets at $156,000 a bed reflects our philosophy and our laser focused execution. The same goes for our absence in MOBs market in 2017 and a rapid growth in \u201818 and \u201819.  Two, we invest capital when we can match the timing, cost and duration of capital. We do not speculate what our cost of capital will be in future years and fund transaction on a granular, and current basis. Three, we think in real-estate, basis and unlevered IRR matters significantly more than cap rates.  Four, we invest granularly with our opening partner. In this model it is critical to work with well aligned partners focused on methodical and smart growth. We have grown with all five 2019 class of operators since our first deal earlier in the year.  For example, I hope you noticed our presently, on our development Hudson Yards with our partner Related/Atria. This is the second major development we announced in last six months after our 1001 Van Ness project in San Francisco.  Five, we engaged in marketed transactions only when we believe that we have a significant age due to our data analytics platform or our relationship with health systems or payers.  Sixth, we see an incredible demand of U.S. senior housing product amongst the most highly sophisticated institutional investor today. We cannot be happier with our benchmark transaction in 2019. We started this year with another significant senior housing transaction that we reported last night with our earnings release at a very attractive price to our investor.  Our guidance of $1.7 billion to 2020 disposition includes this transaction. Though we have a $1.1 billion of announced acquisition building to our guidance that Hugh will discuss in detail, needless to say that we feel very optimistic that we\u2019ll have a very strong year of net investment.  With that, I'll pass it over to Tim McHugh, our CFO. Tim. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results, our balance sheet and our initial guidance for full year 2020.  Welltower returned to growth in 2019, reporting normalized FFO of $1.05 per share for the quarter and $4.16 per share for full year 2019, representing positive 4% and positive 3.2% year-over-year growth respectively.  Results for the year are to be categorized by three main themes : The consistency of our internal growth engine; the volume of accretive capital development activity as we invested $4.8 billion across high quality senior housing and outpatient medical opportunities; and the discipline of our capital recycling efforts, as we had $2.7 billion of property disposition, including $560 million of high yielding LTAC and post-acute assets, and had $192 million of loan payoffs, reducing our loan investment portfolio to its smaller size since 2015. The result of all this was a year in which Welltower returned to earnings growth, while also significantly improving the quality of our asset base. Now let me provide some details around our portfolios performance. First, our seniors housing triple-net portfolio posted another consistent quarter with positive 2.9% year-over-year same store grow. Sequential occupancy was flat in the quarter and EBITDAR coverage declined by 0.01x.  Next, our long term post Q portfolio generated positive 4.3% year-over-year same store growth, driven in part by an easier 4Q \u201818 comp, which included partial rent recognition from a tenant that is now current on rent. We also benefited from fair market value step-ups and a well-covered conflict healthcare lease acquiring the acquisition of QCP. EBITDAR coverage declined by 0.03x, driven in part by the addition of four development assets, the trailing 12 month pool.  As a reminder, we reported our coverage a quarter in arrears. So this September 30 trailing 12 month coverage does not reflect any impact in the new PDPM Medicare Reimbursement System, which is implemented at the start of October.  Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical portfolio had another solid quarter, delivering 2.3% same store growth, bringing the full year average to positive 2.1%. We continue to make meaningful progress in our same store occupancy as well ending the year at 94%, 60 basis points ahead of fourth quarter of 2018.  Next to health systems, which comprises of our HCR ManorCare joint venture with ProMedica. This portfolio entered the same store pool for the first time this quarter with 1.375% year-over-year growth and EBITDAR and EBITDARM coverages of 2.06x and 2.77x respectively.  Lastly, our senior housing operating portfolio continued to report above our expectations with total same store growth of positive 1.5% in the quarter, bringing full year average total senior housing operating growth to 2.7%.  As of prior practice, I will now provide details of pool changes in our senior housing operating portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we had a nine asset sequential change in our senior housing operating same store pool. There was an 11 asset West Cost portfolio removed and moved to held-for-sale, offset by two assets entering the pool.  At year-end 2019 we had a total of 77 senior housing operating assets classified as transition properties, a net increase of two properties since the end of 3Q, driven by three assets that transition from triple-net to RIDEA and one former Brookdale asset that transitioned to a triple-net lease.  The remaining 74 former Brookdale and Silverado transition assets, 71 have been successfully transitioned and will all reenter the same store pool by or during the fourth quarter of 2020. Our guidance assumes a slightly positive impact on results from transition properties in 2020 and we\u2019ll provide more color on this as we progress through the year. Turning to capital market activity in the quarter, we continue to take advantage of a very strong bond market, issuing debt across two geographies in December. First, we issued our inaugural green bond, raising $500 million or seven year debt at 2.7%. Welltower\u2019s ESG team led by Kirby Brendsel put a lot of time and effort in preparing for the reporting requirements that come with Green Bond financing, and has paid off with tremendous support received from ESG investors. Welltower is committed to staying at the forefront of ESG initiatives, and we look forward to growing this part of our capital stack going forward.  Secondly, we return to the Canadian debt market for the first time since our inaugural offering in 2015, refinancing our 2021 Canadian dollar maturity to the issuance of $300 million of seven year debt at 2.95%. In turning out our last remaining unsecured 2021 maturity, we removed all major unsecured maturities through 2022, meaningfully derisking our balance sheet for the next three years and increasing the weighted average maturity of our unsecured debt stack to 8.8 years.  Additionally, we continue to access the equity markets during the quarter via our DRIP and ATM programs. In the quarter we issued approximately 4.3 million shares and the weighted average price of $85.19 per share for estimated proceeds of $364 million. As of today's call, through our forward ATM program we have sold 6.8 million shares of common stock that have yet to settle, representing $583 million of estimated proceeds. Turning to leverage. We ended the quarter at 6.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDAR temporarily above our long term target range. This is due to the timing of capital recycling and more specifically to the fact that $1 billion of our previously announced acquisitions closed in mid-December.  When adjusted for a full quarter of acquisition cash flow and for the updated investment and disposition guidance, along with raised but not settled forward equity, leverage is expected to return to the mid to high five\u2019s by the middle of this year.  Lastly, before walking through our 2020 initial outlook, I want to address three items pertaining to our total portfolio of same store policy, an outline of which can be found on the investor sector of our website.  First, we use duration based qualifiers as frequently as possible in our policies in order to eliminate as much subjectivity from our disclosure decisions as possible. For developments, properties enter the same store pool following five full quarters of being in service.  Development plays an important role in our senior housing investment strategy, and the lower development pipeline represent a small fraction of our total senior housing portfolio. We\u2019ve determined it\u2019s useful to provide more insight and its contribution to our same store growth by providing a stabilized senior housing operating growth metric, as a complement to our total portfolio senior housing growth metric.  Stabilized is defined as nine quarters after being placed in the service. Given the broad range of products we develop, from senior apartments to assisted living, we believe we are using a duration based metric that is representative of the entire pool stabilization pattern, is more straightforward for investors and its helping to create rules for each bucket. Second, on normalizers. We normalized our same store results for changes in currency and ownership, as well as for unusual and non-recurring items such as property tax refunds, insurance reimbursements. We believe this to be beneficial to investors in understanding our run rate business.  We\u2019ve disclosed all normalization amounts in the back of our supplement since 2016. Per supplement disclosure, 2019 average full year SHOP NOI growth would have been 50 basis points higher, without normalizing out unusual and non-recurring items that benefit us in 2019. Lastly, in 2020 we will continue our efforts to further align the reporting of our same store in our quarterly filing with our same store and our supplemental presentation, with an intent to reach full alignment.  Now, on to our 2020 outlook. As indicated in our press release, we are initiating full year 2020 FFO guidance to a range of $4.20 to $4.30; the total portfolio same store growth, NOI growth of 1.5% to 2.5%. At the same level this NOI is comprised of outpatient medical grow a positive 2.25% to 2.75%. Long term post-acute grow of positive 2% to 2.5%; health systems grow a positive 1.95%, and senior housing triple-net growth of positive 2.25% to 2.75%, and total portfolio senior housing operating growth of 1% to 2.5%. At the midpoint of total portfolio senior housing operating growth stabilized same store NOI growth is estimated at positive 1.25%.  On to guided investment activity. Our initial FFO guidance assumes we are net sellers for the full year, with initial disposition guidance for the year of $1.7 billion of Welltower share, with an average yield of 5.1%. This includes a little over $1 billion of previously announced dispositions, including $740 million from our Invesco MOB joint venture and $675 million of under contract dispositions announced last night in our earnings release.  On acquisitions, as always our initial guidance only includes acquisitions closed or announced which totaled $1.1 billion as of today's call, made up of $320 million, that has already closed and approximately $820 million of remaining MOB transactions that will close in the first half. Lastly, on developments, we are approaching an inflection point with our development pipeline as it pertains to spend relative to deliveries. We are relatively light here in the delivery front for the first three quarters of the year, before delivering $210 million of our $302 million of full year deliveries in the fourth quarter.  In 2020 we will deliver another $714 million of deliveries against $468 million of spend. So as this development portfolio starts to run out a little bit, we will feel a bit of near term dilution, certainly from the SHOW part of our development pipeline. As you will have 400 million of deliveries in the fourth quarter of \u201819 through year-end 2020, creating $0.02 per share of drag on FFO for 2020 before stabilizing over the next two years at positive 6% to 8% of FFO contribution per share. Develop pipeline upside beyond 2020, along with upside from transitions and the continued recovery in senior housing are what makes us optimistic well beyond 2020, as our portfolio is positioned exceptionally well to benefit the demographic trends across all of our geographies.  And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Tom. Tom DeRosa : Thanks Tim. So you\u2019ve head us repeat the word optimism throughout our prepared remarks this morning; this is sincere. The green shoots from our core portfolio we saw in late \u201818 that grew in 2019 are fueling this optimism. Our senior strategy to align with major health systems have been validated and we are mining many interesting investment opportunities that will enable accretive growth and drive shareholder value. We look forward to talking more about this with you throughout the year.  Now Liz, please open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from a line of the Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks, good morning. I guess Shankh, first on just the acquisition environment and kind of the pipeline. Could you sort of give us a sense for how big the pipeline is today versus say six to 12 months ago? And in what areas is it sort of most robust? Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Steve. Good morning. The pipeline is as big as we have felt this time, you know really throughout the year, but particularly relative to the last 12 months, the pipeline is significantly bigger. As I told you in my prepared remarks that the pipeline is focused on two areas one is on the senior housing side, the other is our deals that are sourced through our relationship with health systems.  Mostly you will see that this year other than the transaction that we have made or we have shaken hands 12 months ago or six months ago plus, will be mostly out of that MOB markets this, so senior housing and health system transactions directly with the system. Steve Sakwa : And is there anything without get specific. Can you share anything just about pricing trends or cap rates kind of as you look to deploy capital versus maybe look to deploy capital versus maybe where you spend capital in 2019 or are things better, getting tighter? Shankh Mitra : So on the senior housing side, if you look at sort of the top end really pretty assets, really good markets, very good operators, cap rats are extremely tight and they have gotten really tighter in the last say 12 to 18 months, particularly the last six months. The transaction we announced yesterday sort of shows you that. On the other hand we are seeing the emergence of distress. In memory care and in markets where you saw the first burst of supply in \u201915,\u201916,\u201917, everything in the middle is sort of, it depends right. If you look at our pipeline and look at our history, you will see that we grow with our operating partners with a development of off-market acquisitions one or two efforts at a time and that market remains extremely favorable.  So we have a lot of you know either very small portfolios or a lot or one-off assets, two assets, three assets that are in the pipeline that add up to a big volume, but that's where we get our pricing and that becomes very accretive. So we are very, very optimistic; very, very optimistic about the deal pipeline this year. Steve Sakwa : Okay, and then just one follow-up for Tim; I appreciate all the commentary. I couldn't quite get all the numbers so I might have missed an exact spread. I think you said that the developments do help do same store a little bit and that you're, you know almost putting a second number out there. So can you just quantify what same store I guess is being boosted by in 2020 just from the developments? Tim McHugh : Yeah. So Steve, the numbers that I gave were 1% to 2.5% range for our total SHOW portfolios to 1.75% midpoint, and at that point assume the stable portfolio grows at 1.25%. Steve Sakwa : Got it! Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Jonathan Hughes : Hey, good morning. Tim, thanks for walking through your same store definition policy and providing the slide deck on the site. I was hoping you could give us maybe this RevPar occupancy and expense growth component embedded in your SHOP NOI growth guidance? Shankh Mitra : Hey Jonathan, I'll take that. So you know as we talk to you about this before, the three big variables which moves, where we land on the same store NOI growth obviously that occupancy, that's pricing and obviously labor, right. I mean they are the three major components.  Without getting into too much on how those things will obviously change each other or influence each other though, I want you to sort of think about is what we have seen in the last, call it four to six quarters, you will see flattish to slightly down occupancy and you will see 3%-plus growth in the rates and we will see what we get on the labor side.  As I said, two quarters doesn't make a trend. We are not assuming that trend will continue, but if we do get some help on the labor side, what we have seen in fourth quarter if that continues, obviously there'll be upside. Jonathan Hughes : Okay, so we can kind of extrapolate may be the past couple of quarters and roll that forward and that gets to your embedded guidance. Any different to your non-core portfolio? Shankh Mitra : No, we have the non-core portfolio. You know obviously there's a significant difference to performance. I'll give you an example, just in fourth quarter. Again, don't take one quarter and run with it, but just if you look at U.S., in fourth quarter large for core U.S. markets were up 3.5%, 3.4% to be specific in NOI and other smaller markets were down 2.5%. There is a significant difference of performance between large core U.S. markets versus smaller markets. We're seeing that, so I don\u2019t know exactly what that will get to, but I suspect that you will see a big difference between the two as we roll through 2020. Jonathan Hughes : Got it, that's great. And then just one more form me. Tom, you talked about your partnerships with healthcare providers and capabilities in the prepared remarks, but I was hoping you could talk about how your new partner, specifically the senior housing partners ascribe value to gaining access your data analytics platform.  I mean the world at Washington capital, I think a lot of these operations should go out and admittedly find cheaper sources, but clearly they come to you to gain something others don't provide. So I'm just trying to figure out, how us as outside analysts and investors ascribe value to this part of your business because it is so unique.? Tom DeRosa : Well, thanks Jonathan, I'd say that it's helping our senior housing operators understand where to focus, because we can provide them such granular information about their target populations. It really helps them become much more efficient and effective senior housing operators and we are now talking this expertise and bringing it to health systems. Health systems are now working with us to figure out how they can build market share in certain markets that are important to them, and this is a tool that they\u2019ve really not had in their arsenal before.  So you know we see it as truly a differentiator and I\u2019d also say that our senior housing operators are also seeing the other capabilities we bring. You know I talked about the CareMore Anthem collaboration. That is a win-win for everyone involved, including the resident, their families, the operator. And from a senior housing operator standpoint, we see expanding the operating model of a senior housing facility by collaborating with third parties like a CareMore can drive occupancy and increase length of stay, and may offer opportunities to enhance revenues.  So we think that \u2013 you know we're always focused on alignment, that you hear that's a word other than optimism you hear from us a lot, which is alignment, and you know it's not just talk, it's real, it's happening, and that's what's driving the senior housing industry. The people that see the future and know that the future of the senior housing industry is not what exists today for the most part and they want to be \u2013 work with Welltower. Jonathan Hughes : Okay, yeah. I mean from us in the outside it\u2019s just trying to understand how maybe we priced it into the metrics that we see in terms of the yield on you know new partnerships, so\u2026 A - Tom DeRosa : Yeah, so Jonathon, its early days. I think you'll start to see \u2013 it's going to help you I think, and over time we\u2019ll point you to where we're expanding the service model in senior housing through these types of collaborations, and there should be \u2013 you should be able to see better performance, so that'll \u2013 again, its early days, but as I said earlier, we\u2019re starting to roll these programs out into multiple markets across the country and I think that's when it'll be more tangible. Shankh Mitra : Jonathon, just \u2013 you know these things are hard to model, but I would just \u2013 one way to think about it could be that if you look at just in the last 18 months, we have talked to you about eight new operators, right. I mean to your point they're coming to work with us because of our \u2013 these capabilities, not of our cost of capital, right. Where there are significant chief sources of capital the world is divested with capital.  These are these capabilities, so you can \u2013 one way to think about it, you know you can think like how many of those operating partners that we may or may not be able to get over a period of time and then think about how are ongoing investment with them as I mentioned in 2019. Earlier in the year we sort of announced our batch of 2019 partners and so far you know today, as of today we have invested more with every one of them. So that sort of gives you a sense of \u2013 we\u2019ve been trying to get a sense of what the platform is what as Tom talks about. The platform is what more than just the asset and you know obviously that's the way you can get to the platform value. That might be one way to think about that. Jonathan Hughes : Yes, alright, thank you very much for the color guys. I appreciate it. Tom DeRosa : Thanks Jon. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Your line is now open. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Maybe just sticking with partnerships, Tom what should we expect in 2020 from the Jefferson one. A - Tom DeRosa : Well, we\u2019re hopeful in 2020 you will see kind of the first stage of a joint venture around some of their ambulatory assets. That is something that we are currently working with them on. They've identified some of the assets that will go into that joint venture, so I would expect you will see that this year.  And then the next piece of it is bringing Jefferson's services into our senior housing and post-acute portfolio in the greater Philadelphia region. We have a concentration there. We have 20,000 lives, particularly 20,000 lives of people that are mostly paying out of pocket to live in high end senior housing is a very important population to Jefferson and that's one of the keys here.  I think you're going to start to see more health system presence in our senior housing portfolio. It\u2019s happened already, but I think with respect to Jefferson it'll start to be \u2013 it'll start to be derivative scale, because they are such a large system and we have a large portfolio. So I\u2019d expect you'll see that in 2020. Some of the other aspects of our relationship are a little bit more longer term focused. You know I talked about \u2013 you know you\u2019ve heard us talk about our Clover housing model. Concepts like that, that might include Jefferson clinical, particular from a primary care standpoint being co-located in those types of communities is something that we are very actively looking on, because again you know Jefferson talks about healthcare with no address. That is allowing them to push out their products and services outside the hospital campus and that's very much a focus of what we're doing together. Nick Joseph : Thanks, that's helpful. And then Shankh, just on MOB cap rate compression that you've seen there, can you put some numbers around that and then who are those incremental buyers that are driving cap rates down? A - Shankh Mitra : I mean, I'm not going to give you numbers. You have seen some very aggressive trades in recent times. You know again, if you look at our \u2013 what we're closing or have talked about, in real estate transaction you should take everything with a six to nine month delay. So think about the announcements sort of we made during the REIT [ph] and we should date that back six to nine months ago, right.  So the cap rates are tight, they are coming down. A lot of public REITS, institutional owners, private equity, I don't want to specifically name someone, but the whole point is we, as we said several times, we think that our bogey that we have to head on an unlimited ROI basis is 7% or pretty close to that and we think that asset class, if that asset class gets priced somewhere in the 5 \u2013 you know low 5 or 5, that makes absolutely no sense for our investors. So if the pricing gets there we\u2019ll stay away. If the pricing remains sort of mid-five, we will be active. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Your line is now open. Rich Anderson : Good morning. So I wanted to talk about your peers and you and the same store discussion Tim that you went through. I'm just reading the team leads and it seems like maybe you were involved in a kind of cooperative process to get on an equal playing field. I don't know, maybe we\u2019re involved. Can you just describe, if in fact you weren't \u2013 what were the hold ups that didn't sort of get you to a point where you were in exact agreement with your peers, namely Ventas in TEAK and you know, is there a chance that we'll get there at some point in the future, so that you know we do have this sort of a more agreeable sort of environment among the three of you on that topic specifically. Tom DeRosa : Good morning Rich, its Tom. Let me jump in on that first, and then we'll see if Tim has any additional comments. You know I\u2019d say that Welltowers had a same store policy for years and that policy and our adhering to that policy is reviewed quarterly by our audit committee. By the way, this policy applies across all asset types at Welltower beyond senior housing to triple-net MOB and the others. So yes, you referred to the chatter about same store senior housing policy, which I suspect has much to do with the significantly stronger performance of our assets versus the others you mentioned.  Look, I hope our earnings results that we report today, that we reported throughout the year, and the fact that we proactively dealt with our problem children over the last three years speaks to the quality differential. And so you saw that we posted the policy that we\u2019ve had in place for a number years; you can take a close look at that, you can talk to Tim about that, we\u2019re a very different business, we are a very development focused business, the type of senior housing assets that we'd like to buy don't exist, so we have to build them and we're the ones who are driving that process.  So I don't think we're talking apples-to-oranges here necessarily in terms of senior housing portfolios and I hope that we are putting this matter to rest, because it's not a productive discussion. Tom DeRosa : Yeah, [Cross Talk] You know the intent of the conversation, I think the alignment around it is that you tend to bring more information to investors transparency, comparability and the rest of it, and I think you're seeing some positive outcomes from that. I think from our \u2013 the presentation or the outline of our historical policies that we put out last night, you'll see there's a lot of familiarities between policies and know what our commitment is to continue to provide investors with more information they need, particularly as it pertains to the kind of differentiating quality between portfolios. Rich Anderson : Okay, so like total portfolio versus just the shop portfolio. A - Tom DeRosa : Well I guess, part of it is \u2013 part of our thought is that the total portfolio is the focus right in having \u2013 what we posted last night is our total portfolio approach and that you know I think that the ideas that you buy Welltower because of our \u2013 the exposure we have across all of our asset types and what that does to the consistency of our cash flow and so just a morals approach gives you a better view of how that entire business is operating. Rich Anderson : Okay. Tom early in the conversation you said sometimes things don't work out, that\u2019s life and business and generally. Can you give an example where something didn't quite work out the way you had hoped, but that you have dialed in protection mechanisms at the point of the negotiation to protect the downside and protect your investors. Do you have one or two in mind where that in fact has happened? Tom DeRosa : Yes, but I wouldn't be able to tell you specifically about that, but yes, that's one of the reasons why you know our performance is better. But I'm not going to call out specific operators on this call, but I will tell you that we give our operators an incentive to outperform and that, when you work with the right people is hopefully \u2013 that's driving the performance versus the downside protection. We don't go into any arrangement hoping that we're going to be able to pull the downside protection lever. A - Shankh Mitra : Rich, this is an inappropriate conversation to call people out on the call, but I can talk to you offline, but think about how we have changed the business and on what an ideal trio structure is. It\u2019s very much laid out for that downside protection. It also significantly provides upside participation.  If you think about how we have moved away from \u2013 you know I'll give you another example, which is obviously it's very easy to think about senior housing, but just think about what we have done on our loan books, right, which essentially where cut in half. We don't make OpCo loans anymore, we don't make this kind of you know lending money to operators or lending money at the OpCo level, why is that?  It's because you know that downside protection will be that if you are a lender in a specific asset or box, you should be able to take over that box if things don't go right. We are a REIT, we\u2019re not allowed to own an OpCo right completely. So the fundamental you know idea behind this kind of loans are flawed, so we don't do that anymore. So that's why you see that our loan boo has come down. But anyway, I hope that those two examples sort of gives you some idea as to in what line to think about, we\u2019ll have to just speak with you offline. Rich Anderson : Yeah, I didn't mean to put you on the spot there, but you know I thought the good example is ProMedica, which you know had its downgrade and all that, so but yeah, here you are producing or they are producing over 2x coverage versus the 1.8x starting point. So I think that would be one example, no fault to them. It just was a function of you guys setting that up. Well, so I just wanted to\u2026 Tom DeRosa : That\u2019s a credit transaction, that we\u2019re protected by the credit at the parent level. Shankh Mitra : And it's a very good example of you know this organization which is not-for-profit health system, but has an extraordinary business mind. If you\u2019re seeing Justin what happened in the insurance business last year and they have taken really tough calls and exited business. You don't generally see that in a lot of not-for-profits right. They said they made that promise to their bond holders and they did it, they executed it.  If you go back and look at their presentation that they presented at the JP Morgan healthcare conference, that lays it all out. So a very, very good example, that's why our interests are aligned and you will see that we will continue to grow with them. Rich Anderson : And that\u2019s coming from a guy who didn't like it very much at the outset, so you know, so good for you. A - Shankh Mitra : We understand Rich. Tom DeRosa : Thanks Rich, we appreciate it. Rich Anderson : Thanks very much. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Derek Johnston : Good morning everybody. The $740 million SHOP portfolio that is subsequent to quarters end slated for sale. Can you give us some more details, including you know what percentage of these assets were already converted to the RIDEA 3.0 structure or had they not been and then also, what percentage of your going forward SHOP operators have been converted to the new structure? A - Shankh Mitra : Thank you very much. Very good question. It\u2019s a transaction in process, so I'm not going to get into too much of what the transaction is. I will tell you that this is not a portfolio in RIDEA 3.0 and the second thing I will tell you about this then the buyer of this portfolio is an extraordinarily smart and very well-known institutional investors. We have a tremendous amount of respect for them and we do a lot of business with them in different places.  So we think not only that this is a great transaction for us, we think this is going to be a fantastic transaction for their investors. About 80% plus of our operators today and number of operators today are in that RIDEA 3.0 operating. A - Tom DeRosa : Derek, what I\u2019ll add to that is, perhaps when you see high quality portfolios being sold by Welltower. That may be an indication that that operator was not interested in a RIDEA 3.0 structure perhaps. A - Shankh Mitra : As a general comment? Tom DeRosa : As a general comment, so that's something you should consider as to why we might you know choose to sell some portfolios that look to be and are very, very strong portfolios of real estate. Derek Johnston : Okay, very helpful. Just switching gears quickly to health systems, I noticed the same store NOI assumption of 2% growth. I mean I think this is the first time you're including this in guidance. So I guess while you know the health system build out is in the early days and the growth rates maybe initially lower and possibly ramp over time, the question is you know what do you feel will be the long term growth rate of the health systems? Shankh Mitra : So Derek, so that is obviously, that bucket is if you think about it, it\u2019s a ProMedica bucket. As you know the first year their Collider was 1.35% -- 1.375% and going forward its 275. I believe we closed the transaction on July 26. So you have a mix of 1375 and a 275, but when you get the full year you will get to 275. Derek Johnston : Okay, great. Thanks. Shankh Mitra : So part of the year is 1375, part of the year 275, going forward 275. Derek Johnston : Got it. Operator : Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. Shankh you referred to this sort of the senior housing barbell approach, and obviously in other asset classes you can think of multifamily as a BC and asset classes, some different breakups, but just curious as you described the part of the barbell that you've just started building. Can you talk about how competitive that market is pricing, what type of structures you may be employing similar to sort of the RIDEA 3.0 that you've done with the existing portfolio. Just kind of walk us through how to think about that market in terms of differences, in terms of pricing and structure. Shankh Mitra : Yeah, I'll be sort of describing to you a high level basis what I meant by barbell approach. If you think about just purely from a pricing perspective, on the high end you can pass the labor inflation that's been happening and across the market, but if you think about generally speaking across all markets, wages have been going up. Whether that\u2019s sort of a move on minimum wage somewhere closer to $15 or you know whatever that metric is for a given market or just general you know sort of a lift in wage because of low unemployment that is happening across the board.  In certain markets, in high end markets you can pass that to your consumers and you're consumer understands that\u2019s the case right. That you are not just jacking up rates because you want to jack up rates. They understand there's so many people who serve them and their wages are going up meaningfully. In other markets where I'm talking about is the lower end, sort of we call lower rent market where you don't have a lot of people. It\u2019s a low service model, so higher margin. You're not impacted by sort of the people and of the inflation that much. So we think somewhere in the middle the problem is your still facing the labor and a move towards that you know $13, $14, $15, yet you don\u2019t have the price to justify that.  That sort of a dichotomy today is the first time we're seeing irrespective of market, labor growth has been pretty much towards a much higher number than they have been. So you got to concentrate on the markets, where you can do past that pricing or you have to be in markets where you are not providing that one-to-one hands-on care and you are sort of a low service model, so that\u2019s sort of we\u2019re focused on. Addressing your next question, sort of where you were asking for what are we doing on the lower service model side? Remember these are apartment assets, effectively seniors\u2019 apartment and as a REIT we can own apartments and have complete control. We don't have to get into a RIDEA 3.0 type structure where there is a, you know what we're allowed to own a third of the OpCo or not. That does not apply for those kinds of assets. You have a much higher level of control there. Vikram Malhotra : Great! And then Tim, could you just clarify, you mentioned the 50 basis point delta between the same store portfolio growth and then applying that sort of stabilized layer onto it. Can you just clarify, I may have missed this. I dialed in late. When you say stabilize, what are you sort of excluding? Because the development properties I think you laid out, they come in post five quarters. Tim McHugh : Correct. So the developer properties come into the pool post five quarter, so we got a duration based rule on that, and they don't stay \u2013 what we said is we \u2013 they don\u2019t stabilize for this metrics purposes until they are in for nine quarters and in my prepared remarks I went through some of the reasons for that. So the non-stabilized portion of the same store portfolio is made up of those assets that bunch with the pool, but haven't hit that stabilization point. Vikram Malhotra : The nine quarter, okay. And what is the stabilized number for 2019? Tom DeRosa : The stabilized number 2019 is 150 basis points lower than our 27. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, great. And then Tom just one last one; you've talked a lot about the partnerships with the health systems, kind of how \u2013 what shape Jefferson may take. I\u2019m just sort of curious as to how long that sort of partnership took. What were sort of the push backs and you know do you see this as being \u2013 what types of systems do you think would be more open to this sort of partnership? Tom DeRosa : Very good question Vik. These partnerships take a long time, because you have a myriad of people internally that you need to deal with and establish credibility with, and there's also boards involved. And I think one of the things that made Jefferson successful is that we had established relationships and credibility amongst the management team, as well as with the board of Jefferson. But these are not you know quick \u2013 they put an RFP and you're responding to it. These are very nuanced relationships that take time, and so there are a number of them simmering on the stove right now that looks like Jefferson.  I mean the fact is truly the high AA plus health systems for the most part will believe that they're better served by raising debt in the capital markets. We tried to remind them that debt has to be paid back. We have a \u2013 we're offering them a long term solution to help them grow. Not that they won't take advantage of low interest rates in the debt market, but we're just another oar in the water of capital, so.  I would tell you that there are some relationships we have been developing that some may look like the Jefferson partnership and some might look a bit different. So I would just say stay tuned, but we're actively \u2013 this is an area that we've been very actively engaged in for many years. Tim McHugh : I\u2019ll just add one thing Vikram. If you think about it, there are health systems who still believes that healthcare should be delivered primarily within the confined four walls of the hospital and you know so they probably will have a different tag versus a lot of health systems believes that healthcare needs to be out in the community or in where people live and sort of it having more of a comprehensive approach to health and wellness, and you will see more of them will be a partner. Tom DeRosa : Yeah, it's beyond cost-to-capital. If it's just cost of capital, some health systems you know have a very low cost-to-capital. This is broader than that and I think that is an element of why anyone does business with Welltower. There\u2019s a broader value proposition that we present. It's not just about cost-to-capital and that's why we're growing the way we're growing through off-market transactions, because if someone is going to put out an RFP and wants to get the lowest priced capital, well sometimes maybe that might be us, but that's not how we're thinking about growing our business. Vikram Malhotra : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jordan Sadler : Thanks, good morning. Just moving to the shop portfolio for a second, can you talk about the new lease spreads versus renewal increases that are baked into the guide for 2020? A - Shankh Mitra : We'll just tell your Jordan that we think that we're going to get overall pricing above \u2013 you know our expectation is our pricing trends will remain very strong. The spread between new lease and renewal differs from operating partners to operating partners, building to building. So it'll be an impossible task to get into that, but generally speaking, you know people usually don't live our you know exceptional communities, which provide exceptional care just for a small increase of price that is justified by what is happening in the labor market. Jordan Sadler : So, I mean I know there's obviously a pretty broad disparity, you know probably also in terms of the same store NOI performance across the portfolio. But I'm just kind of thinking, lending across the portfolio, if there is any granularity you could offer in terms of what's sort of happening on the mark-to-market basis upon releasing? A - Shankh Mitra : We have one operator who has seen pricing in the mid-5 range. A bunch of operators have seen pricing in the sort of the 4 to 5 range and a lot of people have seen that sort of 2% to 3.5% range. That sort of gives you the broad spectrum. I've seen one that has the sort of the lowest of 1%, 1.5%, but that sort of gives you the range.  The second question you asked is on a mark-to-market. Remember what happens on an overall cost basis. You come in at an assessment level. Over a period of time that assessment goes up, right. So from a care revenue perspective and eventually to say you know there are care levels of 1 to 5. I'm making this up to make a point. Jordan Sadler : Yeah, I get it. Shankh Mitra : You come in at a 2%, but you know you leave at 4%, 4.5%. There\u2019s always a different of you know pricing on care on a mark-to-market basis, because the next person coming into the 2%, 2.5% right. So \u2013 but from a \u2013 so what we\u2019re seeing and we have seen, this is no secret to anyone, we try to keep the level same, so when the higher acuity people leave, lower acuity residents come in, so mark-to-market on the care side is always negative. On the real estate side, remember there\u2019s two price right. The rent side we\u2019re seeing rental increases cross the board. Pretty much that sort of mirrors what I told you. The market rent I'm talking about, mirrors what I've talked about on the pricing side. So that gives you a sense of what happened. Jordan Sadler : Shankh, I'm sure you've done this work with you data team. Would you share what the seasoning impact if you will is on same store NOI grows, you know from you know just basically folks aging in place across the portfolio? Shankh Mitra : I will. Jordan Sadler : Acuity of care rising. Shankh Mitra : Yeah, I will take that up with my team and talk to you offline. Jordan Sadler : Okay. And then one other, just PDPM, Tim obviously you pointed out nothing in the quarter. Any early comments in terms of what you're seeing across the health system portfolio and/or with genesis just basically in your conversations with these tenants/partners and then perhaps expectations coming from CMS regarding recommendations for reimbursement come April. Shankh Mitra : Yeah, so first is, I think it's too early to comment on what\u2019s the impact of PDPM. So we first \u2013 sort of that is something, it will take time for everybody to understand and will have different impact on different platforms, you know very different impacts, so that\u2019s sort of \u2013 I'm not going to engage into that and pretend I know exactly what's going on. I will tell you that this is exactly why we don't want to do and that's why we structure the [inaudible] in the way that we did. We do not pretend that we\u2019re the expert in CMS rate increase and then annual basis, which is not.  Second category, totally given that I told you that we are obviously not an expert, we\u2019ll stay away from what might or might not be coming. I will just remind you that generally speaking as I said, across the board we're seeing civilization of that business. That business has been pretty much under attack for years and years.  I think our regulators understand that. There\u2019s been a lot of bankruptcy filings in that sector over the last two years. I think regulators understand that that is a very much of a needed sector and our health system partners will tell you that that is very much of a needed factor. I think whatever happened, I have zero insight and whatever happens will be reasonable and will have an impact positive or negative, generally on different platforms. Jordan Sadler : Alright, I\u2019ll yield the floor. Thanks guys. A - Tom DeRosa : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America Merill Lynch. Your line is now open. Joshua Dennerlein : Hey, good morning everyone. A - Tom DeRosa : Good morning. Joshua Dennerlein : I\u2019m curious, how involved were you guys in the site selection of the new related trio development in the Hudson Yards. A - Shankh Mitra : The specific one or in general? Joshua Dennerlein : I guess just what\u2019s that partnership like? Is it your data team kind of leading the charge on like, \u2018hey, these are good sites. These are what you should consider.\u2019 Just curious on that front. A - Shankh Mitra : So generally the way it works, that you have an extraordinary related you know team of professionals that\u2019s led by Brian Chow [ph] related who leaves this particular vertical. Brian tracks with my team and works with the data team directly. It's a two way process; they are an extraordinary good developer who will look at whether they find the site or we find the site we\u2019ll look at it. Then what we do is we run that sort of analytics process, see demographically, typographically what it looks like, why this is different and this is a two-way process. But you\u2019re correct, that every site, possible site we look at we do it through our \u2013 that goes through our analytics process and we then debate. I'll give you an example. For example in DC, we have so far past on several pieces of parcels, because we couldn't get to what we're actually trying to build. So there is a lot of sauces making that goes on and obviously our data analytics team is very much a part of that in the front end from the very beginning. Joshua Dennerlein : Great! Thank you. A - Tom DeRosa : Thanks Joshua. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Your line is now open. Daniel Bernstein : Good morning. I wanted to go back to the comment you made about owning and operating your \u2013 you know the lower end businesses with senior apartments maybe independent living. You know there's a lot of competition in the apartment space, Greystar, other private equities, Carlyle. How do you think about the risk of that sector given the competition versus the opportunities and maybe how do you think about creating and building your own Welltower brand within that segment. Tom DeRosa : So Dan, 85% of seniors have incomes of less than $50,000 a year and surprisingly there is very little product for that population. A lot of the independent living you've been referring to sells at a premium to other multifamily in the market and that is not what we are doing at Welltower. There may be markets where we will bring a premium independent living product, because the demand is there for that type of a product, but when we talk about some of the markets in this country that we currently own assets in, these are addressing a tremendous unmet need and you know the opportunity for people to live in safe housing, that is designed to accommodate a long arc of aging with rents of $900 to $1200 a month.  There's a tremendous opportunity there, and what we're doing is when we can connect that housing concept with a payer, because these are people that are on Medicare advantage plans, and when you can work together with the Medicare advantage plan, you can really help them reduce risk and hopefully create better environments for this population to live in. This is a population that's never going to be able to afford to live in senior housing, at least the seniors housing that we own. This is a new asset class. And your point about will Welltower brand this sector, stay tuned for that. You'll hear more about that this year. Shankh Mitra : Dan, if you have time, come over to New York at some point and sit down with our leader who runs the business, Ayesha Menon, and understand how we are working and thinking through the exact same problem we talked about, but we're not focused on the high-high end of that business. So if you think about it, you talked about Greystar and others. I don\u2019t pretend to be an expert in Greystar\u2019s business, but my understanding is that they are focused on the high end of that product, very high price point, you know $3,000, $2,500 something like that. If I understand correctly, we\u2019re focused on the lower end of that product, the $1,000, $1,200, $1500; it's a different product. Daniel Bernstein : That\u2019s actually really helpful to understand that and I will take you up on your offer to come up to New York. One other quick question, MOB\u2019s have shown some improving occupancy. To get that occupancy, are you giving away any extra TI, anything that might cause a little bit of drag on that the FAD, AFFO or is that simply you know the MOB\u2019s locations next to the hospital and there is demand there and that's driving the occupancy. Just trying to understand that a little bit better. A - Keith Konkoli : Dan, this is Keith Konkoli. I would say, actually our capital expenditures are below our historic experiences, so we're really not giving away any additional CapEx or improvements to get tenants into the spaces. We\u2019re really just very focused. Our team is really in the market, canvasing the market, and it's really just driving activity through focus on the business, I would say is what's really resulted in our increase in our occupancy. Shankh Mitra : Dan, one thing I will tell you that your sort of question implies, that in billing being right next to the hospital is what get them leased. I saw you at Revista. You probably have heard me saying that on the panel, we do not believe that on campus MOB\u2019s are aware the industry is and what the industry is going.  We have sort of no horse in this race. Our portfolios is roughly half on campus and roughly \u2013 you know roughly off campus. We do believe that consumerism in healthcare is real and healthcare is moving to where people are going.  So it is asset-by-asset, system-by-system, relationship-by-relationship, but I want to make sure that you understand our view. Right or wrong, that's our view and we do not believe that on campus MOB is that sort of this asset class that we need to stride for, we just don't. We just don't think that\u2019s the model of healthcare where the future is going to be. Daniel Bernstein : There was certainly the view at Revista as well, I think so. I appreciate the color and I\u2019ll hop off. Thank you. A - Tom DeRosa : Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Michael Carroll : Yeah, thanks. Tom or Shankh, can you provide some color on that little Judy senior housing product that you guys have been talking about throughout the call. What type of investment should we expect out of there? Does this product exist today or do you need to really build most of it? Shankh Mitra : We have invested significantly in the last, call it 12-months we\u2019ve invested close to $0.5 billion. Some of the products do exist and our team has actually just closed a transaction of three assets in Vegas recently, actually the last couple of weeks.  The products do exist, but not in terms of the acquisition volume that you would expect from us, because just what we're trying to address, you will see acquisition, you'll see development, but I'm not willing to give you a number that would suggest that we have a target, which we don't, which is the most important point of the call. I read so much about \u2013 you know two years ago we were targeting your idea, we did. We actually saw that when the price was right, we saw a lot of idea, but for these days I see people say we\u2019re targeting to buy one of these, we don\u2019t, and we have been absent from the market.  I already indicated to you, we\u2019ll be absent from the market, probably this year. There is no target portfolio in our head that we are trying to get to. It is all an IRR driven model. So, I just want you to understand that, that's a very important part, we are not trying to solve for an exposure. We are trying to invest capital. We are investors not deal processor. Michael Carroll : That makes sense. How many operators do you have right now that are focused on this? I know Clover is and I think you mentioned Mark. I guess how many operators do you have that are focused on the type of product? Shankh Mitra : We have a bunch of relationships that are in discussions. You mentioned obviously Clover, but there are others. Too early to comment on how many people that will be doing business with. You will see more of this conversation as the year rolls. But I can assure you that we are conversation. As I offered to Dan, come over to New York, sit down with Ayesha. She will be able to give you much broader and more sort of accurate view of what's going on in the business. Tom DeRosa : You know Mike, I would say at our Investor Day later this year this will be an area of focus that will present. So you'll get a deeper dive on this business line later this year. Michael Carroll : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Tayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Tayo Okusanya : Yes, good morning everyone. Tom DeRosa : Good morning Tayo. Tayo Okusanya : Hi. Your initial guidance in regards to acquisitions and dispositions actually has you guys you know set up as a net seller, at least to start the year. I think again, just kind of given your cost of capital that\u2019s somewhat surprising to a lot of people, but at the same time seeing the amazing prices you're getting on some of these sales also makes perfect sense.  So the question I have for you is you know 12 months from now do you guys kind of still see yourselves \u2013 if you kind of look through the mirror, on the backward, but then do you still see yourselves as a net seller for the year or do you kind of think given your positive commentary on the acquisition front that you could still kind of see sort of the net buyer by the end of 2020. Tom DeRosa : Tayo, we just gave 2020 guidance this morning, now you want 2021? Tayo Okusanya : No, I was going to look at 2020 backwards is what I mean. Tom DeRosa : Okay. No, I think that you know this from how we give guidance. We are not going to speculate on acquisitions and you know a big reason for that is because acquisitions are cost capital dependent and so Shankh spoke to the optimism we have on that side of the business, but we're not going to, certainly not going to put things into numbers before they've been funded.  So you know part of the reason you're correct in saying we're net sellers, we certainly, we control the sales and we control the buying process of stuff under contract, but there's a reason we don't kind of put anything speculative in there in that.  So you've got an idea what's driving our numbers, and I think you're likely correct that it will be surprising given the current backdrop that we would be net sellers, but that\u2019s what\u2019s currently driving our outlook, is that net seller. Shankh Mitra : If this current capital markets stays where it is, I would be very, very surprised if we're not a significant net buyer by the end of the year. Again, but it is capital markets dependent, it is opportunity dependent, it is return dependent. Tayo Okusanya : Got you, that\u2019s helpful. And then ProMedica, again great pricing. In fact amazing pricing there. Any thoughts around maybe monetizing more of the portfolio, going forward? Tom DeRosa : We are extremely, extremely happy with the relationship that was an opportunistic sale. If there are more like that comes up with ProMedica and we come to the same conclusion that we should take advantage of that, we\u2019ll do that. But in generally speaking, we are very happy with the relationship, and we will continue with the relationship, but obviously it's not going unnoticed, and that\u2019s sort of, was the point that even Rich was trying to point to remember.  We own this real-estate, we're just not the only owner of this real-estate. We own this real-estate with ProMedica. We\u2019re 80% owner they are 20% owner, they are as happy with this pricing as we are and you know they are very sophisticated business people. So they are thinking about the same thing that you and I are, so we\u2019ll see where we get to. Tayo Okusanya : Good, thank you. Tom DeRosa : Thanks Tayo. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is now open. Steven Valiquette : Great! Thanks, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just to come back to your comment on the flat trend for compensation per occupied room in senior housing, which is obviously encouraging. It kind of sounds like you were hopeful that the improving trend would stay, but you didn't have perfect visibility on it. I guess I just wanted to drill in a little bit deeper on what you think are the primary drivers of that improvement, whether it was just serendipitous or is it related to some specific programs where you are getting some early traction or maybe it's just too early to declare a victory on sustaining those trends. Just any extra color would help. Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Thank you very much. I want you to understand my comment. I said sequential trend on you know on the labor cost was flat. It was a sequential comment, not year-over-year comment.  You know, I do not want you to think that labor cost is being flat. My whole point was on a sequential basis and perhaps, just perhaps the second derivative of that growth is somewhat flattening. So it is still a big number that\u2019s going big time, maybe the rate of growth what we have seen in the last three, four, five years hopefully that is not going to be as bad as we have seen. It is a combination \u2013 and that is a hope. I specifically said, that we did not put that in our guidance. So if we do get that, it will be an upside to our numbers, but we did not obviously model that, because it could just be something serendipitous as you said.  There is a lot going on. If you go back about four quarters ago, I talked about different technologies that we're experimenting with and rolling out in different operating platforms. I think I specifically mentioned the use of one such that has helped one of our largest offered Sunrise to reduce their turnover, you know 30%. So we are not sitting on our hands and trying to get to somehow trying to outperform the market, we are trying to add _ through technology and is sort of that's where I will end. Tom. Tom DeRosa : Steve you saw that Phillips put out a press release a few months ago about the collaboration with Welltower at 56st Street. This building will have technology that no one in the senior housing industry has ever seen. We're hoping that this technology which will help monitor the needs of that population and anticipate their needs, will over time be able to \u2013 allow us to have more efficient labor models around how we manage this population.  You know when I took this job, and when I came off the board to be the CEO here, I remember the management team saying, \u2018Wow! this is such a great operator. They have two FTEs to every resident.\u2019 And I remember thinking and that's a good thing, that's not a good thing; that is not sustainable. And so we're looking for how do we improve resident experience and care and do it at a lower cost of labor, and the only answer we can think of is technology.  And the fact is we're going to have a great example to look at, which I know is just a few blocks from where you work Steve. So we\u2019ll have a chance in the later part of the spring early summer to have you see what's happening there, but we're excited about that. That's part of what we think we need to do as a company.  We are advancing this. This is not happening in the industry, it's happening because Welltower is using its tentacles and relationships to challenge the historic operating model in what was essentially a hospitality business, which has really become part of the healthcare continuum. That has been something we've done. That's not happening in the industry, so stay tuned for more of that. Steven Valiquette : Okay, also I definitely got the sequential part by the way. I mean on page three on the supplement you can see kind of the raw, dollar numbers on compensation, flat sequentially and then up about 3.5% year-over-year, which is a bit better than the 4% to 5% that\u2019s gets talked about.  Also just final thing on the subject, I was going to suggest a little bit tongue and cheek that perhaps you're grabbing all of the therapists that are being laid off in the skilled nursing sector because of PDPM, maybe re-employing them at lower wages in the assisted living, but obviously it\u2019s not that simple. But it could at least be a general factor in supply demand dynamics around skilled labor overall or do you think that's not really a factor. Shankh Mitra : Steve, I'm not an expert in that area and they'll stay away from making any comment. I'm happy to connect with you \u2013 connect you with our operating partners and the CEO of those operating partners, but by no means I want to pretend that I'm an expert in that area; we\u2019ll stay away from that comment. Tom DeRosa : But just to answer that, what I have seen is as the senior housing concept moves more in the direction of being part of the healthcare continuum. It attracts a different caliber of labor force, and you see that \u2013 when you see, there are a few health systems in this country that actually have their names on senior housing properties and also they also want skilled nursing properties. And they will tell you that there's an extra level of credibility, because these properties are associated with a highly respected health care system. So it does attract a better labor force and often times they have to pay them less, because people see a broader value property being associated.  So I think as we at Welltower start to move our portfolio more in that direction, towards the health system, the types of collaboration that you understand we have with payers, just legitimizes this business from the old age homes that exist all over the country and are still being built and still being invested in by REITs, that\u2019s now what we do. We are in a much higher value part of the chain here and we're driving that. So again, I always say this, but stay tuned. I mean we're so excited about where this is headed. Steven Valiquette : Okay, I appreciate the extra color. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Joseph with Citi. Your line is now open. Michael Bilerman : Hey, its Michael Bilerman here with Nick. I have a couple of, hopefully just quick follow-ups. In terms of \u2013 Tim, in your opening comments you talked about the balance sheet being a little bit more highly here today given the timing of the deals in the fourth quarter, and then you have the forward and then the disposition effective guidance that\u2019s there, which by the summer if you take them more forward would get you to the mid to high fives.  How should we think about, and it sounds like there\u2019s a lot of optimism here on investing pipeline, that you're not going to end up with the $600 million net disposure. How should we think about the funding of that net investment from this point forward? Tom DeRosa : Yes, thank Mike. I think that the \u2013 my prior comment on where disposition or where acquisition guidance is relative to where it may end up, is my intention in saying that it was directed towards this question, which is if we end up being a larger net acquirer, we're going to being a net acquirer, we will fund that all in real time. So on the capital recycling side, particularly as you kind of report that leverage metric four times a year, you can have a bit of choppiness in it, but there is just a bit more of choppiness in general when you're talking about selling buying assets, if we are not selling any more assets, you can count on us being capitalizing any further investment in lockstep.  So, you should assume that kind of leverage. My language around leverage holds our list of where we end up on the net disposition or acquisition side for the year. Michael Bilerman : Okay, so is your \u2013 I guess based on the acquisition pipeline you noted today, what should we expect you would do a big forward equity offering, so that you can take down this proceeds as those deals close or are you more apt today to sort of look into your portfolio and say, \u2018you know what, let's push more into the sales market today,\u2019 because obviously selling assets and raising equity given where your stock trades has very different accretion and implications and it's hard to see now which way you were leaning. Tom DeRosa : I think that the way that we think about that is, you know the sale of asset is being driven by the value that we are seeing in the market for them. And so it's been opportunistic and if we don\u2019t think there is kind of value there for assets, we\u2019ll continue to sell equity.  Your point on accretion is dead on, that we have not been selling assets because it\u2019s been more accretive to fund through this position of assets. We\u2019ve been selling assets because it's creating a much more, sustainable and high quality earnings stream from long term.  So the decision to sell has not been driven by where the capital markets kind of are at. In fact it's been counter to that and that was part of my opening remarks, just try to get that point that we are \u2013 there's [inaudible] from how we\u2019ve been continuing cap or recycle, but we think that\u2019s the right move and you know this is you, the cycle is \u2013 we are not calling the cycle but it certainly is closer to the end and the beginning and we are very aware of that. So that plays into the way that we capitalized and lockstep and certainly plays in the way that when we see bits per assets. We are not trying to real time value that relative to where our stock trades. Shankh Mitra : One thing to that, and I think you are now tired of hearing it from me, accretion is a question of \u2013 near term accretion is a question of cap rate, and we are not a cap rate buyer or cap rate seller right. We are total return buyer and total return seller. So there are still \u2013 there are assets on a total return basis that make sense to sell that will not make sense to sell if you just look at cap rate driven near term accretion. Michael Bilerman : Right. Tim, just going back to the same store policy and thank you for the presentation. Remind me between the 10-Q, 10-K and the supplemental, I know currency plays into it pro rata in terms of the Q and K doing a 100% and 0% of the unconsolidated. How does the stabilization on development methodology or guideline differ between the same store that you put in the queue, versus the supplemental. Is there a difference in methodology? Tim McHugh : Yeah, no difference. There will be no different the methodology there, and the two points you made, FX and pro rata are explained. The 80% plus of that delta and then we talk about, when I talk about aligning our policy and our SEC docks more with kind of how we look at in the supplement, part of that is that we things like transitions, these impacts same store. Those policies differ between those two docs at this point. So that\u2019s the idea that we\u2019ll align those more as years go on. Michael Bilerman : Right. But historically the stabilization methodology, the five quarter that you \u2013 or four quarter in the role from the fifth, that application was identical between the number in the Sup and the number in the 10-Q and 10-K. There is no difference in guideline or methodology or rule that you are using specifically on that item. Tim McHugh : Correct! We\u2019ve always \u2013 that\u2019s \u2013 I mean the commentary, we are suppose to kind of give you an idea. The reason why we approached if from a duration based test is because we think it's the simplest and the least subjective way and I think what\u2019s come out of this conversation is going to continuing. We think we provide ample disclosure to see how that, impacts our results and we are committed to continuing to do that, but that five quarters in is in both of those pools. Michael Bilerman : Okay, and then Tom just a review just on this topic and it sounded like from your answer to Rich\u2019s question that you know you guys have had a policy for less number of years, it\u2019s checked by the audit committee. You\u2019ve had discussions with the other two. The other two clearly came out consistent on Tuesday night. It seems as though there are differences or else you guys would have all come out at the same time. I'm reading from your comments if I read the tea leaves that I guess they weren't willing to come to you versus you're not willing to go to them, in terms of agreeing to a disclosure. Is that fair? Tim McHugh : This is Tim here. I wouldn't say that. One, I think that we want to avoid kind of getting into how that conversation played out. I think that as I said in my comment earlier, I think that the positive parts of this is for investors and analysts, I think there's alignment in getting more information out there. That certainly is our first and foremost goal here. But I think what was stressed there was that we wanted \u2013 our approach to this is on a total portfolio basis. So the idea is you know metrics matter. All of our metrics matter to investors. It\u2019s the way to value the entire portfolio and I don't think there's anything to read into of who would come one way versus the other. It's just an approach, a different approach. Tom DeRosa : And Michael, as I said earlier, we believe with respect to senior housing, we are a very different business than those other companies, and so we \u2013 our policy is what we believe is the best representation of how our assets are performing. What I would say is that our policy also has some downside risk to it for us as well. Because something moves into a same store pool, a new development moves into a same store pool, doesn't mean that in a year the occupancy might drop 10%. So it\u2019s not just an upside we are trying to play. I mean this is \u2013 you know we have thought very long and hard and with taking advice from others who we respect to build the same store policy that we think gives the best indication to our shareholders about how the assets are performing. So we stand by that and given that the scale and the dominance that we have, we think we're in the best position to dictate what policy should be. Michael Bilerman : Right, and that\u2019s 150 basis points to 275 down to the 125; the impact of the stabilization from the development, that\u2019s for 2019. Tim, are you saying that the effective 125 that you would report for a stable portfolio, is that supposed to be mimicking what Pete [ph] and Ventas are now reporting as their same store definition or do you believe there are still differences even on that measure. Tim McHugh : I\u2019m going to be clear to say that we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re certainly not trying to mimic anyone else's disclosure. We're trying to provide disclosure to investors that allow them to compare and do what they need to do. But that \u2013 your question on kind of the mimicking side is \u2013 our intension is to get more disclosure around it, so you can make adjustments or kind of use the numbers how you want to across different companies, but most importantly this is for our investors and the way we think investors should view our number. So I'm not going to comment on kind of how that compares to other policies. Shankh Mitra : One thing I would say Michael, if you just, you took the 150 basis points comment, but the other differentiation point that Tim laid out is the normalizers right. So you \u2013 if you are trying to get to a specific type of disclosure, I would not just take one, I would take both. So the net difference would be 100, not 150, and obviously Tim laid out the impact, that could be for next year. Michael Bilerman : Right. I was just trying to \u2013 by going to producing this, what you call stable, whether that was supposed to get closer to a comparable number. I understand the normalizing being ahead with this year, I\u2019m just trying to put all the pieces together to try to see whether there's commonality or not. Tim McHugh : Yeah, I mean that's what I said. The intent of it is to provide more, an answer to the discloser, to give you more information. I think that\u2019s what we are hearing from you, investors, etcetera, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to provide. Michael Bilerman : Okay, I appreciate you guys taking the time. Tom DeRosa : Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next question comes from Chad Vanacore with Stifel. Your line is open. Chad Vanacore : Alright, since the call is running long, I\u2019ll just keep it to one question. Just think about your managed care, it seems like you hit your expectations and since you\u2019ll be asset from the MOB market, can we see any expansion in the SNFs portfolio this year, maybe add some details about how you're dealing with the market for SNFs in terms of risk and returns. Shankh Mitra : Yes, thank you very much. Managed care portfolio did not hit our expectation, it exceeded our expectations significantly. If you go back and look at last call transcript, we talked about $300 million EBITDAR. As you look at in my prepared remarks, I said that we achieved $307 million EBITDAR, so that\u2019s point number one.  Point number two is, we are buyer of any asset class, skilled nursing included at a price. We think that today's skilled nursing market pricing is so hot that we should be a seller not a buyer. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Michael Mueller : Yeah hi, just a quick one. Same store policy aside, what has been the average time to stabilize your senior housing development and as you look at these urban projects that are going into the pipeline, do you think they will stabilize faster or at a similar pace? Shankh Mitra : We underwrite three years to stabilization. It depends on obviously product-to-product is different, market-to-market is different. Usually we have seen sort of between call it 18 months to 36 months of stabilization.  It does matter in a different product, at a different place. I will tell you an example of a product that would have taken a long time to stabilize, but has stabilized in 18 months. We have an asset that\u2019s with our partner Belmont Village in Westwood that opened weeks after Lehman Brothers collapsed. We thought that obviously that product will probably take three to four years to stabilize; it stabilized in eight months. So it really depends what the product is, what the offering is, when the demand of the market is, but a three year stabilization is on average what we underwrite. Michael Mueller : Got it! Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors. Your line is now open. Lukas Hartwich : Thanks, just one left for me. The year-over-year growth from the Belmont village portfolio has been pretty volatile. Can you provide a little color there? Shankh Mitra : It's actually not volatile. What you see on the sub is an annualized number. So if you look at in any given quarter, you are looking at year-over-year, you have to divide that by four and it is actually not volatile, it is one of our most consistent out performer of all assets we own. Lukas Hartwich : I guess, I am doing that, I'm comparing 4Q of \u201918 versus 4Q \u201919. Shankh Mitra : That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, you can\u2019t do that because that\u2019s an annualized number. What you see on the sub is multiplied by four is what you get. You understand what I'm saying? That is\u2026 Lukas Hartwich : I guess my question is, if the methodology is consistent throughout the years, wouldn't the trends be comparable? Shankh Mitra : No, it wouldn\u2019t be. I can tell you exactly. I don't want to get into these discussions of different operators, but I can tell you that Belmont actually had a very, very good year and the NOI was up for the year. Again, it\u2019s not a quarter-to-quarter business, it was up in the mid-single digits. Lukas Hartwich : Okay, maybe I'll follow up. Thank you. Shankh Mitra : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Nick Yulico : Okay, thanks. I'm going to avoid some of the philosophical discussion on same store, but instead I just had a question about for the guidance on 2020 senior housing operating. What percentage of the senior housing operating business is actually captured by that same store number? If you had it on NOI or number of assets, and the fourth quarter was 80% of your senior housing, NOI was in the same store, 67% of the properties. What is it for 2020? Tom DeRosa : So it will grow throughout the year. By the end of the year we\u2019ll be back at more than 90% of the pool is going to be and or our assets will be in the pool. So one of the reasons as you know that it gets below that kind of historical number has been the transition piece and importantly that's not what those essence were in senior housing operating, they were in triple-net. So we\u2019ve added assets to that SHOW pool, but you'll see as the year progresses that number will grow when you'll be back above kind of 90% and the delta at that point will be primarily just acquisition activity.  So in reality if we don't buy anything it probably is well above 90%, but just thinking about kind of where it\u2019s at historically, we are back at or above kind of historical trends by the fourth quarter. Nick Yulico : Thank you. Tom DeRosa : Thank you. Operator : I'm showing no further questions in queue at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q1 2020 Welltower Inc. Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on-mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I\u2019d now like to hand the call over to Mr. Matt McQueen, Senior Vice President of General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir. Matt McQueen : Thank you, Andrea and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Tom for his remarks. Tom. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Matt. Good morning. I'd first like to say that I hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I know many of us have been directly impacted by COVID-19 and all of us have been indirectly impacted in some way which is having an overwhelming effect in shaping everything we are experiencing during this extraordinary period. Seniors with multiple chronic conditions who populate our senior housing property are vulnerable to any virus or infection and particularly affected by COVID-19. Historically our operators have implemented time-tested protocols for flu and inflection control that have proven to mitigate the impact of prior influenza outbreaks. However, we now know that COVID-19 is not an influenza outbreak but has become a global pandemic. Further we have learned our society's ability to slow the spread of COVID-19 rests solely with social distancing measures, given the lack of vaccines or drug therapies. The high level of personal care delivered to senior living residents combined with the fact that COVID-19 can be spread by asymptomatic residents, family members and care staff has resulted in many challenges for our operators. As Shankh and Tim will describe, our business had a strong start to the year but starting in mid-March data began to show that the growing impact of COVID-19 would make this performance not sustainable. In an effort to maintain transparency regarding our business, we have issued regular updates, which have provided context for declines in occupancy we started to see in late March that have continued through April. Given the tremendous uncertainty we face from the business model build to own real estate that enables the health and wellness needs of vulnerable seniors to be met in residential settings, this morning's call will be more focused on steps we are taking to manage this uncertainty. As Tim will discuss, we acted quickly to bolster our liquidity position. We also took numerous steps to help support our senior housing operators, health system, post-acute care and medical office tenants through this unprecedented period. For example, in March, we started to source and distribute much needed personal protective equipment or PPE for many of our operators and tenants who could not access for example, masks, gloves, gowns and testing kits. These efforts have helped our operators and tenants to better protect their staffs and residents. This is not what a REIT typically does. But extraordinary measures are often needed in extraordinary times like these. We told you in March that we would use data to guide all decisions regarding our business. Therefore, occupancy declines within our senior housing operating portfolio, a continual increase in operator expenses due to staffing and the cost of PPE, rent deferment requests from medical office tenants and the impacts of a sharp decline in elective surgeries combined \u2013 contributed to our decision to withdraw our 2020 guidance on April 17. There is much outside of our control, but we are taking steps to manage what is within our control. After a successful program to reduce overall G&A spend over the past three years, we believe we can lower G&A expenses this year by approximately $10 million to $15 million on an annualized basis by reducing compensation and non-compensation expenses. Additionally, at this point, we believe that it would not be prudent to pay 100% of our dividend, until we have more clarity regarding our cash flow for the year. So we've decided to pay 70% of our pre-COVID dividend. This was also a data-driven decision but it was by no means an easy decision. But we believe this is in the best long-term interests of our shareholders. Virtually overnight, COVID-19 has meaningfully impacted our business and changed our near-term objectives. However, we remain committed to our long-term strategy of being an important platform and real estate partner for constituents across the health care continuum to enable them to more effectively achieve the goals of value-based health care. Critical to our strategy is to focus on ensuring that the social determinants of health are met for all populations and especially for vulnerable populations like seniors. Since we began to shelter in place, even the most resilient people have experienced challenges with basic social determinants, such as sourcing groceries, medication and isolation and loneliness. Residential care concepts like senior housing allow these much needed activities of daily living to be delivered in consistent, supportive, efficient, and cost-effective ways. This is why we believe in the long-term viability of this business. When COVID-19 is a bad memory, we will still need to meet the health and wellness needs of a rapidly aging population and to reimagine and develop a more sustainable health care delivery infrastructure. That being said, we believe we are taking the necessary steps to navigate this uncertain environment and withstand the volatility presented by this pandemic so that we can meet this mission. And with that, I will turn this over to Tim McHugh who will take us through the financials. Tim? Tim McHugh : Thank you, Tom. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2020 results. The early impact of COVID-19 and our tenants observed within the quarter and into April. And finally, a capital activity and balance sheet update. As a reminder to everyone on the call, Welltower removed all components of full year guidance in mid-April, after reviewing our first month of financial results with the impact of COVID-19. We believe the extent of COVID-19's impact on our portfolio will depend on many factors. We cannot accurately predict the future implications this pandemic will have in our business trends at this time. Although, there is no assurance that we are currently experiencing peak impact as it pertains to both our business or the broader economy, we are hopeful that we are moving through the period of peak uncertainty. And as that uncertainty diminishes, we'll be able to provide you more clarity on our outlook. Moving to the quarter, Welltower reported normalized FFO of $1.02 per diluted share for the first quarter. These results included a total of $7 million or approximately $0.02 per diluted share of unanticipated property level costs in our senior housing operating portfolio, associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Welltower is elected to not normalize these COVID-related expenses from both FFO and same-store results. Now turning to our individual portfolio of components. First, our Seniors Housing Triple-Net portfolio delivered 3% year-over-year same-store growth and both occupancy and EBITDAR coverages were flat on a sequential basis. As a reminder, our Triple-Net lease portfolio operating stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2019 and therefore do not reflect any impact in COVID-19. We expect our Seniors Housing Triple-Net operators to experience similar headwinds as everyday operators during the second quarter. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated 2.6% year-over-year same-store growth. And EBITDAR coverage declined by three basis points sequentially. On to health systems which is comprised of our joint venture with ProMedica. As indicated on last quarter's call, EBITDAR growth was strong in the fourth quarter in this portfolio and subsequently rent coverage improved eight basis points sequentially to 2.14 times. Rent collection across our Triple-Net segments including seniors housing, long-term post-acute and health systems was consistent with the historical in the first quarter. In April, we have collected 97% of total rents due. Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical portfolio had another consistent quarter delivering 2.1% same-store growth. Our rent collection was in line with historical norms in the first quarter and in April we collected or approved rent deferral on 95% of our rent due. Early on in the pandemic, we are in active discussions with our tenants that were most impacted by the considerable slowdown in the facilities-based revenue streams, most significantly elected procedures. We focused on providing 60-day deferrals spanning April and May and as a result of these discussions, we've approved approximately 8% of our monthly rents for two-month deferral plans with payback periods within calendar year 2020. As of today, we believe approximately 25% of these deferrals, we brought current in the near term as tenants received financial support and see operations begin to open back up. Lastly, our Seniors Housing operating portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI declined 1.6% in the quarter. A stronger-than-expected first two months of the year were more than offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on both March occupancy and expenses with approximately 5.2 million of unanticipated expenses occurring in the property level within our same-store pool. As a reminder, we did not normalize COVID-related expenses out of our same-store metrics. Turning to April and as highlighted in our business update presentation released alongside our earnings last night, we experienced an acceleration in the occupancy pressures that began in March, as total portfolio occupancy fell 240 basis points in the month of April versus a 70 basis point decline in March, driven primarily by a significant decrease in move-ins as outright admission bans became more common across our portfolio at the start of April. We expect these occupancy declines to continue throughout the second quarter with occupancy expected to decrease 500 to 600 basis points by June 30th. We intend to continue our periodic updates throughout the second quarter to help investors and analysts better understand these trends. Before turning to the balance sheet, I wanted to make one final point on same-store. As I alluded to last quarter and as shown in this morning's 10-Q, we have aligned our Q and K disclosures of same-store with our supplemental disclosures, but the only difference is being the normalizations that we detail on page 22 of our supplement consistent with historical disclosure practices. Now on to the balance sheet and capital activity. I want to move through these highlights in two distinct sections. First our balance sheet, focusing on both liquidity and leverage; and then capital spend as it pertains to investments, developments, CapEx, corporate overhead and lastly our dividend. Starting with capital market activity. In early March we obtained commitments for a two-year unsecured term loan of $1 billion bearing interest at LIBOR plus 120 with the right to further upsize the borrowed amount by $200 million. We've closed on this loan on April 1st and the loan will be drawn in the second quarter. During the quarter we issued approximately two million shares via our DRIP and ATM forward programs at a weighted average price of $83.94 per share for estimated proceeds of $171 million. At the end of the quarter, we settled these in all prior forward sale agreements totaling 6.8 million shares and average price of $86.48 per share for $588 million of gross proceeds. The settlement of these forwards this brings Welltower's equity raise via DRIP and ATM since the start of 2019 to $1.7 billion at an average price of $80.64. Following these activities and as of May 4, we have approximately $2.36 billion of capacity under our $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, $1 billion of capacity under our undrawn term loan and cash and cash equivalents of $348 million, totaling just over $3.7 billion of liquidity with no unsecured debt maturities until 2023. Turning to leverage. We ended the quarter at 5.93 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a 44 basis point sequential decrease from year-end. Although, we expect EBITDA to experience more bearing in the coming quarters due to the impact of COVID-19, we believe our leverage position entering this challenging period as well as our liquidity position will allow us to endure this period of uncertainty. Moving to capital spend and starting with investments. In the first quarter, we completed $398 million of acquisitions across four separate transactions at a blended yield of 5.6%. We have no further material acquisitions under contract for the remainder of 2020. On the disposition front, we completed $781 million of pro rata dispositions including $64 million related to a disposition of an unconsolidated equity investment during the quarter. We anticipate another $386 million of property sales during the remainder of the year including $121 million of sales and the final two tranches of our Invesco JV, the first of which closed in April for $74 million. Moving to development, we completed the $141 million of development spend in the quarter. We expect development spend of $463 million for the remainder of the year and then only $178 million of spend beyond 2020 to complete our current pipeline. The large majority of our development pipeline in the final stages of construction, we continue to view these developments as excellent uses of capital and as a medium-term source of natural deleveraging as they begin to produce cash flow over the next 24 months. Turning to capital spend on our existing portfolio. We anticipate reducing our CapEx by approximately $90 million from our initial budget for 2020. This will be accomplished from a combination of tighter restrictions and project work during the pandemic, deferred leasing capital on outpatient medical as leasing activity slows during the same period and also some delaying of larger capital projects across all asset types until we have more certainty around our outlook. Now on to corporate overhead. I first want to start by acknowledging the incredible work done across our organization over the past two months. We've spent considerable time over the last four years, focusing on lowering the run rate costs of managing our business on behalf of shareholders. Our core initiative in this pursuit has been the operational efficiencies gained through streamlining reporting systems. And although we certainly did not have this current pandemic in mind when we were designing these processes, it has certainly paid off as our accounting, FP&A, tax and treasury teams amongst many others have done a tremendous job keeping our organization functioning at a very high level while working from home. On the corporate overhead front, we've lowered our expectations for full year G&A to between $125 million to $130 million versus our prior guidance of $140 million. This reduction is being driven by expected reductions in management and incentive compensation, reduction in travel expenses and new hires and a minimization of all discretionary corporate spend. Lastly as announced in last night's earnings release, we have decided to reduce our quarterly dividend to 70% of our pre-COVID quarterly dividend levels, resulting in a $0.61 per share dividend declared last night. Given the uncertainty surrounding the short and long-term impact of COVID-19 in our business and the broader economy as a whole, we felt preserving liquidity by reducing our second quarter dividend to better match our near-term expectations of underlying cash flow was the most prudent way for us to maximize balance sheet stability as we navigate these unprecedented times. We expect to further evaluate our long-term dividend policy as the year progresses. And with that, I will hand the call over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I will comment on our operating environment and follow-up with our thoughts on capital allocation. When we last spoke with you on our Q4 earnings call, we had a bullish outlook for the business with a sharp portfolio gaining strength, our MOB portfolio retooled and executing on leasing and significant relationships with health systems were formed. In January and February, we delivered results that were ahead of this bullish outlook. And then with a flip of a switch our business changed in March due to COVID-19. If you pass through our Q1 sharp results, you will notice that despite the impact of COVID-19 in March, we still delivered a 3.6% same-store RevPAR growth for the quarter. That indicates to you how strong this year could have been if COVID-19 didn't happen. But COVID-19 did happen. And there is no question that our operating earnings will be considerably lower as a result. Densely populated coastal markets have consistently helped us to maintain strong pricing power in our shop business. Unfortunately many of these markets have also become hotspot for the virus. On the positive side, we are starting to see some relative stabilization in the Seattle area where pandemic has started. But on the other hand, we're seeing New York, New Jersey getting hit hard with no sign of stabilization just yet. There are three topics that are top of our minds as far as operations are concerned. Number one, resident safety and employee safety. This is the highest priority for us and our operators. Tom, discussed how swift actions we have taken on PPE side. Two, labor. In the short-term we're experiencing elevated expense levels as Tim described though we are encouraged by the expanded labor pools interest in our business as seniors housing is one of the few industries that is hiring today. And three, leasing velocity and occupancy. We have provided you the details of occupancy decline since COVID-19 breakout along the way through our business update. We lost approximately 70 basis points of occupancy in March, 240 basis points occupancy in April in our total SHO portfolio. Occupancy will continue to drop until our operators lift admissions ban. It is challenging to predict exactly when that will take place. I have discussed with you the details of our SHO portfolio construction and how portfolio's diversity of location, acuity, price point, et cetera results in lack of a correlated growth amongst our different operators. We have tested these models again and again and sensitized for business cycles and even debt supercycles. However, what we are faced with today is a once-in-a-century pandemic, which has led to a perfect storm of an entire economy effectively sheltered in place and a virus that disproportionately affects our frail senior population. The result is a closing of the front door of many of our communities across the portfolio. And with that our diversification benefit has been compromised. But we remain committed to our long-term strategy and portfolio construction. On the asset side, we cannot manage a portfolio for once-in-a-century black swan pandemic event that's why we maintained meaningful financial flexibility on the other side of the balance sheet in terms of liquidity, leverage, debt maturity, meaningful unused capacity of secured debt particularly those available from GSEs and CMHC, should we get asset mix wrong at a given moment in time. And in this context, let's not forget seniors housing is also a form of housing and has broader access to debt capital than most other forms of real estate. As we sit here today, we see a wide range of outcome both with the pandemic and with the economy. The range of outcome has somewhat narrowed on both of these areas as infection curve has started to flatten and the Federal Reserve's forceful intervention in late March has started the flow of credit again. The range of outcome still remains meaningfully wide and we will continue to maintain significant financial flexibility until we have further clarity. As Tom and Tim discussed, distributing out majority of our cash flow in this uncertain environment with a wide range of outcomes is not a prudent capital-allocation decision at this point in time. This retention of cash flow is obviously an extremely positive -- credit positive event in the near term, but we also think it will turn out to be a very positive outcome for our continuing shareholders as it puts us another step closer towards playing offense and helps us avoid dilutive capital raises that we have observed coming out of the last cycle. In the last two months, which feels like a lifetime now all of our capital-allocation activities can be thought in two distinct mental models; short-term defense and long-term offense. Short-term defense, we acted swiftly to arrange term loan to bolster our liquidity settled our forward equity program completed many in-process dispositions and pivoted away from our acquisition outlook. All of these actions were done with a view to respond defensively in a short -- really short period of time. We are working with our operating partners to fine-tune our CapEx spending for rest of the year working through our leases with tenants across all three lines of our businesses and executing our long-term business plan with different operators in certain select assets where it's appropriate. We're also contemplating a number of development -- we're also completing a number of development projects in 2020, which you know is the last year of our significant committed development spend. We're not done with this work stream by any means, but we made significant progress in this area of short-term defense. Long-term offense. This work stream is now under progress, but is by design behind the previous set of actions. We're focused on our portfolio both in terms of refinancing and recapitalization and starting to contemplate what opportunities might emerge for us to deploy capital. Asset values have clearly come down from pre-COVID levels. We just don't know to what extent yet. As we highlighted in our earnings release last night, a large seniors housing transaction that we discussed on our last call after the purchase and sale agreement was executed eventually did not close. The post-COVID world is more uncertain and we understand that people get cold feet. That near-term uncertainty has an impact on asset pricing. That is true for all the assets that we might be a buyer as well. We have always been price-sensitive and will continue to be even more so going forward. We remain excited about the prospects of our industry with a great demographic tailwind, especially in light of near-term supply which should decline substantially. Any incremental capital we deploy will be done after maintaining a sound balance sheet, ample liquidity and a laser-focused attention on price with a margin of safety. I would like to conclude by saying COVID-19 has created a very challenging backdrop for us. While we cannot control what happens to macro environment around us such as the pandemic, we can control how we respond to it. You as our shareholders, employ us as the managers of the business to make capital and resource-allocation decisions to create long-term value per share for continuing shareholders. We described the capital-allocation decisions we have taken so far and there are more to come. I hope our actions to prudently allocate resources to further bolster our cash flow by reducing G&A, a significant portion of which will come out of management compensation is a reflection of our alignment with you. This year has been a painful year for our shareholders and we are stepping in to share that pain with you. We ourselves are shareholders in the business and think of the stock we own as the ownership and partnership interest in the business that you all collectively own. We value this business on long-term occupancy cash flow and margin subject to a floor of replacement cost of the physical real estate not just to move around that gets valued and marked by -- marked every day by whoever wins the contest of exposure popularity or earnings prediction for the next quarter. Uncertain times are unsettling, but they create opportunity to create significant value for our shareholders over the long-term. With that, I'll pass back the mic to Tom. Tom? Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Shankh. Before we open the line for questions, I just would like to say that I'm very fortunate to work with such a team of talented and dedicated individuals who are coming together during the harshest of circumstances. All of you know it's not easy to be working remotely and having a team that's used to being together and work remotely. Yet, the entire Welltower team has proven their commitment to our company's goals and are playing a critical role in our long-term success and I could not be more appreciative of their efforts. I'm happy to share with you this morning that our Board recently moved to recognize two of our most trusted leaders. As a result Shankh Mitra has been named Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer in addition to his role as Chief Investment Officer; and Tim McHugh has been named an Executive Vice President in addition to serving as Chief Financial Officer. Shank and Tim are being recognized for their intellect experience, broad internal and external leadership and dedication to Welltower. I'm extremely grateful and proud to work shoulder to shoulder albeit virtually now with both of them every day as we navigate Welltower through a period of great uncertainty toward brighter days ahead. So before we open for questions, I'd just like to say that we ask that you please limit your question to one question. And if you have another question to please jump back in the queue because a number of analysts have asked that we -- they may have to jump off the call a bit early because of the number of companies reporting today. So I ask you to please adhere to that. And with that -- and we'll stay on to answer all your questions. So, with that, I'll turn -- Andrea, you can open up the line. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Once again, for time sake, we are allowing one question and if there is a follow-up question, please reenter the queue. Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and the prepared remarks. When I look at the SHOW portfolio occupancy trends through May 1 and compare that to what you expect by end of June, it seems like things are expected to be less worse in May and June. But then in the slide deck you say, the number of communities that move-in restrictions is expected to rise. Can you just clarify these seemingly conflicting statements and maybe give any commentary on occupancy or expense trajectory beyond June assuming the trends do match what you're projecting for this month and next? Thanks. Tom DeRosa : Jonathan, I'm going to have Shankh to answer that, but it's going to be -- it's very hard for us to predict anything beyond the second quarter. But, Shankh, why don't you jump in and give your thoughts? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So Jonathan, as you know that we are expecting 500 to 600 basis points of occupancy decline for the second quarter. And that should be seen with -- obviously, coupled with the comment that's right next to it, about our comments on pricing. So, obviously, those two are interrelated and should be seen as together. But, obviously, the fact is right now majority of our communities, almost half of it, is completely shut down from new admissions' perspective and others are, relatively speaking, behaving like they were shut down, at least in the month of April. We're starting to see billings or are at least starting to open up. Communities are starting to accept new residents or we're having conversations with where our operators are telling us that they're optimistic, their buildings will start to open, sometimes in May, sometimes in June. But I want to remind you, this is obviously a decision of our operators and it's taken at the ground level community by community. So we're telling you what we are hearing, but if we knew exactly what will happen, then we would not be taking the decision that we have taken with our dividend and with our guidance. So, understand there is significant uncertainty. And as we know more, we will, as Tim said, we will let you know more. But we're telling you what we are hearing from our operating partners. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to try to understand a little more the dividend reset and how the $0.61 was maybe arrived. I'm just trying to figure out if that's tied to thinking about taxable net income in a specific way or how the SHOW portfolio may trend and whether there could be, maybe, a true-up dividend at the end of the year to get you to either taxable income or maybe even a further cut. I'm just trying to understand how the 30% was sort of arrived. Tim McHugh : Yes, Steve. This is Tim here and I'll take that. So you're correct in thinking through this from the dividend, largely following taxable book income, as part of kind of REIT rules. Our view is that -- I mean, not our view, our expectation is that taxable book income will largely follow profitability. So there shouldn't be a large gap between what you see on the operating performance side and what ends up being kind of taxable income for the year. So you should think without getting too much into kind of how those two things might be slightly different within any given period, you should view the dividend cut is just being more a review on our -- on the management team view of where short-term cash flow's gone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra of Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess there's a lot of uncertainty on the SHOW side and I -- it's tough to predict out more than the quarter. But can you maybe give us some color on how you're viewing the Triple-Net portfolio? How underlying performance is relative to the SHO portfolio recently and the potential need there for restructurings? Tim McHugh : Yes, Vikram. Tim here, again. I noted in my prepared remarks and what we -- how we're kind of thinking about that is Triple-Net or RIDEA is the same business in a different financial structure, right? And we've spent a lot of time talking about there being differences in our ability to control CapEx, various reasons why -- how our businesses evolve as we've become an owner of RIDEA properties in larger part versus Triple-Net properties. But the underlying businesses are largely the same. And the day-to-day business that goes in those facilities is the same. So we expect the performance of assets within the Triple-Net to be very similar to the RIDEA. Obviously, different according to different types of facilities, different geographies, et cetera. But our expectation is that, the Triple-Net fundamentals very much follow the fundamentals from RIDEA side. And as we kind of think about that in terms of how that impacts financials, I think the most conservative way to think about it is that long-term rents in any Triple-Net are going to follow the economics of the buildings. There's a lot more complexity to forecasting that than there's RIDEA where if we think about fundamentals and how they flow we'll see that go one-for-one into our financials. And I'll just say that we've been -- we mentioned rent collections in Seniors Housing Triple-Net to this point have been strong. And it continued to be even into May. And I think that we have not entered any deferral programs. We'll continue to update the market as we kind of think through that. But there will be I think some difference between kind of how those rent checks come in and underlying EBITDAR for some period of time. And it probably matters on the duration of weakness and the extent of it to how -- if any restructures occur how and when they occur. Shankh Mitra : Vikram, I'll add a couple of -- two more points to that just to give you some more color. First is, our Triple-Net portfolio geographic obviously very different from obviously our SHO portfolio. And if you think about the biggest impact of where COVID happened is primarily coast to coast, right? So a lot of other markets obviously not similarly hit. But that will be one source of differentiation. The second source of differentiation as you know in the Triple-Net lease very simplistically speaking right your cost is relatively known to the landlord that you write a check and you collect every dollar of cash flow after that. So if you're an operator and you have collected every dollar of cash flow above that, you have intrinsically assumed that you have the risk both up and down. That is what the structure is. Now how we view some of these situations depending obviously on duration of the spending and the effect of the spending et cetera, but how we'll act will depend on what we think of you just as we did with the Triple-Net lease between Welltower and you how -- what is our thought on you as an operator? If you think that you're a good operator in your market and this is a pretty unfortunate event that happened for one time then we'll act one way. If you think that you are not a good operator and have never been a good operator or it's not -- we don't see eye to eye on how the business should go forward, then it will be hard for us to tell you the upside is yours and downside is all our shareholders. That's not how we think. And so, it is going to be a much more nuanced answer that will be based on case by case. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Bilerman with Citi. Michael Bilerman : I don't know if it was Tom or Shankh that you mentioned you don't run your business for 100-year century type event. But I guess with the mindset of what has occurred do you think about portfolio diversification in terms of the level of senior housing assets that you have both within SHO as well as net lease as a percentage of the total especially as -- especially on the IL side and much less need based than your skilled or your higher acuity assets. And whether you'd want to pursue a more broadly diversified health care portfolio that's more equal weighted across the number of different health care verticals and how does going through this experience even though it hasn't happened since the 1918 Spanish Flu. Does it change your perspective of how you want to have your diversification by health care type? Tom DeRosa : That's a good question, Michael. Let me start off. Look we still believe that because of the aging of the population and because of the needs of a population seniors who are going to be living longer, we are still committed to models that bring those seniors together in settings that can better manage their needs whether they are less acute or more acute. So we -- while we are sitting at a moment in time that that is challenging that model, we think -- we don't think there's a better alternatives longer-term than putting seniors in environments where you hear me talk about this a lot. Their social determinant needs can be met effectively and cost efficiently. At the same time, we're opportunistic we're capital allocators and we look across all sectors of health care. I would say that prior to the last two-plus months you saw us making progress with a number of our health system initiatives, which would have started to bring in more diversification into our portfolio. Remember that the nation's health systems are thinking very differently about where they will provide their services in the future what different settings outside of the hospital. And many of them are aligned with us about settings that where they can better deliver services to seniors. So we're very much still committed to the senior business, because we think it has the biggest impact on the future of health care. Shankh, do you want to add anything to that? Shankh Mitra : Yeah. Michael a couple of more granular points. First is the Welltower's portfolio is primarily a need based portfolio except \u2013 I mean, when I say U.S. our portfolio. Our U.S. and U.K. portfolio is primarily a need based portfolio. We have a couple of operating partners who are primarily independent living provider in the U.S., which we also think that in right markets with the right operator can be a very good business. But generally speaking our U.K. U.S. business \u2013 our U.S. and U.K. business are need-based business. Our independent living exposure that you're talking about is primarily a Canadian business. And we think that business is a very different business. We think that business is a housing alternative business and that will continue to do well. If you ask me today that where is the biggest opportunity as we see price aside you know that first thing we think about is price and we're a buyer of everything at a price. Price aside all things being equal I think there is no other real estate asset class that I know of that has a better opportunity to create long-term value than senior housing. So price aside if you told me that I have $1 to invest where would I invest on all health care asset classes given what the returns are going to be where total return investors I fundamentally think that will be senior housing. So if anything our exposure we'd like to take it up not down. Now, again that's the price aside comment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Rich Anderson : Hey, good morning and thanks for the color and commentary, tough times as we all know. My question is perhaps more big picture. I wonder, if you would at least be open to the possibility of a fundamental change in the back end of this particularly senior housing into skilled nursing where social distancing may be here to stay in some form and how that might manifest itself in the business longer term. Shankh your comments about no better asset class and perhaps that will prove to be a very reasonable observation longer term. But will there be an incremental frictional vacancy within the four walls of these asset classes? And are you giving that any thought or is it just too soon to know if there will be some sort of fundamental changes. It's hard to imagine we would go through all this and there's not going to be some fundamental change to how these businesses operate at the back end of all of this. Tom DeRosa : Yeah. That's a fair question Rich. Look it's hard for us to make predictions right now based on what we've been dealing with in the pandemic. Well, I think that there will be fundamental changes in the service model and the asset positioning? Somewhat, I mean we were headed there particularly with technology companies. And I think there's going to be more new technologies that will enter senior living buildings that will essentially create tremendous efficiencies and mitigate some of the risks that we're seeing today due to an infection or a viral outbreak in buildings. I think it's very early to say if social distancing is going to be the way of a future. I mean that's a \u2013 if that's true if we're going to live in a world where we have to stand six feet apart from each other I think every business is going to be challenged and \u2013 but I'm hopeful that's not the future. I'm hopeful that we will get through this period and come back to the types of models that have been evolving to manage what is still one of the biggest demographic issues we've seen which is the aging of the population. And I also believe a health care system a health care delivery infrastructure that will have been compromised by this pandemic. And we already know that many leaders of health systems are thinking very differently about the setting in which they meet their constituencies. So, Rich it's very early to say. I'm hopeful we don't live in a world where we have to stand six feet apart from each other long term. Shankh you have anything to add. Shankh Mitra : Yes Tom. Rich, if you think about we're always data dependent and if we're always open to the possibilities if that was your question we always are. If things change we will change. But I can tell you if you read the letters that we receive our operators receive and that they share with us sometimes we receive together about what our customers are saying and what we think is the pent-up demand for this business is we do not believe that's happening. If anything I'm not sure you saw -- or you read about Governor Cuomo's presentation yesterday. Majority of the people at least in New York where this data is published with COVID coming to hospitals are coming from homes. Only 4% of the people who are coming to New York hospitals are actually coming from assisted living. That tells you that our industry is doing something right. Now if things change we will change. But we believe that our operators and all of our people in the frontline are doing an amazing work to keep our residents safe. There's obviously no guarantee. Pandemic is everywhere. That's why it's called pandemic, right? But all seeing -- when that's all done when -- and as Tom said when COVID is a distant memory it might prove out to be the other way too. But we are always open to facts and we're always open to new possibilities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Todd Stender with Wells Fargo. Todd Stender : Hi. Thanks, guys. I hope everyone is well\u2026 Shankh Mitra : Thanks, Todd Todd Stender : in Seattle. Thank you. In Seattle, Shankh you're seeing improvement or stabilization. However you characterized it. Is it occupancy? Is it prospects of move-ins, expense control? Just trying to get a sense of how close or far away you are from seeing any signs of improvement in the New York, New Jersey area. Shankh Mitra : So Todd in Seattle in the beginning of this -- Seattle fell off the cliff at the beginning of this when we started giving you, obviously, all these updates. Occupancy was going down 90 basis points, 100 basis points a week. Now we are seeing occupancy is going down more like 30 basis points, 40 basis points a week something like that. So it is still going down. But obviously, the second derivative improved significantly. All I was pointing out on the other hand in New York, you have seen the infection curve has flattened and it's coming down. But it's sort of -- it's still pretty peak panic here. And obviously, all the states are not open yet. And when that happens, obviously, we'll see the impact on occupancy. But I was trying to drive, sort of, two distinction. It is purely a function of not only the psyche of the consumer, but also how safe our operators feel. I'll give you an example. One of our worst-performing market today is L.A. Southern California has been years- in years- out one of our best performing markets. And why is L.A. which is not as you think it's probably -- you don't think about L.A. today as sort of the most impacted COVID-impacted market. It is meaningfully impacted, but that's not sort of, what you call the eye of the storm. The reason being all of our operators have buildings admissions banned everywhere in Southern California in L.A. particularly. So it is a function of when our operators feel safe enough to open the buildings for new residents. And when that happens you will see occupancy will come back. It is hard to say when that will happen. I will give you some more color for you to think about. Four weeks ago, when we were seeing occupancies going down so let's call it 60 basis points whatever we said in our business update, all our operators were coming down significantly, right? I mean it's happening across the board. You see the first impact. Whoever moves out was \u2013 moves. And obviously buildings are shut down. Now we're seeing more nuanced approach and difference of performance. We're seeing some of our operators have flattened out literally flat. We are seeing a couple of our operators are starting to gain occupancy as they have started to open some of the communities particularly as of May 1. So they are more nuanced location by location uncorrelated performance that's based on demographic, psychographics and supply of a given location is starting to happen. But it is too early to say when that will completely manifest and we get back to the norm. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Yeah, thanks. Shankh in your prepared remarks you kind of commented that there might be some investment opportunities as the result of this. I mean how should we expect that Welltower is going to pursue those types of deals? Do you want to wait until the market stabilizes a bit until you actually have some clarity of what's actually going on? Or you be more opportunistic to find some distressed opportunities? Shankh Mitra : Thank you for that question, Mike. So clarity often comes with a price right? When you mean clarity, you probably mean that when we have clarity, we have a line of the goalpost of what we know what will happen to the NOI. That is generally true for majority of the businesses. It doesn't have to be true for real estate. You know what it costs to build a building in a given location. So if that's the case you can bake in what is the price per door, price per foot of a specific opportunity and then you can have enough margin of safety that you don't have to know what will be the NOI next three months. We have never bought buildings that way. We have our view of what is the margin occupancy and obviously pricing of a building should be with our operators and specific with us \u2013 one of our specific operators and we will act accordingly. But it has to be priced in so that we can take that near-term uncertainty to create long-term value. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Good morning, everyone. Thank you. Tom you mentioned hospitals. So the CARES Act has essentially provided the federal backstop to hospitals. And we feel deem them critical infrastructure. Does this change your view at all on the future of hospital investments within the overall health system? And secondly do we still have too many? Tom DeRosa : I think there are still too many hospitals in the U.S. and I think you're going to continue to see consolidation. I think that it's very interesting. If you look at the hospitals Derek you've got many of them who are operating at 50% capacity because elective surgeries have fallen off the cliff and they've not had as many COVID cases. So it's a very challenging time for the health systems. And I \u2013 again it's very hard to predict the future based on where we sit right now in the middle of this pandemic. But I don't \u2013 I think ultimately we have \u2013 you're going to see broader outpatient strategies by health systems a movement away from the hospital. At least that's what we're seeing from our conversations. And obviously, our health systems are on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic and the government has responded by supporting them through this. Because their beds are filled with people many health systems in the hotspots are filled with people with COVID and they do not have the elective surgeries. And a lot of those are being pushed off. It's a real \u2013 it's created a very challenging environment for our health systems today. But again Derek I wouldn't again make too many predictions based on the COVID-19. I think it's going to badly damage a lot of health care infrastructure. But I think to a large extent it's going to have to be rethought and reimagined. So again hard to make any predictions but I would say that we still from our conversations we think health systems are looking to deliver their services basically outside of the four walls of the traditional acute care hospital. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. Jordan Sadler : Thanks. Just wanted to touch on sort of green shoots if I could. I know it's way, way too early. But can you maybe just point to sort of the best story in the portfolio? And what you're seeing? I think you did highlight Seattle but anywhere else that's sort of maybe driving what seems to be a little bit of optimism at least in the occupancy forecast for May and June in the SHO portfolio? Just tell us what's happening. Shankh Mitra : Yes so, John I know you know this. I know we have said this many times I'm going to have to \u2013 I'm going to say it again. It is too early to comment what \u2013 how things are going to play out. If we knew exactly what is going to happen we would not have done what we have done by reducing the dividend, right? I hope you acknowledge that. Having said that, I can tell you, there are two types of stories. One I mentioned, we're seeing, across the board, this is not just a Welltower comment. I think you have to acknowledge how hard people on the frontline are working to keep our residents safe provide all the assistance of daily living it is very, very hard. And we are seeing all these letters that are coming from our operators were sharing with us all these letters where residents and their families are thanking our operating partners how much that means to them and how good they feel that they're taken care of in this kind of when this pandemic goes on. That tells us the product there's a true need for the product. Now, as I told you that we \u2013 the moment, one of our operators opened a handful of buildings on May 1, the moment that building opened occupancy went up on that day 50 basis points, right? I had a conversation a couple of days ago with one of our operators, one of our best operators in the New Jersey, New York market and the CEO told me that if she opens up buildings today, the occupancy can go up by 300 basis points. There is that much pent up demand. I'm not trying to tell you that it's true for every building. I'm not trying to tell you that will happen. The moment all these communities open occupancy is going to go up by 300 basis points. You asked for a positive story. I gave you a positive story of what we are hearing. It is too early to say how things will play out. If we knew exactly how it will play out we will not be doing what we just did. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I just had a question about some of the normalizing adjustments you guys have for FFO. So you had a straight-line rent receivable write-off that -- in conjunction with an amended lease. Trying to understand what's that related to. And then the provision for loan losses that you booked, I think it was related to your non-real estate loans. Can you just talk about what's going on with the loan book? And just remind us those are corporate loans to operators? And how should we think about what is actually cash income that you're receiving from your broader loan book this year? Thank you. Tim McHugh : Yeah. Thanks. I\u2019ll take\u2026 Tom DeRosa : Go ahead, Tim. Tim McHugh : Yes. Okay. On the normalizing. So we -- earlier this quarter Capital Senior announced agreement that came with a couple of other landlords on top of I think when they had come to prior with the third landlord. We're one of those landlords. So, as part of that we restructured our lease with them into essentially runs through year-end, and then the properties will be transitioned. So the write-off there is due to just the straight-line from the remainder of that lease. So that was Capital Senior restructure. And then the provision for loan loss was not a write-off of the actual loan, but it's -- we've impaired the loan under just a change in our view on collectibility. And it's -- you're correct it's a corporate loan it's working capital loan. Part of the loan book that we've continued to shrink meaningfully over time is the non-real estate backed loans partially for this reason. They're obviously a bit riskier than your real estate backed loans. And on kind of cash versus GAAP we give -- in our supplement on the NAV page we break out cash interest rates versus any pick or non-cash interest we're receiving. So that should give you a pretty good idea of kind of the run rate on from both a cash and a GAAP standpoint. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich of Green Street Advisors. Lukas Hartwich : Thanks. For the SHOP development pipeline and the unstabilized, but recently completed projects. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the change in the trajectory of lease-up there. Shankh Mitra : Lukas the lease-up definitely, obviously, will be slower than what otherwise would be if COVID didn't happen. We do think they are very strong properties in very strong locations. I can walk through property-by-property and tell you how many deposits we have, et cetera. But the matter of fact is obviously people need to get into the building for obviously that to become a revenue stream. And in this uncertain times that's obviously not happening. Post-COVID they will get back obviously to the leasing velocity, but this is -- there's no question that lease-up what we thought before COVID will be slower. So you can sort of move back everything whatever number of months that you thought it will take. You'll just have to move the number of months you will think that COVID will exist added to that and we will probably get to the similar results. Maybe there will be some pent-up demand, but I think it's safe to assume that it's pushed out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Mizuho. Tayo Okusanya : Yes. Good morning everyone. Tom DeRosa : Hi, Tayo. Tayo Okusanya : My question had just to do with capital allocation. Again fully understand today the goal is to kind of preserve as much liquidity as possible, but as things start to look a little bit better whenever that is can you just talk a little bit about how you would prioritize capital allocation decisions? Is it back to acquisitions? Is it the share buyback that maybe become more attractive at that point? Is it reestablish? Is it increasing the dividend? I'm just kind of curious when you kind of think about your liquidity position when the time is right how do you kind of think about deploying that? Shankh Mitra : Yes, Tayo, that's a really, really good question one of the most important questions that we are focused on today. I laid out on my prepared remarks, how we are thinking about getting on offense. Everything we buy is a matter of obviously price and embedded IRR into it. As we sit here today there is nothing we see on the investment side that is more attractive than the stock. And that might change tomorrow that might -- we might see opportunities that are very different tomorrow, but as we sit here today. And if you -- I know you were asking about obviously liquidity, so I'll give you a more comprehensive answer on how we're thinking about buyback, because that's probably is helpful for everybody to think through. As I mentioned in my script, we believe a stock is a fractional ownership in a business. It's not a ticker. I described to you how we're thinking about allocating new capital and getting on offense. That applies to new opportunities as well as the opportunity we know the best. That is our own company. We think buyback should be number one, price sensitive. It should be only done when we think we can do that below, what the business is intrinsically worth. And which as we discussed, should be pretty simple for a real estate company like us, with a fairly good estimate of replacement cost, on price per door, and price per foot basis. Two, it should be need sensitive, should be done keeping our balance sheet sound and after intelligent growth prospects are met. And number three, it should be to the advantage of continuing shareholders. So as you know that we did not buy back stock when it was fashionable to do so. And lots of S&P 500 companies are doing it at the top of the market cycle. In fact, we sold billions of dollars of stock to grow our company. We're not contemplating buying back stock to financially engineer our earnings so that we can get paid. Just the opposite, we just described to you significant management compensation reduction today. At this current state of uncertain world, we believe that buyback is more intelligent form of capital return method, than distributing all the cash, from the business in form of dividend. But as we said, we'll not leverage up the balance sheet at this point, to take that liquidity and buy back stock. Hence, we need to source other forms of liquidity from our own assets. If we do believe that this management team is capable of executing such transaction during this pandemic, then you should think that we'll buyback stock or deploy that capital for other acquisition opportunities. If you don't and you think that the market is too uncertain and we can't get the liquidity from somewhere else then you should not think that we'll deploy cash buyback or not. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great thanks good morning, Tom and Tim and Shankh. I hope are safe. Regarding the Triple-Net portfolio updates on page 11, in the slide deck, that's definitely helpful. And just regarding the health systems in particular regardless of what's happening operationally in the memory care assets just curious, if you're able to provide a little more color on the financial health of ProMedica overall beyond 1Q 2020. And when thinking about the low twos EBITDAR coverage ratio that you showed is there any color you have from ProMedica whether these federal stimulus payments, that they're receiving in April and May are offsetting, hopefully the majority of the operational softness that they might be seeing in their acute care hospital opportunities, in the second quarter? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : So, I'll take that Steve. It is extremely inappropriate for us to get into the details of ProMedica financials. Given that it's a company with obviously have a lot of bonds outstanding. I will tell you that ProMedica is in a fine shape. Your assessment is generally right in the direction that there will be obviously, as you know, all the elective surgeries stopped. Obviously, the post-acute side of the business and the senior housing side of the business got impacted. On the other hand, they have a very large insurance business which obviously is working in a completely -- performing in a completely different direction. Regardless, your general assessment that any operating weakness should be offset by what any system whether ProMedica or not should be receiving from the CARES Act directionally is right. But it is not appropriate for us to get into more details than that. Our coverage does not include obviously any of that and primarily because it's coverage as Tim said. All our coverage reported are on a one quarter lag. And this is the actual operating performance of what happened in the buildings as of December 31st. Steven Valiquette : Well, maybe the simpler question then maybe is just on, the overall list of things that you might be worried about right now in the overall business where do ProMedica and memory care rank right now low or high? I'm guessing it's low but I just want to check the box on that. Shankh Mitra : We're worried about everything. But on that line it's very, very low. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kim of BMO. John Kim : Thanks. Good morning. I guess a similar question on, any commentary you could have on financial health of your senior housing partners, whether it's SHOP or Triple-Net whether it's the ability for them to receive any government assistance. And if not, are you contemplating any financial support outside of a rent cut? Shankh Mitra : I'll take that. John. We think, our obviously an ideal structure, our operating partners do not have. That's not a financial liability. So if you look at, this -- I'm glad you asked this question. If you look at the balance sheet of the large operators this cycle versus the last it's in a meaningfully better position. So that's sort of one general observation, on the second where there is a lease with an operator which is obviously a form of leverage I already had the discussion in response to another colleague of you asked the question how we're thinking about Triple-Net. So, I'm not going to get into that. But generally speaking other than that, right at this moment, we are not contemplating anything else. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Hi, everyone. Thanks for letting me again in another one end. It seems so far that Welltower has fared favorably in COVID-19 containment versus other senior housing peers, let's say, with less resources. So how are you planning on marketing your core SHOW competencies really to capture outside or outsized or maybe even pent-up demand once admission bans end and basically go on offense? Tom DeRosa : So Derek, it's very much at the hands of the operators. We are not -- we don't promote individual operators. That's their business. I do think as they have good data to show that will be very helpful. I think that the industry is gathering together, which is I think an important piece here to promote what good is happening throughout the senior living industry. A lot of the media attention has been focused on negativity, on some tragic situations that have occurred in largely undercapitalized nursing facilities. But I think that there will -- Shankh said this. I think there will be good stories to tell about how they manage the needs of their population during this impossible situation. And you can be sure that they will be aggressively marketing those stories to help people regain confidence in the sector. Shankh Mitra : And I'll just add Derek. You're asking an extremely good question. We do believe that coming out of this crisis there will be stronger operators. Strong operators will get stronger. Strong operators with more access to technology or other types of health opportunities or outcomes will have -- will get stronger. So there has been a lot of marginal players got into the business because of slip in real estate was very profitable in sort of call it the 2014, 2015, 2016 time frame. And I think that you will see the operators who have been here and time-tested with operating models they will gain market share. Operator : And there are no further questions. I would like to hand it over to management for any closing remarks. Tom DeRosa : Thank you for participating in our call today, and we're always happy to take any additional questions directly. So please reach out to the team, if you have other questions. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today to Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Matt McQueen : Thank you and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Tom for his remarks. Tom? Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Matt. First and foremost, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these difficult times. When we last spoke with you in early May, Welltower was in the midst of the most challenging period in the company\u2019s history. Many of our senior housing and post-acute care operators had implemented admissions bans to prevent or control the spread of COVID within their communities. Critical personal protective equipment and testing kits were difficult to procure and labor challenges left many of our operators short-staffed. However, I am pleased to report that significant progress has been made on all of these fronts. And that most of our properties have reopened with appropriate staffing levels and requisite PPE and testing kits. This was accomplished through careful planning and precautionary measures taken by our operators. In fact, in just a few months, 95% of our senior housing operating communities are now accepting new residents. And this is significant, because our communities are a critical component to the care continuum. It is imperative that seniors have access to residential settings, in which professional care is offered to meet their everyday needs, including safety, nutrition, hygiene, and medication management. It is important to remember that this is a need-driven asset class. Welltower\u2019s traditional assisted living portfolio is skewed towards higher acuity settings, which are built for seniors, who have exhausted the ability to be cared for in a conventional home setting. We continue to owe a debt of gratitude to the frontline workers in all of our properties, who braved extraordinary obstacles to put the care of their residents above all house. While I\u2019m encouraged by our progress, by no means are we signaling the all clear. We are acutely aware of the heightened level of risk, which continues to exist, particularly at the number of COVID cases in the U.S., continues to rise. As Shankh and Tim will describe in greater detail, the toll from COVID on our business has been and will continue to be pronounced. However, the decisions we have made since the beginning of the pandemic and the steps we have taken over the past five years to strengthen our enterprise have put us in a position to weather this storm. These decisions while often difficult are rooted in data and always executed with the long-term interest of our shareholders in mind. This management team has earned a reputation for taking on both opportunities and issues in a proactive manner and COVID-19 has not changed that. One of the strongest examples of this approach relates to our recent efforts to further strengthen our balance sheet. As financial conditions begin to \u2013 began to deteriorate at the outset of the pandemic. Our team did not panic. Instead through a thoughtful and deliberate process, we obtained a $1 billion term loan providing us with ample flexibility in the event of a prolonged market downturn. As conditions improved in subsequent months, our team waited for an opportune time at which to return to the public market. And in June, we issued $600 million of unsecured debt at just 2.75%, a lowest coupon on 10-year notes in Welltower\u2019s history. These actions are a reflection of Tim McHugh and his team\u2019s responsible stewardship of our balance sheet, and the confidence from investors and our banking partners in the Welltower platform. Another major achievement was the disposition of two large portfolios of seniors housing and outpatient medical assets with a combined total value of $1.3 billion. These sales were executed during a time in which few real estate assets traded and when the ability for senior housing to withstand the impact of COVID was called into question. Most notably, our $1 billion transaction with Kayne Anderson provided significant and immediate liquidity to Welltower in a period of under 45 days and was executed at valuation levels, which were only modestly below pre-COVID pricing. Again, we were not back into a corner to complete these deals. The valuation we achieved demonstrated the appreciation for the long-term growth prospects for healthcare real estate, by astute investors and the strong liquidity, which exists for our asset class. I applaud our investment teams for their perseverance in completing these deals under the most extenuating circumstances. As the year progresses, you should expect to see more of this. Following the completion of our capital markets activity and portfolio dispositions, our near-term liquidity stands at $4.3 billion. The company is extremely well-positioned to address all near-term capital obligations and its ample capacity to execute on accretive opportunities as they arise. Our team will continue to explore all avenues, through which to create value for our shareholders. And regardless of how strong our liquidity position is today; our underwriting discipline will not be compromised. Many questions were made on answered after the duration and ultimate impact of COVID-19. However, what we can say with great certainty is that the long-term drivers of our business remain firmly intact. The population is growing older. The need for value based healthcare is as important as ever and addressing social determinants of health will only grow in relevance. While it\u2019s often difficult to see past the next week or next quarter, rest assured that Welltower\u2019s long-term value proposition has not changed. There will be challenging times ahead, but we are confident that the company is positioned to navigate through these choppy waters and emerge as the continued leader in delivering the real estate that will enable more efficient and cost-effective healthcare and wellness. With that, I\u2019ll turn the mic to Tim. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Tom. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2020 results. The impact of COVID-19 in our business observed this quarter, our capital activity in the quarter, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update. In second quarter, Welltower reported normalized FFO of $0.86 per diluted share. These results include a total of $37 million or approximately $0.09 per share of property level costs in our senior housing operating portfolio associated with COVID-19 pandemic. As we indicated last quarter, Welltower is elected to not normalize these COVID-related expenses both normalized FFO and same-store results. Now, turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our Triple-Net portfolios. As a reminder, our Triple-Net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported quarter in arrears. These statistics reflect the trailing 12-months ending 3/31/2020, and therefore, only reflect a partial impact in COVID-19. In the quarter, we collected 98% of cash rents due on these portfolios and as of last night\u2019s release; we\u2019ve collected 97% of cash rents due in July, which is in-line with previous months\u2019 collections at this time. First, our Senior Housing Triple-Net portfolio delivered 1.4% positive year-over-year same-store growth, and the difficult comp combined with an increased bad debt drove growth below original expectations. Occupancy was down 50 basis points sequentially and EBITDAR coverage increased 0.01 turns on a sequential basis in this portfolio. Our Senior Housing Triple-Net operators have experienced similar headwinds as everyday operates during the second quarter and we expect these coverages and occupancy stats reflect that going forward. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generating positive 2.1% year-over-year same-store growth and EBITDAR coverage declined 0.04 times sequentially. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our HCR ManorCare joint venture with ProMedica, a NOI growth at positive 1.375% year-over-year and EBITDAR coverage declined one basis points sequentially to 2.13 times. Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical portfolio delivered positive 1.8% same-store growth. As a significant year-over-year decrease in the parking revenue caused by national shelter in place orders during the quarter, along with an increase in bad debt accrual was slightly offset by better than expected tenant retention. New leasing lastly remains uneven as a result of COVID. The second quarter ran behind pre-COVID budget by 104,000 square feet, but the gap began had narrowed June and July with new leasing exceeding budget by 44,000 square feet in July. During the quarter reflecting approximately 87% of cash rents, while approving 12% of rents for two months deferral plan. With the slower than expected reopening of certain regions in our portfolio caused more deferrals in the May-June period and we anticipated when we reported our first quarter numbers, we are encouraged by the momentum in the rebounding tenant openings, they accelerated in the back half of June and July driving cash rent collections to 95% in July. We\u2019ve also had strong deferred rent collection in June and July as our two-month deferral plans began repayment. We collected 96% of what was due over this period. We\u2019re extremely proud of the Welltower outpatient medical employees, both onsite and working from home, who have kept our platform running smoothly during these extraordinary times. Before viewing this quarter\u2019s senior housing operating portfolio results, I want to briefly summarize the outlook we provided back in May when it certainly was at its peak. At that time, our expectations were that occupancy would be down between 500 basis points to 600 basis points from April 1 through June 30. The RevPAR would be flat on a year-over-year basis that expenses would increase by 5% sequentially driven primarily by labor costs. Before turning to how things actually turned out in the quarter, I\u2019d like to first point out that our same-store pool is now represented a 91% of our total senior housing operating NOI, this will continue to increase in the year-end. In the quarter, occupancy declined in our same-store portfolio by 490 basis points from April 1 to June 30. Our same-store expenses declined 10 basis points sequentially and our same-store RevPAR declined 20 basis points year-over-year. The net result of the second quarter same-store NOI declining 24.5% from the previous year and 23.3% from the previous quarter. These results were collection of widespread admissions bans that were in place to most of the quarter the limited move-ins as well as extraordinary COVID-related expenses, totaling $34.2 million in the same-store portfolio, resulting in significant margin compression in the quarter. As a reminder, we\u2019re not normalizing any of these COVID-related costs for same-store. Looking forward to the third quarter and starting with the July data we\u2019ve already observed, we experienced 70 basis point declines in occupancy in July from start to finish. And we expect to finish third quarter, approximately 125 basis points to 175 basis points lower than we ended the second quarter. We expect overall show expenses remained relatively flat sequentially if continued reductions in COVID-related spend will be offset by increased costs relating to reopening of communities, seasonal utility costs and an increase in insurance costs. Now, in a capital market activity. In June, we issued a $600 million unsecured bond with a ten and a half year tender at 2.75%. And as Tom mentioned the lowest tenure coupon in the company\u2019s history. We\u2019re able to tender for $425 million of our two outstanding 2023 bonds increasing the way to the average years of maturity to 9.2 years were unsecured bond borrowings and further de-risking maturities through 2023. Following these tender activities, which closed in July, we have approximately $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and the full capacity of our undrawn $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, totaling $4.3 billion of near-term liquidity as of July 31. Moving to investment activity. In the second quarter, we invested $124 million, almost entirely in our development pipeline. On the disposition front, we completed $949 million of pro rata dispositions at a 5.7% cap rate. Post quarter-end, we closed the second tranche of the MOB portfolio sale we announced nearly, with proceeds of $173 million at a 5.4% yield. And we expect the third and final tranche closed in the third quarter for $89 million of additional proceeds at a 5.3% yield. Shankh will speak to you later on, we feel very good about liquidity for all property types in our high-quality portfolio and view our private cost of capital, a significantly better price than our public costs at this current time. As of a result of these successful dispositions in the quarter, we ended the quarter 6.36 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, a 43 basis point increase in the last quarter, despite and approximately 13.5% decline sequential EBITDA. COVID is substantially increased variants in our near-term EBITDA, and consequently, we\u2019ve done everything in our control to counter that and maintain a strong cash flow based leverage profile despite our currently depressed property level cash flows. We\u2019ve also been acutely focused on managing what is in our control to maximize retention of cash through this pandemic. This has been focused on three main areas, G&A, CapEx and the dividend. On G&A, we expect to finish the year between $125 million and $130 million of corporate G&A, implying a run rate of a little over $30 million a quarter for the remainder of the year and representing a $10 million plus decrease what we\u2019d initially guided to for the year. For CapEx, we reduced CapEx spend by $12 million or 18% sequentially with our growing liquidity profile and our buildings opening back up, we expect fund to increase over the next two quarters, but still expect to finish the year approximately 16% below, where 2019 levels work. And as we announced last quarter, our dividend reduction, which has created approximately $110 million of quarterly cash flow savings. Results of these actions along with many others was that we were able to retain a significant cash flow before investment activity, despite the substantial negative impact of COVID-19 had on our second quarter results. While these decisions, particularly, the dividend decisions were difficult, we felt strongly that they gave us greater control as we navigate through the pandemic. retaining cash flow is by design difficult than the reconstruct. So, when analyzing near-term impact of COVID-19 on our cash flows, it was not just analysis of when we might return to breakeven levels of cash flow. There\u2019s a question of how long that deficit would last and the time it would take will retain cash flow to reach a level that allows for the accumulations of that deficit to be repaid i.e. today\u2019s dividends would need to be paid with tomorrow\u2019s cash flows. as a duration of the deficit period increases, its compounding impact on the deficit repayment needed to return the balance sheet to pre-COVID levels. Ultimately, this has a dual impact of not only amplifying business strains caused by the pandemic, but also be stabilized in the balance sheet. disposing of assets or selling equity offset this increased leverage, only increased the payout deficit by either eliminating any cash flow from disposed assets or adding dividend paying shares to our share count. our asset sales this quarter demonstrated by reducing the dividend to a level below current cash flows was made by our management team. As we were able to make a decision to sell assets based solely upon the value received and the stabilizing effect to these retained proceeds have had in our balance sheet. We believe these decisions ever moved dependent on a quick recovery, allowing us to decrease downside risk, they continue to make capital allocation decisions with a long-term focus. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll now provide additional color on the operating performance that Tim discussed and discuss our capital allocation strategy in this challenging yet rapidly evolving times. As we reflect back on the frenzied pace of activity over the last few months, our focus has been and will continue to be the safety of our residents and staffs in our communities. frontline heroes of these communities have done a tremendous job of improving the safety and quality of the life of the residents from the earliest days of this crisis. For example, in our SHO portfolio reported resident COVID cases over a trailing two-week period peaked at 510 cases in the first week of may. And since then, down to 98 cases, we\u2019re presenting 80% decline from the peak. This is despite the fact that our operators tested nearly 100,000 residents and employees so far. while COVID cases of spite across the nation, the prevalence of cases across our portfolio has remained relatively flat so far. COVID-related deaths, which peaked during the last week of April are down 92% since then and have so far remained relatively stable in July despite its spike in nationwide cases. This remarkable improvement though far from being completed, has allowed our operating partners to cautiously open doors to new prospects. In the last week of April, 42% of our communities had official admissions ban. That number today is 5% including 3% partial events. moving down sequentially from pre-COVID February peak to April when you had the first full month of COVID by almost 77%, since then, moving that up 174% from April low to the July. move-outs are peaked in March and sequentially, down 37% in July, relative to March. However, we still have more move-outs than move-ins. As a result of this, occupancy loss in our shop business has narrowed from down 60 basis points during the last week of April and first week of Maya to down 10 basis points each of last three weeks. though this improvement is encouraging, we are cautious about the overall environment as spike in COVID cases in our markets are real and they can impact our communities at any time. We have been seeing a steady increase of leads, inquiries, and deposits due to that need-driven nature of our business. The total number of leads in the system, which declined 55% from February to April trough since bounced back 60% in June, from that trough, it is approaching pre-COVID February numbers in July. However, move-ins are trailing as those leading activities due to the hesitation in the psychology of the consumers as the juggle between the difficulty of taking care of the elderly loved ones and the fear related to national headlines are rising COVID cases. So far, we have been positively surprised by our operating partners\u2019 ability to scale expenses to a rapidly declined in occupancy so far. We saw rates held up slightly better than what we thought in assisted living and memory care segment, which is up 1.7%. the occupancy was hit much more pronounced here down 6.2% year-over-year. While occupancy of our IL segment held up relatively better down 2% year-over-year, rate growth declined 10 basis points year-over-year. Additionally, the entrant of a lower price point senior as apartment portfolio to same-store pool in Q2 impacted the world mix, reducing total report at same-store RevPAR growth by 40 basis points for the quarter. Clearly, given how COVID had spread, the larger coastal markets have been impacted significantly during the quarter more than other markets. Finally, we\u2019re starting to see some differentiations in operator performance that can be explained by operator value-add, not just location, product type or acuity. As I mentioned last quarter, correlation pattern completely broke down in March and April, and we are happy to see it improving through June and July. on capital allocation front, we discussed in last quarter earnings call, two distinct mental models, short-term defense and long-term offense. We are glad to inform you that during the quarter, we have largely completed our efforts on the defensive side and have now shifted our focus on the offense. We\u2019re extraordinarily proud of our execution during the second quarter in both public and private markets. And it is important to remember and understand these two are one interconnected set of decisions and not distinct action. For example, our exceptional execution with Dave and his team at Kayne Anderson in record time with our senior housing and MOB portfolio disposition along with our execution to secure a term loan with our banking partners, both took place during the dark days of March. This gave us confidence to be patient in accessing public bond markets rather than issuing bonds when credit spread, where that peaks. if we were to issue bonds during those days, we would be looking at coupons close to 5%, not 2.75% that we issued later in the quarter that would have come at a cost to shareholders of $130 million over the life of the bond. We believe our execution in private markets peak to the significant demand of stabilized assets, both in senior housing and medical office asset classes. We\u2019re in the middle of other transactions that are premature to discuss at this point. But needless to say, we feel very strongly about the demand of our assets. More to come as we progress for the year. notably, this robust interest and pricing, and nowhere to be found in assets that are not in the middle of the fairway, such as those deals with broken capital structure, suboptimal operators, development and lease-up assets or generation handover of companies and assets to name a few. Fundamentals determined cash flow and asset price is a multiple of that same cash flow. These variables are usually inversely correlated with opportunities to invest at the highest moment of uncertainty. In other words, when fundamentals are great, asset pricing is high, expected returns are low. When fundamentals are bad, asset pricing is low, expected returns are high. We\u2019re seeing that playing out in many parts of senior housing sector today. We\u2019re starting to see signs of distress across the spectrum of the issues I mentioned. these situations not only required capital, but they also required operators, who are otherwise overwhelmed with the demand of their time given what\u2019s happening within their communities, and that where we come in with our toolkit. At Welltower, we think our value proposition in three interrelated groups; capabilities, culture, and capital. we lead with our capability. We execute with our culture of partnerships and we get the ball across the finish lines through our ability to write resolute checks with unmatched speed and structural creativity. When we introduced our ideas through your business model to achieve better alignment with our operators, many of you asked if Welltower will be able to retain its cultural partnership, to which we responded the proof was in the pudding. We are seeing the proof today. We\u2019re working with our operating partners very closely in identifying assets in their backyards through our data analytics platform and tailor-made to their model based on size, acuity, vintage demographics, and psychographic criteria. This algorithmic approach narrows the opportunity set to a manageable number, which is filtered to succeed for our operating partners that dive in and help us underwrite. Our operators and deal teams that connect with the fellow operators and owners to run through our thoughts on pricing, our ability to close and execute on operator transfer agreement on an expedited basis. We are either getting a quick yes, and jumping on the executions, or we\u2019re getting a quick no, and moving up to the next opportunity. For example, one of our partners in Midwest, StoryPoint, we have identified 137 distinct communities in seven states that fit their criteria and we\u2019re going through the list of opportunities with the StoryPoint team one asset at a time. These days have more than 2,800 senior living properties that are humanly impossible to hone in on a practical basis. The job of the algorithm is to bring our partners and our deal teams to focus at the highest probability, last mile effort. We remain fundamental value investors. We\u2019re focused on bottom-up underwriting, basis relative to replacement costs and structural protection. In another example, we have our in-process of executing on three premium opportunities with our partner, Brandywine in extraordinary locations, such as Princeton, New Jersey and summit, New Jersey. In another example, we\u2019re proud to execute an extraordinary opportunity in Fishersville submarket of Brookline on an existing land and structure that used to be a college. the township and the people of Brookline has given us incredible support and zoning approval even during COVID-19 to create an iconic 160-unit senior living project, where underwriting several more transactions with Balfour in the home markets of Colorado, as well as a new home in Boston. I can cite many other examples with other operators, but I will retain those for future calls. but I hope you walk away from this call, understanding that we have never been more excited about the opportunity to invest capital in the senior housing space, because of the pricings that we are seeing. We are buying communities in our core California and New Jersey market for less than $200,000 unit while replacement costs in this location are in excess of $0.5 million a unit. targeting development or development plus returns without the majority of the development risk outside lease-up. We believe in this business long-term, we also understand the near-term is going to be uncertain and challenging. Please note that uniqueness of this very challenge is what\u2019s creating a once-in-a-duration opportunity, right before the market they get upturn in the demand cycle. At the same time, the supply is coming to a screeching halt. Many of you, who follow NIC data have seen stocks are down to Q1 of 2009 level and we\u2019re likely to see this trend continue. construction activity across all real estate asset classes is down significantly, which is creating softness in soft and hard costs. Land prices are starting to show cracks as well. In this environment, we\u2019re standing by our operating partner, shoulder-to-shoulder when tourist capital is fleeing the space. And that is attracting more and more operator and development partners to Welltower, highly taking the proof in the relationship pudding. I am optimistic we\u2019ll be able to create significant value for a long-term shareholder in next 18 months to 24 months by allocating smart capital, leveraging our operating platform. With that, over to you Tom. Tom DeRosa : Thanks, Shankh. Before we begin the Q&A session, I wanted to call your attention to a press release from last week, announcing the appointment of Diana Reid to our board of directors. Diana is an accomplished and highly-respected executive with 38 years of experience across the financial services and commercial real estate industries. She most recently served as executive Vice President of the PNC Financial Services Group and executive of the bank\u2019s commercial real estate business. She\u2019s also held leadership positions in many prominent organizations, including the Mortgage Bankers Association, Commercial Real Estate Finance Council, the Urban Land Institute and Real Estate Roundtable. All of Welltower\u2019s stakeholders will benefit from Diana\u2019s extensive experience and insights and we are extremely fortunate to have someone of her caliber join our board. I\u2019m also pleased by the fact that with Diana\u2019s appointment, 88% of our independent directors are women and minorities. As I\u2019ve said in the past, the diversity of our employee base, our leadership team and our board continue to be a priority at Welltower. This is not only a key component of good governance, but it is a proven driver of higher returns to shareholders. And with that, I will turn the mic back to Galen to open up the line for your questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. I guess both Tom and Shankh, you guys spent a fair amount of time talking about the investment opportunities and Tom, it sounds like you alluded to some other potential sales coming down the pike, I guess. How do we sort of think about or way \u2013 the sale of assets that may be stabilized and Shankh, it sounds like you\u2019re looking at buying some broken assets and just sort of the dilution short-term versus kind of the long-term gain and the high growth and maybe, the high IRR potential, is there just \u2013 is there a sort of an amount of short-term dilution you\u2019re willing to take to get long-term growth out of these transactions? Shankh Mitra : Steve, that\u2019s a very good question. If you think through at least sort of the mental model that we have, we are fundamentally looking to sell at this point assets that we think achieve pre-COVID pricing or pre-COVID IRR if we have sold those days. Our need for liquidity that we had obviously, or what we wanted to achieve in March is all now achieved at this point. So, we are looking for releasing capital from assets that we think is a testament of that long-term value. With that, we\u2019re looking to buy assets or deploy capital, whether that\u2019s assets or any other evitable opportunities such as our stock, unless we think there\u2019s a substantially higher IRR that can be achieved. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. We are long-term value investors and we are not focused on quarter-to-quarter dilution as you might have noted that the sale that we executed in the quarter had $0.02 of dilution in the quarter, but we still think that achieved extraordinary pricing as well as value for the shareholders. Tom DeRosa : But Steve, I\u2019d add that we\u2019re not sellers underdressed. There are many quality sources of capital, institution investors that see the long-term value of this space and are very interested if there\u2019s an opportunity to buy high-quality assets from us or partner in a joint venture structure with us. So, there are very active dialogues going on and that\u2019s why I mentioned, you should expect more of this as the year progresses, there\u2019s \u2013 I definitely want to say that definitively, but we\u2019re pretty optimistic at this point. Steve Sakwa : Thank you. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Bilerman : Thanks. It\u2019s in Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Maybe, spend some a little bit time talking about the senior housing operating environment and whether you\u2019re seeing any differences in-between the operators of their pricing strategies, whether some are using concessions versus some are holding rates, just how different operators, just like different healthcare REITs are approaching the market in different ways. I assume your operators are as well. So, if you can go through that. that would be helpful. Thank you. Shankh Mitra : Yes. So, we are obviously, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are seeing different strategies, but sort of \u2013 more I will just describe that as a tweaking of pricing strategies than a wholesale changing pricing. We believe that we provide an exceptional value to customers and for which, we need to attract a certain level of staffing for what you need pricing. So, we\u2019re not interested in compromising on that pricing or rather compromised on occupancy. So, if you look at, as I mentioned, our assisted living and memory care portfolio, RevPAR was up 1.7% even during this quarter. Now, if you think about as you lose occupancy and you were not building occupancy, you lose community fees. That obviously impacts that number in a pretty meaningful way. However, we\u2019re not seeing any decrease of like-to-like pricing in our communities. just the reported number, Michael was impacted by bringing the lower pricing or lower price points in his apartment into the pool. If you exclude that we would have reported a RevPAR increase of 20 basis points \u2013 increase of 20 basis points relative to flat, what Tim described last call. Tim McHugh : I would just add to that, from Shankh\u2019s, point at this point, who you\u2019re seeing move-in, as you\u2019ve seen move-in to pick up are really going to be your most needs-based resident. So, the value proposition from high-quality care, which \u2013 and then reputation, which is where our operators sit within these markets, has probably never been higher. So, there could be a point when things actually start to pick up and you see the incremental demand come back, where pricing comes into that equation. Just given where \u2013 how suboptimal occupancy is across most markets. But at this point, pricing is in what\u2019s driving incremental occupancy, it\u2019s not driving the marginal customer and it\u2019s truly, really a needs-based client that\u2019s coming in. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from Rich Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, obviously, you\u2019ve got a commitment long term senior housing. I wonder and Shankh to you, I understand you\u2019re not a seller unless you can get obviously, reasonable price pre-COVID value in IRR and all the rest. but how would you characterize the future from an asset allocation perspective for Welltower and in light of a skilled nursing and post-acute assets and medical office, could \u2013 if you had your way, you got the pricing that you wanted, because senior housing, almost is the entire story here, five or 10 years from now, or is it more just growth at senior housing and you\u2019ll continue to maintain some exposure to those other asset classes. Shankh Mitra : So rich, as we have mentioned in, pretty much every call, our asset allocation is strategy, or really a capital allocation strategy is driven by price. in the scenario that, which you described that every asset class that we play in, remains perfectly over priced for rest of 10 years and senior housing remains perfectly underpriced for next 10 years, then yes, the description that you gave that is possible, that is rarely how things happen, obviously, right? In moments of opportunity in the \u2013 when you see in capital markets, where capital comes in and out of a sector for various reasons, you see these moments of opportunity, and that\u2019s what we believe we\u2019re seeing. So near-term capital allocation, you will \u2013 obviously, you\u2019re going to see a significant increase in senior housing, but we love all of our asset classes. We love, like we love all of our children. There\u2019s no question that we want \u2013 we remain interested in playing all different asset classes. Our incremental capital allocation strategy is a function of price, not function of love for one asset versus other. Right now today, we have never seen a better opportunity to invest in senior housing as an asset class. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James. please go ahead. Jonathan Hughes : Hey, good morning. My question is on the rate outlook and you did touch on it a bit in Michael\u2019s question earlier, but I was hoping you\u2019d share some thoughts on the trajectory or reception of rate increases in a world, where amenities I\u2019ve been taken away from residents. Of course, they\u2019ve been taken away for their safety, but the social interaction aspect is what attracts a lot of residents to these properties and that might not be back to normal for some time. So, how does this removal of this socioeconomic factor and impact the rates your operators are able to achieve today for both new residents and existing resident rate increases? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Jonathan, that is a great question, which is why you are seeing the lower acuity models, where the need of providing healthcare and social determinants of health is lower. You are seeing rates not as pronounced rate increases with \u2013 as we have described to you that we saw a slight decrease of rate. on the other hand, where the social aspect of business is very important, social aspect of the living is very important, but more important is taking care of other health issues; obviously that\u2019s where it\u2019s increased the rate. So, it\u2019s an interplay between all aspects of the services that we provide, where you have more need driven, obviously residents, they will have less impact on rates in this kind of environment, where you have more lifestyle-driven residents, you will see more impact over it, just because of what you just described. Tom DeRosa : Right. Jonathan, that\u2019s what I said earlier. our portfolio is skewed towards the higher acuity. So, these are truly people that are moving in, in this environment, have really exhausted other options. So, the social part of the senior housing model is not as important to them. They need to make sure that these seniors are getting their daily care. They can\u2019t \u2013 that cannot be done in \u2013 by many families today in the world we\u2019re living in, it becomes impossible, particularly if someone has dementia. So that is the profile generally of who is moving in today. They\u2019re not as concerned about the social aspects of the senior living model, but as things start to come back to normal that once again, will become a more important attribute to the consumer. But today, it\u2019s really all about safety and care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. Shankh or Tom, can you talk a little bit about how the second COVID wave or maybe, the continuation of that first COVID wave has impacted your operators? I guess, particularly in California, had they been forced to re-shutdown or delay reopening some of those facilities or what\u2019s the thought process behind that? Shankh Mitra : That\u2019s a really, really good question. Frankly, I\u2019m extremely encouraged and positively surprised by the example, you just brought it up in your course. I was going to use that. California is probably, the only place, where you can see there\u2019s a true second wave, right. There\u2019s a lot of other states, where you\u2019re seeing sort of the first big wave. I\u2019m happy to tell you, this is why I was so encouraged by the performance of last three weeks. We haven\u2019t seen significant admissions ban or lack of performance in California in last three weeks, that really surprised me. We reported as you can see in our presentation sort of 10 basis points of occupancy decreasing last three weeks, those are obviously rounded numbers, Mike, but if you just followed the real numbers, they were down 14 basis points, down 10 basis points; and last week, it was down 7 basis points. given California \u2013 Southern California is our largest market. Given California is obviously impact to those numbers. You would have seen a much, much worse \u2013 and a worsening impact, not an incrementally better numbers going forward. Tom DeRosa : Mike, I wanted to add to that. I\u2019m not going to name the operator, but there\u2019s one operator in particular, who was very quick to shut the door during the first wave in California. And what I would tell you is in the second wave, they are taking new residents. So, they are needed to adjust to this COVID environment and they did that by really \u2013 by effectively shutting down. And now, when COVID back there, they are in a position to safely admit new residents. They have the right protocols and procedures in place that are enabling them to again, meet the demand for this quality of care in a residential setting in markets, where the headlines are pretty scary. but I think that\u2019s a good indicator and it helps us explain some of the stats that you see in our deck. Why the number of cases are not spiking in our portfolio like they had back in April and may when one of the operators were blindsided, not just our operators. I mean, we all were blindsided by COVID. And so again, this could change Mike, but it\u2019s an interesting \u2013 California is an interesting data point for us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the investment cadence. within the context of what\u2019s going on with cash flows and leverage. Are you guys better to buy or to sell right now? In other words, will sales and purchases be more balanced here going forward and offset one another in terms of volume? Shankh Mitra : No. Well, I cannot sit here and tell you that I know or have any idea. I will only tell you that depended on one thing and that\u2019s price, and expected return out of those buy and sell. If we find the opportunity to deploy capital that at an extraordinary basis, and return we\u2019ll buy more. And if we think that we\u2019re better off selling, because the market is providing us great value for our assets that sort of seize through these uncertain times, then we\u2019ll sell. on a practical basis, there\u2019s going to be a combination of both, obviously as you think through how assets \u2013 how debt gets re-priced, eventually the stress to debt service coverage, how that stress is obviously, equity. It takes time, but we\u2019re very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing already seeing today. But I cannot tell sitting here on any given quarter, how those sales forces buy volumes, whether they will sort of cancel each other, one will be higher than each other. I can tell you that. it\u2019s just purely price dependent. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for taking the question. maybe, both for Tom and shankh, you\u2019ve obviously talked a lot about exciting acquisition opportunities across the spectrum, more so seniors housing. I\u2019m just wondering seniors housing specific, can you talk about those opportunities in context of kind of geographies, meaning the UK and Canada as well, product type, IL, AL and then maybe, even something that you\u2019ve talked about in the past, the affordable product. So, what are you looking at in terms of potentially getting a little bit more aggressive on, in terms of building the portfolio from here? Tom DeRosa : So Vikram, we\u2019re looking at opportunities across the board, all three countries obviously, just given the population and a number of product, we\u2019re seeing more opportunities in U.S., distress or rather more favorable pricing. So far, we see across the board, not necessarily one product diverse is other, but probably more in high, high acuity and AL memory care. probably, there is more distress, because you saw the occupancy fall the most in that. And that\u2019s pretty much I can tell you, we\u2019re seeing, as I mentioned, we\u2019re seeing across the coast; East Coast, West coast, we\u2019re seeing extraordinary \u2013 we have seen some extraordinary pricing in both coasts. We\u2019re seeing a lot of opportunities in the Midwest. We\u2019re seeing opportunities in Texas. We are in it, our deal team, which is our legal team, our investment teams, and all the teams that support them have never been busier. but whether we will be able to what we execute on will be a function of, as I said, price and needs to be reflective of the environment that we find ourselves today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Mizuho. please go ahead. Tayo Okusanya : Yes. good morning, everyone. So, I just wanted to focus a little bit on the comments around the improvement in the \u2013 well, improvement in the rate of decline, as it pertains to occupancy in senior housing, again, clear that most of your facilities are open. It sounds like, virtual tours and things are happening, but can you just talk a little bit more about why that slowdown is actually either occurring. The ability of the directors of these buildings to still kind of get move-in traffic despite COVID or whatever have you. Tom DeRosa : Yes. So, I think we touched on this, Tayo, a little bit. but as we can think about our portfolio, primarily our U.S. and UK portfolio, it\u2019s high acuity, it\u2019s a need-driven portfolio, right. So there is again \u2013 you can only push off this demand so much. So we\u2019re seeing, as I mentioned that just if you think about leading indicators that just take leads. And I mentioned those in my prepared remarks, you saw a rapid decline of lead a pre-COVID first month, last month of pre-COVID is February, a significant decline, 55% decline, sort of to the trough of may and April. And by June, it was up 60%; in July, it\u2019s now actually \u2013 in month of July, it\u2019s approached the pre-COVID numbers of February, but if you kind of peel back the onion and you will see, there are the majority of the people are more need-driven than just lifestyle-driven. And just \u2013 that\u2019s due to the fact that they can only push off the need that much into the future. So that\u2019s why we think we\u2019re seeing it. The other thing I will tell you, we have given you the absolute number, not just a percentage of number of what is going on in a community from the perspective of COVID. I hope you think given how large our portfolio is. how many units available versus the number of people in the COVID, which we mentioned 98 cases, that is a remarkable testament to the quality of care, that\u2019s provided by our operators in those places and that reputation does matter. And that you cannot say the same thing about the industry as a whole. but our operating partners have that reputation that delivering on that reputation and that\u2019s what attracting new residents. Shankh Mitra : One of the things I\u2019m going to add to that Tayo is the decision has changed today, it\u2019s \u2013 can you \u2013 number one, is their COVID in the building. Can you take my mother or father? Are you able to take them in what \u2013 how are you going to protect them? And can you meet their needs? That is the decision chain today, because so many people have exhausted their ability to care for that relative and have been in many cases; in many markets, they\u2019ve had no options, but just to take care of them at home or in their home and if you think about it, a lot of these residents or incoming residents, their lifestyle is being shut into a room in a house, or they\u2019re living by themselves in an apartment with some limited, either family care or home healthcare. So, in a sense, the lifestyle component doesn\u2019t change too much for that individual, except there\u2019s much more security and consistency around their care program then can be achieved in a conventional hall unless you\u2019re extremely wealthy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Kim : Thanks. Good morning. So, your operating diversification is a positive for your company performance, but when you look at some of the larger tenants and the sequential decline, looking at a sunrise or Rivera, they\u2019re pretty significant underperformers within your portfolio. I\u2019m not sure if you can comment on these operators specifically or if not overall, the ability for some of your private pay senior housing operators and their ability to handle this kind of performance in the absence of government assistance. Tom DeRosa : Before Shankh gives you an answer, this is that the operators just point out, this has been in place in a while, being annualized the quarter. And so sequential changes are just more pronounced. So, you\u2019re taking the entire sequential change and you\u2019re multiplying it by four to get to that in-place NOI number. Shankh Mitra : But regardless, John, you make a point, there\u2019s no question that some of our higher acuity operators have definitely underperform. And if you add high acuity with coastal locations, that is definitely some \u2013 in some operators, we have some significant performance decline. But that is why you have a diversified portfolio, right, without getting into very specific names. But if you follow through the coastal market and then you add acuity where we saw the most decline, it is not difficult to find out who would have performed relatively better or worse. But as Tim pointed out, that you should not take one quarter when NOI declines staggering 25%, if you multiply by that four, you\u2019re going to get very, very different results. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Thanks. So, I just wanted to turn back to the move-in issue. So, I mean, move-ins have improved, but they\u2019re still down 45% in July versus last year. And so I guess, I\u2019m wondering, do you have any data on why customers or delaying move-ins, and particularly if you have any feel for the timeframe of that delay or people telling you, they just want to wait three months, they\u2019re going to wait a year, they\u2019re going to wait until there\u2019s a vaccine. And I guess, I know you talked about leads, but it would be helpful to understand instead if you had any sort of backlog of deposits, you can point to? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : First is, let me answer your second part of your question. Deposit activity is extraordinarily strong. As I pointed out the move-ins activity, which has been obviously improved, pretty meaningfully is not matching the deposit activity as people are spreading out their moving dates. That\u2019s what I think you\u2019re asking about. And I pointed out in my prepared remarks. I think the other part of your question was, is move-ins down from last year? Absolutely it is. If you think about what we are trying to get to at least what most analysts and investors asking, they\u2019re trying to get to a point understand the run rate earnings power of the company. Sequential gives you that year-over-year is a function of what happened yesterday. Sequential gives you what is going to happen tomorrow. And I think that\u2019s what sort of, we are personally with here to figure out the exact same answer anyway. What is our run rate EBITDA? But is move-in down from last year? There\u2019s no question. Of course, you see, we have lost 500 basis points occupancy in one quarter. So, you are not at the same level of activity and it is going to take some time to come back to the same level of activity. Tom DeRosa : Nick, I want to add something to that, what you see is people are, as Shankh mentioned, the deposit activities is good. The movements are delayed. What\u2019s the way that move-in, I think was your question. In some cases it\u2019s you \u2013 if I can\u2019t visit right now on a regular basis, I can\u2019t visit mom or dad on a regular basis. I\u2019m going to wait till there\u2019s some visitation \u2013 safe visitation model before I moved them in. So, they\u2019ve secured a place, but they\u2019re delaying until perhaps there\u2019s some again, we\u2019ve seen visitation allowed in many States and again, under very strict protocols. In some cases, in some States, it\u2019s the testing. It\u2019s bad. I don\u2019t want my mom to be tested, to be poked and prodded twice a week. So, I\u2019m going to wait until that settles down. So it\u2019s elements like that. These are people that need to come in. They\u2019ve secured a place with a deposit, but they\u2019re waiting to the conditions might meet their needs a bit better if the situation isn\u2019t desperate, like I need today; I need to move my dad today. I cannot take care of him anymore in the situation he\u2019s in. So, it\u2019s individual, it\u2019s specific to the family and the individual, but it\u2019s, things like that that are causing that delay. Shankh Mitra : And Nick, that\u2019s why we\u2019re not giving you our best guess scenario, our best guess that occupants will be up next quarter, right? Given the amount of activity and demand that we see in the system, you would think that, just from that, we will be indicating that occupancy will be up. We\u2019re not, because we wanted to see that hesitation. So it gets at least for next three months, we want to see how that plays out before we tell you that we feel that the consumers are coming back in-house. We\u2019re not saying that we want to see how that plays out. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : Yes. Thanks for the question, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m curious on operator expenses going forward. There obviously was a lot of extra COVID costs. What should we kind of look for in 3Q and maybe the ability for labor to flex as occupancy has come down in marketing budgets, that\u2019d be really helpful. Thanks. Tom DeRosa : Yes. Josh, I think the way I thinking about that is, just with the quarter looking at kind of COVID costs, the biggest piece of it, if you think about COVID costs and roughly call 20% of that kind of PPE and cleaning. And that is likely going to be around until you have a vaccine or the pandemic has come down a lot. In saying that, I\u2019d say the cost of PPE still likely inflated. So, the cost of requiring has come down quite a bit from the certainly March April area, but it\u2019s still in many years, probably two x to three x, or it should be when supply chains can and completely kind of normalized, but just speaking, the kind of current pricing, if PPE cleaning makeup about 20% of that, and there\u2019s a piece of it then that is kind of dietary and that diet therapies pieces from delivering meals to rooms, instead of running, the common or communal dining areas that will start to come down as you see some normalization of internal activities. And then lastly, the labor piece. And labor piece makes up the large majority of the cost here. And the labor piece, actually, it\u2019s probably fair to think about in our \u2013 the deck we put out last night, we\u2019ve got a, our trailing two-week COVID cases. And you see they peak on May 8, and that\u2019s actually probably a very good indicator of when our labor costs are tied to COVID peak. So, April and May both have pretty high COVID related labor costs. It came down considerably into June, that\u2019ll burn off obviously dependent on the pandemic and the prevalence of COVID-19 in our facilities. But as that come down, that labor piece is almost burned off entirely at this point. So, going forward, it gets \u2013 it\u2019s right to think about just that kind of PPE and cleaning costs being a dominant force and then labor will be dependent on the actual prevalence of the virus. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steve Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning, Tom and Shankh and Tim. Tom DeRosa : Good morning. Steve Valiquette : A couple of questions here. One, do you, I mean, you touched on this a little bit already, but just that comment on a Slide 17 at the recent rise in COVID cases may result in near term increases as admission bans. And it sounds like your operators are now generally want to be on the offensive on move-ins. I guess, if there are a potential new admission bans, that sounds like they would be more mandated by state government, as opposed to voluntary bans, so I just want to make sure that we\u2019re taking them out that the right way? And then maybe the bigger question overall, Shankh, you kind of touched on this for 3Q, but the way it stands right now is that your expectation that in calendar 2020, that Welltower will cross the threshold and shop where the move-ins will exceed, move-outs. So the occupancy will start to increase at some point this year, or is that still up in the air right now the way it stands, just want to get clarity around the calendar 2020 thoughts around that? Thanks. Tim McHugh : Thanks, Steve. It\u2019s Tim. I\u2019ll start with your question on move-in bans, and then Shankh can answer your second question. I think I just kind of re categorize your comment on our operators being on any offensive. I think our operators being very smart about the way that they\u2019re admitting residents. And I think you\u2019re correct in what we\u2019ll call it kind of outright admissions bans and Tom kind of made this point about California with one of our operators that kind of voluntarily moved to admissions bans in first wave, the second wave they\u2019re admitting presidents. But certainly the admission protocol is extremely heightened. And that gets a little bit Tom\u2019s point on even some of the hitting of that protocol being part of the reason why you\u2019re not seeing people choose to move-in. But I think part of what we\u2019ve seen so far is, as you\u2019ve seen the cases spiked nationally again, you\u2019ve seen cases within our facilities move-up, but stay very controlled and start to come back down the last two weeks. And I think that\u2019s actually, it\u2019s symbolic of the admissions protocol working very well. So, do I think, the actual admissions bans you\u2019re correct, that will be driven more so by probably state and local municipalities. And then obviously the building itself when there is an actual case of COVID, but the building, the operators themselves, I think, are just being very cautious about admitting. So, that\u2019s playing a role here. But the actual bans will be more driven by governing bodies. Shankh Mitra : Steve, to your second question, do we \u2013 are we here to sit down and predict when move-in and move-out across the world will absolutely not. You tell us how you think COVID will play out, and we\u2019ll tell you how that will transition to a numbers. We\u2019re only telling you what we have seen until yesterday. We\u2019re not going to sit here and predict what might happen tomorrow given the uncertainty of this environment. We\u2019re encouraged by what we have seen. We\u2019re also obviously telling you that we\u2019re very cautious, that things can change anytime. So, we\u2019ll obviously not going to sit here and predict when those two will across the world. But we haven\u2019t \u2013 we are very, very encouraged that it can very close last week. Tom DeRosa : Yes. And the one thing we do know, Steve, is that the operators, know what they\u2019re dealing with today. In March, April, May, they were again trying to figure out what was happening and we\u2019re unprepared as we all were. So, I think that the positive today is that they do have the right policies, procedures in place to manage a very difficult situation, but things can change on a dime. So again, reiterating why we\u2019re not being \u2013 looking, try to predict what\u2019s going to happen through the rest of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lukas Hartwich from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. Lukas Hartwich : Thanks. There\u2019s a lot of focus on the potential for government support for senior housing here in the U.S. I was hoping you could provide some color on that discussion in Canada and the UK? Tom DeRosa : Well, in the UK, it\u2019s a very different story, Lukas. This \u2013 there is much government support for the senior housing industry in the UK. And unlike in the U.S. it did not become a target of hysteria around COVID, what\u2019s interesting in the UK, the frontline workers in the senior care business are considered heroes like the people who work in hospitals. In the United States that\u2019s not the case. And that\u2019s a shame, because the healthcare workers in the senior living in post-acute care spaces have been subject to the same conditions that as healthcare workers in hospitals they faced a lot of the same challenges, and like our healthcare workers in hospitals they\u2019re doing the best they can to meet the needs of their population. So, I\u2019m hoping that will change in the U.S. But in the UK, it\u2019s a different and there\u2019s certainly more government support for the senior living industry in the UK. In Canada, remember, our business, is really more of an independent living business. The higher acuity models in Canada are government provided. So today, I can\u2019t comment on government support in Canada coming into the independent living model \u2013 into the independent living sector, I really couldn\u2019t comment on that. They\u2019re both, obviously both countries are having very different healthcare system than the United States. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Capital One. Please go ahead. Daniel Bernstein : Good morning. Quick question. When we look back at 2009, average entrance change went up, acuity went up, margins went down, length of stay went down. When you\u2019re looking at the opportunities that I sound generational, how are you thinking about the underwriting of the long-term fundamentals of the business? I know that may be very difficult, but are you concerned about maybe the long-term upside of the NOI, the business is a little bit lower going forward then it\u2019s has been in the past? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Dan, I am not only concerned, I\u2019m paranoid about everything that changes investment returns. So that\u2019s why, in this uncertain environment, the price needs to reflect that uncertainty, right? But I do think the industry is coming to a point where you can underwrite different scenarios and then price that in, at the end of the day, we deploy capital to make money for our shareholders. There\u2019s no guaranteed return. If we wanted guaranteed return, we\u2019ll be buying government bonds. But we do think that, today, as opposed to 90 days ago, one sector is reaching a point where you can underwrite, and you can price in uncertainties of the various things that you mentioned. So, we\u2019ll see how it plays out, but we do believe that at the end of the day, if the revenue characteristic, the cash flow characteristics, not just revenue, the cash flow characteristic of an asset comes down. What we\u2019ll do with that will depress returns and obviously that means that will depress future development, if there\u2019s no returns developers will not chase the assets and ultimately demand and supply will balance. That is true for any capital intensive business, so, will not be any different here as well. But you\u2019re raising some very, very good points and we are not only concerned. We\u2019re also paranoid about those things, and we\u2019re trying to do the best we can from top down sort of data analytics approach to bottom up, value investing approach and I sort of described on my prepared remarks, however, bringing those together. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sarah Tan from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Sarah Tan : Hi, this is Sarah on from Mike Muller, one question on my end. How much of your Triple-Net revenues are at risk [indiscernible]? Could you comment on that? Shankh Mitra : Sarah. Can you say that, how much of the Triple-Net rent? I couldn\u2019t hear the last part. Sarah Tan : How much of your \u2013 what portion of your Triple-Net revenues are risk for rent reset? Shankh Mitra : I think, Sarah, you said how much of our rents are at risk of a rent reset? Sarah Tan : Yes, that\u2019s right. For the Triple-Net revenues. Tim McHugh : Yes. So, as I said in my prepared remarks, the Triple-Net business and senior housing in two different structures. And so that wins have been felt by every day business, there\u2019s certainly being felt on the Triple-Net side. There\u2019s some differences given the different product mix in location, but what I said, last quarter and more repeat again, is that the economics long-term have to support the rents. And I think that\u2019s something we\u2019ve talked about a lot on calls the last three years. Did we restructured a lot of these rents and got ahead of some of this is that operators see the long-term opportunities asset class, and want to remain in these buildings and in control of the buildings. And so the thought of there being kind of a rent reset based just on current economics, I think is somewhat misplaced. So, and you look at rent collection and it remains very strong in this space as well. So, I think in general there\u2019s no \u2013 we\u2019re not here to say that the economics underlying these properties been challenged and there will be certainly conversations around how the economics and the rent a line and we were prepared to have those. But at this time, I think the best we can do is continue to see where rents go and flush and stay high and we\u2019ll continue to observe that and report to the market. Shankh Mitra : And Sarah, as you think through, we\u2019re not obviously going to speculate, but as Tim talked about it, that\u2019s how we think about it. As you think through our numbers and try to get to your best guess, just remember our reported numbers still include a very large tenant that we have already restructured and announced to the street, which is Capital Senior. That\u2019s already still in those numbers there will be out the next two quarters, but that has already happened. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Mizuho Capital. Please go ahead. Tayo Okusanya : Hi, just a quick follow-up on the health systems platform. Can you just help us understand that this point, I\u2019m going, there\u2019s a lot going on in skilled nursing and government funding, but could you just help us understand specifically what you\u2019d expect to kind of happen next from a government funding perspective? What you\u2019re kind of hearing also from the States about Medicaid funding? Just given all their budgets are pretty stretched right now, because of the whole COVID issue? Shankh Mitra : Yeah. So, Tayo, we\u2019re reading the same things that you\u2019re reading. This is inappropriate for us to speculate on what additional government funding might be or might not be coming to this space. So, we\u2019ll just leave that for future discussions. But we\u2019re encouraged by the support that post-acute industry has seen so far. Tayo Okusanya : What about on the state that was just given a lot of them are setting the budgets right now? Are you kind of hearing anything of any feedback that you set to next have a good sense of what the Medicaid funding would look like? Shankh Mitra : Thank you for trying Tayo, I\u2019ll remain the same answer that it is an inappropriate venue for us to speculate on the future state government action as well. Operator : Thank you. I show no further questions in the queue at this time. This concludes our Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded [Operator instructions]. I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Matt McQueen : Thank you and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call maybe deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh? Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt and good morning, everyone. First and foremost, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these difficult times. Before I get into the accomplishment for the quarter and discuss our capital allocation strategy, let me make some comments on leadership changes and strategy going forward for Welltower. Let me start with our outgoing CEO, my close friend and mentor, Tom DeRosa. Tom's impact on our industry, our company and me can never be overstated. He was a visionary who saw the need of integrating senior housing into healthcare continuum years before COVID and now we all know the importance of that today and going forward. He was a successful entrepreneur -- he took a successful entrepreneurial company and made it a process driven institutional company that attracted an incredible caliber of talent. And last but not the least, his contribution on me personally and my career can never be overemphasized. He has been a terrific boss, a great mentor and a close friend. He continues to help me even today and guide me in as necessary. We wish Tom the very best in his retirement. I'm also pleased to announce that Phil Hawkins one of the most well respected ex-CEOs of the REIT space has joined our board. We're looking forward to Phil's guidance and mentorship for many years to come. And finally, I'm thrilled to be working with a new independent Chairman of the Board, Ken Bacon, with a strong track record of leadership and experience, both in real estate and finance. Ken, will lead our board and partner with me and our leadership team as we execute our company strategy. As far as our team is concerned, the company has never been in a better place. There are about 20 women and men who are leading this company forward every day. I cannot be more proud of this team. In the coming weeks and months, you will see a series of promotions and new roles that will consolidate the leadership of this company, not a change per se, just a recognition of the exceptional work that the team is doing. Our team has never been busier and more excited to create once in a lifetime value for our owners. Many of you have asked me if our strategy will change going forward. The answer to that question is an emphatic no. Welltower will continue to strive to be the premier wellness infrastructure company that allocates capital in the path of growth of healthcare and wellness trends. You're not going to get any grand strategic pronouncement from me. We\u2019ll continue to focus on creating value for our partners and our employees, if they create significant value for our owners. And the partners and employees will be able to create long term sustainable value, only if their end customers are happy. It is that simple. We do not need to complicate a simple idea. We need to continue to execute and deliver superior cash flow growth on a per share basis. To paraphrase one of my favorite CEOs of all time, Tom Murphy, the goal is not to have the longest wait but we arrive at the station first using the least amount of wealth. We will continue to be vigilant as ever that institutional imperative do not fit into our culture and we remain focused on efficiency of the platform, data driven decision making and employee satisfaction. Given it is my first call as CEO, I lay out a simple capital allocation framework for you. A company effectively has four choices of raising capital; capping internal cash flow, issuing debt, issuing equity and disposition of its existing assets. It also has five essential choices of deploying that capital; investing in existing assets, acquisitions, paying down debt, paying dividends and buying back stock. You can loosely call the first set of choices as selling, but right description of that would be sourcing or raising capital. You can loosely call the second set of choices as buying, but the client description would be deployment of capital. Following the same line of thinking, loosely speaking, consistent buying low and selling high creates value for our shareholders in a more wholesome and thoughtful description, pptimizing these choices from this menu of sources and uses in a tax efficient manner creates value for continuing shareholder on per share basis. The goal is to maximize cash flow and value per share, not to become the biggest or the most revolutionary. We at Welltower do not spend a second strategizing on how to win the popularity contest on Wall Street. In fact, as stated in the past, we focused on buying assets when they're out of favor that is unpopular at the right price in the right structure. Ultimately, this capital deployment strategy allows for outsized return with a large margin of safety. Price, not exposure, is the ultimate mitigant of risk. We are constantly striving to create value and trust you as our shareholders will reward the companies that create true intrinsic value over long term. If you allow me to continue this theme of sourcing and deployment of capital, let's look at what we have achieved in Q3 and post quarter close. We are delighted to inform you that we have executed on two large senior housing transactions at a valuation significant in excess of $400,000 units in the mid 3% cap rate on current NOI and around 5% cap rate on pre COVID NOI. These transactions with our Invesco joint venture on MOBs puts us in an enviable position of balance sheet strength. We currently have $5.2 billion of liquidity and $2.2 billion of cash, which is expected to rise further as the quarter progresses. We at Welltower do not see balance sheet as a matter of vanity like vintage cars, but the most important countercyclical tool to create value at the cycle lows and avoid the need of raising dilutive capital at exactly the wrong time in the cycle. That gets us to our menu of capital deployment to particular interest investing in hard assets and doubling down on the assets that we already own through buying back our own stock. In matter of any acquisitions as is with stocks patients is a virtue with occasional boldness, and we think that moment of occasional boldness is finally here. We have in excess of $1 billion of acquisition in our pipeline comprised of 6,500-plus units at an average price of $165,000 unit at a material discount to replacement cost. 17 deals in the pipeline represents a wide range of transactions from $10 million redevelopment asset to $188 million core portfolio of brand-new assets. We have identified many of these assets working with our existing partners through our data analytics platform or who are buying out other capital partner of our existing operators. The pipeline's initial yield is at low 4s but we believe it will stabilize in the high single-digit to low double-digit yields. As is a very short term but incorrect way to look at this will be, we're deploying capital in the low 4% trends and sourcing that capital in the mid 3% range. We believe the correct way to look at this will be that we are sourcing that capital in the mid single digit unlevered IRR and deploying at a low double digit unlevered IRR, as evidenced by sourcing the capital in the 400,000 plus per unit level and deploying that capital at $165,000 per unit level. Despite our weak cost of public capital, this rate has never been wider and hence the opportunity to create generational value for our owners on a per share basis. And that completes the look for you and explains why our team is so excited and so busy. We believe we are making real impact and anticipate creating exceptional value. We not only see this environment as an opportunity for smart capital allocation in the financial realm, but also in the human capital area. We are seeing availability of superior talent in the marketplace today and we're bouncing on this opportunity as we are on the investment side. With that, I will hand the mic over to Tim, who will walk you through the operational and financial results for the quarter. I will come back to make some additional comments on the operating environment after him. Tim? Tim McHugh : Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on the third quarter 2020 results and performance of all property segments in the quarter, our capital activity and finally, a balance sheet liquidity update. In the third quarter, Welltower reported normalized FFO of $0.84 per diluted share, a $0.02 decline from second quarter, driven by $0.03 of dilution from dispositions completed in Q2 and Q3, a $0.01 negative impact from changes in revenue recognition in our post-acute senior housing triple net portfolios and a slight decline in sequential senior housing operating performance. Those items were offset by tighter cost controls at corporate and reduction in COVID-related expenses in our senior housing operating portfolio. As a reminder, on the dilution type dispositions, we had $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, inclusive 10/31 deposits as of 9/30. Now turning to our individual property segments. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple net lease portfolio covered an occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6/30/2020 and therefore, only reflect a partial impact on COVID-19. Across all triple net lease segments, Welltower collected 98% of contractual rent due in the third quarter. Now starting with our senior housing triple net portfolio. Same-store NOIs declined 10 basis points year-over-year and higher bad debt accrual and a tough comp drove growth slightly negative. The combined FFO impact of revenue recognition changes on one restructured lease in the quarter was $0.05 relative to 2Q and expected to grow to a full penny in 4Q., i.e., another half penny impact sequentially from 3Q to 4Q. Occupancy was down 390 basis points sequentially and EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.02x on a sequential basis to 1.02. Consistent with my comments in the past, our senior housing triple-net operators experienced the same headwind server day operators over the past seven months, and we expect reported lease coverage starts stats to continue to reflect these challenges and more of the pandemic periods reflected EBITDAR going forward. In the quarter, we also transitioned five of a planned nine properties from Capital Senior to StoryPoint Senior Living and expect the other four properties to transition by the end of the year. This is the first phase of the transition agreement we entered into with Capital Senior at beginning of the year, which allowed for an early termination of CSUs leases on 24 Welltower owned assets in exchange for full year 2020 rent being paid in cooperation with transitioning the operations. Despite the challenging environment, our team and our operators have been able to organize and execute transition plans with StoryPoint transitions as well as the remaining 15 properties CSU currently operates, which will be transitioned to three of our existing RIDEA operators in the fourth quarter. As a result of the COVID backdrop, the initial expected dilution from the conversion is expected to be approximately $12 million or $0.03 per share in 2021 relative to rent recognized in 2020. As a reminder, since our capital senior rent continues to be paid, the leases on these assets that have yet to be transitioned are reflected on our payment coverage stratification presentation on Page 7 of our supplement and make up roughly three fourths of the triple-net senior housing rent that is less than 0.85x covered by EBITDA. Although the last seven months have been very challenging for the senior housing triple operators, the sequential stabilization we observed between the second and third quarter, along with relief funds from HHS we received in the fourth quarter, should help our operators find their footing heading into 2021. Turning to long term post acute portfolio. We generated positive 2% year-over-year same store growth and EBITDAR coverage decline by 0.1x sequentially. As noted in our business update earlier this month and in last night's release, Genesis Healthcare, which makes up approximately half of our long term post acute segment exposure, includes language in the second quarter financials filed on August 10th regarding its ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of this, Welltower began recording Genesis lease revenue on a cash basis in the third quarter, retroactive to July 1st. This had a negative $2.2 million impact or approximately half of penny FFO per share relative to second quarter 2020. This also resulted in writedown of $97 million of straight line rent receivables. Genesis continues to remain current on all financial obligations to Welltower through October. And lastly, within our triple net lease segments, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with ProMedica Health System. NOI growth was positive 2.3% year-over-year, driven by 2.75% increase during August and trailing 12 month EBITDAR coverage was 2.61 times. Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical portfolio delivered positive 1% same store growth. This below trend growth was driven mainly by increased bad debt reserve, majority of which related to lease enforcement moratoriums in several California jurisdictions, which we have a sizable footprint. As these moratoriums expire, we spent rent collection to further improve. We continue to see signs across our outpatient portfolio that activities returned to pre COVID levels, evidenced by the number of tenant work order requests received, our tenant's own volume data and park income in our properties. In the quarter, park income was still a slight headwind year-over-year, but its negative contribution to NOI growth decreased to 10 basis points this quarter versus 70 basis points in the second quarter. During the quarter, we collected approximately 97% of contractual rents and had an additional 2% of rents deferred, the majority of which are located in the aforementioned jurisdictions with lease enforcement moratoriums. We also continue to have very strong rent collection and deferral plans we put in place in April, May and June. Since we started collecting on these plans in June, we've experienced 99.5% collection rates through September. As a reminder, the large majority of our second quarter deferral plans were structured to pay back entirely by year-end. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before reviewing this quarter's senior housing operating portfolio results, I want to briefly summarize the outlook we provided back in us. At that time, our expectations for the third quarter was that occupancy would be down between 125 and 175 basis points from July 1st through September 30th. And that REVPOR and total expenses would be flat sequentially. We ended the quarter with occupancy down 150 basis points start to finish. REVPOR was down 40 basis points, and expenses were down 3.4%. Turning to results in the quarter. Same store NOI decreased 27.3% as compared to the third quarter of 2019, driven largely by 680 basis point year-over-year drop in average occupancy. As we indicated last quarter, two factors drove this outsized decline in occupancy. First, the portfolio began the third quarter at significantly lower level of occupancy, following the steep drop experienced in the second quarter and continued to decline during the quarter, albeit at a significantly decelerated pace from 2Q. And secondly, we experienced a seasonal increase in occupancy in the third quarter of 2019, creating tougher sequential comp. REVPOR for the quarter was down 1% year-over-year, but I want to provide a bit more color here. The next shift is distorting the use of this metric as a proxy for rate growth. Over the last two quarters, our lower acuity properties, active adult independent living, have held up considerably better on the occupancy front than our higher acuity buildings. This has driven up the percentage of total portfolio occupied units that are lower acuity and therefore, lower rent paying units. This has had the mathematical effect of averaging down our total portfolio of rent per occupied unit. If you break the portfolio into two buckets, active adult independent living in one and assisted living and memory care in the other, you will see the lower acuity bucket had 20 basis point decrease in REVPOR year-over-year, while the higher acuity bucket had a positive 1.4% year-over-year change. While we are seeing as in some select discounting on room rates in some of our markets, in general, rates continue to be fairly resilient in the face of occupancy declines. And lastly, SHO operating expenses. Same store operating expenses declined 1.1% year-over-year and declined 3.3% sequentially. I'll focus on sequential growth since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. We experienced fairly expected sequential expense trends driven by two main items; lower compensation growth as operators adjusted their staffing to lower occupancy levels and lower COVID expenses as same- tore COVID expenses decreased from $33 million to $50 million sequentially, driven by lower emergency staffing costs and significant reductions in price per unit cost of PPE. We expect COVID-related costs to continue to decrease in the fourth quarter, but at a much lower pace than in 3Q. Looking forward to the fourth quarter and starting with October data we've already observed, we've experienced a 30 basis point decline in occupancy to the week of October 23rd. And we expect to finish the fourth quarter approximately 75 basis points to 125 basis points lower than where we ended the third quarter. We also expect both ROVPAR and total expenses to be flat on a sequential basis. This outlook does not include any impact from HHS funds that maybe received in the fourth quarter. Now on to capital markets activity. In July, we completed the successful tender of $426 million of our 3.75% and 3.95% senior notes due in 2023. Proceeds for the tender were generated from the June issuance of $600 million in senior unsecured notes bearing interest rate of 2.75% with maturity date of January 2031. We used the remaining proceeds to pay down $140 million of our term loan due in 2022. These transactions both derisk near-term maturities through 2023 and increased our unsecured bond borrowings weighted average maturity to 9.2 years. Additionally, in the quarter, we repaid $289 million of secured debt of which $112 million was the fee and subsequently extinguished in October. Moving to investment activity, which was mainly focused on our development pipeline with $96 million invested this quarter. On the disposition front, we completed $1.4 billion of pro rata dispositions at a 5.3 cap rate. Post quarter end, we closed on the previously announced sale of a senior housing operating portfolio for $200 million or $395,000 per unit. The sales price represents a cap rate of 2.6% based on third quarter annualized NOI and a 4.9% cap rate on pre-COVID or March trailing 12-month NOI. Inclusive of this disposition, we completed $3.3 billion dispositions year-to-date at a 5.4% cap rate. We expect to close another $186 million of transactions in the fourth quarter comprised of secondary tranches or [ROPAR] asset sales tied to previously executed outpatient medical transactions. The near-term FFO impact from the completion of these intra and post-quarter dispositions will be approximately $0.03 per share sequentially in the fourth quarter, and will bring cash and cash equivalents to $2.4 billion and total liquidity to $5.4 billion. We believe that the continued ability to execute dispositions of strong pricing supports our view that our private cost of equity capital is substantially better than our public costs at this time. Underlying cash flow continues to be impacted by a challenging backdrop. We ended the quarter at 6.02 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a 34 basis point increase from last quarter as a result of liquidity generated successful dispositions in the quarter, which have continued to bolster the balance sheet. Adjusting for EBITDA loss to sales in the quarter and the post quarter end sales just mentioned, run rate net debt to EBITDA is approximately 6.1 times, with $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thanks, Tim. Let me provide you some color on underlying trends of what's happening in the senior housing business. Needless to say that we're very encouraged by the sequential stabilization of NOI in the quarter. I would like to draw your attention to Slide 16 of our deck, which describes a significant sequential improvement of move ins. Last quarter, I talked about the hesitation of customers to move in after they put a deposit on. As communities resumed visitation, we have seen a significant improvement in this area, frankly, which was my biggest concern as described last quarter call. Let's take an example of five very large operators, which constitute of national operators, large regional operators in Northeast, West Coast and Sunbelt, a pretty diverse group. The average delay between deposit to move in during October of last year was 19 days. In March of this year, it was 17 days, that increased to a whopping 41 days in June. We have seen a meaningful decrease every month in Q3 and finally, it is down to about 18 days in October. We are hearing from our AL focus partners that in many cases this lag is now getting shorter than pre covet days as families can no longer delay the care needs of their loved ones. No question, we're very encouraged by that. However, we are unwilling to project this moving trend as we are in middle of a third wave of COVID across the country. It will be a complete full hurry for us to predict how things will play out in next few weeks and months before the COVID car flattens out again. But the experience of this accelerated move-ins in the pace of move ins tells you that our customers need our product. They moved in as soon as they could. We have no ability to predict when we'll be on the other side of the COVID but we're optimistic when that they finally come, our need-based product will likely to see meaningful traction in demand. What bridges us between now and then is our fortress balance sheet and what creates value between now and then is our ability to allocate capital to make outsized returns for our owners. In this age of Torrens of information, it is sometimes hard to differentiate signals from noise. It is important that we periodically take a step back and remind ourselves that stock is a fractional ownership in a business and not a ticker. As managers of the business we can assure you that our team has never been more energized and excited about creating long term value for our shareholders. With that, we\u2019ll open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Stephen Sakwa : I guess, Shank, going back to Page 16, it's encouraging to see the move-ins. Could you talk maybe a little bit more about leads and kind of where leads are? And I know you spoke a little bit about the time from a lead to a move-in. But just what are you seeing specifically on that timetable as it relates to move-ins? Shankh Mitra : So Steve, leads has not been a problem even when we were here 90 days ago, leads have come back, not completely to pre COVID level but definitely on a year-over-year basis but sequentially it has. And it is even on a year-over-year basis, it's approaching pre COVID level, maybe 10%, 50% still lower. But we're definitely approaching the amount of leads and the quality leads, more importantly, in the system. The issue has been that you obviously had a very good follow-through of how many people are doing -- either seeing the units, whether virtually or physically and then getting to the deposit. That's what I talked about the pressure on the sort of the front door, if you will. That has not been the issue. The issue has been that the customer was hesitating after that. This is a purely an AL focused comment. We're still seeing hesitation in the IL focused communities where if you don't have a need, you're taking time to make a decision. I mean, with all the noise and then obviously, hopeful good news on vaccines, people are just taking time. I can't tell you why that is the case but on the IL side, people are taking the time. On the AL side, we have faced that pressure on the front door but that was not translating into the move-in, that sale was not translating into the move-in, which we kind of described that. And since we said that, we have seen some clearly significant improvement in that area. So that's what we're seeing in that rapid pace of acceleration in that move-in and that continued even through last week. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citi. Mr. Joseph, your line is open. Okay. I show our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : So just want to get in a little bit to the fourth quarter sequential occupancy numbers that you went through. So down 100 basis points versus the third quarter, which is reasonable in a perhaps a seasonal environment, and you can comment on seasonality that would typically impact you. But I'm curious how would 100 basis points compare to your pre-COVID history. Is this a fairly typical change in occupancy, or is it still being impacted in your view by the unique environment we're in? Tim McHugh : I'll start with that, Rich. It's higher than we usually see. You typically see kind of a 50 basis point decrease over that stretches from 4Q to 1Q, but over a typical seasonality of occupancy, you'll see 50 basis points lost over kind of the fourth quarter and first quarter. So this higher than that. And I think speaking about the seasonality is improvement, because it adds some uncertainty to the number, which is factored in now we're looking at the fourth quarter. We've talked about this a bit, at this point, in some ways, it's a best guy\u2019s hypothesis and that we won't see as much of a seasonal change in demand just due to the disruption we've seen in this demand during the year. And so seasonality, there's two things that drive seasonality. There's change in seasonal demand and there's also the impact of the flu. I think data is very supportive of the flu. At this point won't play a large role in the typical seasonality we see. And on the demand side, we don't necessarily think that the typical demand changes we see will play a role. But the 100 basis points is really just due to the COVID environment, what we've seen so far in the quarter. And certainly, when I say COVID environment, it's really the national picture, the acceleration in cases and it\u2019s that adding a bit of certainty to what the outlook is for the next two, three months. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Shankh, congrats on taking the leadership and congrats to the whole team. I know you guys put a lot of hard work. Just maybe building or digging into '16 a little bit, you've seen the acceleration, like you pointed out in the lead conversion that the time lines narrowing. I'm just wondering if you described sort of second or third wave, or hard to categorize now. But can you sort of comment on this decline in timing and the leads in markets where you've really seen a true second and a true third wave versus markets where we're just seeing sort of a new wave. In other words, is this more kind of uniform? Are you seeing real dispersion in markets? Shankh Mitra : We're actually not seeing a lot of dispersion in markets per se, there's a huge dispersion from a product-type perspective. So you were seeing whether in the West Coast, East Coast or Texas, or you pick your market. If you have a need driven product, the customer's willingness to make a decision is significantly higher. And frankly, we are hearing from some of our partners that, that is even accelerated relative to even pre COVID levels. But in case of where you have a lifestyle-driven product where somebody wants to be in that environment but doesn't have to be, you are still seeing visitation. So it's not a market driven, it is definitely a product driven phenomena. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citi. Michael Bilerman : So Shankh, congrats again on the CEO role. How do you see your leadership style and approach both similar but also different than Tom? And maybe secondarily, Tom, obviously, was highly visible within the industry and as well as globally going to Davos and other events. I guess how do you see yourself doing that? And is that going to be part of your approach as well as CEO of Welltower? Shankh Mitra : So I will tell you, look, as you guys know that Tom has trained me for the job over many years and definitely been very influenced by how he saw the world. The first and foremost, he had taught us and that sort of ingrained in my leadership style as well as a lot of other people in our leadership team is to take that what we can do more from this platform, not just think about disparate aggregation of assets but thinking through platform. And the importance of being on the bleeding edge of healthcare and wellness trends and that will continue to happen. I'm very much focused on execution, very much focused on per share value creation. And that's what the team made and capital allocation. So everybody's leadership style is different and I would -- obviously, it is less important on the difference between Tom's leadership style and my leadership style, I will tell you, that it is as collectively as the leadership team, we see our biggest focus today is to increase the value per share execute. And obviously, there's a tremendous amount of potential for us to get back to our lost earnings, not just to the recover level. As you imagine, we have talked about even pre COVID, our portfolio was under leased and get back to that and create that value through execution and capital allocation, and that's what we are focused on today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Capital One. Daniel Bernstein : I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the other side of the equation on move-outs and just understand maybe why residents are moving out if you have that information at this point? Is it pent-up move-outs, AL to SNFs that you've seen higher acuity, families taking residence out before the winter, any change in length of stay? Just trying to understand that other side of the equation for move-ins. Shankh Mitra : Dan, you asked a very interesting question. If you think about move outs, move outs have come down pretty much across the board for over last seven, eight months through COVID. Last couple of weeks, I would say that we have seen some increased move-outs. It's hard to say why that is the case, because it's too short of a time frame to make this as a trend. But it is also the most difficult part of our business to predict. It is all of the above of what you mentioned as reason for move out. We don't see financial reasons for move out in our industry, but we have seen some elevated move-outs for last couple of weeks. We also saw some reduced move outs few weeks before that. This is a very, very hard business to predict on a weekly basis, monthly basis. So I think it is hard for us to sort of get into that and see what the trend and what's not. You could take us for weeks and say the first two weeks is that you wanted to have an optimistic bench, and you could have said that I will take that move-out trends and move-in trends and project, or you could have taken the last two weeks of elevated move out trends and project forward, and there's no right and wrong answer. We have just done the latter part or the first part. But we could be wrong and things can turn out to be better than we thought. But as we sit here today with the uncertainty that we see the overall, the national COVID environment, I think it's prudent for us to, at this point, not to try to get to too excited about what might or might not happen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Q - Juan Sanabria : I just wanted to follow up with one of your points at the end there where you talked about conversions of people putting down money to actually coming into the cities in that kind of compresses back to kind of pre-COVID levels. Does that mean potentially that once COVID passes that you don't have kind of deferred demand, I guess, particularly on the AL side that would be coming in the door kind of post COVID whenever that may be first or second quarter that's kind of deferred the decision and now is ready to come in if those leads and deposits are converting today? Shankh Mitra : No, Juan. It simply means that the customers need our product. So what has been going on is with all the national headlines and all the COVID and the overall situations, people are hesitating. Now we obviously have a need that's sort of adding up. And now the customers are saying, well, they can move in, again, we're not projecting that into the future, that's a very important point. If we did then we would not give you the guidance for fourth quarter that we did. But very much with thinking that very simply the customer has moved in when they could. Now if COVID spiked up again and they can because you have visitation bans or you have shutdown of facilities and all of those things, that you will see that. But most importantly, they moved in when they can. I was simply answering the question on the need-driven nature of our product and the secular demand of the product. COVID will eventually be behind us and the demand of the product hasn't changed through this period of time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky from Berenberg. Connor Siversky : Just a quick one on testing capacity, among your peers of the last round of earnings, it still seemed like point-of-care test were in short supply. So I'm just wondering how this dynamic has improved at all? And then given some news on the vaccination front, what are the goals in terms of testing if we're taking six or 12 month view? Shankh Mitra : Connor, we have made a very significant improvement even in last 90 days on point-of-care testing. We tested over 200,000 employees and residents and that continues to progress. We got some very significant improvement, I would say, in the last 45 days in that particular area, a point of -- in the testing side. But it's too premature to say how that will impact the consumer behavior and the ability to move in people. We think it will improve. But again, given the overall uncertain environment, it is too early for us to comment. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : I was hoping to get a sense of the legacy RIDEA contracts that were embedded in the SHO dispositions during 3Q, and if the majority were actually legacy structures. I believe heading into 2020, you had 80% of operators converted to what is seemingly a more favorable RIDEA 3.0 contract. And I guess the second part of the question is where would that percentage stand today? Thank you. Shankh Mitra : I don't have the number percentage for you, but I can tell you that both of -- what was -- the two portfolios were sold, they were not in RIDEA 3.0 contracts. So your fundamental assumption will be correct. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich from Green Street. Lukas Hartwich : Just a bit color on [Indiscernible] earlier, that was really helpful. I was hoping you could dive a bit below the surface and describe what you're seeing with base rents versus concessions, things like that? Shankh Mitra : Lukas, can you repeat please one more time? Lukas Hartwich : So was curious on the REVPOR front, if you could dive a little bit deeper on what you're seeing with face rents versus concessions? What's kind of driving the headline REVPOR number? I thought the color around the mix shift was helpful. I'm just curious what's going on with face rents and concessions? Tim McHugh : So I think from the numbers and we're seeing in the market is we're not seeing a lot of evidence of concession. I think as Shank spoke to probably seeing more on the lower acuity side as far as just what we're seeing in the market as far as it\u2019s because of some of the difference in kind of needs-based aspect of it that there is a little bit more of a consumer discretionary goods and therefore, you're seeing a bit more of that, I'd say, in the front end whereas on the assisted living side, you're seeing very little bit. We've talked about this a bit, community fees, which typically align with when you move in and are both kind of cover costs to move in, as well as having testing, et cetera, to get your acuity level of care. So you're seeing some discounting of those. And so we've said the combination of community fees coming through REVPOR is that you have people moving in on a year-over-year basis. So you're seeing kind of community fees in total come down and also you're seeing some discounting. And in assisted living importantly you\u2019re not seeing discounting in care and more of the residents we're seeing coming in, they're coming in because of the care. And so there isn't a lot of price competition there. Reputation is a huge factor. You saw some competition in general in the market to the supply cycle over the last couple of years impact pricing. I'd say in the COVID environment, you're actually seeing a bit of that dissipate because more of the consumer residents are being attracted towards the better brand names and more well-known names in the market. So assisted living pricing is holding up, I'd say, pretty well, as said in the opening remarks, given the steepness of the occupancy declines. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Shankh, I was hoping you can provide some color on the investment pipeline and the types of deals that you've been able to source. I guess, prior market valuations appear to have held up well, especially given Welltower's recent sales, I guess, this past several months. I mean, what is or is there a difference between on the assets that you sold versus the deals that are in your pipeline, if you're being able to source at much below replacement costs? Shankh Mitra : There is. So if you think about in today's marketplace, pay, if you take a very simple view of. What gets you financing is you've got to check three boxes, pretty assets, pretty market, most importantly, a very well-known well-reputed operator. If you can\u2019t check all those three boxes, it will be very hard, if not impossible for you to line up financing. And that gets you to the everything else outside that. We talked about this on the last call. We are bringing our operators into asset. So these assets will become financeable but today, it's not. Many of these assets were built in the last two, three years, so they don't have a stabilized 2019 NOI that a lender can underwrite. So a lot of things we're buying brand-new assets that have been built last two to three years, does not fit that criteria. So those are the ones that we are doing. Interestingly, if you see that in real estate over a period of time for apples-to-apples, newer asset trades for higher prices than lower, but just really difference of CapEx that's relative to vintage. Given what happened today in the marketplace, you are seeing exactly opposite of that. Newer assets are trading at a discount purely because they can get financing because they don't have a stabilized NOI for a lender to underwrite. And that's where we are coming in to buy things for cash. So we don't obviously put financing in, we buy assets for cash. And that bringing in our operators that these assets are obviously owned by other capital partners of our existing operators and we're buying this asset. So there is a difference. So if you think about what we sold that checks all the boxes, pretty assets, pretty market and very experienced and well-known well-reputed operator. You missed one of those checks, it comes back to pretty much very, very few buyers in the marketplace as well as dominant one. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Shank, let me offer my congrats on your promotion as well. And actually, the comments you had on the call regarding the portfolio buying and selling was definitely helpful. On the lines in our model that really sticks out is the gain on sale of properties with some $3 billion recognized over the last five years or so. So that's been now lost upon us. The question I really have, though, is just related to your comments on the lower expenses in the SHOP portfolio, particularly in the lower PPE, where you said the price per unit costs are now weighed down. Just curious how much you think that trend is more of a industry phenomenon versus how much Welltower maybe driving a better-than-average trend on that either due to some of the initiatives like the Dallas procurement center and other stuff that's more company specific. Thanks. Shankh Mitra : I'd say we actually have wound down a lot of the activity that we had in the Dallas Procurement Center. That was very important to operations when -- to our operators' operations early on in the March and April period when the only way to access PPE or one of the only ways to kind of guarantee access to it was through scale. And I think as we've seen distribution channels normalize and they're still not back to where they would be pre-COVID. But as you've seen them normalize, our operator sale of assets PP&E and sales, and in instances like really haven't we've stepped in to help. But for the most part, that's going direct from operators to providers of PPE. And so I think in saying that the pricing is more of just seeing a bit of a normalization from -- if you look at mass prices where some as upwards of $8 on things are retailing $0.80 to $1.10 in a normal environment and they're still elevated even today. But if they're in the $3 to $4 range, it's come down significantly from what we're paying on average in the second quarter. Tim McHugh : I'll just add some commentary to the first part of your question, which is I want you to understand that we're not trying to buy and sell assets like trade assets, that's not our goal. Obviously, when we see how to finance a transaction, we're trying to always think about what our sources of capital will be. Sometimes that could be stock at some point in the cycle, some point that could be the equity that's trapped into the asset that you think have maximized under your sort of umbrella. So we have alluded to this before that the huge amount of portfolio transformation, which I believe sort of amounts to close to $30 billion of asset disposition and acquisition over the last five years, is roughly complete. However, we have seen that the propensity of companies to continue to grow and that is not inside Welltower. We're always trying to think how we maximize value per share for the continuing shareholder. You can say the one good thing will be when you\u2019re exactly at the right place is just continue to sell your stock instead of selling your assets, and that would be a correct approach if you just look at capital allocation from the lens of spot NAV. I told you that's not how we see the world. We see the world from the perspective of long term IRR of what you're selling versus what you're buying and look at a comprehensive way of what your tools, the sort of sources and uses of capitals are. So we'll continue to do that. But the overall transformation of the portfolio that we wanted to do that some started, I would say we're roughly close to being done. But that doesn't mean that we'll not sell assets. We'll continue to sell assets if we think that is the best source of capital to fund what we are buying. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Mizuho. Omotayo Okusanya : So first question just around the senior housing. Again, we've kind of had its first round and you guys are getting some proceeds in 4Q. But I think clearly, everyone thinks that's not enough. I mean what's the viewpoint that you have internally of just what the government still has to do or what you would like to see the government do in regards to help for the industry to kind of stabilize then? Shankh Mitra : We don't have an internal view of what we'd like to see the government do. I think it's been very beneficial to our operators to have seen them step in with the first tranche that they provided through HHS. And there's a second tranche that's currently being contemplated and has been open for application. It's more performance-based, the first one was just more based on 2019 revenue. But as far as kind of further funds from HHS, management doesn't have an internal view. Part of the reason why we\u2019ve acted the way we have as far as building our balance sheet and continuing to strengthen our capital position is that we're not reliant on the duration of the pandemic or the government taking a view on funds to the industry. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico : Just a question on the move-ins. I know you guys pointed to Slide 16, which is showing the move-ins coming back versus February being indexed to February. And I guess I'm wondering though, why is February the appropriate month to be comparing to? I mean, isn't February, the dead of winter kind of a slower move in time, isn't the more relevant metric that your move-ins are down 39% from a year ago? Shankh Mitra : We do think that's a relevant metric. That's why we put out in our slide deck. However, as far as we understand, if you think about the business, the February marks the last month of pre COVID. So we're trying to understand the business trends, how that has changed through COVID. So putting out last -- year-over-year is not a function of just what's happening today. It's also a function of what happened last year. All of us on this call know what happened last year at this point is fairly irrelevant given how COVID has changed our business. But we do think that the point that you're making, which is the year over year decline is an important one, and that's why we put it in board face on our slide deck. Operator : I show our last question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Just two quick ones here. Number one, should we think of all near-term acquisitions as pretty much entirely being focused on senior housing. And then second, can you update us on the progress at the 56th Street project that opened recently? Shankh Mitra : So let me answer both of those two questions. Our near-term acquisition pipeline is primarily focused on senior housing. We have a couple of smaller MOB deals in the pipeline. However, it's primarily focused on senior housing because that's why we see the significant disruption on the pricing side. MOBs are not priced for distress and we see for the marginal use of the capital, we see significantly bigger opportunity on the senior housing side. And the East 56 Street, we're still waiting for our license, state seems to be opening up again for licensure. So when we get the licensure then we'll open the buildings for residents. Operator : We have a follow-up from Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc. Jordan Sadler : So I wanted to ask you and I might have missed this because I get drop for the second half of the call. But I had a question about sort of the market in general. I mean I appreciate your commentary and I know this has been your cadence about sort of buying low, selling high essentially, very focused on capital allocation. How would you characterize the market for seniors housing right now? In other words, supply of assets versus demand? I mean are we in equilibrium, or are people better to buy or better to sell? Is it tough to source stuff, easy to source stuff? How would you sort of characterize it? Shankh Mitra : That's a great question, Jordan and it's a tale of two cities. If you have, as I described previously, pretty assets, pretty markets and most importantly, experienced operator and a stabilized 2019 NOI base that a lender can underwrite, you cannot -- there's a feeding frenzy. You cannot have enough assets for capital to buy, because everybody -- private capital is not focused on what's going to be the occupancy from fourth quarter. They're focused on what's coming for next three year, five year, 10 years, 15 years and the opportunity to make generational return given where we are from an industry perspective, the demand side of the equation. So that sort of -- you have one side. On the other side, the finance misses one of those -- one or more of those checks that I talked about that you cannot finance those transactions today. And because of that, usually, transactions like that has been financed in the bank side of the house rather than life companies or agencies on stabilized assets. And banks are obviously not lending in the space today anywhere close to where they were. I I almost would venture, I guess, to say they're not lending at all other than like a couple of select circumstances. So you have a tale of two cities on those kind of assets, which are not financeable because of the -- you didn't check all the three boxes that I talked about, there's almost no bid for the asset, because we have to buy those assets for cash. And there we have very significant buyers who know we buy assets and we buy everything for cash. And so we're finding tremendous opportunity on that. And frankly, as I described previously, we're finding many of these assets you can buy brand-new assets at a significantly lower price than the older assets purely because of all the margin building activity that happened in our industry from, call it, \u201816, '17 to '18, '19, and those assets are, in many cases, are not financeable, and we're finding tremendous risk adjusted return. bringing our operators and our data capabilities and filling those assets out that you will see in next few years. Operator : I show our last question and follow-up comes from Omotayo Okusanya from Mizuho. Omotayo Okusanya : Just another quick one. Is there any pressure to kind of ramp up acquisition activity in a world where you have at a kind of eliminates the 1031 exchanges. Like how does that kind of change how you think about deals going forward? Shankh Mitra : There is only one pressure of buying things in our shop and that's price. We're not trying to fight assets exactly at the bottom regardless of outcome of election. It is possible that you will see asset prices are lower in three months than it is today. But again, if you think about the scale and scope of our balance sheet of how much value we want to create for our shareholders, if the asset prices go down we'll buy more. So there is no pressure other than price. And we can tell you at Welltower, we're [salivating] on the prices that we see today in the marketplace. Operator : Thank you. I do show we have a question -- I show no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call over to management. Shankh Mitra : Thank you very much. We'll see you in another 90 days. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Mr. Matt Carrus. Matthew Carrus : Thank you, [Dillaman], and good morning, everyone. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the Company's filings with the SEC. With that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh? Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. First and foremost, I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. In the suite of this year-end call, I would like to review year 2020, the most challenging in our history and discuss different paths of growth, long-term value creation for our continuing shareholders on par share basis. We came into 2020 prepared for perhaps a plain-vanilla business cycle downturn. We pushed out our maturities in Q4 of 2019, sold a lot of short duration assets, bought a lot of longer duration assets, and continued to upgrade our portfolio, operators, management contract, and talent. We are hopeful that with the continued decline in senior housing deliveries and starts on one hand and the ageing of the population finally picking up on the other hand that 2020 would serve an inflection point for the fundamentals after decades of weak demographics resulting from the ageing of the baby-boomer generation. Then, the once-a-century pandemic happened that would turn out to be particularly devastating for our business. The back half of first quarter, the second and third quarters were all about long-term value preservation. We enhanced our liquidity profile dramatically by selling assets in record time at or near pre-COVID pricing, more importantly avoided mistakes of raising long-term dilutive capital, a consistent theme for managing the company for continuing shareholder on a par share basis. We started during the dark days of March and April by selling $1 billion of assets at great prices in record 43 days from signing a confidentiality agreement to receiving cash. We continued this journey during Q2 and Q3 and eventually executed on $3.7 billion of disposition at extraordinary prices to build an unprecedented war chest. Two things particularly surprised me during these times. The resilience of our team including our extended team of operating partners and the liquidity of our assets. Not that we didn't have doubts or failures, but we continued to move forward in spite of them with a steady hand on the wheel and an unwavering belief that we\u2019ll get to the other side. Our team\u2019s stoic resilience reminded me every day of Winston Churchill's famous quote, that \u201cSuccess is not final, failure is not final, it is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d In those moments of reckoning, I realized how privileged I was to be part of this team that didn't miss a beat and blazed new trail. For years, I have heard that healthcare-oriented real estate deserves a discount for the \u2013 to say, a shiny tower in middle of a large gateway city due to the lack of liquidity and smaller ticket size, especially during down cycles. I hope that during the worst down cycle of our asset class, this debate has been finally settled as demonstrated by our execution and that of our colleagues that helped [indiscernible]. In the fall, we pivoted again from defense to offense as we started underwriting and shaking hands on new acquisitions. It is important for you to understand that we don't shake hands and find excuses to walk or chip away, which if we shake hands, we close. Our handshake in this business is worth gold, and we only enhanced our long-term reputation during this pandemic. During last quarter\u2019s call, I discussed $1 billion of deep value opportunity. I am delighted to report that we have closed roughly $700 million of acquisitions since the start of fourth quarter at a significant discount to replacement cost. Our acquisition pipeline has grown meaningfully, and as I sit here today, I am optimistic this year is shaping up to be a year of net acquisition, perhaps significantly so. At the same time, I will remind you that we are not driven and incentivized by volume of acquisition, but the value of it. Asset price is the ultimate determinant of how we'll behave. In this moment of confusion and ambiguity, I indulge you to focus on four distinct pillars of long-term value creation for Welltower. One, operating fundamentals. Tim will get into the details of what happened last quarter and what might happen next quarter. While operating fundamentals is awful right now with little near-term visibility, we are optimistic about the vaccine rollout as 90% of our assisted living and memory care facilities have conducted their first vaccination clinic with virtually all residents taking the shot. While I would not expect this to be a source of value creation in the very near term, I'm hopeful about the second half of the year. Normalization of operating performance remains the largest source of value creation for our shareholders. It is too early to comment on exact timing of the trough and the shape of the recovery, but we'll keep you posted frequently intra-quarter so that you can see what we see. Our focus remains on upholding the reputation of our communities and maintaining the safety of our operator staff and residents. We spared no expenses and have already spent in excess of $80 million on COVID-related expenses to-date doing everything we can within our control to support their wellbeing. Due to the great reputation of our operators and the extraordinary value they provide, rates are holding up. In 2020, REVPOR was up 2% in AL memory care, 1% in independent living, and 4.4% in our seniors\u2019 apartment business. This growth occurred despite the headwinds resulting from lower community fees driven by a decline in move-in activity. Number two, operator platform enhancement, management contracts, leadership and system enhancements, and building local scale are some of the examples of this. Let me highlight two specifics here. A) Sunrise, we are delighted by the appointment of Jack Callison as the CEO of Sunrise Living, our largest operating partner. Jack will bring much needed attention to operating excellence with an operations-first culture. We are also negotiating a new management contract that will align the interest of Sunrise and Welltower as the owner of the assets. We are diligently working with the management of Revera, Sunrise's majority owner to enhance Sunrise's position so that it can emerge from this pandemic as the leading operator of poised for excellence and growth. B) Building local scale. If I can quote Charlie Munger, the advantage of local scale are of ungodly [ph] importance to this business. We have and we will continue to scale our most important strategic partners as we expand our senior housing footprint. To name a few in alphabetical order, Balfour, Brandywine, Clover, Cojir, Frontier, Kelsey-Seybold, Kisco, Oakmont, StoryPoint are just some of the examples of the partners we have grown significantly during this pandemic. What is common amongst them? They are excellent operators in their market. They have great leadership. They are disciplined. Yes, courageous, and they have an aligned relationship with Welltower. We rise and fall together. This list is expanding with our significant opportunity set that I mentioned few moments ago. Number three, capital deployment opportunity. I have already commented on the acquisition opportunity on the deep value side. As a risk of sounding like a broken record, I would remind you that we are an IRR buyer with an incredible focus on basis, operators and structure. Our opportunity set is rising rapidly and I hope to provide you with more specific color in next 60 to 90 days. This comment is obviously focused on the current opportunities. Let me provide you with some color on a related topic, but on future opportunities. We at Welltower, has never been in a more advantageous position as a partner of choice. For years, we have focused on growth strategy driven by our relationship-based and alignment-focused structures and data analytics platform rather than prioritize on costs and access to capital advantage. After all, not all capital is equal. We never imagined that we've encountered today's extreme stress, but as you can see, we stood by our operators during this difficult time not only to preserve their businesses, but also to grow it significantly. Talk is cheap, but action is not. For this reason, we are inundated with requests as a partner of choice from all asset classes we play in. As much as they like do call, we have been on roads throughout this pandemic meeting with prospective partners. This is very meaningful truths. We have executed more partnership and pipeline deals in next nine months then over five proceeding years combined. We expect to deploy $10-plus billion of capital in these opportunities in next few years. In other words, we are not only executing on deep value early cycle opportunities, but also laying a strong foundation of growth through the entire cycle when inevitably the significant price discrepancies of today will be gone. To give you an example, we recently reupped our master development agreement for five years with Kelsey-Seybold, our largest MOB tenant. We are looking to start approximately 600,000 square feet, 100% pre-leased development in 2021 and 2022. Number four, talent opportunity. I touched on this last call, but let me elaborate for those of you who are focused on long-term. We are seeing an incredible interest in our platform from seasoned professionals to early career applicants. We have taken advantage of recent disruption and brought in 41 new professionals in 2020. We expect at least as many, if not more to join our team in 2021. In addition to new talent, our existing talent pool is taking on more responsibilities in reaching new heights. As a result, we had 50 new promotions at Welltower. Though this puts out early pressure on G&A, which is partially offset by lower executive comp, we think this incredible talent pool is equivalent of a cold spring, which will manifest itself in a meaningful growth for the farm. Speaking of talent pool, how is the mood inside today inside Welltower. What I described to you as a stoic resilience last year has transformed into an environment of optimism and unbridled passion this year. I want to make it abundantly clear. We have no crystal ball about the near-term operating fundamentals, but we are doing meaningful work that matters we have meaningful relationship and we are seeing a new level of positive energy of people who wants to be part of this team internally and externally to create meaningful value and make a disproportionate impact. With that, I'll pass it over the microphone to Tim. Tim? Timothy McHugh : Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2020 results, the performance of all of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update and our first quarter outlook. The fourth quarter was a tough end to a very challenging year as the ongoing impact that coronavirus accelerated meaningfully in the back half of the fourth quarter and into the beginning of 2021. The visibility for large parts of our business beyond the next 90 days remain very limited and very dependent on virus-related variables, such as its unpredictable path of growth, the rollout and efficacy of the vaccine and the continuation of population lockdown mandates. As a result of this uncertainty, we decided to provide our first quarter outlook this morning in place of the full-year outlook we would normally provide in our fourth quarter call. As we have done over the last year, we will continue to disclose and update information on a frequent basis, with the intention of providing a more complete outlook, as soon as the variants of the virus-related variables moderate to a level that allows for liable forecasting. Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $0.39 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.84 per diluted share. Normalized FFO was sequentially flat in third quarter and the decline in senior housing operating earnings and dilution from disposition to close over the last two quarters was offset by recognition of HHS funds, lower G&A, lower interest expense, and initial returns on reinvested capital. Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, with our Triple-Net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflected trailing 12 months ending 9/30/2020, and therefore, only reflect a partial impact from COVID-19. Importantly, our collection rate remained high in the fourth quarter, having collected 97% of triple-net contractual rent due in the period. Starting with our senior housing triple-net portfolio. Same-store NOI declined 2.7% year-over-year as leases that were moved to cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against prior full-year contractual rent received. Occupancy was down 260 basis points sequentially consistent with the average occupancy drop from 2Q to 3Q in our RIDEA portfolio and EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.01x on a sequential basis in this portfolio to 1.01x. During the quarter, we transitioned a UK development portfolio from triple-net to RIDEA, transitioned 14 former triple-net capital senior assets to new operators in RIDEA structures and disposed of one asset to the net impact of increasing coverage by 0.03x. Consistent with my comments in the past, our senior housing triple-net lease operators experienced similar headwinds as our RIDEA operators over the past nine months and we expect reported lease coverage stats to continue to reflect these challenges as more of the pandemic periods reflected in EBITDAR going forward. That being said, resilience of this portfolio is reflected by the continued high cash collection rate is encouraging. As I described last quarter, we entered into agreement with Capital Senior at beginning of 2020, which allowed for an early termination of CSU leases on 24 Welltower owned assets in exchange for full rent being paid in 2020 in cooperation with transitioning the operations of these assets. We transitioned 14 properties operated by CSU to new operators in the fourth quarter in addition to the five that were transitioned during the third quarter and anticipate the remaining assets to be transitioned to new operators in the first half of 2021. As a result of the continued COVID backdrop, the initial expected dilution from these conversions is expected to be approximately $0.04 per share in 2021. Additionally, the conversion of a development portfolio in the UK from triple-net to RIDEA is also expected to be negatively impact normalized FFO by $0.04 per share in 2021. The combination of these two transitions is expected to result in a sequential roll down with a little over $0.02 per share of normalized FFO from Q4 to Q1. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated 2% year-over-year same-store growth. However, EBITDAR coverage declined by 0.012x sequentially to 1.0x, which was almost entirely due to deterioration in largest long-term post-acute tenant Genesis HealthCare. As we noted last quarter, Genesis HealthCare, which makes up approximately half of our long-term post-acute exposure raise concerns around its ability to continue as a going concern in the second quarter financials filed on August 10. As a result of this concern, Welltower began recording revenue on a cash basis in the third quarter. Furthermore, we wrote down our unsecured loan exposure driven by $80 million in the fourth quarter. Similar to our Genesis lease income, we've been recognizing all interest on our unsecured loans on a cash basis. So this impairment does not change income recognition on these loans. Genesis remains current on all financial obligations to Welltower through January. And lastly, health systems, which comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 2.27x. Turning to medical office. Our outpatient medical office portfolio delivered positive 2.1% year-over-year same-store growth modestly below long-term trends. Growth continues to be negatively impacted by reserves for uncollected rent, the large majority of which resulting from lease enforcement moratoriums in several California jurisdictions in which we have a sizable footprint as I described last quarter. As these moratoriums expire, we expect rent collection to improve from 98.5% received in the fourth quarter. Looking back at 2020, our outpatient medical platform displayed incredible resilience in a truly challenging year, which includes periods of time, which basic medical appointments and procedures were flat out, not permitted. We still managed to grow same-store NOI in an average of positive 1.7%. During the fourth quarter, we continued to observe improvements in several key operating trends as business continue to normalize, notably a pickup in our leasing pipeline, which has start to reflect positive occupancy pickup towards the back half of 2021. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter\u2019s result, I want to point out that we received approximately $9 million from the Department of Health and Human Services CARES Act Provider Relief Fund and post-quarter we received another $34 million, delivering $8 million and $31 million of net expected proceeds at our share. We are recognizing these funds on a cash basis and so there were flow through financials at quarter in which they are received. We are normalizing these HHS funds on a same-store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received that are not matched to expenses incurred in the period they received. In the fourth quarter, there are approximately $11.8 million of reimbursement normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results, mainly tied with HHS program in the U.S. Now turning to results in the quarter. Same-store NOI decreased 33.8% as compared to fourth quarter of 2019 and decreased 11.3% sequentially from the third quarter. Starting with revenue, sequential same-store revenue was down 2.4% in Q4 driven primarily by 160 basis point drop in average occupancy. As a reminder, we started the fourth quarter with relative optimism on the occupancy front with improving year-over-year moving volumes and relatively low prevalence of COVID within our communities. However, these positive trends rapidly reverse as the exponential rise in global COVID cases in November and December, but the city and statewide lockdowns, admissions bans across many of our key MSAs particularly in the UK and California, which together comprised 34% of our SHO Portfolio NOI. Result of this was 180 basis points of occupancy loss from November through year-end. As I stated on our third quarter call, the path of COVID will dictate our business trend from the fourth quarter, not seasonality and not the seasonal flu, and that has proved quite true over the past 3.5 months. Turning to REVPOR in the quarter, total SHO Portfolio REVPOR was down 1.2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. But as I described last quarter, mix shift is restored in the true picture of rent growth metrics. The standalone year-over-year REVPOR growth for active adult, independent living and assisted living segments were positive 3.7%, 0.5% and 1.1%, respectively. The combined total portfolio metric is being impacted by considerable changes in composition of occupied units in the year-over-year portfolio, as lower acuity properties, independent living and senior departments have held up considerably better on the occupancy front since the start of COVID. We just had the mathematical impact of having a higher portion of our total portfolio occupied units being lower acuity and therefore, lower rent paying units. The point being rental rates are proving more resilient across our portfolio than would appear in our aggregate reported statistics. And lastly, expenses, total same-store expenses declined 2.1% year-over-year and increased 50 basis points, sequentially. I'll focus on the sequential since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 50 basis point increase in operating costs was driven mainly by higher sequential COVID costs as a result of the surge in cases in the fourth quarter. Decline in topline combined with these expense pressures had a meaningful impact on our operating margins, which declined 220 basis points sequentially to 22.3%. As I noted earlier in the call, we did not include government reimbursement that was not tied to period expenses \u2013 NPL expenses in our same-store results, and therefore, COVID expenses negatively impact same-store by $18.9 million in the quarter. We will stay consistent with distribution in Q1, where we've already received a net $31 million in HHS funds that would likely turn COVID expenses into a net benefit if included in our same-stores and offset. Looking forward to the first quarter and starting with 2021 year-to-date data we have already observed. We've experienced 180 basis point decline in occupancy through February 5. Given the still heightened presence of COVID, we expect average occupancy to be down 275 to 375 basis points from fourth quarter to first quarter. Note that we are providing the average occupancy as opposed to spot occupancy as a former better tie to our reported financials, and therefore, 260 basis points of our expected 275 to 375 basis point decline is already baked given the swift drop from mid-November to-date in occupancy. We expect monthly REVPOR to be down 20 basis points sequentially, although it should be noted that actual rent per unit is up 2.1% sequentially. With mix shift, which I mentioned earlier, and two fewer days in the quarter is Q1 reported REVPOR versus actual rent growth. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be effectively flat as higher sequential COVID costs are offset by less labor utilization due to lower occupancy levels. Turning to capital markets activity. Throughout 2020, we took a series of actions that were difficult result in our ability to retain significant cash flow and ultimately gave us greater control to navigate through the pandemic. It's worth highlighting that despite the stress driven by our business, we've avoided the destabilization of the balance sheet by borrowing to pay the dividend or being forced in raising equity or selling assets on attractive valuations. Given where we sit today, the $2.1 billion of cash in over $5.1 billion of available liquidity, we are pleased with our course of actions being the most prudent way to maximize balance sheets stability and positioning us to take advantage of attractive capital deployment opportunities. In addition to showing up a balance sheet, we undertook a series of actions to optimize spend and maximize retaining cash flow by reducing our corporate overhead through tighter cost controls and fine tuning of capital expenditure plans. We also made the decision in May to reduce our quarterly dividend by 30%, given the uncertainties from the pandemic timeline and severity. Despite the pandemic substantial negative impact on our business, our actions throughout 2020 removed any dependence on a quick recovery, and also afforded us the opportunity to be patient with respect to the transaction market and take advantage of attractive private market valuations relative to public markets, while also highlighting institutional demand for a high quality portfolio. Over the course of the year, we sold $3.7 billion of pro rata assets at a blended 5.4% yield, including $1.3 billion of senior housing operating assets at a price per unit of 332,000 per PPE. Most recently, during the fourth quarter, we sold a portfolio of senior housing operating properties operated by Northbridge for $200 million, representing a 4.9% cap rate on March trailing 12-month NOI and $395,000 per unit. Also in the fourth quarter, we announced a new joint venture partnership with certain investment vehicles managed by Wafra. The joint venture comprised a portfolio of 24 outpatient medical properties previously majority owned by Welltower. Many of these transactions were completed in the midst of significant disruption to real estate and capital markets, when the long-term viability of our senior housing assets in particular were being called into question. While we are pleased with execution on disposition front, we\u2019re excited to now be executing on the acquisition side with financial flexibility and ample liquidity. On our third quarter earnings call, Shankh described $1 billion acquisition pipeline. And since the start of the fourth quarter, we've closed on $657 million at a blended initial yield of 4.5% with an expected stabilized yield over 7.5%. Lastly, moving to our first quarter outlook. Last time we provided an outlook for the first quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.24 to $0.29 and normalized per diluted share of $0.71 to $0.76 per share. The midpoint of our guidance $0.735 per share represents a sequential decline of approximately $0.105 per share from the fourth quarter. The $0.105 decline is composed of a $0.08 decline in senior housing operating results driven by $0.06 of fundamental decline and $0.02 of increased COVID cost. A $0.03 per share sequential decline in triple-net senior housing NOI, a little over $0.02 of which is related to the Capital Senior and signature UK transitions mentioned earlier with the remainder due to fundamental declines on cash recognition leases. A $0.02 per share decline related to net investment activity in Q4 and Q1 and $0.03 related to a combination of other items mainly made up of increased G&A, income tax and a slight decline in interest income. These declines are offset by a 5.5% increase in pro rata HHS funds received to date in the first quarter. As a reminder, we are only guiding the HHS funds that have already been received as of today's call. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim. I want to end with two things before we open it up for questions. First, I'm excited about the collaboration that is the March between our peers and us. We have worked diligently with healthy Ventas and Omega to address operator and industry issues and towards mutually beneficial transactions. For example, it was an absolute pleasure to work with Tom DeRosa and his team on two separate transactions, totaling $170 million. I'm positive we are embarking on a new era of collaboration amongst the public companies in our space. Second, in spite of our talent is being faced by our industry today, our confidence in our business has not changed, and I'm hopeful that my comments this morning have provided you with a framework for how we intend to create long-term value for all of our stakeholders. We are grateful to be part of your portfolio as our shareholders. Personally, this management team has established a highly concentrated position in Welltower. In fact, neither Tim nor I have sold a single share of the stock that we have received on a post-tax basis since we have come on board few years ago, which should be an indication to you our fellow shareholders of our conviction and personal stake we have in this business. As Buffet taught us, diversification may preserve wealth, but concentration builds wealth. This does not mean the path forward will be without challenges, but it is clear that we are all in on this company and that our alignment with you, our shareholder is strong and significant. With that, we'll open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Good morning and thank you for the time. Just on the acquisition front, you guys talked about the $1 billion pipeline and being confident on more opportunities. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on what the focus is. Is it still on the kind of the value opportunities in seniors housing buying at a great basis? And if that's the case or more generally, if you can give color on the timeline to stabilization from the low cap rates going in, what we should expect in terms of when you get those stabilized yields? Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Juan. Good morning. That is, our focus is to buy near-term \u2013 at least in the near-term basis value opportunities that are significant discount replacement costs where we can bring in the right operators or buy with the right operators if it is owned by some other capital partners of our operators. So we're focused on basis, we\u2019re focused on operator, we\u2019re focused on structure. Interestingly, we're starting to see some opportunities where the initial yield is not as much of a drag. That\u2019s just a coincidence. We're not focused on that. We're focused very much on basis, structure, and operators. And I expect that our blended yield of the opportunities when we talk about next quarter will actually be dragged up overall by this set of opportunities. But I can tell you that is not our focus. We're purely focused on basics, structure, and operator. Juan Sanabria : And any color on timeline to get to the stabilized deals. I mean, it just generally ties to the overall length of the recovery. I know it\u2019s just\u2026 Shankh Mitra : Juan, it is purely dependent on the shape of the recovery and when it drops, which I already said that I'm not going to comment on, right. It is a very uncertain environment. That is precisely why we're buying these value opportunities so that we don't have to be dependent on that, right. So if we had a perfect sense of what the shape of the curve looks like and when it perfectly troughs, then we will be buying everything we possibly can, which we are not. We're very focused on a significant discount/replacement cost for that very reason. But again, we need more time to give you a general sense of what that looks like, but it depends on assets to assets. We're buying assets that are 82% occupied. We're buying assets that are 22% occupied. So, it's very hard to make a general comment on when, what we think that sort of the shape of that acquisition [ph]looks like. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Stephen Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. Shankh and Tim, I know you can't really comment on sort of the exact bottoming and timing of the recovery, but maybe talk about sort of the move-ins and the conditions that you think you need to see within your facilities kind of in the macro in order to ultimately start to drive move-in volume given what we've seen on the decline? Timothy McHugh : Yes. Thanks, Steve. So, I think the first and foremost what we've seen and learned over the last 10 months is that one; cases naturally and cases in our buildings have very much married each other. The virus has presented itself as \u2013 it\u2019s pretty challenging kind of keep out of anywhere. So, I think you may talk about the macro and being cases, we're kind of speaking to both of those at the same time, but we've seen both the negative and positive case counts rise and fall, start to impact our business 30 to 45 days afterwards. That makes sense given thinking about kind of the sales cycle on an average kind of 30 days of a kind of start that will lead to a close. So what we need to see is the direction we're seeing right now in case counts to continue. We need to see likely the vaccinations that are going on at a national level in our buildings and then allow for that to be kind of held at a low level. And we're seeing those things take place now, but as of today\u2019s call, we're still very much at an elevated level of cases nationally in our building. So I think what we need to see is for this current level to drastically continue at the low level to sustain itself, and we'll start to see some early indicators of that if that direction continues over the next month or so, and the fundamental impact in our business would come, as I said kind of 30, 45 days after that. So I think it comes down to simply the path of COVID. And it's a big reason of kind of the outlook being one quarter here and not the full-year because I think any full-year outlook would essentially be just more of a guidance on where the path of the virus goes, which is something that we don't think we've got a better view on those of you in the market. So, it really comes down to just COVID. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Connor Siversky : Good morning, everybody. Thanks for having me on the call. Appreciate the detail on the prepared remarks. I'm looking at lease maturities, specifically as it relates to the post-acute care portfolio in 2021. I'm just wondering how those conversations are progressing and if there's any kind of expectation for renewal rates? Timothy McHugh : I'm sorry. Say that again, Connor, you said which leases? Connor Siversky : So the lease maturity is related to the post-acute care portfolio and then how those conversations are progressing? Shankh Mitra : So Connor, the conversation with all tenants is the same, right. If a tenant wants to focus on what is the right \u2013 near-term fundamentals right now, and project that as the future, then I don't think that's our right tenant, right. I mean, we have to \u2013 you cannot think about this business as what is happening right now and Mark \u2013 at least to market on that basis on today's fundamental. That's just not how we think about it. I laid out the whole framework of how we think about leases in a previous call. I'm not going to bore you with the details, but the conversations are always the same. What is the normalized cash flow of a business? What does that mean from a value as well as the last dollar basis of that lease? The leverage in fact, right? So that's how we think about leases. That's all we do leases, new leases, renewal leases, and that's all going to move forward. If we think that our tenants and us, we can't agree on what is the long-term value of our real estate is. Then we have to move forward with a different operator. Our value is in the real estate and we know how to preserve it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mr. Carroll, if you have your phone on mute, please unmute your line. Michael Carroll : I do. Sorry. Tim, with regard to the seniors housing triple-net portfolio in your prepared remarks, can you kind of provide some color on what percent of the operators are being recognized on a cash basis? And I guess what are they paying today versus their contracts for the rents? And just real quick off of that, in that payment coverage stratification heat map that you have, is that coverage ratio reflected on their contractual rent? Or is that reflected on the rent that they're currently paying today? Timothy McHugh : Yes. Thanks Mike. So a little over 5% of our triple-net NOI is reflected as cash and not as contractual rent. And on the heat map, if things move to cash, they're removed from the heat map because essentially, at that point are one-for-one in relative to what's being reflected in earnings and what's being received in cash. And that kind of is not relevant to the actual contractual and also could end up kind of inflating coverages. So we \u2013 if it moved to cash, essentially what we move it off because at that point, earnings is reflecting exactly that cash. And I'd say just as kind of relative areas of where we've seen [indiscernible], where EBITDAR has kind of fallen relative to rent, it's kind of probably been in the 0.5x to 0.75x coverage areas. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Derek Johnston : Hi, everybody. Good morning. Spot occupancy stands at 74.4% for SHO and with COVID cases declining and most of your residents likely vaccinated by the end of first quarter, is this 275 to 375 basis points of further decline in occupancy that you're guiding, is this your estimate of Welltower\u2019s pandemic trough occupancy given what we know today? Timothy McHugh : So what we're estimating in our actual first quarter guidance with \u2013 in my prepared remarks, I alluded this. But if we were to be, if today's occupancy was to be held from here through quarter end, we'd end up at an average occupancy decline from 4Q to 1Q up 260 basis points. And our guidance is for 225 basis points of decline from 4Q to 1Q. So our expectation is that given the heightened COVID cases on a national basis that declines and occupancy continue, and we're not making a call on the direction of COVID, which would therefore impact occupancy. So in short, no, we're not, we are not calling today's occupancy trough. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jordan Sadler : Thanks. Good morning. I know that you guys have some optimism because you've sort of transitioned from defense to offense and began buying assets again. So I just wanted to get a little bit of a sense of what you are thinking is as you're underwriting these assets in terms and I mean, seniors housing specifically in terms of the pace of potential lease up, so on the other side of sort of this spike in COVID, how do you think about what \u2013 and maybe you can give us some brackets for what lease up occupancy might look like during the peak leasing season, like April to September? Timothy McHugh : Hey, Jordan. So I can put some brackets around it just thinking through kind of pre-COVID occupancy levels. We've talked a bit this year looking at move-ins as a percentage of pre-COVID levels and to give an idea of not only how much they've declined at start of COVID, but kind of where they sit relative to levels in 2019. If you were to look at kind of move-in levels from April to September 2019 and compare that to move-out levels we saw on the fourth quarter of this year, so just the most recent experience, which is a bit heightened relative to historical. But as you can see in our stats certainly is not spiking. You would see at 100% back to pre-COVID with demand levels 90 to 110 basis points of occupancy increases on a monthly basis. And that's really a product of \u2013 again, demand coming back quite a bit, if you look at January of 2021 and we're at 50% of prior year move-ins. So thinking about that 50% back to pre-COVID levels, that's a quite a climb from here. But another way to look at it is we likely have to get back to kind of 65% of pre-COVID demand levels to get to breakeven on occupancy and then from there build to start to gain. And just putting that in context, when COVID did come down in the late summer, early fall of 2020, we did see demand is measured by move-ins moved back to kind of 70% prior year. So we've seen demand moved back in that range during COVID pre-vaccine. But certainly we're well below that now. So current trends move-ins have gotten worse, but hopefully that gives you an idea of where they could move to if demand really comes back to pre-COVID levels in the short-term and also where we kind of need them to get to just see some stabilization of the portfolio. Shankh Mitra : Jordan, does not mean that we're underwriting in this April to sort of the early summer to late fall leasing season, we're going to see that kind of occupancy increase. If we did that, we would buy every product that we can possibly buy in the market. So I want to remind you that we are not \u2013 we're focused on basis so that our value creation is not dependent on our ability to pinpoint the shape of the recovery. It is purely depended on what it takes to build a building. And if you can buy at a significant discount, the two things will happen, right. You can wait for the demand to come back. And if you can make money at a \u2013 obviously at a 50% to 60% discount replacement costs, then no one will build a new building, add the replacement costs because they have to charge a lot more than you. So ultimately in any capital heavy asset class like real estate, assuming your overall demand is increasing, ultimately the demand supply is well-balanced. If I can make money at discount replacement costs, you will not be able to make money by building a new one at replacement cost. This is particularly interesting phenomenon in this cycle. In most cycles, what you see is replacement cost, I mean, the cost to build goes down whenever recession hits because housing is [indiscernible], replacement cost is actually spiking through this particular cycle that keeps even a bigger gap as we think through a cycle. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Bilerman : Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Nick. Just a two-part question, Shankh, just in relation to partners and relationships that you talked about during your opening comments, you talked about $10 billion pipeline of opportunities as you've executed more partnerships over the last nine months than you did in the five years prior, and you mentioned 600,000 pre-lease MOB. Can you just step back and sort of break down that $10 billion, a little bit more detail about what comprises it, what sectors and the timeline? And then the second part sort of the relationships, you talked about this new collaboration with your fellow healthcare REITs, what drove the change in those relationships? I think it's definitely a positive, it's nice to see, but what was the driver because I think you've been a little bit more critical over time and I just want to know what sort of led to these newfound positive relationships? Shankh Mitra : Okay. Let me take the second one first because that's a easy one. I don't believe that I've ever been critical of our peer companies. What led to the collaboration is that I reached out to my fellow CEOs, and we absolutely agreed that we need to work on this industry issues and operator issues together. And I got a very warm reception. So that\u2019s just very simple, right? I mean, it is true that we have to work on this and there is a power in bigger numbers and we have very smart companies in our space run by very confident and smart management team. It is only in our interest to work together to solve these bigger issues than work alone. So that's a simple one. I'm not going to get into the first question. I will tell you that we are creating, as I said, we're very much focused on from an acquisition side on two things, right? Early cycle opportunities that obviously we're executing and you'll be very pleased as the year progress where that will shake out, but we're very much cognizant of the fact that early cycle opportunities, eventually that will be gone. So if we start working on, then what will eventually become is the normal cycle opportunities to late. So we have never stopped. And it is also pretty much to be a very advantageous position to be a large company in our space \u2013 the largest company in our space, which we're expanding pretty rapidly and we didn't bat an eyelid and stopped. And because we believe in the business as I laid out, we are \u2013 you have to think about it.  This is a very interesting business where you have to work with other people and you have to work with operators. You have to work with developers. In many cases they are one and the same and to go create value together, not at the expense of each other. That alignment is extremely important. And this life nine, 10 months has given us the opportunity to work with more of our operators. And frankly speaking, as you can see, being aligned with Welltower, has created significant and is continued to create significant value for our operators who \u2013 if you think about if you're not aligned with an capital source that has the capability and the fierce resolve to deploy capital to this kind of disruption, then ultimately, as I said, you come to the other end of the cycle and it's too late. So I'm not going to get into what that looks like. I'll just give you one example, 600,000 square feet of 100% pre-leased MOBs, Michael, you can do the math and think about how much value creation. And that is not a pipeline that is just a start that we're sitting here today between 2021 and 2022. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jonathan Hughes : Hey. Good morning. Could you talk about your underwriting assumptions on the recent SHOP acquisitions at a mid-three yield? And the reason I ask is because using some of the assumptions laid out in the December 2018 Investor Day, like exit price and 7% IRR requirement, it implies a high single-digit NOI growth CAGR for the next decade. I know you won't comment on the growth and the recovery trajectory, but maybe some of those other assumptions like exit price have changed versus two-plus years ago. So any details or thoughts about how you underwrite SHOP and compare to perhaps now higher yielding, but more stable and slower growing medical office buildings would be helpful? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Jonathan. It depends \u2013 obviously every asset is different where you buy the asset, what basis you buy the asset is completely different. When we made that presentation, we never thought we'll be able to buy assets at \u2013 and meaningful discount replacement costs. If we look at pre-pandemic, healthcare real estate, particularly on the senior housing, usually traded at a mild to modest premium to replacement costs because the healthcare income has a multiple, not a real estate multiple, but it's still a multiple, right? So in asset class where you\u2019re starting above some level of replacement costs, you're going to keep your pricing power really strong through the whole cycle. And the next buyer analysis, you have to think about your next buyer analysis. And the next buyer has to also believe that we'll continue. That by implication, you are buying above replacement costs and you are selling above replacement costs or you were making a bet that the NOI growth, if you're \u2013 NOI growth will meaningfully outstrip the cost of construction increase, right? So in both sides, you are at some form of above replacement costs. That equation changes completely when you can buy at a significant discount replacement costs. So if you buy $0.50 on the $1 and at some period of normalization, you sell it at 100 cents on the $1. You are still at a significant discount to the previous case, when your next buyers\u2019 analysis it's much, much easier. Nothing has changed except the price and that price tells you why we're so excited about it today. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer from Baird. Please go ahead. Amanda Sweitzer : Great. Thanks for taking the question. As you kind of think about building occupancy post-pandemic, how are you thinking either about changing service levels or where and how you invest CapEx if at all in order to attract new residents? Shankh Mitra : Okay. So this is a question that I don't want to be too long-winded and give you an answer. It depends on the price \u2013 really the service level of the assets inside those buildings today. And we don't increase occupancy our operating partners do. And we work with our operating partners on service levels CapEx needed and everything, but this is a collaborative process. And I don't want to sort of sit here and tell you that this is \u2013 we have the operating expertise to do that. I'm assuming you're asking a SHOP question. We have the best operators in the business that are very, very good of what they do and their local dominance in the marketplace, obviously, as well as this particular service area is very much of what we are depending on. Having said that, we have worked diligently with our operators on payers and provider integration, and as I said, this is a very long answer to a question. We're happy to take this offline. And have you talked too much ever \u2013 obviously this process in our SHOP, but the pricing question, the service question is more of an operator question than a Welltower question, CapEx question is definitely something that we work together. Having said that the payer and provider integration is something that we're leading and our operators are collaborating with us, but that's a long discussion. And we'll take this up offline if this is of interest to you. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : Thanks and good morning. And just a comment, the olive branch are extending your peers and they to you, is like red meat to me. So happy to hear about that type of collaboration in the space. And speaking of collaboration, one of the things the gaming sector has noticed \u2013 gaming REIT sector has noticed the ability to expand margins post-pandemic and some lessons learned about what was kind of wasteful in their four walls and perhaps a better product at the other side of this. Question is on SHOP. I know there is a lot of talk about margins going down, of course, these days, but do you envision that there will be some positive lessons learned from all this and that ultimately part of your interest in senior housing and SHOP specifically is that there is a margin expansion sort of thesis down the road here, maybe two, three years down the road, perhaps that will come out of this or should we not be thinking along those lines? Timothy McHugh : So Richard that's a very good question. It's one we've talked about a lot actually with our operators through the last period kind of the last six months. I think I'll answer in two ways. The first is on lessons learned. Absolutely, this has made our operators look at their cost constructs in a more critical way than they probably ever could or imagined just given the pressure to occupancy and getting back the levels that for a lot of them look like they haven't done in since at least of some of these assets years ago. We've had feedback from operators and large platform saying they've found ways to do things from labor front, just a lot more efficiently. And given the feedback ahead of time to what you're speaking to that when you start to see the business come back and you think there is significant cost savings in the \u2013 particularly the labor model as far as getting a bit more leverage off it. Again, in the margin side, I would hesitate to kind of speak to that from a margin expansion story just driven purely by that as of yet. As you know, there's cost and the structure right now that are being added because of COVID. We feel pretty confident that a lot of these things are temporary. But given that, there's two things to speak now as kind of a market expansion story. We're having those cost in the current business and having an unclear picture of when and how the kind of the virus moves away from our business. I think it would be a bit aggressive. But I do think the margin expansion story of thinking about it relative to even where we were pre-pandemic. We think there's an occupancy lift story in this space just given the demand story and that makes us \u2013 still keeps us very positive in the spaces that long-term demand story hasn't changed in the pandemic. And certainly has been a very impactful last nine months, 12 months, and need to continue to be in the near future. But the long-term demand story stands and that's going to lift occupancy and there's a lot of operating leverage in this business even without changes to the structure. So you're going to see as kind of industry occupancy lift up over the next three to five years, I think you are going to see margins move above where they were pre-pandemic even without those operating efficiencies being put into the model. Shankh Mitra : Rich, I would just add two things. One is that, we obviously \u2013 I would encourage you and our team would be happy to set it up to talk to Mark Shaver in our team with what we're doing on the payer provider side, and which should help margin as well. The second lessons learned, I would say not a margin point, but the separate point is one of the lessons learned in our SHOP through not just this pandemic, but through last few years, is that you should not lend money to an entity or any type of entity where you are not willing to take the keys, right. As of REIT, we're not allowed to obviously own an operating company more than 35%. So we should not lend money to operating companies where we're not able to take over the assets. Today, we're only focused \u2013 obviously in the last few years, and through the cycle, through the pandemic, we're only focused on if we write a credit check, we only write, if we are completely able to take over the assets and we're very happy owner of the assets on the last dollar exposure that we have. That is a big lessons learned inside our SHOP and a good one for the long-term value creation of our shareholders. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So a couple of questions just here on the vaccine rollout. Clearly that's important in terms of getting move-in activity back. So I was hoping to get some stats on what the adoption rate has been of the vaccine by residents and staff members so far. And then I'm also wondering, we saw an announcement from Atria, which was very vocal saying that they were requiring staff members to get vaccinated by May. And we haven't seen anything from Sunrise. And so I guess I'm wondering as a part owner there in Sunrise, are you guys pushing for that policy and maybe just give us an update on kind of what that policy is in regards to staff members across your operators in assisted living? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Nick, I\u2019ll answer the second question and Mark will answer the first question. We have tremendous amount of respect for John Moore and his team at Atria. We do not comment on the vaccine policy of different operators. We work with our operators and supportive of their different policies. I can tell you everybody's focus is to get to the right place. How they get there is the decisions that the management teams and the CEOs of specific operators to take that. We do not push for one or the other, but I can tell you that everybody is focused on the same outcome. Mark? Mark Shaver : Yes. So just to give some stats, the relationships the operators have with CVS and Walgreens has worked quite positively. We've seen over 120,000 vaccinations across the platform as of earlier this week. About 90% of our communities have completed their first clinic and very actively working through the second clinic we feel by the end of February, 1st week of March. Most, if not all of the second clinics will have taken place. With regards to adoption and consent, 90 plus percent of residents have consent or receive the vaccination, 55% of staff across the portfolio that varies from operator-to-operator have consented to receive the vaccination. We're not going to get into specifics on number of vaccines by individuals. Some of this is skewed. You maybe aware that if there was active COVID or inactive COVID diagnosis in the prior 28 days, an individual has to wait to delay that. So we're focusing really on consent and the percentage of vaccinations that have occurred across the communities. But what happened to provide additional color, but those are the highlights. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Mueller : Yes. Curious how are the yields on the various new developments you're looking at compared to what underwriting would have been in pre-pandemic? Shankh Mitra : Our target yields Mike have not changed. Market conditions have changed, so obviously or even more critically thinking about the cost as well as the land price and ultimately how much it takes to \u2013 obviously how long it takes to get to that stabilization and the working capital loss in between, right. So our focus, again, as I\u2019ve said, you have to imagine these things. They're long-term. We think about at least the developments that we're interested in. You're talking about a five, six-year cycles, so you have to really, really think hard about when do you start, when it actually finishes, when you get your approval. And just for an example, as you know that for last few months or last year or so, we have worked on in new development project in Brooklyn. It is one of the hardest place to build in the country, right. You can't change your view depending on how you're feeling about your occupancy today. That's a five to seven year process. And so our return thresholds have not changed. Clearly, what we think sort of the trended yields, the trending has changed given what is going on in the business today, and we still need to make money on an untrended basis to start this development. So that's how we're thinking about it. Michael Mueller : Got it. Okay. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Todd Stender from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Todd Stender : Thanks. Your data analytics team has been instrumental in having you guys drill down on MSAs just for senior housing, of course. But can you share the recommendations that they're providing now just in light of lingering new supply out migration from more urban cities due to COVID, maybe any specifics you can share? Shankh Mitra : So Todd, we have the ability to tell you today. First is that not just focused on senior housing the team has built. The platform has been enhanced pretty meaningfully in last few quarters, so we have the ability. We're beyond what you have seen in senior housing into medical office and other housing businesses such as active adult, where you play pretty heavily. One of the questions that you raised, which is the migration pattern, you can do. We have a team \u2013 entire team, which has been working on this data scientist. Today, I'm glad to tell you that we have the ability to pinpoint that out migration or in migration on a weekly basis, not just focused on the longer-term data such as ACS and IRS data, but also cellphone data and other more near-term or more instantaneous sort of data. I don't mean instantaneous in right at this point, but we can tell you most on a weekly basis \u2013 not almost on a weekly basis, we can tell you on a weekly basis where people have moved out or moved in. That is very much flowing we\u2019re through models as we're making investments. As you know, that we're very, very focused on making new investments on all the asset classes we deal in. And it's definitely a big part of why we're seeing today the attractiveness of us as the capital has enhanced in last few months or few quarters because we're still standing here and taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace, but also that huge predictive analytics platform that we have built over many years that our partners are attracted to. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So a couple of questions here. I guess, first regarding REVPOR, it was encouraging to see the positive year-over-year trends in 4Q 2020 in AL high urban senior apartments in that 1% to 4% range. In your walkthrough of the FFO sequentially into 1Q 2021, you mentioned that\u2019s $0.06 hit from a fundamental decline in senior housing, I guess, I'm curious, what's the REVPOR assumption within that? Does that stay positive year-over-year, or does that start to decline? Thanks. Timothy McHugh : Yes, that's a good question, Steve. So when you think about on a sequential basis that $0.06 that moves from 4Q to 1Q effectively, so think about like REVPOR and occupancy decline combining to get your revenue change, sequentially, our REVPOR is down 20 basis points, but that's driven by two things. 40% of our senior housing revenue in the fourth quarter is actually from operators that receive rent on a daily basis, which is pretty common in the higher acuity side of senior living. And so just moving from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, you lose two days, you go from 92 days to 90 days. So with REVPOR being an approximation of monthly rent, your rent will go down 2.2% just from that. So there's a headwind from that on a sequential REVPOR basis. And then you've got this continued mix shift where the occupancies and mix shift, the make-up of revenue in the fourth quarter versus first quarter, again, you're seeing a higher occupancy fall off in the higher acuity segments of our portfolio, which pay higher rent. So in combination of those two things is the REVPOR from how that impacts kind of total revenue is down 20 basis points. But if you look at on a per day per unit rent were up 2.1% in the fourth quarter relative to the first quarter, and it's actually pretty strong sequential growth and it\u2019s driven mainly by \u2013 roughly half of our operators also have Jan 1 increases. So there\u2019s increases that\u2019s pushed through on Jan 1 and that's helped kind of rent growth. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich from Green Street. Please go ahead. Lukas Hartwich : Thanks. Hey, Shankh, in the past, you've talked about Welltower and difference between the SH-NNN and SHOP format is structured correctly. I'm curious how the teams evaluating that question for the existing portfolio, as well as acquisitions in this environment because, clearly there's a lot more uncertainty and not only near-term fundamentals, but the recovery, the trajectory, potential long-term impacts in the senior housing business. Still a lot of moving pieces relative to the history there. Shankh Mitra : Well, I think you just coined a new time. I'm assuming you're asking about the difference between senior housing triple-net versus senior housing operating. So look, given where the cycle is, I want to be a majority being the equity position are in the RIDEA side. But there are opportunities to deploy capital in the senior housing in a triple-net side. If you have assets that are stabilized and you can buy it cheap enough that the last dollar of that lease is still in a place where the operators can make money and we can make money. Obviously, you can create a lot of bells and whistles than what the operators have the second bite of the Apple. So there's ways you can create that alignment, but remember, if you simplistically think about RIDEA is an equity exposure and at least it's more of a credit exposure, you can create value if a) from our side, if the buildings are stabilized or near stabilization and you buy it cheap enough that your last dollar is still a pretty low rent relative to what the cash flow of the buildings look like then you can create value, but that's how we think about it. That's how our operators think about it. And so we have found two opportunities to do leases. If we do find more opportunities, we'll do it, but I can tell you that the industry is moving away, at least we're moving away from very tightly covered leases. Today, we're thinking about there should be even more margin of safety, and when we find opportunities where we're buying so cheap that we can that's when we're going for it. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : Hey. Good morning, guys. Shankh, I just wanted to follow-up on your comment in your opening remarks about hiring [indiscernible]. I think you said 41 employees last year. Curious, just what area of the business are you guys hiring\u2026 Shankh Mitra : Pretty much across the Board, I mean, if you think about it, we have added a lot of people on our investment teams and we have hired a lot of people on that data analytics team, we hired a lot of \u2013 hiring people on our infrastructure teams or accounting, tax. I don't have the background. I can tell you that we have seen an incredible resurgence of interest in our asset in our company today from both sort of externally and internally. And what I mean externally as an operator, as developers, internally as prospective employees. Both experienced employees that we're hiring there's a lot of talent in the market for obvious disruption. Also a lot of early career employees that we're seeing. I'll just tell you just one small stat. Interesting one, doesn't change really when we do. We hire \u2013 East Coast, West Coast and Midwest, we hire the top seven schools for MBA candidates. This year, we got more than 1,400 applications for really four or five positions we hire. So that sort of tells you the interest in our business and the amount of incredible talent we're seeing both on the early career side as well as super experienced side, and we'll see some really good hires this year as well. This year, I expect that we'll add 40 to 50 professionals across the Board in the company. Acquisition is not just as I said, I want you to think about, Josh, acquisition in this kind of market, which is so disruptive in three ways. One, obvious one, right, we're doing value opportunities that we can add, edit discount replacement costs; b) acquisition of partnership and operator relationship and developer relationship, that's B; c) is employees. We're in a business of talent and given the amount of disruption that's in the marketplace that we see and what we think this business will become as we think about three years, five years, 10 years from now. We're very much adding an incredible level of talent that we have sort of never seen in the marketplace. Joshua Dennerlein : Great. Appreciate the color. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. Good morning, everyone. First of all, Shankh and Tim, I just wanted to give your entire team credit for such strong transparent disclosure on your business updates. I wish more of your peers were doing that. And also regards to Tom, I hope he's doing well. My first question really is around government support. Could you just talk a little bit about kind of post the Phase III announcement kind of what you've seen in the pipeline at this point or what the lobby group is seeing, what the potential is for the government released for your operators? Shankh Mitra : So let me take your question and see what I can get there. I'm not going to comment on sort of what might happen. There's too much uncertainty. We have a new administration. If I sit here and try to comment on what might happen, I'll be so much outside my zone of confidence, which I think, you know, that I focus very much on talking about confidence. Being a lifelong Buffett and Munger, sort of decide, I'm not going to answer that. But I will tell you that Tom is doing well. I talk to him pretty frequently. He has been an incredible mentor and a friend. He continues to help me think through a lot of issues and he's definitely doing well. If you reach out to him, he will reply to you, but he's definitely doing well and he remains safe, great supporter of the company and he's helping any way he can. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Capital One. Please go ahead. Daniel Bernstein : Hey. Good morning. I appreciate you staying on and taking the calls here. It seems to me that the initial acquisitions you've done here, I mean, clearly the disruption you're buying it below replacement costs, but they're not really truly distressed sales. So just trying to understand what you're seeing in the marketplace in terms of lenders, bankers, kind of exercising covenants, enforcing more distressed sales the remainder of this year, especially given your comments on a strong pipeline. And I know if you can talk difference between that distress in senior housing and skilled nursing? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Like beauty, distress is also something that lies in the eyes of the beholder. I can tell you Dan, we're buying assets in core markets of New Jersey, Seattle, California for less than $200,000 a unit where replacement cost is $400,000, $500,000 above $500,000 a unit. If you don't think that's a deep value opportunity, I really don't know how to answer to that. So I guess, we just have to obviously think about it different way. We are \u2013 if you just always remember price relative to what it takes to build that gap is what we've distressed. If you just want to look at purely on a price per pound and does it look cheap, just wait for a few, as I said, 60 to 90 days, I can tell you more about some of those opportunities that we're seeing. But I think we\u2019re executing on some very significant sort of discount replacement cost opportunities, some we have reported. And if you look at what those assets are and dig into what it takes to build it, you will understand that. So going back to the banks, look, I have no idea when the banks will obviously push more towards \u2013 sort of pushing these sort of these whole pipeline of new construction that happened between 2015 and 2019 from their books. But I can tell you that we have been working diligently with many of our banking partners. Just yesterday we executed on one such loan. Look, we're here open for business. We have a sense of what the value is. We have a sense of how we can create value, not just at the buy, but also with our operating partners and we're executing. But I can't sit here and tell you when the banks will pick the books. That\u2019s just no way to say that. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks again for sticking on. Just to go back to sort of the potential inflection. I know you can't give near-term prognosis on when that's going to happen. But just in terms of early indicators both on move-ins and move-outs, Tim I found your comment that 65% needed for stabilization, interesting. I'm just wondering, in the different geographies given the COVID cases have trended somewhat differently, and that has a correlation to the move-ins. Any early signs you're seeing on monitoring that would suggest move-in and move-outs kind of can turn the other way. Timothy McHugh : So there is not \u2013 I think as far as early indicators, we haven't seen enough to note it as a trend, I'd say. You certainly have seen operators where you've seen deposits or tours or initial inquiries move up. You've also seen \u2013 as your question goes, you've seen it move down in geographies in which you've had, essentially last six to eight weeks has been shutoff in a lot of ways. So not enough of a trend on the initial indicators or first movers to say that there's something there. I do think part of what I was getting on earlier is what we've seen in the past. You follow some of the first indicators being inquiries and quest for tours, et cetera. You've seen that kind of lag cases in that kind of 30 to 45 day range. So what we've seen in cases, in fact that there\u2019s still very high may make this time a bit different as far as how much time it takes to post it, but just thinking about it a mid-January kind of peak in cases, you would likely \u2013 if things continue on this trend, the positive trend we're seeing, I think you\u2019ve start to see towards the middle or the end of the month, maybe some of those first indicators move in a more portfolio wide basis. And so we can provide some more color on that as we update the market over the next month or two, but right now it\u2019s too early to speak to it. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Omotayo Okusanya : Hi, good morning. Thanks for continuing to go on. My question actually ties into what Vikram was just saying. If the inflection rate trends have been getting better over the past few weeks, you guys kind of talk about a 45 day lag, I guess it does seem to indicate to me that things should get better in the back half of the quarter. But yet you have 260 basis points of average occupancy, big decline backed in today, but the guidance for 1Q is 275 to 375 basis points. So guidance \u2013 a few things actually get worse in the back half of the quarter versus better. Could you just help me clarify that? Timothy McHugh : Yes. I appreciate the question. To clarify that a bit, we're saying if the trends were to continue and I think you\u2019re saying the same, you would start to see some improvement in latter part of the quarter. But trends getting better from here or staying the same as the part that we're not taking a position on. And so certainly if that continues that way, that's when we start to see some improvement, our guidance doesn't take a position on COVID in the path of it. It's even today despite where we've come off of. Case counts in every way, shape or form are higher than any point we've given a forward look in the past nine months. So today still there is a lot of uncertainty. It certainly feels better than it did three or four weeks ago. But what's baked into guidance in our view is not an attempt to call for a better or a continued improvement and it's more of a current state holding. Shankh Mitra : Also Tayo, as Tim sort of pointed out before majority of the decline is on an average basis is already baked in, right. So if you see the improvement that you are hoping for, which we're not hoping for, we're not guiding for then that will more impact the second quarter than the first quarter. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the Q&A session and today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect at this time. Everyone have a good day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the First Quarter 2021 Welltower Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce General Counsel, Matt McQueen. Matt McQueen : Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh? Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. I'll make some introductory comments on the state of senior housing business, our ongoing alignment efforts with our operating partners, and we will also provide a detailed perspective on our current thoughts related to capital allocation. Tim will then get into detailed operating and financial results. We are cautiously optimistic on the senior housing business with greenshoots emerging in U.S. and U.K. While it is too early to raise an all fear flag as another COVID resurgence can never be ruled out, we're delighted to report an occupancy increase of 120 bps in U.K. and 90 bps in U.S. over the past six weeks. Despite growing optimism in U.S. and U.K., performance in Canada has remained somewhat weak due to increased COVID cases across many regions. While most residents within our Canadian senior housing properties have been vaccinated, the rollout to the broader population has lagged meaningfully due to lockdown in certain areas within Ontario and Quebec, move in stores and visitation have been highly restricted, which has ultimately led to an occupancy loss of 50 basis points since mid-March. This trend has improved in April. Despite the drag from Canada, the move in activity in March is higher than the last non-COVID impacted month of February of 2020. In addition, as I have described in past quarters, rates continue to hold. As adjusted for 2020 leap year, AL rates are up 1.6%, IL rates are up 0.7%, mostly dragged down by the Canadian business. Senior apartments and wellness housing rates are up 6.3%. Our operators across the board are seeing broad momentum that continued to build, irrespective type, geography, activity, this is the most optimistic tone I've heard from our operating partners in a long time. We're even seeing the lifestyle-driven customers are starting to come back, which frankly surprised me in a positive way. Fundamental results have exceeded our expectations in Q1, and we're anticipating strong momentum in Q2. While we continue to avoid speculation on what the arc of the recovery may look like, we have provided additional disclosure on the additional LOI and earnings power of our portfolio assuming a return to 2019 level of NOI for our stable portfolio and adding incremental NOI from our filler portfolio. We believe this results in additional $480 million of NOI. And remember, this assumes a return to 2019 level of occupancy and margin, and it does not assume a return to frictional vacancy or any rate growth since Q4 of 2019. We're seeing something similar happening in the private market. While current cash flow multiples of what we are buying might be high as compared to what we're willing to pay two to three years ago, this is a moot point. We're paying a much lower multiple and a stabilized cash flow as evidenced by a much lower price per unit. While in most other asset classes, this could be a matter of opinion, I believe in real estate it is a simple business where you can obtain a very granular view of price per unit and how this compares to replacement cost. While we can sit here and debate how different assets and portfolio prices compared to prices per unit two to three years ago, replacement costs are shooting upwards with a white-hot housing market driving construction costs exponentially higher in recent quarters. This phenomena is now spilling into other material costs due to a $2 trillion infrastructure plan announced by the Biden administration. As costs continue to rise, the market-clearing rent to achieve minimum acceptable return is also ratcheting up. However, those returns are not going to be easy to achieve. Today, as much of the senior housing industry effectively remains a lease-up mode, given the impact of COVID on occupancy. If this was not enough, now the interest rate curve is backing up, creating further pressure on developers pro forma. This backdrop clearly is unique to the current cycle, which we believe will result in meaningfully lower new starts in near to medium term. The supply outlook, along with already rising demographic growth in the first half of the decade gives us confidence that we'll achieve the level of asset performance that we provided. Although I have nothing to add in terms of the timing and/or the trajectory of the recovery, our analysis was done one asset at a time, and I hope you will find this new disclosure useful. During the first quarter, we continued our effort to create greater alignment of interest with our operating partners by restructuring several relationship constructs. And as we mentioned on our last call, we have made structural changes to several senior housing agreements. I would also like to highlight some recently announced strategic transactions with Genesis and ProMedica, with elements of both deals reflects our approach to value creation for our shareholders. First, Genesis. As we announced last month, after 10 years, we have substantially exited our Genesis real estate relationship through a series of transactions, which meaningfully derisked our cash flow stream going forward. Effectuating this nearly $900 million a transaction wasn't easy. It involved a skilled nursing operator deeply impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, the transitional access to local and regional operators working through our outstanding loans to Genesis, at the same time, creating opportunity for Welltower to participate in the post-COVID recovery in post acute fundamentals. Ultimately, we executed a mutually beneficial transaction for Genesis and Welltower shareholders. For Genesis, the transaction resulted in a meaningful deleveraging of its balance sheet, which will help you to reposition the company post-COVID-19. And for Welltower, we're able to execute the transaction at a par bid value of $144,000 and generated an 8.5% unlevered return over the full term of Genesis relationship. And upon the repayment of the outstanding debt, that return will rise to 9% with even further upside potential from participating preferred and the equity position. We believe that this represents a very favorable outcome for the shareholders, Welltower shareholders, particularly in light of the challenging environment that we have faced in the post-acute sector and then COVID-related pandemic-induced downside we have seen. While transactions will result in some near-term earnings dilution for Welltower, we expect to create significant value for our shareholders following the deployment of the $745 million of anticipated proceeds over a range of high-quality opportunity that I'll discuss shortly. Since our announcement last month, Genesis has received an infusion of equity capital and named a specialist in Harry Wilson as CEO. We wish the team of Genesis much success in the future as we have substantially exited a challenging legacy structure with Genesis, I hope our shareholders appreciate the favorable ultimate outcome. As we have done with several operating relationship over the last few years and discussed on various calls, our team embraced complexity, fixed creative solutions, doesn't run away from their problems and situations where the choices may be imperfect and ultimately work tirelessly to fulfill our commitment to our owners, operating partners, and employees. Second, ProMedica. We announced two transactions to strengthen and expand our relationship with ProMedica, which will enhance the quality of our joint venture position and continued growth. The first transaction involved $265 million sale of 25 skilled nursing assets with an average age of 41 years, which will result in an immediate improvement to the quality of the portfolio. At the same time, we also crystallized a 22% unlevered IRR over two and a half years of ownership of the asset, which is a true reflection of the power of our value-oriented investment philosophy. We at Welltower firmly believe that basis not yield or cap rates determine investment success. Through a separate transaction, we are pleased to maintain an 80% stake in our state-of-the-art assets which has been contributed to our 80/20 joint venture with ProMedica. ProMedica has already assumed the operations of these assets, which have been rebranded as ProMedica Senior Care. This successful transaction is yet another example of our focus on improving quality and growth profile of our portfolio while doing so at favorable economic terms to all stakeholders. ProMedica team is making progress in developing new relationship with other health systems as a provider of choice as Promedica represents the premium not-for-profit provider at the leading age of healthcare evolution. We're hopeful that we'll be able to deploy far-direct creative capital with this innovative partner of ours. Speaking of accretive capital deployment, we are pleased to share with you that we have closed in excess of $1.3 billion of acquisitions year to date with very attractive unlevered IRR, in particular, extremely happy to announce that we have partnered with a Safanad led investment group to recapitalize HC-One, the largest and most reputable operator of care homes communities in U.K. Our investment in excess of $800 million comes in form of first mortgage debt on HC-One's real estate and equity in recapitalization. We also received significant warrants that would further allow us to participate in the post-COVID upside that we are confident that management in process of executing. HC-One will add a value option to our high-end focused U.K. platform. There is significant opportunity to upgrade the asset base, operating platform and people in this portfolio, and we have tremendous confidence in James and David to fulfill their mission to deliver the highest quality care, along with the residents and employee satisfaction. In recent weeks, HC-One has experienced the same positive occupancy momentum as our broader U.K. portfolio, gaining 90 bps of occupancy from the March 2021 trough. Our debt investment represents the last found exposure of just $40,000 far unit and important statistic given our unrelenting focus on basis. This basis also represents a significant discount to replacement costs, in addition to the upside from equity and warrants. We think this is an extraordinary risk-adjusted return story. We believe we'll be able to generate low to mid-teens on IRR from this transaction while adding a highly strategic partner to fill a gap that we have in our portfolio in the U.K. With acquisitions, patience is a virtue and so is occasional boldness. Since we mentioned in our October call, the moment of boldness is here, we have closed in excess of $1.8 billion of acquisitions. The initial yield of this whole tranche is 6.8%, but we expect it will stabilize at a significantly higher number. When while the environment was very uncertain then, and we didn't give into institutional imperative about headline pressures, and we relied on independent thinking and resilience of our team. We remain very bullish on acquisition opportunities and have several attractive deals under contract currently and a highly visible pipeline, which we think we'll be able to execute through year end. While our focus continues to be on the right asset with the right basis and with the right operator, I'm hopeful that our 2021 class of acquisition will be immediately accretive to 2022 earnings and will be significantly accretive to 2023 and beyond. Lastly, I will address a very interesting question I have received from an investor post our last call. I was asked why we have such an emphasis on partner selection and whether it would be better off vertically integrating. We think this is an excellent question that deserves some reflecting for a moment. Notwithstanding the RIDEA law in senior housing, we believe we're better off in the ecosystem of partners and implementing an industrial view of vertical integration. That view is rooted in our belief that the combination of centralized capital allocation and decentralized execution creates the best long-term return. We believe this strategy of decentralized execution relates to energy and keeps politics and costs at bay. This is especially important in real estate, which is profoundly a local business. However, overall, we are happy with our execution so far in the year to create partial value for our shareholders, but by no means we are satisfied. We are cautiously optimistic about the fundamental environment and excited about our opportunity to acquire assets, create new relationships, and attract quality challenges. With that, I'll pass it over to Tim. Tim? Timothy McHugh : Thank you, Shank. My comments today will focus on our first-quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a balance sheet and liquidity update, in addition to an outlook for the second quarter. After a year defined by infection protocols, move-in restrictions, and incredible operating challenges for our partners, we started 2021 in arguably the most challenging environment yet. With case counts hitting new highs across all three of our geographies and operating restrictions moving up in lockstep. Towards the end of February, the vaccine rollout hit its stride and nearly 80% of our facilities had their second vaccine finished. Case counts across the portfolio dropped precipitously, and we started to see the early signs of stabilization. The effectiveness and rapid deployment of vaccines within our communities are just starting to be felt across our resident population. And while we are encouraged by the last 6 weeks of recovery in the U.S. and U.K., significant uncertainty remains with respect to the prevalence of the virus among the general population, the timing of the reopening of the economy, and the timing of further rollbacks of operating restrictions, especially with respect to our Canadian portfolio. The result is a near-term operating environment that, although notably improved, remains highly unpredictable in the short term. As a result of this uncertainty, like last quarter, we provided a one-quarter outlook with our results last night. As we have done over the past 14-plus months, we will continue to disclose and update information on a frequent basis with the intention of providing a more complete outlook as soon as the virus-related variables moderate to a level that allows for more reliable forecasting. Now turning to the quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.17 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.80 per diluted share versus guidance of $0.71 to $0.76 per share. When providing guidance last quarter, we also provided expectations for $31 million of HHS provider relief funds we received in the quarter. We ended up recognizing approximately $34.7 million of HHS funds, along with $2.5 million of out-of-period payments for similar programs in Canada. Removing the impact of these funds, along with the $3.5 million termination fee that was received in one of our senior housing management company investments, which was not contemplating guidance, our normalized FFO moves to $0.70 per share. Therefore, on an apples-to-apples basis, we came out $0.01 above the top end of our HHS adjusted prior guidance of $0.64 to $0.69 per share. Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported one quarter in years. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2020. Importantly, our collection rate for rent remained high in the first quarter, having collected 96% of triple net contractual rent due in the period. Starting with our senior housing triple-net portfolio. Same-store decline 2% year over year as leases that we moved the cash recognition in prior quarters continue to comp against the prior year full contractual rent received. EBITDAR coverage decreased 0.01 times on a sequential basis in the portfolio to 1.00. During the quarter, we transitioned the remaining five capital senior assets, moving one to triple-net structure under a new operator and the other four to various structure with CSU until transition. We also completed the transition of four properties leased by Hearth management to Storypoint under a new lease agreement. These transitions had a net positive impact of 0.02 times in total portfolio coverage. Next, our long-term post-new portfolio generated positive 0.2% year-over-year same-store growth, and EBITDAR coverage increased 0.37 times sequentially to 1.37 times. As 51 of the 79 Genesis assets began operator transitions. 23 assets have already transitioned as of this call, including nine former Powerback properties, which moved to ProMedica Senior Care. Pro forma for the already-completed ProMedica JV, Genesis Healthcare represents less than 90 basis points of our total in-place NOI. And long-term post-acute will be reduced to 6% of total NOI. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised by ProMedica Senior care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.8% year over year and trailing 12 EBITDAR coverage was 1.9 times. Before turning to outpatient medical, I want to highlight a disclosure change we made to our presentation of occupancy in our supplemental disclosure. Historically, we reported occupancy to 100% ownership. But going forward, we will present both at Welltower's pro-rata share to better reflect Welltower's ownership economics. This has no impact on NOI, which has always been presented at Welltower share. We have footnoted the occupancy levels if presented a 100% ownership in both the senior housing operating and medical office portion of our supplement. Now turning to our outpatient medical portfolio, which delivered positive 3.1% year-over-year same-store growth, as cash rent growth and higher platform profitability combined to producing acceleration in NOI growth. Tenant retention continued to be strong at 87.7% in the quarter, as we executed renewals on more than 540,000 square feet of space in the quarter, our highest amount ever reported. Additionally, we've also seen the length of term on executed renewal increases compared to last year. Also in the quarter, we completed our second joint venture with Invesco Real Estate for a portfolio of outpatient medical assets and completed our first with Wafra. Our ability to form joint ventures with best-in-class capital partners over the last two years has allowed us to maintain scale and more importantly, the tenant relationships generated from our in-house asset management platform. At the same time, we diversified our access to capital during a period of significant capital market turbulence. We look forward to growing these relationships further going forward. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. Before getting into this quarter's results, I want to point out that we received approximately $35 million from our Department of Health and Human Services Cares Act provider relief fund. As we've done in the past quarters, the funds are recognized on a cash basis, and as such, will flow through financials in the quarter they are received. We're normalizing these HHS funds out of same-store metrics, however, along with any other government funds received they're not matched expenses occur in the period they received. In the first quarter, there were approximately $33.8 million of reimbursement normalized out of our same-store senior housing operating results, mainly tied to the HHS program in the U.S. Now turning to results for the quarter. Same-store NOI decreased 44% as compared to first-quarter 2020 and decreased 15.6% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Sequential same-store revenue was down 3.6% in Q1, driven primarily by a 310 basis point drop in average occupancy versus our guidance midpoint of 325 basis points. Turning to REVPOR in the quarter. Show portfolio REVPOR was down 1.5% year over year, but mix shift and an extra day of rent in the comparable leap-year quarter are distorting the true picture of rent growth metrics as over 40% of our revenue is derived on a per name basis. When adjusting for the leap year, total portfolio REVPOR growth moves to negative 1%. And breaking out our individual segments, our active adult independent living and assisted living segments reported year-over-year growth of positive 6.3%, positive 0.7%, and positive 1.6%, respectively. As I mentioned in the past few quarters, the combined total portfolio metric is being impacted by a considerable change in the composition of occupied units in the year-over-year portfolio. Our lower acuity properties comprised of independent living and senior departments held up considerably better on the occupancy front since the start of COVID, which has the mathematical impact of having a higher portion of our total portfolio occupied units being lower acuity and therefore, lower rent-paying units. Rental rates are proving resilient, more resilient across our portfolio than would appear in our aggregate reported statistics. Lastly, expenses. Total same-store expenses declined 2.6% year over year and decreased 20 basis points sequentially. I'll focus on sequential since the changes are more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 20-basis-point sequential decline in operating costs was driven mainly by lower COVID cover cost as case counts dropped dramatically in March. The meaningful decline in our top line, combined with these expense pressures had a significant impact to our operating margins, which declined 280 basis points sequentially to 19.4%. As I noted earlier in the call, we did not include government reimbursement that was not tied to parity expenses. And therefore, COVID expenses negatively impacted same-store by $14.8 million. We are not factoring any HHS funds into our second-quarter outlook. Looking forward to the second quarter, and starting with the April quarter-to-date data we've already observed, we've experienced 20 basis points through April 23, with the U.S., U.K. up 40 and 90 basis points, respectively, while Canada is down 20 basis points. While we are encouraged by the recovery in the U.S. and U.K. and are hopeful that the effectiveness of the vaccines has put a floor underneath operating results, we remain cautious on projecting an acceleration in recent trends, given the lack of historical precedents and uncertainty of reopening trend, particularly in Canada. On a spot basis, we are currently projecting a 130-basis-point increase in occupancy from March 31 through June 30. We expect monthly REVPOR to be plus 1.2% sequentially, although adjusting for the extra day in 2Q versus 1Q reduced to plus 70 basis points sequentially. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be effectively flat. As increases in operating costs from higher occupancy should be offset by a reduction in COVID-related expenses. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to execute on our strategy of maximizing balance sheet stability. We're maintaining flexibility to position us to take advantage of attractive capital deployment opportunities. In March, we issued $750 million of senior unsecured notes due June 2031, bearing an interest rate of 2.8%, and used these proceeds to redeem all remaining senior unsecured notes due 2023. As a result, we were able to extend all senior unsecured debt maturities to 2024 and beyond, extend our weighted average maturity profile for nearly eight years. We also extinguished $42 million of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 7.6% in the quarter. In February, we highlighted a robust pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. As these transactions materialize, and the pipeline has grown, we've utilized our forward ATM program, selling 3.7 million shares of common stock to date at an initial average weighted price of $73.43 per share. These shares will generate future gross proceeds of approximately $272 million, and along with $1 billion of cash from our balance sheet, will enable us to officially capitalize our highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. Moving on to leverage. We ended the quarter at 6.59 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, a 31 basis point increase over the previous quarter as underlying cash flows continue to be pressured by the impact of COVID. While transactions closed in the second quarter will result in a slight increase in leverage, after adjusting for expected proceeds from assets held for sale and $272 million proceeds from the forward sale of common stock, we expect leverage to settle in the high sixes before the ramp in senior housing cash flows begin to naturally drive leverage lower in the coming quarters. Speaking of recovery, Shankh spoke earlier about the magnitude of potential cash flow growth from just returning to pre-COVID levels of margins and occupancy in our senior housing operating portfolio. This will have a significantly positive impact on cash flow-based leverage metrics. And although the duration of this recovery remains highly uncertain, the inflection point this quarterly is optimistic that it has begun. And our demonstrated ability to access significant equity proceeds through asset sales, even in the most difficult times, along with our return the equity market since last quarter, leaves us confident that we'll be able to keep the balance sheet in a position of strength as a natural deleveraging when the senior housing recovery returns us to well within our historical target levels in the not-too-distant future. Lastly, moving to our second-quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the second quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.31 to $0.36. And normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.72 to $0.77 per share. As I noted earlier, this guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS funds or similar government programs in the U.K. and Canada. So when comparing sequentially to our first quarter normalized FFO per share, use a $0.70 per share number I mentioned earlier in my comments, which excludes the benefits of these programs as well. On this comparison, the midpoint of our second-quarter guidance of $0.745 per share represents a $0.045 sequential increase from 1Q. The $0.045 increase is composed of a $0.02 increase per share increase from our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by an increase in sequential average occupancy and expected reduction in COVID costs, a $0.025 per share increase in net investment activity as strong post quarter investments is offsetting the initial dilution from loan reductions and operator transitions related to Genesis. A $0.01 increase in NOI from triple-net and outpatient medical segments, and this is offset by the expected $0.01 increase in sequential G&A, driven mainly by new hires. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic on our business, we have remained resolute in our commitment to ESG initiatives. In fact, our efforts on this front have only grown over the past year, and we are pleased to report significant progress, not just in terms of numerous awards and accolades we have received, but also by our action to strengthen and expand our ESG platform, which we believe will bear fruit in many years to come. We have recently received the Energy Star Partner of the Year award for the third consecutive year and elevated to the level of sustained excellence, the EPA's highest recognition within the Energy Star program. We have also been honored that our social initiatives we are recognized with the quality score of one by IFF, the highest ranking in the social category. And last but not least, we continue to receive an A rating from MSCI, one of the most widely, well-respected global organization for our broader ESG practices and disclosures. I'm extremely proud to be working with our Board of Directors, one of the most diverse in Corporate America in this commitment to create long-term and sustainable shareholder value per share through our ESG initiatives. With that, operator, we can open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Rich Anderson : I got up at six this morning to be first in line. So the disclosure on the recovery is great. And I appreciate that you can't comment or know what the trajectory is going to be, but it is question number-one in every one of my conversations because right now, we have to deal with an elevated multiple because of trough earnings. And so people want to know what the snapback is going to look like. My estimates are down 30% versus pre-COVID because of all this noise. And so I guess the way I would ask the question is, if you can't give trajectory, what would disappoint you in terms of getting back to square one. Would you say, \"Boy, if we're not there in two years, that would be quite a disappointment.\" Can you kind of triangulate at least a range of expectations as opposed to committing to one? Shankh Mitra : Yes. Thank you very much, Rich. I hope you don't have to wake up at 6 a.m. to be first in the line. But I'll just address the question, is any definitive answer for our end is as much of a guess from us as it is from you, right? So just understand there's no historical precedence to what's going on. We're simply telling you, if we go back asset by asset to where the NOI of these assets were, it's an important exercise because we have sold a lot of assets, bought a lot of assets, so it's very hard for you to figure out from our supplement what the number looks like. So we try to answer that question that if we just went back for the stabilized pool of assets to Q4 of '19, what will the NOI look like? And we add the filler portfolio and stabilize that, what does that combined look like. Now I cannot answer the question, whether it's two years or four years or it's - you've got to really put that in the context and your expectation. However, I will say this, and it's a very important point. It is to a Q4 2019 rent level a.k.a. that if you assume that this we expanded out, let's just say it will take four years from today to get to that stabilized level of NOI. So it's going to stabilize in 2026. You have to assume the rent of the business remains flat to achieve that NOI, right, which we don't think obviously is happening. We have continued to say that we expect that rent growth will hold up, right? So you might get it later, but you will get x number of years of rent growth to get added to that. Obviously, that rent growth has a contribution margin that's very high and it falls to the bottom line. On the other hand, if we say, okay, we're going to get that earlier, you are not going to get as much rent growth. You will only get, just say that you decide that you're going to get there in two years, right, I'm making this up. And two years up, so you will only get the rent growth from '19 to '23 instead of '19 to '26. So I'm pointing out that there are many levers here that you have to think through. The longer gestation period will bring you ultimately a higher number because of the rent growth aspect that I'm talking about versus the shorter. And that's all I'm willing to say right now. I can guess, but it is a guess. We're underwriting assets in a way that, frankly speaking, we don't need to know. That's why we're so focused on basis. If you look at our stock, it's a real estate company. You can look at what the basis looks like on a price per unit basis, and then go and think about what it takes to build that portfolio. You will see that portfolio trade had a significant discount to what it takes to build it today. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler with KeyBanc. JordanSadler: Wanted to hone in on a little bit of a different question, which is really the pacing of move-ins and move outs. It's something, Tim, that you addressed on the last call. And I couldn't help but notice that indexed move-ins are now above what seemed to be pre-pandemic levels or at least in March, they were 1031 on Slide 14 of your deck. And so that's pretty interesting. And I know it's probably - and you just addressed Shankh, you don't really want to speak to the potential trajectory of move in. So I totally get that. Can you just maybe talk to us about move outs? They're at negative one-one in March. So the indexes - they're below. Why would they remain sort of below pre-pandemic levels going forward? How would you be able to keep them? Or how would your operators be able to keep them below pre-pandemic levels for a sustained period that would sort of maintain or improve even this net absorption pace that we've recently seen? Timothy McHugh : Yes. Good question, Jordan. It's mainly due to just lower occupancy in the building. So right now, we're seeing 140 basis points below - we were 1,400 basis points below where we were pre-COVID on occupancy front. So you've just got substantially lower number of residents in the building. So if you run a kind of historical churn levels, it obviously changes occupancy builds and then move outs start to kind of match historical levels. But as historical churn levels, you should be running at around 80% of kind of indexed historical levels of move outs. If that gets elevated a bit, we've talked about this from a higher acuity resident moving in during COVID. That probably moves to mid to upper 80s. But that can stay, I think, pretty consistent through the recovery. It is tough looking at the last, kind of, six months ticking through what has been natural move-outs and what's been really - certainly a spike we've seen from COVID in the December, January, February period. I think what you're starting to see in March is a return to that kind of 80% level that we would expect, again, giving historical type of churn. But it's certainly something we're watching pretty closely. But from just a level of kind of the comment I made last quarter was from a level of occupancy in the buildings, that move out percentage, getting back to historical levels of 2019 levels of move-ins, you can drive 80, 90 basis points a month in occupancy by just getting back there because the move-outs are going to be lower, purely mathematically based off the occupancy level. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph with Citi. Nick Joseph : I was hoping to get a few more details on the HC-One transaction in terms of the rate on the loan and then the strike price and amount of the warrants? And then what happened to the previous MEZ investment with them? Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Nick. The previous MEZ investments was paid off at par. And we are seeing in Q1 as a three-part investment. One is a combination of first mortgage, equity and warrant. And we think that combination will generate low to mid-double-digit type IRR. We also give you the basis which we invested a majority of that capital, the equity basis is slightly higher, but it's a substantial discount to replacement cost as well. So to hit those IRRS, you don't really need much of a expansion of multiple. What you need is the EBITDA to come back, which we think the management is already executing. And we've noted that the occupancy is already moving in the right direction. I'm not going to break out the specific part. You know that we do not believe in yields and cap rates determining investment success. We believe basis and IRRs get to the investment success and are consistent with that, and that's what we are willing to provide. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley. Vikram Malhotra : Shankh and Tim, maybe you can - if you can describe just the acquisition opportunity set as it's evolved over the last three or four months since your last call, you talked about potentially a $10 billion opportunity over time. HC-One obviously expands your opportunity set in the U.K. But if you could just talk about the opportunity set in terms of assets, returns? And also just in terms of underwriting, I think you referenced your underwriting, if I'm correct, differently or not to a set time and you don't need it because of the basis. But I just asked that because your math that you described here, obviously, talks about pre-COVID levels. We all know, obviously, before pre-COVID, we still had a five-year period of occupancy loss because of supply. So theoretically, there's even more upside. But if you can talk about the opportunity set and underwriting from that perspective, it would be helpful. Shankh Mitra : Yes. Okay. Thank you, Vikram. First is the $10 billion number I mentioned, obviously, is a multiyear opportunity, not a one-year opportunity, right? So I just want to clarify that. But you're right in that expansion with obviously expanding with HC-One, this transaction expands that opportunity. I want you to understand, as I've said in my prepared remarks, that this investment is not just a financial investment, it's a strategic investment. And we looked at the company, its footprint, its management, and we see an opportunity that fills a big hole in our portfolio. Our portfolio in U.K. is very focused on high end, and we didn't have the value option. And there is a tremendous opportunity to grow in that value option, which we think we'll be able to execute through the HC-One platform. We structured the investment in the three tranches that we talked about. We don't go into an investment thinking we'll do debt, we'll do equity, we'll do MEZ or participating equity or. That's not how we think about it. We just look at an opportunity first. Think about what is the first asset opportunity and strategic opportunities, then think about how we get to invest capital so that we can be aligned with our partners. That's a very different approach than it's an asset, and we've got to buy it, are we going to lend to it. That's just not how we take. And it is the right risk-adjusted return. You look at an asset or a collection of assets or portfolio and you think about where in the capital structure even the best risk of return for your investors. Remember, there are different investors in the, obviously, the spectrum of this transaction. There is $235 million of equity on top of us, which obviously Safanad led investment group that includes Spanning and others, they're obviously bringing in, and they think there's an extraordinary opportunity to create value for their capital. Right? So that's a very important point. Now going back to sort of the pipeline, the pipeline is primarily today is senior housing, and the pipeline is very much what we talked about. It's significant. It's very robust. It's large. And it reflects a very significant discount to replacement cost. We're not going to sit here and tell you that we believe that every deal we'll do, we'll have this kind of return that we have described in HC-One, but as said before, that we think we can hit high single-digit to low double-digit IRR, and that environment is still here. We don't necessarily, given our cost of capital, need to hit that. But we're still seeing many, many, many opportunities that we have under contract today, that will get to you to that kind of return, which is in the high single-digit, low double-digit type of IRR. Hope that helps. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : On leading demand indicators and community details. It's certainly encouraging to see visitation and communal dining almost back to historic levels. One missing component is the current quarantine requirement for new residents. It is still the two weeks quarantine or perhaps longer, if not vaccinated. Then secondly, the lower level of in-person toward, is that being negatively impacted by restrictions in Canada versus other markets? Any geographic context is welcome. Timothy McHugh : Yes. Thanks, Derek. So I'll start with the question on quarantine. So this is a state-by-state process, part of my comments in my opening comments, part of the uncertainty around this is that it's local from a lot of the regulations around scaling back COVID regulations from last year, restrictions from last year. So we're seeing it kind of unfold state to state. But largely, the U.S. now quarantining restrictions are gone, if you come in vaccinated. If you don't come in vaccinated, then you do have quarantining. But you've seen through the success of the vaccination of the over 65 population in the U.S. and largely majority of move-ins now that we're seeing come in vaccinated and you're eliminating that quarantine period. And then the second question on tours, you're correct. Canada is dragging down statistics. So you've seen a vast improvement in the U.K., the U.S. is a little different state to state, but now largely, all states are allowing in-person tours. And Canada is still in a bit more of a restricted state. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : I wanted to jump on the HC-One transaction. I think, Shankh, you kind of already answered this a little bit. But when you think about that deal, should we think of it as more of a strategic type investment, an ability for you to continue to grow in the U.K. with that operator? Or was it more of an opportunistic type? I mean, since this is a debt investment, I guess, it's a little confusing on the strategic nature of it. Shankh Mitra : Yes. So, Mike, it's a great question. It is not a debt investment. It is a debt, it's structured as a lot of kind of capital deployed is debt investment, but it also comes with a very significant equity ownership through a warrant or future ownership through a warrant and kind ownership through the equity stakes. So that's how we thought about it. This is not an opportunistic investment. This is a strategic investment. If you look at our portfolio, you will see majority of our U.K. portfolio is kind of in that GBP 1,400 - GBP 1,350, GBP 1,400 per week to GBP 1,600 plus per week kind of. That's our sweet spot. And we think there is a real value option needed in U.K. on the private pay side, you can - there's a tremendous amount of business, tremendous depth of need in, let's call it, the GBP 900 to GBP 1,000 per week. So this fills a true strategic hole that we have in our portfolio, which we have been looking for a long time, not just the last 12 months, to fill that hole. And we think this will be our platform. And as we have talked to our partners here Safanad, we have always seen it as a strategic investment. That's what we have talked to James and David, who run HC-One, and we think you will see further capital deployment activity coming through it in that segment. We're not going to go - I don't want to speak for the management. I do not believe if suddenly they're pivoting the business going from GBP 1,000 a week to GBP 1,600 per week. That's not the vision of the company is. The vision is to grab that demand in that segment, and there's not a lot of quality and a lot of deep providers in that segment. So that's what we see here. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : I understand the potential for your show operator, senior housing operating partners to raise rents going forward. But when I look at costs, of which 60% labor do your operators have an expectation of increases to staff these properties? Labor costs were up 6% to 7% over the past couple of quarters. And given wage increases across the country, it seems like labor costs could inflate just as fast or even faster than rates. So any color on labor cost expectations and how you incorporated that on Slide 13 would be great. Shankh Mitra : Yes, Jonathan. There's no question that you will have labor cost inflation. I do not believe that problem will be as acute as you have seen last five years when all the - frankly speaking, all of our portfolios, given where the locations are, regardless of local regulations have sort of moved at or above that $15 type of numbers. So you have seen a very significant increase of labor cost. Will you see labor cost inflation? Absolutely. But I think you will also see margin expansion from, as Tim talked about previously, we believe that you will see the margin expansion going back to the historic margins level. So it's a win at the end. I will tell you one thing, though. I would highly encourage you not to look at one quarter or one month of labor costs and projecting there. This is a lot of noise and volatility around the fact that a lot of people have received the stimulus check, and that has impacted short term. We do not believe that will be sustained as the sort of this dries up. However, you are right that labor cost inflation will remain, but it will not be what you see in other sectors, because what you are seeing in other sectors, such as lodging and all the sectors, they have laid off all their employees, they shutdown. Right? That was the case. For us, our communities have never shut down. They continue to employ our - obviously, because to take care of our residents, and that continues. Is there no issue? Absolutely not, will remain so. I would also encourage you to think about the potential immigration changes that is - we're hearing about. Obviously, I know it less - probably less than you do, but that also has an offsetting impact. So it's a long-term problem, but just understanding the demand-supply of labor as it relates to demand-supply of people and also how that impacts people's other choices at home, this will all come into place. We'll talk about it as we go through it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Just wondering how are the occupancy trends trending at the new development, say, filler properties compared to the more established properties that you have? Timothy McHugh : Right now, there's not much of a difference. I'd say we're seeing pretty uniform recovery across the board. So likely, we'll start to see that start to change as you see some of the filler properties accelerate just purely by their current occupancy level. But right now, we're seeing pretty uniform recovery across the board. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just hoping to spend a little time on the triple-net seniors housing business that hasn't had the same amount of focus. But if you could just try to help us understand kind of what has been done to date to rectify some of the low coverage, presumably some of the 2% decrease in same-store NOI in the first quarter was driven by some restructurings or adjustments. And you had - I think it looks like some straight-line rent write-offs in the quarter as per some of your supplemental slides. If you could just help us think through what you've done to date and maybe what's left to do because I think that's a big piece of the recovery once that bottoms about what the portfolio could look like going forward with more clarity on the shop side? Timothy McHugh : Yes, Juan. So I think the right way to think about it is, it has been the main focus win for us. And it seems to be for investors as well. But I think in the triple-net senior housing portfolio, around 20% of that in-place rent is now cash. So it pretty much reflects the underlying economics in those buildings. We have been pretty quick to move the cash when we have tenants that are not paying rent. So I think looking at our in-place, looking at our coverage metrics, those are tenants that are current on rent paying us and very much are doing so because of their long-term belief in their business. And if anything, I think what we've seen in the first quarter from the start of a recovery, enhances that belief that there will be - there won't be much impairment here. I think the other thing here is, I think, the difference between cash flow and value. And the underlying assets, I think you're seeing this across the board, are holding value. So the impairment to cash flow, I think, is short term. That speaks to the view there's a recovery. And so I don't think about this being a value prop to Welltower, and if anything, kind of a short-term liquidity problem with the operators. Shankh Mitra : I'll just add, as I've said, probably every call we discussed it. So I'm not sure, Juan, why you think there's not been a focus. A majority of these leases that we have, and we're seeing - you should see that in our RIDEA portfolio as well. Usually, the assets are owned and the propco is jointly owned by the operator and us. And those - the operator's propco interest backed our lease, a.k.a, what you see as just from the rent does not reflect the collateral behind the lease. As you will see, these things get restructured, you will notice that value of operators that they own the real estate, their propco interest will really back this rent and will create substantial protection of downside for our shareholders. So I don't want to get into too much of details before everything is done. As I've said before, that you will continue to be surprised how much rent we continue to get from this portfolio? Will there be dilution of short-term cash flow? Absolutely will. And you're seeing that flowing through. Do we think there will be diminution of value? Absolutely not. So that's a general average statement. But that's what we continue to believe, and that's what you have seen through a hundred-year slide, once in a hundred-year slide, which is this pandemic, that held up, will continue to hold up. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky with Berenberg. Connor Siversky : Thanks for having me on the call. Just to follow-up on Juan's question. I'm wondering if this straight-line writedown was at all related to some of the movement we've seen in the top tenants? And if so, could you maybe provide some color on what we can know or what we could expect going forward? Shankh Mitra : No. We will not, Connor. We do not talk about specific operators on this call. And that's not relevant. As I said, that this lease that we restructured, you're only seeing one side of that. You haven't seen the other side. And the operator has a substantial amount of ownership in the propco. And that ownership backed the rent, and this operator is an extraordinarily highly respected operator, and we think we'll get to a point that works for our shareholders and their ownership and you are only seeing one part of it. Just give us time, and you will see it will result into a mutually beneficial arrangement, where we will be able to protect all of our value. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : So one other debate point to add into the mix on the $480 million of embedded NOI. And that's really the Slide 10 as far as the construction versus inventory. As we look at your NOI margins in your SHO portfolio, it went from 32% to 30%, let's call it, from, I don't know, 2015, 2016 to 2019. A lot of that was that big increase in construction. Now that slide shows that's coming way down, which should alleviate some of the pressure as well. So I wanted to just talk about that on the plus side. And to the extent that you have some visibility, maybe just in your just overall strategic review of the industry, do you think that the number goes lower from here on that chart on the bottom of Slide 10 as far as construction versus? Shankh Mitra : So, Steve, that's an extremely important portion. I tried to address that in my prepared remarks. Look, we're all guessing. Right? And we have to assume that people will do things that is economically beneficial to them. If you look at how much the costs have changed, let's just say - let's just talk about cost in the last three years. You have places in the coast, costs are probably up 20-plus percent, low 20%. And if you look at some of the locations in Dallas, Charlotte, Nashville, cost is up between 30% and 35%. The housing market is very significantly impacting not just the cost of lumber, which is everybody is talking about, but the cost and availability of labor. Right? So if you - that's sort of one big impact and a development model is a highly leveraged model. Right? So if you thought you're going to make 7% yield on cost and suddenly now looks like 5%, you are in trouble. But on the other hand, if you see what's going on, interest rate is backing up in a highly leveraged model. But definition development is a high leveraged model, with construction loans, etc. What you have is now interest rates backing up. So it's farther eating into your pro forma. And those two combinations, assuming people don't develop for fun, they want to develop to make money, that proposition is increasingly becoming very difficult. This is an industrywide comment. This is not - I'm not suggesting, see if you can go and develop a building in a given location and can't make money. That's not the point. As an industry wide, it is becoming much more difficult. And assuming people who want to develop to make money, that proposition is getting much, much harder. I'm not even talking about availability of debt capital, etc. The attractiveness of the model has been meaningfully hit in last, call it, three years, particularly last 12 months, as housing has just gone parabolic. So in that context, we think there will be, obviously, a lot less supply than it has been in the, call it, between '15 to '19. Also the '15 to '19, sort of the supply boom was, frankly, was created by a lot of the players, including our company, was paid $1.20, $1.5 on the dollar on the basis. I do not see those participants in the industry anymore. People are very, very - people who're involved in buying assets today, they're very focused on the right basis. And a lot of the sort of the take-out premium is meaningfully gone from the industry as well. So if we put all of those things together, we think that it is reasonable to expect. You can never accurately forecast what the future will look like. It is reasonable to expect that supply in the next five years will be a lot less than last five years, but it is yes, nonetheless. And we do think that will impact the rent growth, which is the point I was trying to make on the 480, is that is the beauty of basis. I highly encourage all of you to look at what is the in-flight per basis value of Welltower. And if you have to make at that basis a number, what rent do you need, versus what it takes to build and to make some minimum acceptable return, call it, 7%, whatever you think is the development yield should be and what is the rent. And you will see what it takes to build on our - today in our company, there's a huge gap between the potential rent, what's potential to bring new supply versus what you can get? That's not just to work our problem. I'm saying existing industry versus the new industry, and that will give you much more insight into what the rental may or may not be. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Omotayo Okusanya : I just wanted to go back to Juan and Connor's question about some of the restructured leases. And, Shankh, you made a point that you're working on structures to help you kind of recover some of the kind of initial rent breaks or whatever benefits you've kind of given these lease tenants in the short term. Could you just talk a little bit about what some of those kinds of lease terms would be to kind of make sure, again, you kind of get those benefits back in when ultimately this tenant starts to recover? Shankh Mitra : Yes. That's a very good question. So there are many ways you can do this. If you keep the assets under lease, you can give obviously short-term rate and - but you can create two years out, three years out, depending on the level of EBITDA. You can do all bells and vessels to recoup that rent as cash flow comes back. And that's the point we're trying to make. Remember this is - cash flow is now starting to come back. Right? So that's sort of if you retain it, obviously, in the lease. Remember, these leases are not - there's nothing behind the leases. There's a propco interest sits behind the leases. So you have a value protection. If you go to RIDEA, right, we are not afraid just to get - take a rent stance, and if that is what, what is the sustainable level of rent from the sustainable level of production. Right? You saw that we bought a new - we bought a bunch of new assets in the reported quarter where we did a triple net. It was a highly respected operator. In that particular case, you would say, why didn't they do a RIDEA? Because if you look at in that portfolio, what we bought, the rent before us was substantially higher, right, 50% higher, that you are paying to the previous landlord. Our rent is much lower. We set it in a way. But then we have some sort of a catch-up. Our rent goes up, not by 3%, but as the EBITDA comes back significantly, and the EBITDA is already moving in that direction. We have a provision to get some more rent. It is also for the operator, at some point, they were paying 50% higher rent. And they will end up probably paying from the current rent level, 10% more, 15% more, but they will keep rest of the cash flow. Right? So it works out on both sides. Why does it works out on both sides. Because the basis is lower. The issue is not - a lease is fundamentally a form of a leverage and if you put a basis in the assets so much higher, and then you put a high LTV loan or high LTV credit for the lease, you are kind of creating problems from two ends. In this case, it's a very low basis that helps both parties, the owner as well as the operators to make money going forward. Going back to your specific question, there's a lot of collateral that sits behind these leases from this specific issue that Juan and Connor, and now you're asking about. This particular operator, which is one of the most respected operators in our space, has a substantial amount of propco interest that they have created through a very significant development machine through '90s. And that propco interest sits behind that lease. So let's just say, you can do it from a lease. This is just a statement or you can go to a RIDEA. Right? If you go to a RIDEA. Right? If you go to a RIDEA the ownership will change and will reflect the fact that their future liability is lower, aka we lost an asset. And we have acted that, backed lease, and we have an opportunity in that restructuring to own more of the real estate, not the same amount. That's the way to think about it. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : So looking at a couple of different slides you guys have and just trying to put this all together. So you had this slide that's showing the future NOI potential getting back to pre-COVID occupancy. And yet at the same time, you're not providing full-year guidance for this year. So on one hand, you're implying a lot of optimism about getting back to an occupancy number, which is much higher than where you are right now. Yet you're not really willing to commit to an occupancy range on the year. And I guess I'm just wondering what is giving you confidence that you're going to get back to a higher occupancy level. I mean, the 20 basis points of April occupancy benefit seem like it's a smaller number than what you were talking about with your weekly benefit when you put out a presentation earlier this month. So I'm just trying to - I'm just wondering if there's something that you can point to, you have a backlog of pent-up demand that you're learning from prospective residents that going to increase move-ins as you get into the third quarter and beyond? I mean, what else can we sort of point to here that you think should give us confidence that you're going to get back to pre-COVID occupancy? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So nowhere on that slide, if you go back and see that we said we will. We just said, if we do go back to that occupancy, this is what the numbers looks like under this assumption of no rent cost and at the margin that it was at that point in time. You will decide whether we will go back or not go back, that's a matter of opinion. What we have stated on that slide is a matter of fact. So that's sort of the number one point. Number two point, we are nowhere implying that you will get to that number within a specific time frame. Full-year guidance that you have raised, that is a specific time frame. We're not committing to a specific time frame on that 480, which is on Slide 13 of the presentation because, frankly, we have no clue. Right? Third, I mentioned on my presentation or prepared remarks, that we are - this is probably the most optimistic I've heard, all of our operating partners from an industry momentum perspective were yet to see it on sort of in our occupancy. Hopefully, we'll see it. We're not baking. We're not sort of counting on it. We're not giving you an occupancy guidance per se. We're giving you an FFO guidance, and we're simply telling you what underlies that FFO guidance, which is basically straight-lining what we have seen so far. Hopefully, that answers your question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich with Green Street. Lukas Hartwich : You said bottom-on shop occupancy. And it kind of looks steady based on some of the numbers you put in your release, but I'm just hoping you can talk a little bit more about the cadence of the increase in occupancy over the past six weeks? Is it steady, or is it bumpier? Just kind of curious what that looks like. Shankh Mitra : Six weeks is not a long enough time frame, Lukas, to give you a trend. But if you insist, I can tell you if it is 60 basis points over six weeks, the weeks that are closer to us today have seen higher than the two and the weeks that are farther from us have seen lower than the 10. But six weeks is not a good enough time frame for you to project. At least we don't have confidence to project that. I can tell you the tone of our operating partners is a lot more positive than what you're seeing. I want to see first in the numbers and then talk about it. This is a highly uncertain environment. We're just not going to sit here and try to guess what things - how things might or might not play out. Remember, there is a possibility things can get much worse. If we have significant resurgence of COVID, it can get worse us. Right? So we're just telling you what we are seeing, we're telling you things, obviously, seasonally, we're seeing things improving. But we just were not ready to go out and tell you that things will successively get better every week, and we have some sort of a secret sauce to see that. It's just a highly uncertain environment. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Daniel Bernstein : I just wanted to go back to the idea of pricing power within senior housing. And I haven't fully run the numbers, but my guess is with home prices rising significantly, rent prices rising significantly, senior housing is probably about as portable as it's been in the last 20 years. So I don't know if you've had discussions or thought about it with your operators, but maybe how - does that change the equation of what occupancy need to be for the industry to have pricing power? Traditionally, you think about 85% or better occupancy for pricing power, but maybe the equation has changed some. So just -- Shankh Mitra : Yes. I am happy to - Dan, very good question. I'm happy to start sort of the - engage in a guesswork with you. But it is a guesswork nonetheless. I can tell you, historically speaking, HPA or house price appreciation index has a very strong correlation with, obviously, rent growth. But this is a very interesting market. Right? It's unprecedented in many, many ways. You haven't seen this kind of housing shortage combined with demand. You haven't seen this kind of escalation of rent - I mean, cost that makes it very, very difficult to build something. Reasonably speaking, I would say, if all of those are together, you should see rent growth. At the same time, you have to acknowledge the fact that entire industry is in lease-up. Right? So I am not comfortable underwriting a lot of rent growth, but I also believe that you will see modest rent growth like you are seeing. Now do I think that three years from now, the rent growth will be better than what we are seeing today. That's reasonable to expect. Do I know for sure? No. But I think that's reasonable to expect. Operator : And we have a follow-up question from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street. Lukas Hartwich : Thanks. On the HC-One loan, I'm just curious if you could provide the debt service coverage, what that looks like on free NOI from that portfolio or that company? Shankh Mitra : Lukas, can I get back to you on that? I don't have that on top of my mind. I'll get back to you on that. I can tell you, on an LTV basis, if you ascribe no value to the actual business, which backs the loan, not just the real estate, the overall V in that LTV is extremely low. And it's a substantial, substantial discount to replacement cost. But I don't have the service coverage ratio pre-COVID basis in my head. I will call you off-line and give you that number. Operator : And we have a follow-up question from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Mizuho. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. Just a quick one for Tim. Tim, I noticed that there was a little bit of an equity issuance this quarter, about $270 million. Just talk a little bit about why that decision was made when, again, you guys have so much cash on the balance sheet. Timothy McHugh : Yes. It's a great question, and it really has to do with confidence in our pipeline. So we've got between our development spend and the external opportunities we're seeing, it's got less to do, and that's why you're seeing it done in a forward structure is it will fund activity when it occurs, but it's a highly visible activity. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I'd now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead. Matt McQueen : Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh? Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I hope that all of you and families are safe and healthy. Before I make some introductory comments on the state of senior housing, and on capital allocation environment, I want to welcome John Burkart, our Chief Operating Officer to this call. John joined Welltower last week after illustrious 25 year career to Essex. We believe he will make a tremendous long-term impact on our platform. Following my remarks, as usual, Tim will walk you through our operating and financial results. We're cautiously optimistic on the senior housing business as occupancy is starting to build and we're encouraged by nearly 200 basis points of spot to spot occupancy growth in second quarter, which clearly exceeded our expectations. Momentum in US continued to be strong, with lead generation returning to pre COVID levels, resulting in a 280 basis points occupancy gain in the quarter and the UK remain resilient despite the rise in the Delta variant cases being driven by the younger cohorts. Though, we are monitoring the situation closely we have seen very little impact to the portfolio so far as UK case counts more broadly appear to be decreasing rapidly after recent spike. While Canada was a drag on occupancy, we are witnessing some green shoots following a material decline in COVID cases. In fact, tours almost doubled in June from April and May in Canada, as provinces have removed moving restrictions and are now permitting in person tours. For our overall portfolio, June was particularly impressive month with move in exceeding 2019 level for the first time since the beginning of pandemic. I'm also encouraged that our operators were able to achieve these occupancy gains, while holding rate reflecting the need based nature of our asset class, and strong value proposition of this business. Year-over-year same store revPAR is up 3.2% across our assisted living properties, 2.8% across our independent living properties, and 5.3% across our wellness housing communities. The strength in same store revPAR was primarily driven by our highest end luxury products in primary coastal markets. Having said that, I'll caution you that there is still significant uncertainty and many unknowns related to the path of COVID. And it is too early to signal an all clear. However, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making towards achieving the substantial embedded NOI growth in our Show portfolio. Last quarter, we provided details of nearly $0.5 billion of NOI upside, which assumes a return to fourth quarter 2019 occupancy and margin levels. We're pleased to report that we not only achieved $71 million towards this total goal in one quarter, but also added another $29 million potential upside through the second quarter of acquisition and development deliveries. Going forward, we'll still have another $430 million to NOI upside in that business. Again, this only assumes a return to pre COVID occupancy with potential upside from high rates and return to frictional vacancy, which is mid to high single digits. Turning to capital allocation, last fall when we have made a significant pivot from defense to offense, we made it explicit bet that consumers will return to this new trend business with 400 basis points of occupancy ramp in US from March trough with healthy rates, it appears that we're on the right side of that bet. Over the past three quarters we have deployed $4 billion of capital at extremely attractive pricing during a time when others were fearful. But we remain paranoid optimists and our humility and lack of complacency are pushing us to test our hypotheses, and underwrite everything we look at with conservatism. And you can rest assured that we look at pretty much everything in our space. Therefore, we are only willing to pay a price per unit that does not require everything to go right for our owners to make a reasonable return. The second quarter was one of the best quarters from a capital deployment perspective, having closed approximately $1.4 billion of growth investments. Q3 will likely top Q2, and we anticipate that it will be another record quarter of investment activity for the company. We started Q3 with a bang. And so far in July, we have already closed $230 million of gross investment and expect our previously disclosed Holiday transaction to close in third quarter as well. While it is fun to talk about large transactions like Holiday, which I'll get to in a minute, I want to point out that our core strategy and strength is granular transaction with a diverse group of operating partners, and is supported by our data analytics platform. Our COVID class, which I define as anything we bought is turning to offense in Q4 of last year, now exceeds $4 billion of gross investment activity, including Holiday, across 37 transactions with 24 unique partners. In the US, that would on average be $16.6 million per community, or $161,000 per unit, which we believe represents a significant discount to replacement costs. The pipeline remained very strong with many owners and operators eager to join our operator and data platform. Let me give you some examples. First, I'm very pleased to announce that we'll expand our relationship with John Moore and his team at Atria while Lilly and her team and Holiday will join our platform. We're buying 80 nearly identical Holiday Independent Living assets at more approachable end of senior living spectrum with an addition of six more combination AIL assets for a total consideration of $1.58 billion or $152,000 per unit. Our base remains compelling even after our anticipated investment of $1.5 million to $2 million of CapEx by community to bring them to tomorrow standard. While the lease up of this portfolio from the compelling basis through -- a double digit unlevered IRR, we believe there are few opportunities to enhance our return. Number one, our underwritten rent growth is 2.5% per year, despite a heavy investment in the portfolio that will improve asset quality and marketability. Our 2026 underwritten rent remains $700 to $800 below feasibility rent to make development pencil. Two, we have a significant expansion opportunity in 10 plus assets which we expect will generate a double digit return on invested capital; three, the optimization of six AIL buildings under Atria platform and four, there are at least five higher and better use opportunities and a couple of them are so significant that they may generate enough proceeds to pay for a significant portion of the CapEx investment for the whole portfolio. If we are successful in this effort, we will have a completely renovated portfolio at roughly out going in basis, which will enhance our IRR materially. Moving forward from Holiday, I like to make the operative specific comments on this call. First, while we continue to be encouraged by Jack Callison's at Sunrise. Jack is refocusing the organization as a premier Senior Living brand in North America. We are excited about this focus growth strategy and brought Sunrise in to run a recently acquired community in the Philadelphia metro area. This is our first acquisition initiative with Sunrise in several years, and believes we'll have many opportunities to grow together. In the UK Sunrise platform and portfolio will be acquired by Signature and Care UK Signature is an existing Welltower operating partner which runs our high fin communities in the UK. We're tremendously excited to welcome Care UK to our platform, which is one of the most well respected and largest Senior Living operators in the UK, with the addition of 81 on the value end and Care UK on the higher end along with our existing operating partners, the barbell approach to portfolio construction that we have taken in the US which is all an -- which we always aspired to be in the UK is beginning to take shape. We're very excited about Care UK technology and management platform. We're also thrilled to welcome Pathway Living to Welltower's operating platform, which we believe opens another avenue for growth for us. Next, I'm excited to announce our expanded partnership with Oakmont Management Group, which is one of our strongest and best operating partners. This expanded partnership with Courtney and her team is expected to result in a nearly doubling of our time portfolio together in California. We're also embarking on a long-term exclusive development program together to meaningfully expand our relationship in the next decade. Fun fact, Oakmont is our first operator in our portfolio to return to the 90% occupancy mark post COVID, a reflection of Oakmont's operating acumen and market strength. Finally, I'm excited to announce our new partnership with Chris Smith and his team at Aspect Health. We recap Aspect's existing MOB portfolio in Connecticut and at New York and entered into a long term Development Partnership with Chris. We believe a combination of our data and operating capabilities with Aspect's relationships, and development talent will create significant opportunities for growth for both companies. We're already on our first development together, which will be a 60,000 square feet outpatient medical building located at a very attractive market in the New York metropolitan area. The property will be master leased to a leading health system for 20 years and is expected to start construction early next year. Speaking of growth opportunities, I'm pleased to announce our continued growth with the Bremner organization. In the next, in the second quarter, our partnership closed on the first building of a large development near Norman, Oklahoma with Normal Retail Health System. The total development cost for phase one of this multi phase development is expected to be in excess of $100 million, consisting of 181,000 rentable square feet, a classy outpatient medical facilities. Our significant MOB development platform pipeline, which is 100% leased, is now in excess of 1 million square feet and will create significant value for our shareholders in a very tight acquisition market. All of these operating and development partnerships make us the foundation for our core belief that centralized capital allocation and decentralized execution releases entrepreneurial energy while keeping costs and politics at bay. We are very proud that we have formed 50 new operators and develop relationships since the beginning of pandemic. And we have a handful more in the works. The implication of our rapidly growing operator and development platform are vast, including a network effect, whereby addition of more operators creates exponentially recent data set, and thus stronger and attractive an analytics platform. This dramatically enhances the informational advantage we're already positive through our best-in-class with analytics platform, which forms the basis of our capital allocation decision. Needless to say, these relationships create foundation for significant capital deployment opportunities, as each one of them are attracted world vehicle on their own right. This Lollapalooza effect of intertwining operating and data platform has created a wide and increasingly deeper mode for Welltower. As Tim will speak to you in a moment, we're very pleased to with our progress to further strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity profile. More specifically, our sequential adjusted EBITDA growth of roughly $50 million indicates that we're on our way to deleverage organically as senior housing properties unfold. Overall, we're very happy with our execution so far in the year to create cost share value for our shareholders. We're cautiously optimistic about the fundamental environment, and excited about our opportunities to acquire and develop talent, create new relationships, and attract quality partners, which will result outside internal and external growth for years to come. After retooling our assets and portfolio operators, and building a formidable predictive analytics platform and talent base, and growing with conviction following two negative cycles superimposed on each other, resulting from oversupply and COVID, I'm happy to say that we're emerging as a partner of choice, an employer of choice and an investor of choice on the other side of this pandemic. With that, I'll pass it over to Tim. Tim? Tim McHugh : Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2021 results, the performance of our investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, balance sheet liquidity and update in addition to our outlook for the third quarter. The time of our last earnings call on April 29, we were six weeks into an occupancy recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, which has seen total portfolio occupancy increased 67 basis points on March 12 lows or an average increase of 11 basis points per week. In the 13 weeks that have followed, we've seen the occupancy recovery accelerate, adding an additional 204 basis points through July 23, an average pace of 16 basis points per week, bringing the portfolio wide occupancy recovery since March 12 to 271 basis points. The recovery continues to be uneven across the portfolio, with the US leading in 401 basis points since March 12, followed by the UK at 275 basis points. And lastly, Canada, which has seen a net decrease of 88 basis points over this time period. We believe these geographic discrepancies will normalize over time as the reopening of both Canada and the UK catches up to the US. Looking forward despite the uncertainty around the path of COVID in the near term, particularly the spread of the new variants, we continue to both gain evidence that the vaccines are exceptionally effective at protecting our residents and staff from this evolving virus and gain confidence with the permanent demand impairment thesis that surrounded the senior housing asset class in much of the last year and a half to becoming significantly less probable. Now turning to the quarter; Welltower reported net income attributed to common stockholders of $0.06 per diluted share, and normalized FFO of $0.79 per diluted share. First initial guidance of $0.72 to $0.77 per share, and our June guidance update of $0.75 to $0.79 per share, which included a $5 million benefit from HHS Provider Relief Funds. We ultimately recognize that $5 million benefit from HHS Funds and also recognize an additional $4.9 million a reimbursement payments for similar programs in Canada and the UK. After adjusting for the impact of these funds, our normalized FFO per diluted share in the quarter is $0.77. Now turning to our individual portfolio components. First, our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported one quarter in years. These statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 3/31/2021. Importantly, our collection rates remain high in the second quarter, having collected 95% of triple-net contractual rent during the period. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio same store NOI declined 2.7% year-over-year, as leases that were moved to cash recognition in prior quarters continued to comp against prior year full contractual rent received. And trailing 12 months EBITDA coverage was 0.89x. As I've stated in the past, the timing and scope for the recovery in our senior housing portfolio will dictate whether or not disruption from COVID to underlying fundamentals generates a short term liquidity issue or solvency problem for triple-net operators. Over the first four months of recovery, we've observed occupancy and EBITDA trends within this portfolio that are in line with our US and UK operating portfolios. As these recovery trends strengthen the solvency risk for operators has decreased in tandem. In our continued strong cash rent collection in the quarter is the best evidence we have this.  The value of the collateral that sits behind many of our lease agreements continue to allow us to work with our operators to enhance near term liquidity without impairing the value of Welltower of real estate position. Next, our long term post acute portfolio generating negative 1.1% year-over-year same store growth and trailing 12 months EBITDA coverage was 1.29x. In the quarter, we transition 40 of the 51 plan Genesis transition assets to new operators, including nine power back assets transition to ProMedica. With the remaining 11 schedule to transition in the third quarter. 35 of these assets are expected to be disposed out the third quarter. With the expected third quarter Genesis dispositions and the $75 million sales in Altech portfolio in the quarter. Welltower's percentage placed NOI generates long term post acute segment will be reduced to 5.6%. And Genesis Healthcare will represent less than 90 basis points of total company in place NOI. And lastly, health systems, which are comprised by ProMedica Senior, care joint venture with the ProMedica Health System. At same store NOI growth of positive 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12 EBITDA coverage was 1.25x. Turning to medical office; our outpatient medical segment delivered 2.2% year-over-year same store growth due to improved platform profitability and increased property level expense recovery. Occupancy in our same store portfolio ended the quarter at 94.8%, a 20 basis points sequential increase versus first quarter. The strong growth is driven by executed new leasing totaling 178,000 square feet, the highest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019 and supported by 94% retention in the quarter. That's consistent renewal activity was paired with reduced vacancies. Also during the quarter we delivered one purpose built medical office building at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. While the two recently converted Stanley MOB in Charlotte with Atrium Health. These building sold 449,000 square feet of fully occupied space with highly credited health systems. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio, before getting into this quarter's results, I want to provide some color on the recently announced transfer of the Sunrise UK operating platform to two local operators, Signature Senior Lifestyle and Care UK. We're excited to take this opportunity to deepen our local operator relationships. The Sunrise UK portfolio consists of 46 predominantly private pay properties located primarily in southern New England, the portfolio is being split largely by geographic focus. The property is located in Greater London moving to Signature, a premium operator with its Welltower had a relationship since 2012. And the rest of the properties moving the Care UK, a new member of the Welltower operating family and the fourth largest independent care home operate in the UK with the focus on the private pay market. Turning to government grants. In the quarter, we received approximately $5 million from Department of Health and Human Services CARES Act Provider Relief Fund. As we've done in past quarters, these funds are recognized on a cash basis and as such will go through financials the quarter they're received. We're normalizing HHS Funds out of our same store metrics however; along with any other government funds received they're not matching expenses incurred in the period they're received. In the second quarter, there are approximately $9.3 million of reimbursements normalized out of our same store senior housing operating results. Now turning to results for the quarter. Year-over-year same store NOI decreased 17.6% as compared to 2Q 2020 driven by a 670 basis point decrease in year-over-year average occupancy. The COVID related decline in occupancy that began in March of 2020 came to a halt in mid March of this year, and portfolio wide occupancy increased by approximately 230 basis points from March 12 to the end of June. With a 190 basis points taking place in the second quarter. The Stanley occupancy recovery and the accompanying operating market expansion have created an inflection point for bottom line results. And sequential same store NOI increased 11.2% in the first to the second quarter. Sequential same store revenue was up 1.8% in Q2, driven primarily by 40 basis point increase in average occupancy and sequential monthly revPAR increase of 1.3%. With respect to expenses, total same store expenses decreased 40 basis points sequentially, and declined 2.9% year-over-year. I'll focus on the sequential change since this is more relevant to trends in the current operating environment. The 40 basis point sequential decline in operating costs was driven mainly by lower COVID costs, as case counts remain near zero for all the second quarter after spiking meaningfully in the first quarter. Costs were also driven lower sequentially by seasonal utility costs, as a spring and early summer have lower utility costs relative to Q1. The net result is a resilient rental rates and rebounding occupancy combined with a decrease in total expenses, with a sequential margin improvement in our same store pool of 180 basis points to 21.2%. Looking forward to the third quarter, starting with July quarter to date data we've already observed. We've experienced a 40 basis point increase in occupancy through July 23. With the US and UK up 60 and 30 basis points respectively while Canada is flat. Despite the strength of recovery so far, particularly in the US, we remain cautious not projecting the acceleration in trends from the second quarter to the third quarter, given the continued lack of historical precedents with which to forecast and also uncertainty around COVID variant. Despite seeing promising resilience in our UK portfolio over the last month, as a surge in the Delta variant infections amongst the general population has not been echoed amongst our resident population. There remains uncertainty, particularly around how national and local authorities may react in the coming months. If the surge continues or accelerate in our other geographies. On a spot basis, we're currently projecting an approximate 190 basis point increase in occupancy from June 30 through September 30. We expect revPAR to be up 1% to 1.5% up sequentially and up 2.5% year-over-year. Lastly, we expect total expenses to be up 1.5% to 2% sequentially driven by a combination of occupancy driven labor utilization and seasonal utility costs, offset slightly by continued declines in COVID costs. The net result in sequential changes will be expected flow through margins in the mid 60s, inclusive of the seasonal utility increase and mid 70s normalizing for the seasonality of utility costs.  Turning to capital market activity. In June, we expanded our existing unsecured credit facility to $4.7 billion after closing on a $4 billion unsecured revolving line of credit which replaced our previous $3 billion revolver. Revolving facility bears interest and LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points representing a five basis point improvement from pricing under our previous revolver. The facility was supported by 31 incumbent and new banks and highlights the incredible support of our banking partners. On June 28, we completed the issuance of $500 million for senior unsecured notes due January 2029. Bearing interest at 2.05%. Proceeds from the offering were used to pay down borrowings in our revolving line of credit, and to pay down the remaining balance of our COVID term loan put in place in April of 2020. Additionally, in the quarter, we extinguish $674 million of senior unsecured notes due 2023 using proceeds for March 25, 2021 bond issuance, improving our weighted average maturity across senior unsecured notes to 8.2 years. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to efficiently capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities. By utilizing our ATM program to fund those near term transactions, having sold 20.1 million shares to just beginning of the second quarter via forward sale agreement and the initial weighted average price of approximately $80 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.6 billion. Since the beginning of the year, we've sold a total of 22.3 million shares of common stock via forwards sale agreements which are expected to generate a total of $1.8 billion in proceeds of which 5 million shares were settled during the second quarter, resulting in $372 million in gross proceeds. And capital deployment opportunities continue to materialize. We'll look to fund those opportunities while maintaining ample liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. We ended the second quarter 6.8x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, 6.88x when adjusting out $5 million of HHS Funds received in the quarter. This HHS is adjusted in 2Q '21 leverage number represents a 0.25x decline from the prior quarter's 7.13x debt to EBITDA adjusted for HHS. Last quarter, I highlighted the impact of the recovery in senior housing fundamentals would have underlying EBITDA and cash flow based leverage metrics. We are encouraged to see this trend take shape as a 15% sequential improvement in EBITDA contribution from senior housing operating grow the entirety of the HHS adjusted improvement and debt to EBITDA. The total portfolio in occupancy sitting at 74.6% at quarter end, 12.6% below pre COVID levels and approximately 16.6% below peak levels achieved prior to last decade supply wave. We believe the stage is set for powerful EBITDA recovery as occupancy upside is a couple of margin expansion of a very depressed base. Lastly, moving to our third quarter outlook; last night we provide an outlook for the third quarter of net income attributed common stockholders per diluted share of $0.44 to $0.49 and normalize FFO per diluted share of $0.78 to $0.83. This guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS Funds or similar government programs in the UK and Canada. So in comparing it sequentially to our second quarter normalized FFO per share, it'd be better to use the as adjusted $0.77 per share number I mentioned earlier in my comments, which excludes data period benefits of both programs as well. On this comparison, the midpoint of our third quarter guidance $0.885 per share represents a $0.035 sequential increase from 2Q. The $0.035 increases comprised of a $0.03 per share increase from our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by an increase in sequential average occupancy and expected reduction in COVID costs. A $0.02 per share increase from strong net investment activity highlighted by the expected closing of the Holiday Senior Living portfolio during the third quarter, result in dilution from dispositions relating to our previously communicated reduction exposure to Genesis. And $0.05 increased NOI from recently converted development mainly two fully leased MOBs in Charlotte, North Carolina and Brooklyn. These increases are offset by $0.01 per share increase in sequential G&A driven mainly by new hires, and $0.01 dilution from share settled in the second quarter. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim. I wanted to conclude by expanding on a team that I mentioned before, we're engaged in two small transactions with two other REITs our sector, that are not material to any company that involved. We are buying a handful of assets in one transaction and selling a handful of assets in other transaction. Those dollars involved are too small to be mentioned on this call, but I bring them up as I think they reflect a new era of collaboration amongst public REIT. Both of these transactions which will result in favorable outcomes for all of our respective shareholders on a transactional basis. But what's important to focus is an emerging theme amongst public REIT, the life doesn't have to be a zero sum game. With that the operator we will open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Morgan Stanley. VikramMalhotra: Thanks so much and good morning, everyone. I guess Shankh and Tim. The one thing that sort of surprised me was the revPAR growth that you saw on a like for like basis. I think most people would have anticipated in this period of still occupancy recovering and low occupancy, there'll be more discounting. So I guess just on the expense side, two questions. One, did this surprise you? And what drove that? And second, if this revPAR continues into kind of the next few quarters, what does that say about sort of the margin and the cash flow recovery into '22? Thanks. ShankhMitra: Vikram, I'll try to take a stab at that. So did it surprise us? Yes, it did. If you think about last quarter call, I said despite all the noise of discounting another so when I said that our operators have a very special product and a very special value proposition that just they're not willing to discount. And but having said that, I didn't expect this kind of pricing strength yet. It was entirely driven by our highest end luxury product in coastal markets, as I said; do we expect it to continue? Yes, we do. In fact, we, as Tim pointed out in his prepared remarks; we expect that to accelerate into Q3. And so look, I mean, from the perspective of the stage is set by a very powerful recovery of margin and cash flow increase as we come through, but we're very, very excited about what's going on. And at the same time there's a lot of uncertainty, we're not in this for next quarter next month. This is a long term business. We're excited about what we're seeing. But most importantly, as Tim pointed out, we think that we're increasingly getting to a point that is really validating our belief that the business which is frankly, it was when we said this last year, around this time, that is validating our belief that the product is needed, and the consumers will be back and we're seeing that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer from Baird. AmandaSweitzer: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start with a quick clarification on your occupancy guidance. When think about your spot occupancy guidance versus where average occupancy will end up for the quarter, it looks like it might be a different setup from recent quarters, and average occupancy could actually end up exceeding spot occupancy in the third quarter. Is that the right way to think about it? TimMcHugh: That's correct, Amanda. The right way to think about is using about 1Q and 2Q. And the first quarter, because of the decline in occupancy, we saw that lasted for two and a half months of the quarter, we actually finished for spot occupancy was below average occupancy in 1Q, we have the opposite effect in 2Q where the increase typically in June has driven spot occupancy above average for the second quarter. So thinking about our spot occupancy, guidance to 190 basis points on kind of a spot basis and equates to 210 basis points on an average change from 2Q to 3Q. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. JoshuaDennerlein: Yes, good morning, everyone. Just kind of curious to hear about your MOB pipeline. And then just aspect how there are other sharpshooters out there you'd be interested in working with? ShankhMitra: Josh, thank you for that question. And our MOB pipeline, if you're asking about acquisition, that pipeline is zero. And if you're asking about development pipeline, it's actually a million plus square feet fully leased, 100% leased pipeline, we continue to believe that the pricing that we're seeing in MOB market doesn't make any sense of our long term perspective. So we remain out of the market. We did this transaction specifically, because we see a very significant growth opportunity with Chris and his team. And are we willing to partner with more sharp -- local sharp protests? Absolutely, yes. But it\u2019s purely on a transactional basis. We have not a lot of interest in that space right now. We think what we are seeing the opportunity to flood capital and make significant amount of return for our shareholders in the senior housing space is compelling. And that's where the capital deployment opportunities in the near term will be focused on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. SteveSakwa: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Shankh, I was just wondering if you could talk about what your operator policies are with respect of activation. So there's been a lot written about healthcare workers, so some not wanting to get it. And I just wonder, does this create any kind of hang up in terms of move in or when you're marketing assets, so maybe just kind of provide around the horn or kind of broad update on kind of where your operator stand and whether you've seen any issues? TimMcHugh: Yes, Steve, it certainly differs across operators. I'd say as far as the question around, hang up and move ins, the effectiveness of the vaccine and the lack of cases we've seen in the buildings across all three of our geographies, this point is really prompt the marketing around the operator policies. That being said, a large majority of our employees, the property level are vaccinated along with 90%, upper 90% of our residents. So the highly vaccinated at a facility environment across the board. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. MichaelCarroll: Yes. Thanks. I wanted to go back to the revPAR growth. I know that your operators have done a good job driving modest growth, even at these occupancy levels. I mean, how does this dynamic change when occupancy gets back to the high 80% range? I guess I'm trying to understand how much does this rate growth vary, I mean are changes generally more muted both on the downside or upside? Or can we expect the total portfolio to generate significantly stronger revPAR growth once occupancy comes back to stabilization? ShankhMitra: Mike, that's a very, very good question. Now you're asking me to speculate. So I will speculate, but it's speculation nonetheless but if you think about the occupancy as we get back, sort of to the more stabilized occupancy level, you just call it high 80%, I think you will see significant pricing power, even above what you have seen sort of these quarters or this particular quarter, let me remind you through the supply cycle, sort of call it from '15 to '19, when our occupancy has gone down, we have still raise rate about 4%, right, in face of a supply cycle, which I expect the setup is completely different. This cycle or this decade forward where you have better demand and probably in a better environment for supply as well. So is it -- should we see once stabilization happens, greater pricing power, we absolutely should. But it remains to be seen, as I will tell you one of the things that we interestingly watch, is that very tight correlation of housing price appreciation, and pricing power in senior housing industry. And we have seen a significant increase in a record household sort of wealth growth. And that hasn't really translated so far into senior housing pricing. We probably starting to see some of that this quarter, but it will come through. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from SMBC. RichAnderson: Thanks. Good morning. So when you take into account the embedded NOI that you go through in the deck, and you hold everything else constant, you're kind of 50% shop and 20% senior housing adjusted for all of that, I know, that's not absolutely precision, but you're clearly focused on the senior housing business. And I know your thesis has always been your IRR investors and you think more about that than certain asset classes, but you're the REIT, senior housing REIT relative to your peers like it or not, at least for now. I'm curious as your underwriting deals and kind of tethering yourself to the business. What are you thinking about in terms of the next supply cycle? We've seen that to be the risk for this business in the past, lumber prices are coming back down. I'm wondering how you're underwriting the future for supply and how you're making sense of the growth in this side of the business. ShankhMitra: Thank you, Rich. That's a very, very good question. So we continue to believe as I said before, that you will see some supply but you will not see this cycle. We believe that supply will chase demand instead of demand chasing supply, like you've seen last decade if we see no supply, we have bigger issues, right, that says that we're the only people who actually see the business. Everybody else is missing, that's not how many is going to happen. But I wouldn't react to short term, high frequency data on these things. Because these data is obviously comes with a lot of errors and noises, the similar types of data that you have been supplied would have told you that occupancy for us for the quarter would be down with negative pricing, that clearly didn't happen.  So I wouldn't react too much to the high frequency data from one or two providers, I will tell you that forget about what others are doing. We are looking at a lot of development. And they're very, very hard to pencil; they are very hard to pencil, given feasibility rent remains between 20% and 30% below depending on different markets. And that just a question of how much rents have sort of cost has gone down, cost has gone up. And a high frequency indicator like lumber price on a Bloomberg screen doesn't tell you that it has changed significantly, you got to look at our long term average and people's ownership of that than sitting in the warehouse, and it hasn't shown up yet. Will it show up? Probably it will show up at some point. But that's it. At the same time, you're seeing a lot of other products, cost is going up, the country is significantly undersupplied on overall housing, and you will see housing starts will continue to go up with the demand of different materials. So I think that a lot of lessons have been learned on the bank side, losing a lot of money in this space, a lot of equity has lost a lot of money, clearly, you can see why we're buying new products at significantly below replacement cost. And the gap between where we're buying, call it $0.60 on the dollar and the $1 if somebody lost a lot of money, right. And so it was obviously these lessons will be remembered in the near term as the demographic catch on. But we are very much aware of what you are saying this is why we're so focused on price per unit. And that's why I made the point I made during my prepared remarks that we're not willing to buy anything and everything, even if we think it's a decent deal. Because in many cases, a lot of these things as a long term investor in the space, a lot of these things need to go right over a period of time for us, our shareholders to make money. And that's not the kind of investment I do make. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James. JonathanHughes: Hey, good morning. I do agree with Rich you are the seniors housing REIT, but I want to ask about the health system portfolio. And what happened to EBITDA coverage there. I see it's one and a quarter turns now from 1.9 last quarter. And then could you also maybe talk about exposure to operators at less than one times EBITDA coverage without naming names? Are there any ongoing discussions with operators for maybe the rate deferrals or transitions across your triple-net segments? Thank you. ShankhMitra: Thank you, Jonathan. So first, coverage came down for obvious reasons, right you are -- you're still remember the NOI has trough last quarter is still coming down right from an trailing four quarter basis is how you report coverages, which means the better quarters are getting out of numbers. And worst quarters are getting in the numbers due mostly speaking in a normalized in a stabilized environment, coverage should give you the state of the business at inflection points like this, where you've got sharp decrease and sharp increases, it will not give you the state of the business. There's just like our other offers that you're seeing in shop, part of the portfolio, the fundamentals have trough last quarter, and it's actually getting better. So for example, let's just talk about ProMedica. I don't want to get into this because frankly speaking for our investors, ProMedica overage is a huge element metric because as I told you before, that ProMedica rent is guaranteed by the health system, the mother ship at the top end, right. So it's really is irrelevant metric for our investors. However, having said that let me make some observations about that topic. The revenue if you think about versus second quarter was the highest actually for ProMedica for that specific business for [Indiscernible] was the highest in last five quarters. They have seen significant increase sequential increase in occupancy, just this quarter, about 400 basis points in that skilled nursing business. And you know what is going on is there is Midlock as we and ProMedica in Midlock selling a bunch of asset, right? And those asset base is going through -- has a negative EBITDA as I talked about before when we announced the deal, and that still flowing to the number and creating significant noise on the number side. So that is absolutely is sort of going to create a lot of issues. And also on the same side, you were seeing, we add a nine Powerback building that is getting integrated. So you have a lot of noise. I will tell you, let's take a step back and think about what the business is trending. Business as I said, the second quarter revenue was the highest actually in last five orders. Business is getting better. ProMedica team, senior care team is doing exactly what we laid it out that they will happen, which is you're creating new partnership with different system, we announced it, they announced a new partnership MetroHealth in Cleveland, there's another one they signed a joint venture, which I'm not at the liberty naming name right at this point is a premier system in the country, business is moving forward.  But as far as wealth of our shareholders are concerned that rent is guaranteed by the mother ship, which obviously is a very significant system with two plus billion dollars of cash and material in a $7 billion of revenue. So I don't want to get into that conversation. Remember, at this point in Jonathan, just not just talking about ProMedica but any triple-net leases will not reflect the state of the business because of the fourth quarter trailing nature of how we report coverages. From a standpoint of your second question, I think Tim touched on it. I will still say again, we have told you before that we believe that our leases are backed by material amount of credit and assets that we own in joint ventures and other assets owned by the operators, we do not believe there will be significant disruption of earnings and cash flow coming out of that. And our belief, that statement is getting stronger and stronger every day. That's how much I'm willing to talk about any specific operator at this call. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from J.P. Morgan. MikeMueller: Oh, hi. My question was just answered. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. JuanSanabria: Hi, thanks for the time. Just curious on the acquisition pipeline, you guys have done a tremendous amount of work and heavy lifting and kudos to you. But the markets always about what come next. So just curious on your views of what's in the pipeline going forward? And how long do you think you can take advantage of this COVID dislocation and for the deals that you're striking now, how should we think about when those were negotiated? I'm not sure you could talk to Holiday more broadly about when those deals were really struck versus just to think about that the runway for future discounted replacement cost opportunities. ShankhMitra: Thank you, Juan. I completely agree with you. It's about what comes next. That's the point I was trying to make on the coverage metric, right. It's the state of what's happening now. And what's happening next, not what happened yesterday. Having said that, I'll tell you, it's important to understand when we talk about acquisition. Unlike many companies, we don't talk about what's under contract, unless it is a very large transaction that shareholders should know about. The holidays are a good example. So the $4 billion or so of COVID class is transaction that we have closed, we could have given you a significantly higher number of the transaction we have taken our hands on. So pipeline, I know you understand that. But I wanted to make a very concerted effort to make that point again, because it's very different from how most other companies report their numbers. So the pipeline, let's just talk about pipeline, which is where we have shaken hands, we have agreed on a transaction and it is going through the process. Well, it's the transactions take long time to close, as you know we're pretty quick, we are quicker than probably most other organizations that you will meet but we're also extremely thorough, right? So it takes time, we visit every property that we buy. So it takes time. So let's just talk about that pipeline, which we define as something that's under contract that's visible. That is significant, and it's under contract. So we feel very, very good about continued momentum on the acquisition side. Let's talk about the shadow pipeline, which I define as something that we're negotiating right now, that is also significant and visible. And I think you will see continued acquisitions at very, very favorable price. As I said before, going forward, as I've said before, we're driven by value of acquisition, not volume of it, right. So as long as we can create value will continue to occur. And if we see that market prices are moved to a place where doesn't make sense, we will not. And for it could be a lip service, but you can look at our history. And you will see that we have exactly done that. We have moved with market pricing, and if market pricing and got into a place where we think it doesn't make sense, we sold assets. So near term, we see tremendous amount of opportunities by this -- all this disruption in the market. And we're seeing tremendous opportunity, because there are several operators, and developers want to join our platform to access the data that we talked about for several quarters on this call. So sum it all together. I'm very, very optimistic about capital deployment opportunities, at very attractive price in coming quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citi. NickJoseph: Thanks. Are you seeing any of your operators take additional pre emptive measures with a Delta variant? And then are you seeing any recent changes to state or local restrictions? TimMcHugh: Hi, Nick. Good question. We have not seen significant changes at state level restrictions and my comments in my script promote towards kind of the uncertainty around that going forward, there's obviously a lot of noise around kind of where things may change and where they've been the last, the most recent months. And the operator front our operators never, you think about sort of like a mask mandate, our operators never left the mask mandate. So you think about just the general facility and the way that they've been being run, there has not and likely will not be much of a change, depending on obviously the path of the virus, but to kind of what's going on in the general public last few months, because the operators continue to run a very safe, stringent environment when it comes to COVID. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. JordanSadler: Thanks, and Good morning, guys. So Shankh, I want to come back to your comment on moving swiftly. I know it's early, and the pandemic is not over. But your bet on seniors housing seems to be playing out better than expected. With occupancy improvements accelerating and now revPAR growth coming through, how is this impacting your underwriting of new investments? And even on the asset management side of the portfolio, how's it impacting your thinking? ShankhMitra: Thank you, Jordan. Look, I mean, when we made last year this bet for example, I'll tell you this is exactly your one year mark, when we first have started this discussion with Oakmont how to grow this business significantly, as a partnership yesterday marked exactly one year. But the times were scary, right? I mean, there's no question about it, occupancy was falling, like a rock EBITDA obviously was going down materially given on the high operating leverage in the business. But we had unwavering belief that the product is needed and that consumers will return, right? That doesn't mean that we knew for sure that will happen. That's the bet we made. And that bet actually made sense on a risk adjusted basis. And we talked about that, over last four calls. And I am very pleased that we recognized that bet seems to be playing up. So how is it changing? Look, at the end of the day, if you -- you have to think about real estate is a game of basis, right? No matter how good the environment is, or how bad the environment is, there's a floor and ceiling of value depending on what it costs to build. So we are not going to say that it's all clear. Things are fantastic.  Let's just pay prices that are above replacement cost and acquire as much asset because we can't because we have a cost of capital. That is not how we run this place. Cost to just, we have a cost of capital; our owners have given us a cost of capital, our bondholders have given us the cost of capital so that we can accrue value to our owners. Not because we want to accrue value to the sellers. And that is how we have always run this place and that is how will always run this place. There is no dearth of opportunity, we're not significantly changing our underwriting and frankly speaking we are basis investor, an IRR investor. So you might say okay, you're long term in 10 year IRR or 15 year IRR really hasn't changed, has your near term growth rates have changed? Yes, it has. But that doesn't translate into higher prices, because we're still solving for the same IRR. And we're still really focused on what the price per unit price per foot is. Hopefully that helps you to get a glimpse of how we underwrite. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. NickYulico: Thanks. Just going back to the senior housing guidance for the third quarter. Tim, I Know you talked about this earlier that it's a little bit hard to predict acceleration. But I guess I'm wondering how much did the July numbers sort of impact guidance, right? Because you're -- I think you said you're up 40 basis points so far, in July, as of last week. And I guess I'm just wondering is that sort of running a little bit slower than June, at the end of the day, June is a very strong month. So I guess we're just trying to figure out kind of the sequential movement on occupancy here, which was strong in June, and then July feels like it's slowed down a little bit, maybe you're putting in some conservatism about Delta Variant, et cetera. Maybe just if you can unpack that a little bit? TimMcHugh: Thanks Nick. That's great question. And thinking about that relative to, you look at the second quarter, as you pointed out, June was a very strong month. What we've seen coming into July is actually very consistent. Indicators like leads and interest in all kinds of leading indicators that were strong in June, it continued in July. The biggest difference at this point, we'll get into July 4, Holiday was a very low moving week, which is not surprising to us looking at June. So up 40, we're a bit more than 40 relative or sorry, in July, we're a bit more than 40 month a day, at this point in July, we were mid 50s. So we called 10 plus basis points, the line kind of where we were in June. And we're 10 to 15 basis points ahead of where we were in April in May. So we're continuing to see this improvement on a trended basis. We're trying not to read too much into kind of micro trends. So I don't think July start really plays a role in our conservatism. I think you mentioned at the end, uncertainly around Delta variant, and they said a much inability necessarily forecast given still unprecedented nature of the backdrop, drive a little bit of our view and how we give the guidance there, but doesn't have as much to do with the start in July. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lukas Hartwich from Green Street. LukasHartwich: Thanks. I have a question for John. I know you just joined the company. But I'm curious what your key priorities are out of the gate. JohnBurkart: Thank you. Yes, it's day 10. So my key priority is to seek first to understand aspect of things, very excited to be here. But those who know me know I don't give out my playbook. So definitely not doing that. But very excited to see a lot of opportunity. Amazing people here, Shankh is obviously amazing. And that's as much as I'm going to give you today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. DerekJohnston: Good morning, everyone. Just back to the capital deployment front. Are you changing or getting creative with the mix specifically in Show? How are you viewing Independent Living versus assisted living opportunities? And how do the valuations vary in the private markets for each segment or versus replacement costs today. And of course, Wells appetite for each. ShankhMitra: We're actually not changing the criteria; it is usually the replacement cost of assisted living for like for like, location is higher, sometimes significantly higher. But we always invest capital relative to what the replacement cost is, IRR targets are not different. I will tell you that we have a general propensity to go with a micro market with strong operators who have a stronghold on a product type. Going forward, as you think about I said this before, our portfolios has barbell approach, we want to be at a high price point high service areas, high service products in great barriers to high barriers to entry market, or we want to be on the lower sort of approachable end of lower price point, low service, right. That's kind of what our barbell approach is. And we have not changed that so there is a lot of creativity in the shop, but usually that's not around just a product selection that's around where you want to play in the capital structure high on the structure transaction that is not just one transaction and done.  For example, we like to build these growth vehicles that will continue to talk about this quarter we talked about Oakmont and aspect. But as you can see go back and look at five quarters ago or six quarters ago, we probably talked about Bremner organization. And you see, this quarter we started $100 million plus of MOB piece, right. So our job is not only to see, okay, where can we get that sort of the play, state of play right now, which is the devalue end of the play, but also create these growth vehicles that creates the interchanges that growth rate through the cycle, right. That's what we are focused on. And I'll be honest with you, Derek, I'm very, very proud of this team that has created I think this company will have unprecedented growth that will be unmatched in its history. And I think it is relatively understood the cyclical sort of bounce of that. But I think it is fairly misunderstood on what the cycle can look like. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky from Berenberg. ConnorSiversky: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for having me. Great quarter. A bit of an abstract question, maybe. So operating under the assumption that the target demographic for seniors has a lot of net worth tied up in home equity. If we were to potentially see a blip in the housing market, as prices maybe come off peaks, could that translate into some kind of transitory impacts on rate or revPAR? Or do you think the demand environment currently is strong enough to offset that kind of dynamic? ShankhMitra: If you believe that housing prices can come down 50%, which I think is how much it's up last few years, three to four years in many, many places, then yes, but also remember that you are talking about people who have bought their houses in the 80s and 90s, right, they're sitting on a significant amount of household sort of network, that should not impact. I will give you, go back and look at how assisted living has done senior housing in general has done in the -- during the global financial crisis, where you got a massive crash of housing prices, and see how the asset class has done. Just as a hint, I think that was senior housing was one of the best performing asset class through the global financial crisis through that housing bust. So that should give you some hint. I'm a student of history, every cycle is different. I'm not going to sit here and pontificate how much it might play out. But I will tell you that housing has an impact on many aspects of the economy. And it has a particular impact because senior housing is not an income place and assets play. And mostly it is housing type of an asset play, but remember, who is your customer? It's an 85 year old, and she's sitting on a house that probably she bought in 1988. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Capital One. DanielBernstein: Good morning, I guess this one to see if we could drill down a little bit into the Canadian asset leading indicators. I mean that has trailed a little bit and your numbers would have been even better than get posted if Canada had been performed. So just wanted to see if we could drill down a little bit on what's going on with the tours, leads some of those leading indicators on the Canadian senior sales. ShankhMitra: Okay, Dan, I mentioned this on my prepared remarks April, or May, we have seen that drag that you're talking about, really populated out in June, we've seen almost doubling up in person tours, et cetera in June, Canada, by and large opened up significantly in the beginning of July. So we are seeing that is starting to reflect and we expect that Canada will catch up, right. So sort of it's a drag today, but I would expect that you will see some significant sequential improvement in Canada. As we get through the rest of the year. Tim, you want to add anything on that? TimMcHugh: Yes, I've said in July, I've mentioned tours interest; we've seen actually tours and inquiries reach 2019 levels. So if we look at how the recovery occurred in the US, there was about a month lag and for between when we kind of saw that start to happen in February end of February when we started to see occupancy turn, not saying it'll follow the same pattern. But you've seen first kind of flattening of the decrease in occupancy. And then we've seen these leading indicators move. So we're certainly hopeful that we'll start to see those fundamentals turn here in the third quarter. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session and today's conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.

I'll walk you through our high-level business trends and capital allocation priorities. John Burkart, our COO, will walk you through the details, operating environment in SHO and MOB. Tim will walk you through the triple-net businesses, earnings guidance and capitalization. This is Jon's first call as he's beginning to dig into the business. So please go easy on him. Despite mediocre bottom-line results, we cannot be happier with the overall results of the quarter. Just 6 months ago, many industry participants and observers were cautioning if the COVID pandemic would result in apartment impairment of demand for senior housing.  And even most people who believe that the demand would come back were worried that with every surge of the virus, the business would take a significant step back. As it has been our experience that these surges drive revenue down, cost up, resulting in a significant hit to the bottom line. For the first time since the beginning of pandemic, we [Indiscernible] this trend. And despite witnessing a significant surge of the Delta variant after we spoke 3 months ago, we still posted the strongest sequential revenue growth in the Company's history. Occupancy went up 210 basis points in the quarter relative to our guidance of 190 basis points pre-Delta, and rate growth accelerated resulting in a 3.5% sequential increase in topline revenue across our same-store shop portfolio. Importantly, year-over-year revenue growth inflected positively in the U.S. and UK portfolio for the first time since the beginning of pandemic. This trend accelerated into September when we absorbed a year-over-year revenue increase for the entire portfolio led by U.S. and UK, which reported a year-over-year revenue growth over 2%. This is particularly impressive in context of a massive Delta surge. Let's reflect on why that might be the case. With nearly all resident vaccinated and stuff vaccination rates approaching 90%, which is substantially higher than general population, prospective residents and their families recognized that our communities are much safer environment than alternative settings. You can see that in our data. In the U.S., despite a tenfold increase in the daily case counts across U.S. in July and August, the number of cases within our short portfolio was just 10% of peak levels observed during the prior surges.  It's similar trend was experienced across our Canadian and UK portfolio for the -- over the same time. This helped us build significant topline momentum in our business as we received the dual benefit of occupancy and rate growth, which we believe will continue into next year. In fact, I believe this trend will meaningfully accelerate into next year as we feel significant momentum in the rate environment. Despite this great top-line performance, our bottom-line performance was mediocre and impacted by a perfect storm across the expense stack. We had a confluence of extraordinary costs, including agency labor as COVID surged, heightened R&M, insurance costs, utility costs, and other sundry costs, all hitting at the same time. There's also an extra day in the quarter which resulted in a mismatch of revenue and expenses as majority of our operators charge rent on a monthly basis. Additionally, we saw meaningful rise in paid time off as many of the employees took advantage of the easing travel restriction during the summer. The rise of COVID also resulted additional call-off from our team members at the last minute, which drove a significant spike in the use of agency lever, which costs 2X to 3X. This situation was further complicated by the vaccination mandate which the system is currently working through. The only good deals on the expense overall is that we began to see the situation normalized in October. While it is too early to comment on exactly how long it will take for the situation to fully normalize, we need to unpack what logically will stay with us in the medium to long term and what will dissipate. In our opinion, based way to increases are sticky and they will likely to be here as unit cost of labor. We firmly believe Welltower operating partners will be able to overcome this hurdle through rent increases as they offer a premium product within a premium micro-market. The alternative of one-on-one care just got significantly more expensive. We are beginning to see the green shoot emerge as operating partners have been -- have seen expansion of labor pool with supplemental unemployment benefits rolling off and children having gone back to school. John will provide more details on this topic. But we believe the usage of agency lever will dissipate going forward. Our guidance for Q4 will suggest that we do not expect this situation to completely reverse primarily because of 3 factors. 1. We have a mismatch of revenue growth and expense growth, as a significant portion of our annual increases happen on [Indiscernible] 1. 2. After you hire people, it takes an extended period of time to go through pre -employment and training process before new employees can hit the floor.  And 3. Delta wave, which peaked in late September, is still with us even in November. However, none of these has changed my view that Welltower stabilized shop margin post-COVID will be higher than that of pre -COVID margin. Even on a near-term basis, I do not believe the earnings power of this portfolio, 2022 exit run rate or 2023 run rate, has changed. I want to repeat that one more time. Even on near-term basis, I don't believe the earnings power of this portfolio's 2022 exit run rate or 2023 run rate has changed. The best operators will rise from these difficult times stronger with significant higher market share while many others will find this business too hard to figure out. We're engaged in, frankly, starkly different conversation with the management team of operators in this industry more broadly. While everyone is fatigued from the events of the past 18 months, many of our partners are watching with John to rethink how technology, operational excellence, revenue optimization, and data analytics can fundamentally change this business. Think of some very basic question, unit labor is going up, but how many units do we need? Price needs to go up, but how do you differentiate price on units with a view of Central Park versus a brick wall. Many operators within the industry are hoping things will get better on their own. Unfortunately, hope is not a great strategy. Our intense operational focus translates directly into our capital allocation strategy. Let me restate what that is. We want to own the right assets in the right micro market with the right operator focused on right equity and price point. And we want to own that asset at the right basis. Either we'll buy at a discount to replacement cost, or we'll build at extremely targeted way at replacement costs. While bidding [Indiscernible] are pretty thin, primarily with few first-time or relatively new capital, we remain extraordinarily active in off-market, privately negotiated transactions while we bring unmatched [Indiscernible] to close with operator and cash capital.  As most of this situation are debt maturity driven, nothing is more important to the seller than the certainty of close with a firm handshake. And as you know, our reputation is we don't negotiate, and we don't re-trade after we have a firm handshake. This approach has resulted in one of the most active quarter in the history of our Company. We closed $2 billion of investments at a significant discount to replacement costs with expected IRS in the high single-digit to low double-digit. We continued our momentum subsequent to the end of third quarter with another $1.3 billion transaction that we have signed the purchase and sale agreement, and that we have described in our press release. While they're all very important transaction, let me highlights the different flavors of the deal. We are excited about a $580 million transaction to buy 8 rental and 6 entrance fee communities in great micro markets. We would recall that we bought a handful of Sunrise CCRC from SNH in 2018. This transaction is very similar in asset quality and location standpoint but at a materially better price. And the previous owner has spent significant amount of capital over $50 million in the last 5 years. We should be able to achieve a high single-digit on levered IRR as our operating partner Watermark leases of the communities. However, we think we can post this return into double-digit on level IRR category as we execute a higher and better use strategy similar to what we have when we're embarking on our 85 Atria portfolio -- 85 property Atria portfolio. For example, there is an extraordinary piece of land in a highly desirable residential Corridor of Bellevue, Washington that is entitled for high density residential as of right.  We can build a great vertical campus of senior or wellness living there, or sell it to a multi-family developer. For many of these communities that access land, while we intend to build additional cottage size units which are already sold out in this location, you get the flavor. In a separate transaction, we bought five classes senior housing communities in Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic region with an extraordinary partner with an extraordinary operator and development group for a $172 million. The average age of these communities is 3 years. And we expect to generate a high single-digit on levered IRR. We also negotiated a long-term exclusive development contract with this team. I cannot wait to disclose the details of this group and our growth plan with them on the next call. But here is a teaser. This team has executed flawlessly even during this challenging Q3 without any agency lever. That gives you a sense of their operating prowess. In a similar vein to new building, we bought 3 brand new communities in the Midwest from a multi-family developer with new perspective, our existing operator. On average, these building are 2 years old. We feel our future pipeline is robust as we are on a 2-year line with several other granular transactions.  We are also building significant momentum around redevelopment and real estate value ad as John Burkart has executed strategy and ethic for over 2 decades. My team historically has focused on [Indiscernible] oriented value ad as we frankly didn't have the right experience after somewhat underwhelming experience from our Vintage transaction many years ago. Now with John and Mike Ferry, our Global Head of Development in one team, re-development and real estate value-add will be another avenue for growth going forward. Stay tune for more.  On the relationships side, I cannot be more pleased to announce that we started 2 new development projects with Kisco, the second phase of Cardinal and [Indiscernible]. Kisco is one of our best operators in our portfolio. Occupancy, incredibly bouncing already back to high nineties. I cannot be more proud to be partnering with Andy Kohlberg and his team to find a few more A-plus plus micro-markets while a Cardinal model will be fantastically successful. We signed a long-term exclusive development contract with Kisco and look forward to grow this partnership over next decade. From the success of these wonderful new addition to the exclusive pipeline agreements quarter-after-quarter, I hope that you, as our Investor, now share the same belief that we truly have built a deep and wide moat around a real estate business through predictive analytics platform that is unique and unprecedented in the real estate industry. With that, I will pass it on to John for a deep dive in operational trends. John. John Burkart : Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on the performance of our outpatient medical and seniors housing operating portfolio, starting with our outpatient medical. During the third quarter, our outpatient medical segment delivered 3.1% same-store revenue growth over the prior year's quarter, leading to same-store NOI growth of 3.4%. The increases were driven by increased property level expense recovery and a reduction in bad debt. Occupancy in our same-store portfolio ended the quarter at 94.7%, a 30-basis point reduction from the prior year's quarter. We continue to see record retention rates with the third quarter exceeding 90%. And with increasing construction costs in rising market rates, we will continue to push renewal rates and accept a reasonable level of increased turnover and related frictional vacancy as we strive to optimize top and bottom-line performance and maximize the value of the portfolio. Now, turning to our Senior Housing Operating portfolio. I'm pleased to report that year-over-year revenue growth in our SHO portfolio turned positive in September, marking the first monthly increase since the onset of COVID-19.  The strong demand-based recovery in seniors housing was led by our U.S. portfolio, which year-over-year revenue turned positive in August, and our UK portfolio, which turned positive in September. The occupancy recovery, an improvement in REVPOR, which began in Q1 reflect a needs-based nature of senior housing and a recognition that these communities are active, safe, and social, 3-key elements to quality senior living. The U.S. continues to lead the recovery, growing occupancy 600 basis points from the trough in mid-March through September 30th, followed by the UK at 540 basis points.  Our Canadian portfolio remains behind the U.S. and UK in the recovery, but posted an occupancy gain of basis points in the third quarter compared to a decline Q2. While the Delta variant has impacted staffing and related costs, it is clearly not slowed the demand driven recovery in occupancy and our operators ability to drive rate growth. Year-over-year, same store NOI for the show portfolio decreased 14.9% as compared to Q3, 2020, driven by 200 basis point decrease in the average occupancy and increased expenses, in part due to the Delta spike and related impact on staffing.  While still down versus last year, same store [Indiscernible] has improved markedly from the decline of 44% in the first quarter, a trend which should continue going forward. The increased labor cost during the quarter were driven by a host of macro factors, which led to temporary labor shortages affecting virtually all industries. The result was increased compensation in the form of wages, overtime, bonuses, and the use of agency labor as our operators have been squarely focused on both meeting the increased demand for their active safe and social communities, and a refusal to compromise on the quality of care. The use of agency labor, which can be 2 to 3 times more expensive than permanent employees was particularly impactful during the quarter as employees who had COVID, were exposed to COVID, or even had a cold had to call in sick, leaving agency staffing as the only option.  As Shankh alluded to, these extraordinary labor expenses are starting to abate. Although I expect we will still see some continued pressure for several months. I'm hearing green shoots as our operators are making comments such as, the peak labor challenge has passed, or we've seen a substantial pickup in applications, our new hires outnumber the employees leaving 2.5 to one, and even we're currently fully staffed at almost all of our communities. Going forward, obviously, I don't know how COVID will impact the economy. But we do know that the operators are increasing their rates substantially to cover the increased labor costs.  Similar to the multi-family business there can be timing issues or delay between expenses hitting the bottom line when the revenue flows through to the bottom line. We're seeing that right now with elevated maintenance expense, which in part relates to preparing units for occupancy due to increasing demand. Additionally, rental rates and care service reimbursements are typically adjusted annually and require 60 to 90 days\u2019 notice, similar to multi-family. Therefore, we continue to move forward -- therefore as we continue to move forward in this demand driven recovery, we expect to see the impact from these rate increases in 2022. Additionally, despite similar occupancy improvement across all states which grew early from the additionally, despite a similar occupancy improvement across all states, we've seen a divergence in the impact of agency expense between states which would view early from the federal unemployment programs versus those which maintained supplemental benefits through the early September. More specifically, states opting out of these programs early saw roughly 2/3 of the incremental sequential increase in agency expense as compared to those states which maintained supplemental benefits.  Finally, during the last 90 days, I've been fully immersed in the various aspects of Welltower senior housing business, including volunteering at sites, meeting with the leadership of various operators and, of course, [Indiscernible] numerous properties. My experience has been consistent with my expectations in that I have found that, the operators deliver a very high level of care to our residents and provide a top-quality living experience. While the focus on care has been and continues to be very high, I believe that similar to the multifamily industry 20 to 30 years ago, there was an opportunity to modernize our Seniors Housing business and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the operations. These efforts will further improve the resident experience, employee engagement, and the financial performance of these communities, including the potential for significant margin expansion. Without giving away my entire playbook, renovating and [Indiscernible] certain communities, implementing revenue management across the portfolio, and engaging in a digital transformation are just a few examples of what I'm thinking about. Being at the beginning of this coming demographic demand wave and seeing a ray of growth and optimization opportunities across all our businesses make this a very exciting time to be at Welltower. Now I will turn the call over to Tim. Tim Mchugh : Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2021 results, the performance of our Triple-net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, and finally, a Balance Sheet liquidity update in addition to our outlook for the fourth quarter. Welltower reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.42 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.80 per diluted share versus guidance of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. Turning to our triple-net lease portfolios.  As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported a quarter in arrears. So, these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6/30/2021. Importantly, our collection rate remained high in the third quarter, have reflected 92% of triple-net contractual rent due in the period across our senior housing triple-net and long-term post-acute portfolios. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI declined 80 basis points year-over-year. As a negative year-over-year impact of leases moving the cash recognition began to dissipate. We expect same-store NOI growth to turn positive next quarter. Trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.83 times. Looking forward, we expect coverages to bottom next quarter near current coverage levels before starting their recovery in Q1. Over the first 7 months of the recovery, we observed occupancy in EBITDA trends within our senior housing triple-net portfolio that are in line with our U.S. and UK operating portfolios. As these recovery trends have strengthened, the solvency risk of our operators has decreased in tandem, and our continued strong cash rent collection along with the value of the collateral that sits behind many of our lease agreements, continues to provide us confidence that Welltower's real estate position remains strong.  Next, our long-term [Indiscernible] portfolio generated -1% year-over-year same-store growth and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage of 1.25 times. In the quarter, we transitioned to 11 more Genesis assets new operators, bringing total year-to-date Genesis transitions to 48 properties. We also completed the disposition of 21 of these transition assets, bringing total year-to-date dispositions to 30 former Genesis assets, including our 9 Power back assets sold in the ProMedica joint venture in the second quarter. With another 14 scheduled for disposition in the coming months. Long-term post-acute in-place NOI concentration is now 5.4% of total portfolio in place NOI.  And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica senior care joint venture with a ProMedica Health System. We had same-store NOI with a positive 2.8% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.24 times. The drop in splinter coverage was driven largely by the timing of HHS stimulus. As the majority of HHS revenue received ProMedica was received in 2Q20, and this was not repeated in 2Q21. At HHS funds 2Q '21 EBITDA was up relative to 2Q '20. As revenue grew both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Our June trailing 12-month coverage also includes results of the previously announced sale of 25-assets held by the joint venture, 21 of which have already been sold to date with the remaining 4 expected to be completed in the coming months. These assets had contributed more than $30 million in negative EBITDA for the trailing 12-months period, ending 6/30/2021. And that their disposal alone will create considerable coverage accretion on a go-forward basis.  I'd also like to remind everyone that our lease is fully backed by a senior claim and the substantial real estate value held at the joint venture, and also the full corporate guarantee, the ProMedica Health System. Turning to capital market activity, we continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the Company to efficiently capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to fund those near-term transactions. Since the beginning of the third quarter, we sold 11.5 million shares via forward sale agreement, an initial weighted average price of approximately $84.36 per share for expected gross proceeds of $966 million. Since the beginning of the year, we have sold a total of 29.5 million shares of common stock via forward sale agreements, which are expected to generate total proceeds of $2.4 billion of which 12.7 million shares were settled during the third quarter, resulting in $1 billion of gross proceeds. At the end of the third -- of the quarter, we had approximately 11.8 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $1 billion.  When in the second quarter at 6.97 times net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA, up slightly from an HHS adjusted 6.88 times at the end of the last quarter. The uptick in leverage was apprised of $1.7 billion of net investment activity completed the quarter. If we run rate the impact of the investment activity completed in the quarter, pro forma net debt-to-EBITDA decreased to 6.82 times. As a reminder, we ended the quarter of approximately $1 million once sell equity raised on a forward basis, along with $f309 million expected disposition proceeds in loan payoffs.  Our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity profile, coupled with a recovery underway in our senior housing sector, have been recognized by S&P and Moody's with both rating agencies recently rating our credit outlook to stable. The upgrades validate the prudent measures Welltower's taken to mitigate risk through the pandemic and to appropriately capitalize our recent investment activity. On a forward-looking basis, as both Shankh and John noted, we continue to be pleased with the momentum of the recovery of the senior housing operating portfolio. With portfolio occupancy ending the quarter at 76.7%, 210 basis points higher than at the end of the prior quarter, but still over 1,000 basis points below pre -COVID levels. The portfolio also sets 1,400 basis points below peak occupancy levels achieved prior to last decade supply wave, setting stage for a powerful EBITDA recovery. As occupancy upside and strong rate growth is coupled with significant margin expansion of a very depressed base.  Lastly, moving to our fourth quarter outlook. Last night, we provide d an outlook for the fourth quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.20 to $0.25, and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. This guidance does not take into consideration any further HHS or similar government programs in the UK and Canada. So, in comparing it sequentially to our third quarter normalized FFO per share, it be better to use an as-adjusted $0.79 per share for 3Q, which excludes $5 million in out-of-period [Indiscernible] and benefits that we received in the quarter.  On this comparison, the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, C/8.5 represents a C/1.5 sequential increase from 3Q. This C/1.5 increase is composed of C/3.5 over accretion from strong investment activity in the third quarter and a sequential increase in Seniors Housing Operating Portfolio, NOI, driven by an expected 140 basis points increase in sequential average occupancy. Offset by $0.02 of dilution from increase sequential G&A, an increased share count from share settled in the third quarter. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim. I want to make 3 quick points before Q&A. First, despite our historic amount at capital deployment over the last few months, I'm very optimistic about the momentum into the year-end and next year. A recent prominent trend that we're starting to see that deals are bouncing back to us as buyers from buyers who need property-level financing as debt market has become very skittish after recent disruption from Delta and labor challenges while working on C3 such transaction right now. Second, with a significant rise of labor and other costs, operators are left with two choices if they were to survive as a business. Either to cut services at our corners or to increase prices.  We believe families understand from looking at prices of virtually all goods and services, from fast food to apartment rents, that there is an unprecedented upward pressure in cost. After speaking with vast majority of our operators, I can assure you that Welltower operating partners do not plan to diminish the level of services and care provided to our residents. So, for the industry in general, recent increase in expense, it would be difficult to continue to provide quality services without an appropriate balance in revenue. As such, rent levels will need to be increased.  The industry should not cut corners, and it should never lose focus on the quality of their services. Please remember the simple mantra that there is no mission without margin. Third, our frenzied pace of new hiring continues through the summer and fall for both early career as well as experienced professionals. In fact, we have added 125 new colleagues since the beginning of COVID, representing a 25% increase in our overall headcount. We're rounding up on our campus recruitment programs as we speak and are delighted that this year class will be the biggest in the history of the Company. With that operator, please open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. And as a reminder, to answer questions, you will need to press [Operator Instructions]. To withdraw a question, please press [Operator Instructions] We will be limiting questions to 1 question at a time. You will be muted as soon as you asks your question [Operator Instructions]. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Steve Sakwa : Thanks. Good morning. Shankh, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the occupancy trend that you're expecting into the fourth quarter. I realize that things are maybe seasonally slowing down as we move into the holidays, but I'm just wondering if the trends you've seen in October, into early part of November, what are sort of the risks that you see to hitting the guidance that you've put out there? Shankh Mitra : Steve, that's a really good question. Let's talk about -- if you look at the history, you will see sequentially from Q3 to Q4, we usually have 20 to 40 basis points of average occupancy growth. We guided 440. So, if occupancy is obviously up meaningfully from that number, we gave you, what we are trying to give you is get away from this monthly, weekly numbers. We've got to run a long-term Company. But we can tell you, if the occupancy stays flat from here to the end of the quarter, we'll still hit our number.  Now let's talk about the fundamentals, not about guidance. We have -- we are seeing unprecedented level of demand and sales environment that we have never seen even this late into the year. If you look at how our October sales trends have ended and then how November has started, this is truly unprecedented. Now are we -- how are we going to protect that through the holiday season. We're just not in the business of doing that. We're running a long-term business, but I can tell you the momentum that we feel in the sales trend, which obviously translate into -- October sales trends translate into November and December occupancy. We have never seen this kind of momentum. That's all I'm willing to say. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Amanda Sweitzer of Baird. Your line is open. Amanda Sweitzer : Thanks. Good morning. Can you help frame up how you're thinking about the potential magnitude of sharp price increases next year a bit more, either in terms of current implied loss to lease in the portfolio, or the pricing pre -owned that you expect the portfolio to achieve relative to the industry? Shankh Mitra : Amanda, we created a new slide in our slide deck. If you look at it, the inflation versus what we think our historic rate growth has been. Now remember that senior housing is not an income -driven sector, it's an asset -driven sector. Housing is obviously the primary 1, but the other things others too. That should frame what is possible from you. I will also tell you, just if you go back and read my prepared remarks, we talked about how there needs to be a price increase to offset labor increase. And you saw that that will also give you some bookends of what is possible.  Clearly, we know what the numbers are, because obviously you got to send letters 45, 60 days before, so we know what is being sent out. and the early feedback from some of our operators who have sustained obviously this entirely. And remember, we also have roles going through. Well, not the entire portfolio is [Indiscernible], so we have some early indications of as we have seen the spike of expenses and we have -- our operating partners have adjusted their pricing, how is that update, that what is behind my comment that I am very optimistic about pricing next year. But it is too early to comment. We'll talk about it in the February call. But I cannot emphasize it enough that we are very optimistic about the pricing increases. And frankly, the industry as a whole we need to do that if we need to make more revenue than expenses in this business. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of John Pelusi of Green Street. Your line is open. John Pelusi : Thanks. Maybe just one follow-up to that conversation there. Could you share what rent increases you're currently sending out today? Shankh Mitra : John, you're putting me in a pretty tough spot. I don't want to put a number out there, but I'm trying to avoid that. But if you look at the inflation versus rent chart that we provided, we intentionally provided that. If I were you, I would look at that. And then I would look at what that pricing power comes from, which is the housing and other asset rates and how people fund this expense. And you will get to a number, but I will tell you the industry overall, I just came back from the [Indiscernible] Conference. Industry is talking about substantial rate increases, not mediocre rating business. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph of Citi. Your line is open. Nick Joseph : Best operators will rise, just on expense, labor pressures. Are you saying that it across all of the operators? Is it across all geographies or are there any differences that you're seeing either from strategy or from location or any other factor? Shankh Mitra : We have seen it across the board, but of different magnitude. As I mentioned the new operator that we brought in in Q3, the $172 million transaction to use zero agency [Indiscernible] And we have seen some operators where contract labor costs has gone up 10x in 6 months. I want to repeat Nick, 10x in 6 months, right? So obviously, you have seen a very different experience depending on who the operator is, but I will tell you also, all these management teams are very focused on bringing that number down significantly. Our guidance, as Tim suggested, does not contemplate that you will see a step down in Q4, but we are already starting to hear -- as Jon said, we're already starting to hear that step down is taking place even in October going through November of the year. But we don't know what is going to happen in the holiday season. So, we're not going to sit here and speculate, right? Our goal is not to speculate on what's going to be a one-quarter number but go back to my comment, what I said, that stabilized margin of this portfolio -- I can talk about the industry. It is my firm belief that our margin will be higher than the pre-COVID margin on a stabilized basis. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Mike Mueller : Yeah. Hi. I was just curious, what's fourth-quarter guidance assumed for show labor cost trends? Any improvement whatsoever or just kind of a continuation of increased but on a full-quarter impact? Shankh Mitra : Mike, as I mentioned in the previous caution that Tim assumed that it will not improve. That's what's in the numbers of that we provided you. However, as I mentioned, that we are already starting to see improvement. The wild card here is how things play out in during the holiday season. We just don't know. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Juan Sanabria : Good morning. Just hoping you could talk to pricing for new customers in the market today. I recognize the intention is for the industry and for Welltower operators to push come [Indiscernible] 1 or on the 12-month anniversary. But curious how pricing trends are faring for new customers across the industry or across your portfolio. Shankh Mitra : Juan, exceptionally good question. It's actually my favorite topic. I like this topic more than even the rent increases. It is -- it's just I'm not going to mention any specific numbers. I will say -- let's just say that we're talking about X percent increase on average for the whole portfolio. From my operating partners, I'm hearing, the street level increase in the rate is between 1.5x to 2x. The Street is moving up faster than the renewal.  That's what I'm hearing from my operating partners. But we'll see how that plays out. This is a very interesting cycle that we're seeing. There has never been more focused on quality and safety. In previous cycles, if you have competed on, whether you are a new shiny penny on the corner or not, the cycle customers are focused on -- they've always focused on debt, but this cycle they're primarily focused on quality of services, quality of care, and the reputation of operators. They are not competing on price. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Derek Johnston : Hi, good morning. The $5.6 billion of investments over the past year really stands out, how much of this would you consider opportunistic driven by the pandemic, versus perhaps in a normal Welltower growth that would have happened anyway? And is this level of investment repeatable going forward? How much more capacity do you have to get through the investment process and take advantage of this market? Shankh Mitra : So, Derek, I do not give guidance on how much transaction one to do. We're not a volume-driven investor, we're value-driven investor, that's the first point. The $5.6 billion significantly understate what that investment volume is. Just to give you a simple example, that -- what the transaction that we have closed represent the $5.6 billion that you mentioned, 25,000 units. Let's just think about it what that means. 25,000 units we have done had a $172,000 value unit pricing. In a normal environment, that would have been $10, $11, $12 billion of transaction. That's -- we got to put that into perspective.  Second, the industry remains very fragmented, and there is a lot of churn going on in ownership as people are finding it either this is -- if you are in 3 different businesses and you don't want to be in this business anymore, we're seeing as data from a lot of families. The labor pressured, obviously COVID was hard enough. Now the labor pressure challenge rising from this. And last few months, we have seen those repeat transaction that we had conversation a month ago. You recall I mentioned that when we are not getting to the finish line on a transaction, that's not because that's going to somewhere else. It really means that they're not selling.  At that price, they're not selling. And now we're seeing a lot of people are giving -- really giving up. Now remember, they can give up because we bring an operator to the table. You will not sell your real estate and continue to run it. The reason you are selling real estate that you don't want to run it. So, putting all this together, as I said in my prepared remarks, despite a significant acquisition volume, I remain very optimistic that this trend of acquisition at these kind of prices will continue finally -- frankly longer than I thought. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Tayo Okusanya : Good morning, everyone. In your recent business update, as an interesting slide here, that shows your shop portfolio on the power of diversity. I'm just kind of curious. Shankh earlier on mentioned ultimately you expect the winners and losers and the senior housing space over the next few years. So that suggest that we start to see a little bit more concentration going forward across Acuity geography on operating model based on who you believe winners will be? Or should we still expect to see real diversification across Acuity and monthly rents with the idea being you just pick the best players at each point on this graph? Shankh Mitra : Thank you. Tayo, welcome back. Tayo Okusanya : Thank you. Shankh Mitra : First, you pick ed the right slide to talk about. We do believe that diversification will continue, but there is going to be significant consolidation in the industry. Let me give you an example. A pretty good example to talk about. One of our best operating partner is operating partner in Midwest, named StoryPoint. You've heard several times about how highly I think of this team. Before pandemic, we've got an [Indiscernible] offer at an incredible price.  So, we sold the 13 buildings we had with StoryPoint and kept 2 new developments that recently -- at that point, opened. So, a big partner we went from 13 to 2. That was 2 years ago. Today, with all the transactions that we have done and all the transaction that is in pipeline, in that 2 years, frankly, through the pandemic in the last 18 months, we are back to 50-plus communities with StoryPoint. That tells you how the winners and losers are changing in the business. The market share of great operators is changing, right? I'll give you another example. Look at how many assets Oakmont managed.  It\u2019s a great example of a fantastic operator. Look at how many assets Oakmont managed 12 months ago, 18 months ago. And make it note on your calendar to see how Oakmont become -- has become a dominant player in California today, 12 months from now, 24 months from now. Right? This is just an example I'm trying to give you. So, you will see that shift of winners and losers, you have seen some spectacular failure of senior housing operators in the business and I can tell you those are not the only ones that you know of Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Rich Hill : Hey, good morning, guys. Hey Shankh, you had a really interesting sliding deck about historical affect the revenue relative to inflation. And as I listen to you talk and listen to you saying that this is a different cycle in past, it does strike me that that maybe the outperformance versus inflation could be even higher this time. Could you maybe talk about that over the medium to long term and how you think about that? Shankh Mitra : Absolutely. First, welcome to our call. We're glad to hear from you. If you think about inflation, inflation and -- most people thinking about inflation is a matter of how much not just obviously the supply side, but also the demand side and the people's ability to pay. Generally speaking, inflation is an Income concept, which obviously, as we all know, that's for most types of products and services. Senior housing is different. Senior housing is not an income-driven sector. It's an asset -driven sector. Look at that asset inflation of what happened.  Obviously, we tried to put together some slides to give you some sense of what happened to the people who are funding the residences, these expense. And you will see that asset inflation has never been more significant, aka the affordability of the product has never been better. So, I think you are onto something. As I've tried to say without putting a number, putting those 2 slides should give you a context of how much rent increases is possible, not just near-term, but over a long period of time. And frankly speaking, as I said, if you think about, we have a Bargel strategy in our portfolio.  If you go back and look at the Q4 of 19 call, This is the last call before COVID that I talked about in detail of how this barbell strategy work, where you have a high touch, high service product in the coast, our coastal type market, where you can -- where labor costs can be fully recovered and still in margin to be made. On the other hand, other side of the barbell are one that's housing portfolio, there's no labor. We have gone to that, and that diversification, we have been very, very focused and very intentional. So, between the 2, you will see a very significant inflation plus growth that's coming. That will be funded obviously to the asset inflation that already has happened. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. I want to go back to the street rates answer that you provided earlier. I guess what's the reasoning that the seniors housing street rate growth is increasing at a faster clip than the renewal growth? Are street rates slower right now than those existing rates and it's just that gap's closing or is there something different there that I'm not thinking about? Shankh Mitra : So, Mike, if you have to think about total rate versus real estate rates, because usually a portion comes in at a say, X level of care and then that goes up to say X plus 2 level of care. So, you've got to have to obviously think about when you say street trade versus in-place trend, do you mean just the total rate or the real estate rate? The real estate rate, if you just call it the relative component of the rent is not -- the street rates are lower. It is just that the operators are realizing that they're not competing just on price.  They e have a quality product, and that quality product people know -- I don't hear from my operating partners people are coming that I want to stay down the lane for $500 less my operating partners, so you should go ahead and do that. We're not going to -- there's a cost to provide the services, the first-class services that we provide. That's just not going to happen that you will cut it. You're not going to stay at Wisconsin for Hilton Garden's price. Nothing wrong with any of those models but that's just not the model. Right?  So, the street rate are going up because you have demand. Look at the take, what we are seeing even this kind of late into the year when you should have -- seasonally, we should have come off and we haven't. So as operators gain momentum on the sales side, they're realizing that our special product, there's a cost, obviously, of serving that piece of occupancy. And we have to charge for it. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jordan Sadler : Thanks. Good morning. Shankh, I wanted to just talk about some of the new things we saw this quarter, heard on the call and a couple of things that popped out to me, where in the CCRCs that you purchased during the quarter, and then separately when I heard you talking about John, you mentioned the ability to do redevelopment and real estate value-add opportunities. So, could you expand on these 2 pieces? 1. Just the interest level in the -- our increased interest level in the entrance fee communities and the return profile for those types of assets? And then maybe what specifically, or maybe even generically, you're thinking in terms of redevelopment or value add dollars or opportunities. Shankh Mitra : Very good question, Jordan. And thank you for getting 2 questions through that first time on the line. So, I'll answer both, and I hope I can remember it. Let's just try first. It's not an increased level of interest in the CCRC communities, we are value-driven real-estate investors, we saw a tremendous opportunity because of the [Indiscernible]. So, if I'd give you some details, we bought that portfolio for $195,000 a unit, and in -- with remarkable dark. So, talk about Westchester, New York, Dana Point, California, Bellevue, Washington, Alexandria. That level, that kind of dark. And then we thought what we can do with the dark. Then I mentioned obviously there is an example of the asset came with a piece of parcel that is the last residential zoned piece of land in residentially Bellevue.  When we look at a lot of CCRC, we continue to -- we always have we continue to look at, it's just we never seen this opportunity where we can do more than what we buy, not just leasing up obviously what we've done, but also a lot more what that can be done with the dot -- with the client entitlement. That's why we're interested in. As I mentioned, I will give you details of what I think that it can go from a high-single-digit and unlevered IRR to a low double-digit unlevered IRR as we execute on this. And frankly, we bought it.  That's where most of our returns have been focused on. We continue to get, call it between 9% to 12%, 13% on levered IRR, mostly transaction we have done, and the return life right there. Focused on the real estate value-add, one of the big real estate value-add that this Company tried to do is Vintage. As you are well aware of the fact that hasn't played out well for us. As I went through the experience, I realized that we didn't have the right talent. It's much more difficult to do it than obviously we taught.  And we stopped that whole focus on real estate value ad in a traditional sense of the real estate. As you know, John has done this for billions of dollars of transactions and executed based on that strategy. So, when we're talking to John, going back a few months ago, that's something that came up and now, obviously, John is the marched into that portfolio, and he is obviously one of the most important member of our investment committee.  So those opportunities we're now ready to really expand on and really execute on. It also as to what I mentioned, that we have built an extraordinary development team over the last 18 months under the leadership of Mike Ferry. We brought in Mike over a year ago and he has built a very large team. And so those are all thoughts that are all coming together. But it's a skill set we didn't have, and now, we do have it. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of SMBC. Your line is open. Rich Anderson : I'm going after John Burkart here. So, John, welcome to the call. John Burkart : Thank you. Rich Anderson : The comments you made about some of the things that you want to apply to the business from your experience in multi-family, I just wanted to touch on a couple. I know you're not going to give away the secret sauce now, but revenue management and some of the multi-family tech initiatives that have been the name of the game in that business for a while now. isn't revenue management only as good as it's fully kind of used in the industry.  So, if you're using revenue management and no one else is, it's sort of not useless, but certainly not as effective. So how do you get the word out on using revenue management? How much is it being used in the industry? And then also in the tech initiatives, how much is that out there already -- There, I think you can make a real difference relative to your peers. I just wanted to see if I can get some color from you on those 2 topics. Thanks. John Burkart : Certainly. And it's Chalk would tell you got two questions is. Rich Anderson : Of course. John Burkart : On the revenue management, actually, I don't agree with you. I think it is operator related and it has really nothing to do with what the industry as a whole. It's an individual, how you price the units, but more than that and more than even the software, And this gets into really one of the wonderful things here is leveraging our data analytics platform, because what you have to do is you have to price the units right on the amenity pricing -- the base pricing, which is not just about changing the price over time, it's about pricing the base price correctly, the relationships between 1's and 2's, the values of certain units -- those with views, those without, etc.  And looking at a portfolio, you just can't possibly do that 1 person, 10 people, 20 people, and get it right. But let leveraging the data analytics platform and go back in time and look at how the market has priced it. That's a different, that's a game changer. And that's what we're working on right now is, I'm partnered up with our data analytics platform to go back and look at our units, look, and understand how the market's price.  That I can tell you in one particular case, we looked and saw on a high-rise substantial variations in demand versus pricing. We're talking in some cases, a $1,000 a unit. Really dramatic change in how we're going to price that product based upon what the market has told us. We'll take that and then we'll add on top of that some other software that will ultimately create to price the unit. Super excited about that.  And the second question was -- this technology was your second question, tremendous opportunities. No question about it. I won't go into the details here. I don't want to give that away. But yes, there are tremendous opportunities to really improve the customer experience, but also to reduce the labor. And of course, that's a big component by just applying existing technology into the business that hasn't been used in the past. So very excited about that. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nick Yulico : Thanks. I just wanted to go back to the expense topic and how to think about labor because it was up 4% year-over-year in the third quarter, the occupancy was down a bit. So maybe that's an unusual relationship, but just trying to understand how we should think about labor expenses going forward because it doesn't seem like that is the pressure that's going to abate anytime soon. I mean, you talked about agency labor.  Maybe, I'm a little bit confused why that use of agency labor would be reduced going forward if it's still a challenging time to be hiring people. And maybe you can just go to triangulate how you guys are thinking about labor when you talk about Shankh, your comment that shop margin will be higher than that of pre-COVID. Eventually, you give IRR calculations, which assumed something presumably about margin, labor, expenses. Maybe you can just give us a feel for how you guys are really underwriting labor as an expense going forward. Shankh Mitra : Fantastic. I would highly recommend you go back and read the script, and you will see that we have detailed that out in our prepared remarks as well as in the other -- answering other questions. But I'll try to summarize it. First, you have to understand the confluence of factors having. Just purely focused on the labor side in the quarter. You people didn't travel for 18 months. And then that's the first time you've got a lot of PTOs being taken and that what caused a very significant demand because our operators provide PTOs, right? So, you've got a significant surge of that.  That's sort of understands our one aspect of what happens, 2), you got one extra day in the quarter. You get paid by obviously daily basis, but you get revenue in most cases on a monthly basis, that's second point. Third, you have to understand that when -- because of the rise of COVID, people are extra cautious. There's a reason there is no COVID in the communities. You've got sniffles and you called in and you should have called in.  But at that last moment look at the spike of the COVID through the quarter, majority of the we got obviously problems in July, but then we got a massive spike as you followed the COVID curve through August and September. We're on the other side of that, right? That's why if you put all of this together then obviously follow the opt-in state versus opt-out state comment that John made. You'll understand it's not a question of optimism, we're actually seeing it. That we're on the other end of it. But only time will say, obviously how that exactly plays out, how much time that takes. But if you follow all these comments that we made, you can put together that picture pretty clearly. Nice, I would just add, if you look that compensation was Basis points year-over-year. So, to your point, occupancy a bit down still seeing compensation cost up, there is real base wage inflation. But the driver of that 4.1% year-over-year expense growth, the lion's share of it is being driven by agency. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time and that does conclude our conference call. You may now disconnect. Shankh Mitra : Thank you.",

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today to Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead. Matt McQueen : Thank you and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurance that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that I'll hand the call over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt and good morning everyone. I'll review the quarter, reflect back on 2021 on this year-end call, walk you through high-level business trends, and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on the operational environment for show and MOB portfolios and Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights, and first quarter guidance. 2021 was a year marked by high conviction capital deployment, partner and talent acquisition, and a powerful inflection in our senior housing business. Our belief in the long-term demand thesis for the senior housing proved out as we witnessed significant occupancy growth starting in the spring of last year which continued through the historically seasonally weak winter season. Just as importantly, in the second half of 2021, we began to see a significant shift in the pricing power. Interestingly, we found these pricing power during a period of relatively low occupancy levels. After all what industry or asset class do you know of that is able to achieve pricing power with occupancy levels in the low 70% range. Low behold that pricing power continued to strengthen in Q4 and in the first quarter of this year despite the impact of Delta and Omicron. Same-store RevPAR grew 3.4% in Q4 falling year-over-year same-store revenue growth of 4.8% one of the strongest quarter in the company's history. And even more encouraging is the revenue growth in US exceeded 6% with the momentum accelerating through fourth quarter. John will walk you through the details in a moment. Though I am not happy with our soft par bottom-line results due to increased expenses mainly from the Omicron induced labor crisis, I continue to believe we will see significant improvement throughout the year given the continued net hiring trends we're seeing from our operating partners. This assumes we don't experience a highly infectious variant. We can offset the higher cost of full-time employees just as we have done during the years prior to COVID, it is a significant presence of contract labor at search pricing level that is a source of the issue. From a demand standpoint, we saw record interest in our product in Q4 that continued through January with inquiries up significantly from December. However, a meaningful number of tours got canceled or postponed as either the prospective resident or their family got COVID or a community that did not have enough employees to conduct the tour as there was a COVID crisis in the communities. However, the tours have picked up meaningfully in recent weeks and we are starting to see strong sales activity, which should translate into higher net move-ins in next three to four weeks. If we are right about this, you may see occupancy growth exceed seasonal trends, while occurring in an environment of strong rate growth. We project this will put us into the double-digit NOI growth range in Q1 only to accelerate further throughout the year. As disappointed as I am about the diminished bottom line flow-through in Q4, due to $30 million of agency costs compared to only $5 million in Q1 of last year, I continue to believe that our 2022 exit run rate and 2023 earnings power of this platform is unchanged. Moving to capital allocation. In 2021, we deployed $5.7 billion across great real estate, with fantastic operator and at even a better price. The most incredible aspect of this story was the granular nature of execution with a median transaction size of $26 million. We're not believers in elephant hunting, as larger transactions usually result in value accruing to the seller. As you know, we manage this company for our long-term shareholders to increase our share value. Q4 was no exception to this consistent trend. We have deployed $1.4 billion of capital in Q4 across 20 separate transactions with a median size of $24 million. I won't bore you with the details of every transaction, but I would be remiss not to mention a couple of them, which I'm particularly proud of, including a handful of trophy buildings in Boston and Florida at a very attractive basis. But perhaps the most exciting investment of the quarter was the formation of our partnership with Andy and Glynn at Quality Senior Living, or QSL. It is hard to overstate how strong of a team, Andy and Glynn have built from conceptualization of the product, to development execution and ultimately their operational excellence. For example, despite all the labor challenges that I've highlighted, QSL have used virtually no agency labor and their buildings are well occupied. Andy who is one of the biggest users of our data analytics platform is embarking on a multi-year effort to expand the Blake brand with the full support of our platform behind him. I hope you are seeing a pattern here with how our data and predictive analytics platform attracts some of the best people in the business, as we offer so much more than capital. This network effect of platform execution across multi-year partnership that were formed over the last few years will fuel our growth for years to come. As Delta and Omicron induce challenges, we had that ugly head in Q4, capital deployment opportunity set only expanded and that continued in Q1, which is seasonally the weakest quarter from a deal activity. With -- after a strong close of 2021, we have already closed an approximately $600 million of the investment over the last six weeks. And I'm pleased to report that our pipeline remains robust, highly visible and actionable. While the capital market backdrops remain volatile of late driven primarily by the Fed headlines, we're well positioned to fund our pipeline with well over $1 billion of equity and availability of liquidity in excess of $4 billion. We're proud of our capital allocation track record both deployment and sourcing. But if capital markets volatility continues, we will access different tools from our toolbox, as we have done before. Lastly, I'm very proud to announce our new partnership with Reuben Brothers, which is buying Avery Healthcare, one of our largest operating partner. Rubin Brothers founded by David and Simon Rubin is one of the largest family offices in the world and is the owner of prime real estate and infrastructure both in UK and globally. There are also a pioneer of investing in alternative real estate and infrastructure as an early investor and owner of Global Switch. Rubin Brothers share our optimism for the exceptional growth trajectory for health care and wellness infrastructure as society ages. We're particularly excited about the prospect of expanding the platform together as Rubin Brothers owns some of the most prime land and real estate in the UK. Tim and I have said on this call many times that temporary degradation of cash flow doesn't necessarily mean the extraction of value, Avery, which constitutes 16% of our same-store triple net NOI will be significantly delevered through this equity infusion from Rubin Brothers. Partnering with highly sophisticated global investors like Rubin Brothers validates our view of the long-term value of this business despite Wall Street's obsession with point-to-time coverage. In conclusion, I'm very proud to -- of our execution in 2021 across operations, capital allocation and partnership. The stage is set for multiyear earnings growth as we find ourselves at the bottom of both secular and cyclical cycles with unparalleled platform built with advanced data analytics 20 or so growth vehicles with different partners and talent to execute on it. The pandemic has been devastating for our entire ecosystem, but we have doubled down during this massive disruption given our high conviction investment thesis. You as our shareholders can rest assured that we'll not be resting on our laurels and that will continue to dig deeper and wider moat. With that, I'll pass it over to John. John? John Burkart : Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will focus on the performance of our management operating segments in the quarter. Starting with our medical office portfolio. In the fourth quarter, our outpatient medical segment delivered 2.4% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, despite a 20 basis point decline in occupancy. We continue to see strong retention rates at 86% in the fourth quarter and with increasing construction costs and rising market rates, we will continue to push renewal rates in exchange and accept the reasonable level of increased turnover and related frictional vacancy as we maximize the value of the portfolio. Now turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. The strong demand-based recovery in the senior housing business continues to strengthen. The show portfolio same-store revenue increased 4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing the first full period of year-over-year same-store revenue growth since the beginning of the pandemic. Occupancy grew 90 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Again, the first year-over-year increase in occupancy since the beginning of the pandemic and the largest year-over-year gain for any quarter since 2016. Sequentially, the show portfolio spot occupancy increased approximately 70 basis points during the fourth quarter to 77.7%. Compounding these strong occupancy trends is a notable shift in pricing power. Over the second half of the year, operators have successfully raised and are again able to charge community raised rates and are again able to charge community fees, both of which were reflected in a 3.4% year-over-year increase in RevPAR during the quarter. And following, an outsized increases on January and February renewals with little to no pushback we expect further acceleration in RevPAR growth over the course of the year. Geographically, each of our markets Canada, the UK, and the US are showing improvement in same-store top line metrics through the quarter. Our Canadian portfolio, which has lagged the recovery, posted a year-over-year revenue decline of 3% in Q4 2021. However, the revenue decline improved intra-quarter moving from a decline of 4.2% in October 2021, to a decline of 1.4% in December 2021, compared to the prior year's respective months. Sequentially, the Canadian same-store portfolio grew at a revenue rate of 1.8% in the fourth quarter. In the UK, our same-store revenue increased 7.8% during the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, accelerating from 7.1% growth in October of 2021 to 9% in December of 2021, compared to the prior year's respective months. Finally, in the US, where the majority of our portfolio is located, year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 6.3%. The acceleration in revenue growth was particularly pronounced in the US, accelerating from 3.8% in October 2021, versus the prior year's month to 9.1% in December. Despite these encouraging top line trends, expenses increased 8.8% year-over-year driven largely by excessive agency cost. The combination of holiday time off and Omicron disruption led to an increase in agency costs in the quarter, almost 4.5 times agency expense versus the prior year's quarter. Excluding agency costs, expenses increased 5.3%. Stress and Systems highlights opportunities and issues and the extreme stress in the health care system brought on by COVID has identified some opportunities to improve the value proposition for our hard-working health care workers. The agencies have been a temporary crush, which will provide a short-term option for both operators and the health care workers. That said, the excessive use of agencies is truly short term in nature, and the exceptional premiums that they charge as much as six times, the base rate during the recent holiday period do not pass through to the agency employees, who typically do not receive benefits either. The quality of life and their work experience is substantially less desirable than that of a permanent employee. Agency employees lack the connection to their coworkers, and customers that they desire as they travel from site to site, city to city, and state to state on a daily basis, often away from their families. Additionally, agency employees are less efficient, as they do not know the systems nor the processes of the operator or the site, nor the specific customer requirement. Our operators have many workflows underway at this time to improve the value proposition for permanent employees, which were bearing fruit prior to the Omicron. Nonetheless, the results of these outsized expenses was a decline in same-store NOI of 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, but still marked an improvement from Q3 2021, with over 50% of operators delivering positive NOI growth for the period. The recovery continues to strengthen despite recent Omicron disruption and we remain confident in our ability to drive significant NOI growth in 2022. Through January, agency labor expense has declined as staff cases have fallen. Agency labor expense is expected to moderate further through the first half of 2022 and declined substantially in the second half of 2022. The other disruption caused by Omicron was a record cancellation of tourists, which Sean described. However, at this point, weekly staff cases are down 81% from their peak including an 89% drop in the US and we are seeing operations normalize. The disruption of tours and sales caused occupancy to fall about 20 basis points in January. However with the high level of traffic, we expect that the continued occupancy gains will return and that we will regain lost occupancy by the end of the quarter. Here are some quotes from our operators about the strength of traffic and deposits. \u201cDigital inquiries were up 36% over 2019 in the fourth quarter and continued strong in January\u201d. And \u201cour four-week averages for inquiries tours and deposits are the highest they've been since August of 2021, we are seeing week-over-week growth in deposits of 10%, the last four weeks running\u201d. We are experiencing the strongest January for inquiries in several years. And finally \u201cour inquiries from the last week alone have been the highest numbers we've ever experienced\u201d. In closing, I have shifted from full immersion in the business to planning in action. I'm even more excited about the future opportunities across the Welltower platform. We are leveraging our proprietary data analytics platform and operationalizing the data to drive results. This process is occurring right now as we have several workflows underway, which we expect to bear fruit in the immediate future as well as many more workflows that we expect to drive our outperformance in the quarters and years to come. I continue to be appreciative of the warm welcome and excitement expressed by our operators as we leverage our combined real estate operating company and care experience to improve the customer and employee experience and drive financial results. Each operator has a unique expertise and opportunities. We have been working very well together and offering support where needed from implementing best practices to applying data analytics to improve their business. In one case, we identified a software tool over 25 years old. As they say, the '90s called and they want their deeper back. I'm confident there is a substantial opportunity to implement operational excellence across the board and bringing the basic back office and sales operations up to match the high quality of care the operators are delivering, which will drive significant margin growth in the years to come. I'll now turn the call over to Tim. Tim McHugh : Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter 2021 results. Performance of our triple-net investment segment in the quarter, our capital activity, our balance sheet and liquidity update and finally our outlook for the first quarter. Welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of a $0.13 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.83 per diluted share, relative to the guidance of $0.78 to $0.83 per share. Our results included approximately $18 million or $0.04 per diluted share of HHS funds and other out-of-period government grants that were not previously budgeted. Turning to our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months at 9/30/2021. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 4.2% year-over-year, driven by improvements in rent collections, on leases currently on cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI. We expect the impact of both these trends to accelerate in 2022. As rent collections improve given that 20% of our leases are subject to API-based escalators. Trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.8x. Looking forward we expect coverages to inflect positively in the first half of 2022 as year-over-year improvement in fundamentals followed the positive trends expected in our senior housing operating portfolio. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 0.8% year-over-year same-store NOI growth. However similar to our senior housing triple net portfolio we expect NOI growth to improve in 2022 through greater rent collections on leases currently in cash recognition as well as CPI-based rent escalators. Trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.29x. Over the course of 2021 we completed $458 million of long-term post-acute dispositions at a blended cap rate of 8.7%. With an additional $108 million under contract for sale at year-end. As a result, our long-term post-acute portfolio represented just 5.2% of total in-place NOI at year-end versus 10.1% at the end of 2020. A 490 basis point decline driven largely by the exit of our Genesis relationship. And lastly health systems which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with ProMedica Health System. Had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.39x. The sequential improvement in coverage was driven by the previously announced agreement to sell 25 assets that have been contributing negative EBITDA. As of year-end we completed the sale of 2021 of those assets with the remaining four held for sale. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to capitalize our robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to fund those near-term transactions. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, we've sold 11.3 million shares via forward sale agreements at an initial weighted average price $85.06 per share for expected gross proceeds of $961 million. We currently have approximately 11.1 million shares remaining unsettled which are expected to generate future proceeds of $949 million. This is in addition to $220 million of expected property disposition and loan payoff proceeds. During the quarter we also issued $500 million of 10-year unsecured debt maturing in 2032 with a coupon of 2.75%. Following similar discipline in their equity funding strategy this is our third unsecured issuance in 2021, bringing full year issuance to $1.75 billion with an average ratio of 9.5 years and a coupon of 2.6%. At year-end when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. When combined with the previously mentioned $1.2 billion of combined unsettled ATM proceeds and expected disposition proceeds we are in a very strong liquidity position heading into 2022. We ended the fourth quarter with 6.95x net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA down slightly from last quarter. Leverage is impacted by the timing of $1.5 billion of net investment activity completed later in the quarter. If we run rate the impact of net investment activity completed in the quarter pro forma net debt to adjusted EBITDA decreased to 6.75x. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of our top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio with portfolio spot occupancy ending the quarter at 77.7%, 70 basis points higher than the end of the prior quarter, but still 950 basis points below pre-COVID levels. The portfolio also sits 1300 basis points below peak occupancy levels. Setting the stage for a powerful EBITDA recovery as occupancy upside and strong rate growth is coupled with significant margin expansion of a very depressed base. Lastly, moving to our first quarter outlook. Last night we provided an outlook for the first quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0.17 to $0.22 per share and normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.79 to $0.84, or $0.815 at the midpoint. This guidance takes into consideration approximately $6 million or $0.015 per share of HHS funds expected to be received in the first quarter. Excluding the HHS funds, the $0.80 per share midpoint of our first quarter guidance represents a $0.015 sequential increase from an as adjusted $0.785 per share number for 4Q, which excludes $18 million of previously recognized HHS and out-of-period U.K. and Canadian subsidies recognized in the quarter. This $0.015 increase is composed of $0.025 from a sequential increase in senior housing operating portfolio NOI and fourth quarter investment activity and an offset of $0.01 increase of sequential G&A and income taxes. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated first quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store growth of 7%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 1% to 2% growth; long-term post-acute, 1% to 2%; health systems, 2.75%; senior housing triple-net, 5% to 6%; and finally senior housing operating growth of approximately 15%, driven by revenue growth of 10%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 420 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thanks, Tim. I wanted to conclude this call by addressing something that you -- we usually don't talk about and that is our comprehensive team. We have completed -- completely overhauled and upgraded our team and this was a multi-year effort building out new areas such as predictive analytics to create a truly scalable platform. With extremely low volunteer turnover, we continue to hire the best and the brightest to further deepen our capital allocation expertise. Historically, the majority of the alpha we created have been through astute raising or deployment of capital. Over the last 15 months, though, we have also built out an industry-leading and, frankly, a very significant development team under the leadership of Mike Ferry and Ayesha Menon. The last piece of this puzzle is building out our operational excellence and asset management capabilities. This started with the hiring of John in 2021. John is building out a world-class team that will accelerate value creation for our shareholders for years to come. We have added a net 51 people last year and we're likely to add another 80 new colleagues in 2022. Many of you who follow our company closely understand that our asset platform is like a coil spring today. We spent heavily during the pandemic, but most of these assets are sitting with low occupancy and thus cash flow, which is about to be released and surge forward to realize its full value. Similarly the people side of our business platform is also a coil spring today. You are only seeing them in G&A line, but their full contribution to the revenue line will be seen in 2023 and beyond. With that, operator, please open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jonathan Hughes : Hey good morning. I wanted to ask about the quality of the operator relationships in the pipeline or maybe generally out there in the seniors housing industry. I'm just wondering what the landscape looks like after a couple of years of pandemic-related headwinds. I know you have a few in progress and you've had success with several over the past few years. But how many high-quality operators remain as an opportunity that you don't already have a relationship with? And what's the size of those individual opportunities? Are they smaller or larger in terms of investment volume than the relationships established over the past few years? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Fantastic question Jonathan. As I said right now I can think of two operators that in US particularly -- this is a US-specific comment and they'll probably be the same for UK and Canada, that I can think of two specific operators that we don't have relationship today that I want to have a relationship. One of them we already have had shaken our hands this quarter and likely probably we're going to talk about it next quarter's call. So, what you are likely to see that means is we generally have the operator base the platform that we wanted to build. You would recall that before pandemic we talked about with you that we have a map, right? And in that map we have different ideas of where the different types of acuities of assets should be and what kind of operator should be running those, right? We kind of generally feel out that map. Now, what you're going to see we're going to go deep. Instead of going broad which you have seen over the last, call it 18 to 24 months, you're going to see us go very deep. And that sort of talks about -- we have a slide on our presentation you can see that we talked about give or take this 25 to 30 relationships across all asset classes not just senior housing, senior housing, medical office, and wireless housing. All three platforms that we are growing pretty significantly that we think creates a very significant opportunity of external and growth that we estimate could be an upwards of $2.5 billion, $3 billion a year for a decade to come. But that's sort of how we're thinking about it. It's going deep instead of going broad but we'll talk about hopefully another exceptional operator relationship next quarter. Jonathan Hughes : Thank you. Operator : I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Joseph from Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : Thanks. John you talked about the challenges with the staffing agency model. As you think about coming out of COVID, do you expect the business model or expense load to change to rely less on agency staffing, or is this more of a perfect storm where it's hard to actually change going forward to limit the use in times of crisis? John Burkart : Yes. No. Thank you, Nick. No, my expectation is that the business will at least get back to historical standards where agency was a small part of the whole picture just was an assistance piece. But frankly, with the workflows going on I think it's a very strong chance that agency diminishes even further because what has changed is the world has gone from a situation where there's an abundance of employees to a scarcity of employees. And so the employers now the good one to have recognized that fundamentally changed how they look at things. Recruiting has become a sales machine with KPIs for the recruiters, et cetera. The value proposition has changed dramatically. People are looking at what the employee experience is words that would never set employee experience you don't hear that. They're looking at that and they're trying to figure out how to optimize. So some changes that are going on are people are realizing like, hey, we should change your hours slightly for some employees, because they have to drop their children off at school. They can't work here, because of when we start not a big deal for us, move it an hour and it works perfectly for them. A lot of things like that are changing. So I think from my perspective, it's great for the hardworking health care employees. It will be great for the operators. And will further diminish the agencies. But it will take time for this to tail off, as I mentioned in my comments, so it won't happen overnight. But I think long run, run rate will be great. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks so much for taking the questions. So just a question on rent growth or RevPAR and margins, and just two parts to it. Just one in the strong pricing part, you're seeing can you talk about the mix between the in-place bumps and just the releasing, or the spreads you're seeing today and what your expectations are? And then on margins in your bridge it's \u2013 maybe this is not the right way to look at it, but in your bridge, it seems like you're embedding maybe a 60% to 70% incremental margin, it seems like it's reasonable. But how are you thinking about the incremental in the context of pricing power? John Burkart : Yeah. So I'm going to \u2013 on the \u2013 you managed to get two questions there and that was good. On the \u2013 on the re-leasing versus the market, clearly, net effective markets are up significantly. They were concessions and community fees that \u2013 well concessions that were given community fees that were waived that's all reversed itself. And so certainly, at one point if you go back in the industry, market rents were below in place that's now changing. And from an in-place perspective and overall the rents are moving up pretty significantly. Very consistent with the comments that Sean made previously, with the expectations of mid-5%s to 10% in that zone. What we're seeing is a lot of strength in the marketplace and a recognition that cost gap come up and it takes a certain amount of money to provide great care and that's what people want. Shankh Mitra : Vikram, to answer your second question, we are getting you back to the pre-COVID margin on that slide. I think you're referring to slide 17. There is no question that, if you have pricing power that will improve. But remember, you also have higher labor cost. So to the extent that, you have higher pricing power in excess of higher labor costs, you will see upside to that margin. But it is getting you back to margin Q4 of 2019 margin for the portfolio that was there in Q4 of 2019. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Derek Johnston : Hi, everyone. Good morning. So in 2021, you had $5.7 billion in gross investments. So off to a solid start here in 2022, so do you believe 2021 number is the high watermark? Is that level of acquisitions repeatable or even beatable this year? And has anything changed in your terms of your ability to source opportunities or even competition for deals since our last call? Shankh Mitra : Has anything changed? The answer is, yes. So if you think about, what we have been saying that, we are mostly focused on what we have been buying \u2013 as you can see the average age of those assets would indicate, they are the children of supply over cycle of 15 to 19, right? What you had is disruption from the revenue side because of all these variants. Then you had a disruption from the cost side because of our employee situation that we talk about. Something changed there, yes something has in the last call it 45 days. And that is what you didn't have is the pressure from financing cost. All construction loans are made on LIBOR, right? Pretty much all construction loans, a variable LIBOR-based loan. And obviously, if you look at the \u2013 how the outlook for Fed has changed over the last call it 45 to 60 days, you can imagine that third pressure is just about to come which is higher financing cost. So something has changed. And now going back is this a level of acquisition possible or beatable. The answer to that question is very simple. We're not a volume-driven investor. We're a value-driven investor. If the volume is there to create part share value we will do it. If not, we will not do it. That's just a simple how to allocate capital. The success of a team is not measured at least our team in our opinion is not the growth of the enterprise but part share value creation for existing shareholders. So as long as that opportunity is there we'll absolutely do it. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Steve Sakwa : Yes. Thanks. I guess I just wanted to circle back a little bit on the guidance just to make sure Tim I understood. In the 10%, I think revenue growth that you talked about for show. Again, what was occupancy and what was rent? And then what is included in the expense side from the elevated levels that you saw in Q4? Are you sort of assuming the same level in Q1 as Q4, or did you assume some moderation? Shankh Mitra : Yes. Thanks, Steve. So on the revenue side we're assuming 420 basis points of occupancy increase on a year-over-year basis driving that 10% revenue growth. So the remainder of that revenue growth is being driven by rate. And on the expense side, I think the best way to look at it is sequentially, we're talking a lot about agency labor. We are assuming a sequential reduction in agency labor about 10% from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in that pool. And that's supported by early trends we've seen in the quarter. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Rich Hill from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Rich Hill : Hi, good morning, guys. I recognize you're not giving a full year guide but I think back to 3Q 2021, there were some bread crumbs given on where renewals and maybe street rates are trending. Based upon my notes one of your competitors have talked about 8% renewals. And I think you had talked about 1.5 times to two times faster as the renewals for street rate. Wondering if you could just provide any updates on that as we think through what full year 2022 might look like? Shankh Mitra : Hey, Rich. John just talked about that. The street rate comments I made is a net effective rent. And you are seeing because obviously, the concessions that were given, the lack of community fees that you had, the effective net street rate is moving up because of that. Not necessarily, the pace is moving but the net effective rent is moving, we continue to see. In fact we have seen some \u2013 a couple of our operators have now moved street rate at Well [ph] In-Place rent, a couple of our very large operators have gotten much closer. So it's a pretty encouraging sort of it as we look in the future. Tim just walked you through at our 10% guidance, means, from a rate and occupancy perspective. And that sort of gives you the second answer to that question, right? So we are a shop. We're focused on ultimately optimization of revenue, not necessarily one component of the revenue. And on top of that you have to think about, one component of the revenue comes with higher cost, which is labor, right, if you just occupancy, which obviously rate doesn't. So we're trying to optimize all of those things together and that sort of blends to what we talked about which is a 10-ish percent revenue growth in Q1, 15% NOI growth in Q1, and that NOI growth should continue to accelerate as we get to the year for two reasons, right? One is, as you build occupancy, you will get obviously your marginal margin will expand obviously, right? So that's one point. Second, you will get a continuation of sort of burn-off of the agency labor that you got. So that's sort of two of these things together, you will get an acceleration of NOI growth as we get to the second half of the year. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Recognizing again you're not giving full year guidance to one of the larger operators in the space talked about 500 to 600 basis points of occupancy growth for the year as their target. So curious how you feel excluding any new COVID wave, how that feels to you particularly given seasonality is still apparent in the business. And typically you don't necessarily gain occupancy outside of the third quarter. So, just curious about your general commentary and targets for occupancy growth for the year. Shankh Mitra : Yes. So, first, you said the magic word, excluding any more new variants, right? So that's a very important what you mentioned there. And despite that I'm not going to venture a guess of what it will look like. I will tell you there are a couple of things to think about. Last year you got a massive disruption in Q1. You've got a significant occupancy loss, you started at a big hole and you had to climb up that hole to get to a point where on an average basis you can build out documents. So you don't have that problem this year, right? John talked about January, our occupancy from point to point is down 20 basis points, which is probably will make this January the best January we ever had seasonality perspective. So, you don't have a hole to climb out. Second, you have better demographics this year. You can see the demographics is building. So we have more demand there and that's sort of playing out for all the leads and other data that John disclosed on his script card, you have a significantly lower number of deliveries this year, right? So -- and then if you -- under your assumption if we don't get hit by four waves like we did last year, and hopefully, that will translate into better occupancy growth. I'm not going to comment on any specific operator or try to sort of venture a guess of what entire year is going to look like. However, the table is set. If all of these things we just discussed lay out, we'll see a better year. But we're long-term investors. We're not focused on how occupancy plays out this quarter versus that quarter, but we're pretty optimistic because of what the underlying trends we see in the marketplace. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Mueller : Yeah, hi. Just curious on the Watermark transaction, what was the pricing difference between I guess the entry fee assets versus the rental, just in terms of like a rough cap rate difference? Shankh Mitra : Mike, we're not going to get into a specific deal, let alone things within the specific deals, right? Obviously as you know how these things play out is that you sign a confidentiality agreement with the seller. We're not going to get into it. We have talked about I believe in the last call that what we like about that transaction is A, the price per unit was very attractive to us; B, some of the underlying land ultimately as you were thinking about real estate investment you have to think about the dart, exceptional dart; and three, we think there is value to be created because of what these assets are and the lands that come with it and what you can do with this only. With all of those three combined we're very excited about the portfolio we got, but we're not going to get into economics of a specific deal, let alone different parts of that deal. That just will put us in a significant violation of a confidential agreement that we have signed. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky from Berenberg. Please go ahead. Connor Siversky : Good morning out there. Thanks for having me on the call. I just want to keep this simple, focusing on senior housing in particular in consideration of the value-based investment approach. So in this positive environment for pricing, I mean, do you expect to see some cap rate compression this year on increased competition? And then just how does this change the opportunity set for you? Does that mean more granular transactions or perhaps a restriction in activity on your end or expectations on your end? Shankh Mitra : Yeah. Connor, I answered this question earlier. I'm just going to repeat what I said. What changed is there's a hard stress that's coming. And that's because majority of construction loans are done on a floating rate basis if not all of them are done on a floating rate basis. And you have a very significant potential increase of LIBOR that's coming to the pipe that will put even more stress in the system. And the second point is we're not cap rate buyers. It is hard to cap rate is a stabilized concept. Senior housing is anywhere but stabilized at this point. I do not expect cap rates even if you're talking about in the context of stabilized cap rate, I do not believe there is going to be a significant compression. In fact, I think a lot of institutional investors are looking at all asset classes including many we own and that we talked about historically that underlying growth rate versus inflation at sudden CapEx makes no sense, right? I've talked about for example for quarters after quarters that given the outlook of what the forward curve was telling you inflation breakeven and others. It made no sense to me for what people who are paying for MOBs with 2% growth rate. Finally, it seems like there is a obviously a understanding on the institutional investor side, people are waking up to say what did I buy for this and how do I make return? So I think there has to be a reconciliation of when you look at your IRR, you have to think about what is the real growth versus the nominal growth. And that's going to show up. That's going to show up at your exit. And we're long-term IRR buyers. We think through these things and that's why we refuse to chase the market. You have seen that for years and years we have done and there was not going to be any difference in that discipline going forward. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson from SMBC. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Thanks and good morning. Shankh you have said in the past that you are not likely to be an elephant hunter that you get noise in the system when you go too big and I can appreciate that. But that is a different mentality versus your predecessor. So if you're not willing to be a buyer as an elephant hunter is there anything that you could see from the sales perspective that could be -- I mean if you're a $26 million average deal price on the buy side, what do you think your average deal price would be on the sell side given that mentality towards\u2026 Shankh Mitra : Very good question. It's extremely astute observation. Look at 2020 and look at how many billions we sold. And if you looked at the disposition you will see sales were done on a multiple of the buys, right? I don't know exactly what the number is, but it is likely to be multiple of that $24 million $26 million that we mentioned. We want to buy retail and sell -- buy wholesale and sell retail. That's what we do right?  Fundamentally no matter what investment class you are it's something very simple how you make money is buy low, sell high. Right? That ultimately is how you allocate capital to make money. So portfolio when there's a lot of hunger in the market to buy a certain asset class portfolio premiums that we are. So you go sell portfolios but you buy smaller assets I think we mentioned that $5.7 billion we bought median size of the transaction not median-sized of the building median size of the transaction was $26 million. That's how we create real value. Operator : Thank you. So our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski from Green Street. Please go ahead. John Pawlowski : Thanks for the time. John as you picked through the SHOP portfolio either by property type LIL memory care or geography -- are there any signs within the portfolio of structurally higher vacancy rates where maybe move in percentage or just not improving in recent months or occupancy is actually sliding here? Shankh Mitra : No. Each area is improving across the board. The starting point that we're at right now is of course pretty low. So, the bar is low to build from as we get to an optimal level which would be substantially higher your question is a good question and there may be some things that become more apparent. But at this point in time everything is working across the Board. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Thanks. I wanted to transition to the triple-net portfolio for a second. Tim can you quantify how many triple-net tenants are on a cash basis today? And what's the difference between the current cash that's being paid and recognized compared contractual rents on those leases? Tim McHugh : So in the first quarter -- or sorry the fourth quarter it's about 15% to 20%. It's kind of stayed within that range for most of the last few quarters. So that's the quantum of kind of how much of that in-place rent is being recognized on a cash basis. And I don't have the gap to contractual right now. Shankh Mitra : But Mike remember, all of our triple-net senior housing portfolio is in US and UK, right? And Syou can see how much that cash flow is sort of inflected or expected to be inflected this year, because they're obviously on cash, the underlying NOI is what we eat and that underlying NOI is going up significantly, which is translating into that same-store triple-net growth expectation that Tim just gave you. In other words, we took the hit by putting it obviously on cash recognition Tim talked about that, on many calls. Now, we're on the other side of that. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead. Steven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So with all your commentary on the labor expense that was definitely helpful. I guess, I'm curious for the $30 million of the agency labor expense absorbed in the fourth quarter. Is there any further color on whether that was fairly evenly spread geographically across the SHOP portfolio, or did you find it as geographically concentrated maybe in a few markets? And also, since well has more of an urban footprint in SHOP overall. Just any generalization from your view whether labor shortage issues are more or less prevalent in rule versus urban markets just in general? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Sure. That's a great question, and we've done an awful lot of studies on that particular issue leveraging our data analytics team. The interesting thing that, we found is it gets back to my comment on stress identifies opportunities and issues. And when looking at it closely, clearly, some markets can have a level of stress specific to that market. But then when you dig deeper in you find out that, tremendous amount of assets have zero labor and selected assets have a lot of agency \u2013 selective assets have a lot of agency. The cause of that is a combination of in some cases Omicron came in and had a material impact on a great amount of staff, which is no surprise. In other cases, my belief frankly is a leadership. And that's partly, what gives me great optimism in moving forward and solving this, because the leadership issues are solvable. And the leadership issues, this is one indication, but they also tie to other issues occupancy et cetera. So this frankly helps us identify some situations that will \u2013 as we make adjustments, we'll improve things going forward dramatically. So hopefully, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Jordan Sadler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jordan Sadler : Thank you, guys. Good morning. Shankh Mitra : Good morning. Jordan Sadler : Good morning. I wanted to \u2013 this is sort of a little bit of a two-parter. One I wanted to clarify, the contract labor assumption embedded in 1Q. I think you said down 10%. So $30 million of expense becomes $27 million. Is that the way to think about it? And then separately, just kind of thinking about the cadence of your guidance for the SHOP portfolio in particular, right? Last time, you gave sequential guidance for 4Q, right? We ended up with a surprise variant late in the quarter that ended up providing pretty significant headwinds, especially on the labor front and pressured numbers lower relative to what original expectations were. I'm curious, how much that experience in the fourth quarter impacted sort of your decision surrounding guidance for the first quarter? In other words, this appears kind of conservative relative to the moderation in expenses? And what seems to be a flat occupancy assumption for the first quarter overall, despite the fact that you only lost 20 basis points in January. So I know that's -- I've asked a lot there, but I'm basically asking about the cadence on giving guidance. Shankh Mitra : Yes. So, Jordan, why don't I start and Tim will finish. First is, I understand Q1 is seasonally a weak period from an occupancy standpoint. So as John talked about, we're down in January about 20 basis points. And we're kind of thinking obviously, the sales activity picked up pretty significantly, tours have picked up. And we're thinking as sales picked up you get some lag, right, call it 20 to 30 days lag from sales to occupancy. So that kind of puts you at sort of towards the end of the quarter. So you don't have a lot of time to pick up that occupancy, right? So that sort of -- I wouldn't call that a conservative, right? I would call that what we think was going to happen. The up and downs and who cares. But just sort of generally speaking, I want you to understand what we're thinking about. You are right, I mean, that will on average, quarter average, Q1, occupancy goes down about 70, 80 basis points. So you get sequentially flat, which will probably put an average of flat significant year-over-year growth. That's a pretty good outcome, because you have to think about what that means for the rest of the year, right? It's not about just Q1 days. The second point is, look, I mean, I am pretty disappointed about the bottom line results in Q4. There's no two ways about it. We did not expect that Omicron will hit us like the way it did. And frankly speaking, there's 45 more days to go in the quarter. And as we have seen, it's highly infectious where it comes and how that can impact you quarter-to-quarter, Jordan, who knows, right? I mean we're focused on what's the real run rate earnings power of the platform. And what we see is pretty exciting, at least, what we see today. But it's hard to get into specifics or when things happen. You have an operating business, right, which is driving the marginal differences, try to get very, very sort of prescriptive about how exactly things are going to play out. It's hard to comment. Tim McHugh : I would just add to the labor piece of that agency piece, Jordan. So your math is correct on the expectation, kind of the step down. And I don't think what happened in the fourth quarter necessarily changes, certainly, very carefully is anywhere, like, conservative in the way that we're forecasting. But the variance in what we've seen happen over the wave is that, the labor disruption has been much greater than the demand disruption, particularly over the last two waves and Omicron was a significant labor disruption. So, certainly, changes the way you forecast from the inputs and confidence levels around it. So that being conservative, it's more of a -- there's a lot of uncertainty in the short term. It's the labor piece and how it's impacting labor market, it being -- the different variants is probably the biggest reason why we have to make a longer-term forecast right now. So, I think, as I said earlier, I think the early trends we're seeing in January are very supportive of our view on the step down in agency. And we thought that was going to be a little bit more back half of the quarter weighted. But, I think, in general, it still stands a pretty good assumption. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Hi. Thanks. I just want to follow up here on this agency question. So, it sounds like it's going to be about $27 million for those costs in the first quarter. If you go back to the third quarter, I think, it was $20 million. So still up versus then? And just trying to hear a little bit more about your assumption for why at some point that expense which is about 3% of your expenses goes away and why you're confident that it's a COVID issue and not a tight labor market issue that's driving the use of that agency cost. Shankh Mitra : Well, it's both. No doubt about it, it's both. And when you look at the fourth quarter some more color on that is you've got some health care workers all of the health care workers who have worked unbelievably, they tirelessly worked and did not take PTO for a long, long period of time. So, you had increased PTOs that occurred around the holiday season and then you add in Omicron and you get the result of agency. So, agency is usually two to three times the rate and it got as high as 6x. It's surge pricing kind of like Uber. So, as that backs away that will lower the expense regardless of the hours. But again going back to my comments the reality is each of the operators have workflows in play to increase hiring and they're all working. So, it was just a unique situation. The combination of the PTO and Omicron that came. So, I am confident that it won't be a long-term item in the industry. But exactly how it abates is it will be over time. Nick Yulico : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Tayo Okusanya : Yes, hi everyone. I wanted to talk a little bit more about the Rubin Brothers transaction. I'm intrigued by it to kind of given again the high-quality assets that they tend to own over here in the UK. Curious how big that JV could become over time all the idea is you're going to be building stuff like the Sunrise assets at 56th and 2nd right in Central London? Is that the idea there? Shankh Mitra : The idea is to expand the JV to reflect the fact that UK society is aging just like US society is aging and there is a lack of high-quality product. If you think about Rubin own a lot of extraordinary prime lands and billings obviously around the United Kingdom. And we're looking at a lot of opportunities to grow the platform and that could include trophy assets just like you mentioned that Sunrise at East 56th Street, which by the way opened this quarter and is doing pretty well. If you are in New York, you want to visit the asset let us know. Finally, through all the noise of the COVID and we're seeing some very early demand story there, which is playing out pretty well. But it can be, but doesn't have to be just trophy assets. Tayo Okusanya : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I show our last question comes from the line of Daniel Bernstein from Capital One. Please go ahead. Daniel Bernstein : Good morning. I have to ask a question here last second. So you talked about ramping up their development team. And when I was looking at your slide in your supplemental, it pretty noticeable that you only have three MOB properties under development almost everything else is seniors housing. So I was hoping you might be able to talk about on the MOB side, whether the lack of development there is more lack of opportunity versus the lack of value and certainly on the acquisition side, you talked about an inflationary environment you don't want to buy four or five cap assets with 2% growth. But on the development side is there a different story there? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So, a couple of things. First, is our MOB pipeline is actually pretty meaningful. I don't know then what's in the south versus what's been reported and not reported. I can tell you that the MOB pipeline is very, very significant. It's 1 million plus square feet that's fully leased. So it's probably not been reported yet. What you see is reported as a senior housing is because we don't separate out what senior housing for while it was housing business, it's all reported as one bucket. But a very substantial portion of our development activity is all the wellness side of the house, rather than on the senior side of the house. On the senior side of the house, they're very targeted, but they're very large buildings, right? So think about -- I'll give you an example. I mean, is 56 Street, which is delivered that's a $300 million asset. You think about 1001 Van Ness that's roughly a $300 million asset. Hudson Yards is a $400-plus million asset. Brooklyn is $150 million assets, right? We talked about Kisco, it's $170 million assets talking about too. So, you have very few assets there that is substantial, that does make a difference to the number. But from a number of properties perspective, they're actually not that high. And the reason being, frankly speaking, other than very special situations, right? Think about where 1001 Van Ness, it's going to be the most trophy building in San Francisco period and full stop. I think about Brooklyn, now the fact that we got something entitled in Brooklyn in Middle a Fisher Hill, right next to the Brooklyn Country Club that should have taken probably 15 years to do, right? So just -- so it's a special opportunity. And that's why we're executing. But other than that, senior housing development today in my opinion doesn't make a lot of sense. And the reason, it doesn't make a lot of sense is you don't know where the ultimate labor cost adjusted rent will land. You just don't know that. And there is no reason to go and guess that. And just obviously if you're doing for your own capital if you're a for-fee developer or a fee-only operator, which is mostly the people who are I'm seeing starting that help in these days because they have no money on the line, right? If it works out, it's great. I have a promote if it doesn't, somebody else lost money. So I just don't see how that works particularly in the context of very high cost and higher financing costs, right? So it just goes back to my point that I made earlier on LIBOR based and floating rate base construction loan industry. So we are thinking about giving you additional disclosure sometime this year about what's the wellness side of the house versus the senior side of the house and we'll get to that. But majority of our new activity is on the wellness side of the house where we're a lot more confident on where the margin lands and frankly speaking their cap rates are much, much, much tighter to create value on the acquisition side, so our focus on the development. And you're going to see as I said the pipeline is very strong on the development side and that's just coming through. I said -- I'll finish it by saying what you have said on that question a very important one, I still -- no one has explained me how someone makes money in a significant inflationary environment on a real basis, not on a nominal basis with an asset class that grows 2% with a 40% cap rate when your inflation is much higher. So somebody's yet to explain me that. And unless I believe that will not be active on the acquisition side. You saw we bought a small MOB portfolio, which was a high-quality portfolio in Arbor we bought. We bought it at a 5.5 cap, which I have said for multiple years, it gives you the right level of IRR.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to the Q1 2022 Welltower Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce General Counsel, Matt McQueen. Matt McQueen : Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurance best projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the Company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll describe our capital allocation priorities in the rapidly evolving investment environment and review high-level business trends before handing the call over to John, who will detail operational trends. A little over one year ago, our seniors housing operating business witnessed a powerful inflection point with occupancy gains and pricing power sustained through the remainder of the year despite Delta and Omicron variants. This momentum continued into first quarter of this year and translated into the first period of year-over-year bottom line growth for our company since the beginning of pandemic. Our total portfolio revenue is up 32.7% year-over-year, driven by both organic revenue growth as well as a significant volume of high conviction capital deployment during the last 18 months. On a same-store basis, our Senior Housing Operating portfolio revenue is up 11.2% year-over-year driven by a 4.6% occupancy growth and 4.6% rate growth. Encouragingly, we saw sequential pricing growth was 4.3%, the fastest growth recorded in our history despite only half of our operators pushing through in-house rent increases on Jan 1 schedule. All of these translated into 18.4% same-store NOI growth in Q1, an impressive number that surpassed our expectations. We're all very encouraged by the speed at which free trades are moving up. And we expect same-store NOI growth will accelerate into the second half of the year, barring another COVID spike, all of this setting up to be a powerful earnings recovery that we anticipate in 2023 and beyond. Before I turn into investment environment, I want to make two things here that are very important for multiyear earnings growth path. Number one, in 2018, when we converted our Brandywine Senior Living lease to RIDEA, I mentioned the two other portfolio we had in triple net structure that we hope to convert. One of them was Legend Senior Living. After many years of discussion with Tim McCannon legendary Founder and CEO, I'm pleased to report that we have converted this relationship to RIDEA. Recall that we had an 88% and 20% profit JV between Welltower and Legend. At conversion, Tim contributed a portion of his propco, five brand-new assets and has agreed to a future development agreement to create a powerful 93%, 7% equity partnership going forward. Finally, after years of persuasion, we have convinced him that we can grow the pie using our data analytics platform so significantly that will still be better off this by owning a smaller portion of the pie. A partner of our company since '90s, Legend has paid every single dollar of rent that was owed to Welltower regardless of the coverage on a given day. Though these deals is dilutive to our FFO in 2022 due to significant agency leverages today, we expect cash flow relative to the previous rent will breakeven in beginning of 2023, and our shareholders will enjoy upside from thereon. We hope for extraordinary partnership over last week -- had extraordinary partnership over the last three decades, and we hope that it will continue for many more to come. This transition, along with acquisition and future development partnership exemplifies our sole focus on enhancing long-term value of the portfolio and is indicative of the potential earnings subside in the portfolio that can be captured through a simple cap rate or multiple valuation methodology. Number two, historically, our SHO business focused on managing managers and assets. Now that we have significantly upgraded our operational capabilities, including through the hiring of John Burkart, our COO, our focus in the SHO business will mirror the real estate and management services that we provide in our medical office business or what an apartment rig does with an understanding that we're limited in providing care services in a health -- qualified health care property. This fundamental shift in our approach has a profound impact on how we think about our role in the operating step. This is particularly important as we think through the most important part of that operating platform, which is the technology staff. John will get into the details as part of his script, but we are delighted that he is in full scale development and implementation of a true operating platform at Welltower. John is working closely with some of our best operating partners to launch this, call it RIDEA for now, but honestly, that doesn't do our new approach justice. As to the scale and impact, we think his plans will have on the customer experience and value creation overall. Needless to say, we expect this multiyear initiative will have a tremendous impact on our earnings growth trajectory and long-term compounding machine that we are setting up at Welltower. Now let's talk about capital allocation. As you know, my team is extraordinarily focused on allocating capital to create part share value for existing shareholders. The keyword is existing. We'll favor our existing shareholders who have been our partners to think and thin, especially through thin. We are fiercely protective of their interest on a per share basis, and won't act in a manner that does not create significant value for them. Because we're extremely transparent and genuinely dislike drama, I will mention to you that Welltower is the Party F referenced in theHTA HR merger proxy couple of weeks ago. Every week, we call owners of assets and express our interest to buy them at a price. This was no different. I am genuinely disappointed that HR Board and management did not engage with us, but that is their prerogative. It is completely up to their shareholders and the Board, which presents our shareholders to decide how to maximize value. Because of the many rumors circulating and the reports and articles about this, I'll mention a few things before moving on to much more important items. Number one, we're fair win-win people, we offer to buy the Company on public information at $31.75 per share, plus a breakup fee of $163 million from a which, as you have seen, the market bodes a significantly value destructive for our analyst reports. We believe that our cash offer provided better value to HR shareholders than the HDA merger, and it was fully financed and were prepared to move within days. I read research notes that described our unfair pricing relative to what might be in market cap rate. Please understand that we did not offer to buy an asset, we offer to buy a company that we are willing to pay for assets and pay a breakup fee that company out for company's existing shareholders for potential dilution that will respect and analyst community has been writing about. I hope this will stop mischaracterization of our offer and our intent. Number two, Welltower always has and always will honor its agreement with third parties, including that with HTA. In fact, HTA itself piloted our NDA with them by providing -- by first disclosing it to HR and then later to the public in the joint proxy. Further our NDA with them does not contain a standstill that will apply us to making an offer for HR as a stand-alone entity. As you would expect, we signed it with HTA in order to access information regarding HTA and its properties, therefore, the standstill only applies to HTA and its properties. Our proposal was expressly conditioned on HR not completing their HTA transaction. Number three, we have never chased the deal and never will. We buy everything at a price and sell everything at a price. Although I'm disappointed that HR did not engage with us, as our offer -- we thought our offer would result into a superior outcome for HR shareholders, I have no intention of being hostile. I personally like Todd, I called him and expressed our interest. We didn't buy shares in the public market, nor did we act in anything but a friendly way. They did not engage. Under these circumstances, we have nothing to do here. Number four, contrary to what some analysts might have written, this deal would not have been dilutive to our senior housing growth. You don't know what proportion of equity, debt or joint ventures we might have contemplated for the transaction. But even if you think we were to do this entirely on the balance sheet, it would be a rather simple exercise. Look at the NOI bridge in our business update, divide that NOI by existing number of shares, calculate the additional shares required by the HR transaction to calculate dilution on a part share basis and then add back the accretion from the deal. You will see our existing shareholders would have covered ahead. We look at every single investment through the lens of opportunity costs. Specifically, we have to satisfactorily answer three questions that Buffett has taught us. And then what compared to what at the expense of what. This is not different. And number five, we're not disappointed nor we are concerned about our growth of our senior housing business. While the contrary, in fact, we just reported 18.4% same-store NOI growth and expected to meaningfully accelerate in the second half of the year. Now that I have put all these rumors to let's talk about the 30 or so owners who did engage with us to create win-win partnership transaction. Year-to-date, we have closed $1.2 billion of acquisitions across 21 different off-market or privately negotiated transactions. This is a remarkable stat given the pace of activity last year. I find it difficult to talk about specific deals as it feels like picking your favorite children, but I still mention a handful of transactions to give you a sense. We bought 700 units at our three large communities in Washington State with Cogir to expand our partnership with Matthew and Dave. Dave Eskenazy is one of the best in the business, and I'm glad that he's now back full time at Cogir U.S. as a CEO. We're also expanding our partnership with purchase of another property in Brentwood located in the East Bay of Northern California. All properties were bought at significant discount replacement cost. For example, the Brentwood asset contains large units, and it was bought for $320,000 per unit. We believe the replacement cost in East Bay today is easily significantly north of $500,000 units. Additionally, we are significantly deepening our relationship with Dan and his team at StoryPoint with the acquisition of 33 communities in Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee in their backyard. With a median vintage of 2016, we're extremely pleased with the average price of 197,000 units, which is meaningful discount replacement cost with 63% of current average occupancy this sizable deal will be dilutive to our 2022 FFO per share, but properties are anticipated to generate significant occupancy, margin and cash flow growth in 2023 and beyond on the StoryPoint's enhanced operating platform. This is another example of us choosing the right long-term investment decision and cash flow growth of our GAAP earnings situation, another thing you hear from us consistently. In another transaction, we announced we're expanding our partnership with Courtney and our team at Oakmont with seven new assets in extraordinary locations in California. Courtney and her team are at the absolute top of operating echelons, and we cannot be happier to grow this partnership together. Separately, within the medical office space, we bought four building property portfolio on the campus of one of the strongest hospitals in Birmingham, Alabama for a 5.5% cap rate in an absolute net lease structure at a great basis. Given the absolute debt structure, we expect unlevered IRR to be high single-digit range. We're also under contract to buy two large beautiful MOBs, one in San Francisco Bay Area, another in Sacramento MSA for a high 5% going-in cap rate at a great basis. Again, we expect to generate high single digits in IRR in both cases. In terms of the financing market, in the last 30 days or so, we have seen a massive shift with property level leverage down 15 points, cost doubling and interest only disappearing from the market, both in seniors as well as in MOBs. This is starting to have a tectonic impact on asset pricing. To put bluntly, I have not been this excited about our acquisition prospects since Q4 of 2020. About six weeks ago, an investor, whom I respect very much asked me if I'm optimistic about the next $7 billion of acquisitions, as I was about the last $7 billion of acquisition that we did since pivoting to offense in 4Q of '20. I instinctively answered what I truly believe that we're driven by value, not by volume, which is this investor took it as a no. Today, that answer will be on equivocal yes. Yes, we are excited about the figuratively net $7 billion as we are when we acted on the last $7 billion. To that effect, our pipeline today is roughly $1.5 billion of deals in process across 20 different off-market or privately negotiated transactions. Several of these are potentially operating unit transactions, which we expect to be very popular with the sellers. Please recall that we define our pipeline as transactions that are already under contract. In addition to this, we're negotiating another couple of billion dollars of acquisitions across several other transactions. While we may not eventually succeed in convincing sellers to agree to our price, please note that we don't need any given transaction. Price is the price. We see cracks in the market and are focused on where the puck is going and not where the puck might have been. The value of a party that never titrates and doesn't request debt has really been higher. In more trust systems in nature, such as coastline, cloud, no matter how much you scale up or scale down, you notice a remarkable sale similarity property. You noticed that in same everyone in nature. For example, in Florida cauliflower is same as cauliflower. This phenomenon is called fractal geometry. This is the same idea that our drive time polygons and isochrones are based on if you have seen our data science presentation. Interestingly, organization history is full of company to grow successfully through small bolt-on acquisitions in their advantageous niche only to present themselves on strategic acquisitions that get them in trouble. David Packer, the founder of HP brilliantly said, more businesses die of indigestion than starvation to discuss this phenomenon. At Welltower, we don't have strategic acquisitions. In fact, sales similarity of mother-nature is highly visible in our investment philosophy. No matter how small or big a specific investment is where after the same, driven by the same factors. In all cases, we're buying, number one, a reasonable basis relative to replacement costs; and number two, where we can add value by driving operational improvement. We are not spread investing deal junkies. We have true total retail investors and are optimistic that 2022 will be one of the best years in the Company's history from an acquisition point. With that, I'll hand the call over to my partner, John Burkart, our Chief Operating Officer. John? John Burkart : Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will touch upon the performance of our operating business in the quarter and provide some elements of our vision for senior housing. Starting with our medical office portfolio. In the first quarter, our outpatient medical business delivered 2.7% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, while occupancy declined modestly to 94.5%. We continue to see strong retention rates in the first quarter of 92%, likely driven by rising construction costs, construction delays and the related increases in new lease rents. Going forward, we expect occupancy to decline modestly as we continue to increase renewal rates in line with market increases. Now turning to our senior housing portfolio. The coiled spring, as Shankh has called it, is starting its expansion. Revenue in our same-store portfolio grew at 11. 2% in the first quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. That's over 2x the growth rate experienced last quarter and the highest year-over-year increase since at least 2017. Our first quarter performance was led by our U.S. portfolio, which reported year-over-year top line growth of 13.5%. Additionally, as we've described in recent calls, pricing power continues to strengthen as reflected by strong renewal rate increases and improving market rate. In fact, RevPAR growth in the first quarter increased by the highest level in years at 4.6% year-over-year and 4.3% sequentially. While expenses grew at a rate of 9.5%, the more insightful expense metric is expense POR or expense per occupied room, which only grew at a rate of 3%, and in the first quarter year-over-year on a year-over-year basis, the lowest since at least 2017. The combination of higher rental rates, increasing occupancy and improving margins led to an outstanding NOI growth rate of 18.4%. Our operators continue to report very strong demand with traffic above 2019 levels, which bodes well for the peak sales season ahead. And if things play out as we expect continued top line strength and further improvement on the expense side should result in a meaningful acceleration in NOI growth in the back half of the year. Understandably, since taking over as COO at Welltower, I've received questions about my vision and areas of focus, both of which I want to provide some insight to on this call. I will outline the opportunity I see and highlight some key elements of my plan, which I believe Welltower is uniquely positioned to execute. As I evaluate the senior housing business, my perspective is a little different than the conventional wisdom that is developed as the health care REIT industry has evolved. The healthcare REIT industry, including Welltower, started with triple net leases for senior housing, giving the owners little to no say in operations and asset management. As the industry evolved with RIDEA, the historic reliance on the operators to run the business continued. The senior housing industry was founded by strong visionary leaders who saw that there was a much better way for society to provide quality lifestyles for its aging members, and they acted accordingly, like so many industries, which are started by small businesses, they are specialists in their core focus, in this case, providing quality living experience for our aging population and generalists and the many other important elements related to running a modern operating business. But as you know, I come to this business with a different perspective and have broken down the business into a few components. It's essentially the multifamily business that provides care with some hospitality. As Shankh alluded to in his opening remarks, although REITs are limited in providing care services, we can perform multifamily type functions like revenue management, capital management, procurement, provide IT expertise as well as leverage our data science expertise. By doing so, we have the opportunity to fundamentally change the potential of this business by creating a full-scale operating platform and bringing operational excellence to the senior housing business. Overall, I have come to believe that Welltower has a substantial opportunity to improve the customer and employee experience and create shareholder value through leading the digital transformation of the business. More to come on timing, but I will say that we are actively working on the initiative, partnering with best-in-class operators, and we will deliver various components as they are ready. The addition of the world-class operating platform will continue to dramatically increase the size and depth of the Welltower moat. And it will greatly simplify the business for our top operators, enabling them to focus on their core strengths increasing their effectiveness and efficiency and driving increased total returns. We expect that all our stakeholders, including our operating partners and investors will emerge as winners in this next phase of the senior housing business. I'll now turn the call over to Tim. Tim McHugh : Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2022 results. The performance of our triple net investment segments in the quarter. Our capital activity our balance sheet liquidity update; and finally, our outlook for the second quarter. Welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.14 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.82 per diluted share, which was above the midpoint of our $0.79 to $0.84 per share guidance. Despite our results only including approximately $600,000 of HHS funds versus the $6 million expectation we had previously forecasted as part of our guidance. This quarter represented our first with year-over-year normalized FFO growth since the start of the pandemic. And when excluding provider relief funds received in the respective periods, or $0.82 per share represents 15% year-over-year growth versus the first quarter of 2021. We are also pleased to report that total portfolio same-store NOI growth turned positive in the quarter. With 8.9% year-over-year growth, which compares favorably to guidance of 7%. Turning to our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported a quarter years. So, these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2021. In our seniors housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 6.9% year-over-year and exceeded our expectations, driven by improvements in rent collections on leases currently in cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI. Trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.82x and with a sequential improvement, mainly driven by the conversion of Legend Senior Living today in the quarter. As indicated last quarter, we expect coverages to continue to move higher through the rest of the year as the positive inflection point we started experiencing our SHO portfolio in the first quarter will be reflected in our triple-net coverages on a one-quarter lag. Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio generated negative 1.8% year-over-year same-store NOI growth and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.3x. We completed $6.7 million of long-term post-acute sales in the quarter bringing our total sales in the last 12 months to $525 million and a blending cap rate is 7.5%, with an additional $202 million under contract for sale at quarter end. As a result, our long-term post-acute portfolio represented just 4.8% and of total in-place NOI at year-end versus 10.1% at the end of 2020, a 530 basis point decline driven largely by the exit of our Genesis relationship. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with ProMedica Health System, had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 0.02x. As a reminder, this lease is backed by the full corporate guarantee from ProMedica Health System. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the Company to capitalize a robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to efficiently fund those near-term transactions. Since the start of the year, we have sold 21 million shares via forward sale agreement, an initial weighted average price of approximately $89.9 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.9 billion. We currently have approximately 19.5 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $1.8 billion. Additionally, we are seeing significant interest from potential sellers to accept OP units as consideration, providing further investment capacity. Taken together, our unsettled ATM proceeds, potential OP unit issuances and $352 million of expected property disposition and loan payoff proceeds provide ample capacity to fund our current investment pipeline. During the quarter, we issued our second green bond comprised of $550 million of 10-year unsecured debt maturing in 2032, with a coupon of 3.85%. Following a similar discipline in our equity funding strategy, this is our fourth unsecured issuance since March of 2021, bringing total debt issuance over the span of $2.3 billion with an average duration of 9.5 years and average coupon of 3%. At quarter end, when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances, our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. And when combined with the previously mentioned $2.1 billion of unsettled ATM proceeds and expected disposition proceeds, we remain in a very strong liquidity position. Lastly, moving to our second quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the second quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders per diluted share of $0. 20 to $0.25 per share, normalized FFO per diluted share of $0.82 to $0.87 per share or $0.845 at the midpoint. This guidance takes into consideration approximately $6 million of HHS funds expected to be received in the second quarter. Guidance represents a $0.025 increase at the midpoint from our $0.82 per share number in 1Q. This $0.025 increase is composed of a $0. 04 sequential increase in our Senior Housing Operating portfolio NOI, $0.01 incremental increase in HHS funds and is offset by $0.025 of increased interest expense, lower foreign exchange rates, particularly the British pound, and dilution from development deliveries. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated in second quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store growth of 8% to 10%, driven by sub-segment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%; long-term post-acute 2% to 3%; Health System, positive 2.75% and senior housing triple net 7% to 8%. And finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 20%, driven by revenue growth of 11% and underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 500 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and continued robust rate increases. We continue to be pleased by the momentum of the top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by a combination of rate and occupancy growth, setting the stage for a multiyear recovery to average occupancy in the portfolio at 76.4% at quarter end, nearly 1,100 basis points below pre-COVID levels and nearly 1,500 basis points below peak occupancy levels. We've described as recovery in the past as a coiled spring with both secular and cyclical tailwinds behind it. When we started to see the spring release in the core portfolio, we have made the conscious decision to steadily allocate capital to distressed, under-operated and often initially diluted properties, along with high-quality development projects. While this capital allocation has the effect of offsetting some of our core growth today, we will sustainably amplify it in the years to come. In short, we're working hard to keep that spring coil even as we start to realize the power of the earnings growth it can drive. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : I want to sum it up -- sum up the call by saying I cannot be more pleased with the internal and external growth prospects of the Company. We have taken a lot of shots, suffered a lot of pain for the course of many years to finally get to the point where we believe we're primed for long-term compounding. The only way we know how to create significant shareholder wealth over a long period of time. A great investment has three characteristics, outsized returns, low risk and long duration. While we are very successful in finding outsized returns in off-market opportunities that we continue to execute on were equally focused on lower risk and longevity. This is why we're obsessed with acquiring assets at a reasonable basis relative to replacement costs in order to reduce risk. And in terms of longevity, Page 20 of our business update will describe to you 30 or so win-win contractual partnerships that we have signed through a seamless way of trust where we hope to deploy 30-plus billion dollars of capital over the next decade and beyond. We see enormous opportunity for growth within our circle of confidence, which we define as the area where we can allocate capital with households instead of using our predictive analytics platform. This confluence of outsized internal and external growth has created a rare condition, which is called Leaping Emergent Effect or as Munger describes it, Lollapalooza effect. You as our owners can rest assured that we will not make any poor capital allocation decisions that will jeopardize these rare leaping emergent conditions that we have achieved through many years of hard work, luck, courage and a culture where everybody is all in. With that, operator, please open the call up for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra : I'm going to try to just want to clarify one. But just first, Shankh, you talked about pricing power or rent growth accelerating. Can you maybe expand on that? What does that mean for the second half and maybe sustainability into '23 on shop pricing power? And then just a clarification, just you talked a lot about the MOB, the HR bid. Just very simplistically, I mean, you've talked -- you've not liked MOBs historically, at least maybe a year or two years ago, like what changed very simplistically. Shankh Mitra : Okay. Let me answer both of those questions separately. It's not too in. So first, let the answer the MOB question. We like all asset classes at a price. I've always said, even if you look back two quarters ago, we said it makes no sense to us that people buy MOBs in the high 4% cap rate range and after CapEx, you're in the low 4s, when you foresee in the breakeven market, how financing market was going to change, right? I'm just surprised that people are surprised this happened. Now you are in a situation where your financing cost is higher than your cost of -- your return on equity at that kind of pricing, which is a real estate is called Death Cross, right? That is the harbinger of obviously what's to come on the asset pricing side. That just doesn't make any sense to me why would you buy something at those prices with that growth related to inflation. Nothing has changed. Look at Vikram, what we just bought. We bought one MOB at an absolute triple net lease, which obviously means we're not responsible CapEx, call it, 5.5%, which is an equivalent triple net, will be close to a 6%. And we bought two others in California, that's high 5s, right, where we think that we can get to an unlevered high single-digit IRR. So that makes sense to us. So it is all about pricing, not exposure that determines your investment success. Second point, obviously, the pricing power. We're -- obviously, we talked about how we think in-house pricing increase would be, and that's obviously very necessary to offset all the costs that we have seen in the system. I'm particularly encouraged that what we see is street rates are moving. Street rates have moved, I would say, first quarter, we have seen high single digit. In April, we have seen some operators street rates well into double digits, right? So that, along with, if you think about half of our -- roughly speaking, half our residents on not Jan 1 scheduled, right, to receive -- they are on a schedule of anniversary rate. So if you put those two together, we'll see sustained strong pricing power through the year, which we're very, very excited about. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Shankh, I was hoping you could maybe just expound a little bit on the distress that you're seeing in the transaction market. And I realize that you're not necessarily focused on initial cap rates, but I'm curious, when you look at your underwriting, have the unlevered IRRs that you think you're going to achieve change at all? And just trying to get a better flavor for the activity levels and just maybe how return hurdles might be going up for you? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So Steve, if you recall, the initial phases of this pandemic, we have done many transactions in, call it, low single -- low double-digit unlevered IRR, which said as the market started to come back as sort of translated into a high single-digit unlevered IRR, right? And given what happened in the marketplace in the last 30 days, with financing market totally blew up. As I said, leverage is down, cost of leverage is significantly up and IO completely vanished. If you think through that, that's really put a levered IRR model upside down, right? So we are now starting to see -- I've seen more deals dropping from contracts in the last 30 days than I've ever seen in my career. So we are starting to see that all the deals are bouncing back. We always have said that price is a price, we give people a price, underwrite a deal on an unlevered basis. So for us, it doesn't really change anything and we'll t he price. And we're seeing all those things that are coming back. So it is that I don't want to get too excited, but I'm starting to see the emergence of sort of those low double-digit unlevered deals starting to pop up again. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Just on the agency expenses down 10% sequentially. Can we get a sense of month-by-month improvement especially since Jan and even Feb likely had pretty high Omicron cases seems that agency utilization could have improved each month as we've moved through first quarter. We're just hoping you can quantify the monthly utilization trend and where agency stands today versus expectations? Shankh Mitra : Derek, we don't want to get into month by month, but you're -- obviously, the way you were thinking about this question is the correct one. We have seen steady improvement through the quarter, and we have seen significant improvement post the quarter, right? So if in or coming in, we have seen that, which is, frankly -- so what sort of gives us confidence that we think where things are continuing in the second quarter as well as in the back half of the year. This is obviously I want to -- I said this -- and I'm going to say this again, we're not in the business of predicting COVID. All bets are off if you have a massive COVID spike again. But that's what we're seeing in normalized market conditions, things are improving rapidly. I don't know, Tim, do you want to add anything to that? Tim McHugh : No, I think that's right. We gave color on our last call when we do January results we spoke to kind of seeing a 10% decline from December to January. And we gave similar color to and seeing a little better than that as a trend for the full quarter. So I think it gives you a read, we kind of saw consistent decreases relative to the counterpart in the fourth quarter. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : I wanted to ask about the expanded partnership with Oakmont, what's so attractive about the Oakmont partnership? And then maybe could you also touch on the CCRCs that you acquired with them? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So what's most attractive about Oakmont is Oakmont is one of the best operators in the business. I mean -- so we -- I mean, look at -- we have mentioned this before, -- they're one of the first ones to come back to sort of 90-plus percent occupancy range. If you look at Oakmont's portfolio performance, it'll be hard for us to believe for kind performance that there was a pandemic that good in operation. Now going back to the point, what else is very attractive. We disclosed, obviously, I think, a couple of quarters ago, that we signed a long-term partnership development partnership with them. So we're very excited about that. We think we're going to create significant value for Oakmont principles as well as well as Welltower shareholders for us to come. And CCRC, so we did not bring Oakmont to the CCRC, it's a CCRC that Oakmont developed in currently with a lot of -- obviously, this is not just entry-level CCIC. There's also a lot of rental units in there. So, we thought they do an extraordinary job of that. And as we always said, just don't think about these things as this moniker, CCRC, this that, the RIDEA triple doesn't change what fundamentally the business is. These are large campuses. New things that we got at a basis and at a cash flow and see a potential growth of cash flow that we think we can make a lot of money. So that's what we see about the partnership. We also bought four traditional rental model together that we think obviously is going to create meaningful growth as well. A lot of these assets open to 2021. So, you are not going to see probably a very significant amount of earnings contribution in 2022, but you will see potentially significant amount in 2023 and beyond. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : Shankh, I wanted to go back to your comments about no intention of going hostile on HR. Forget HR for a moment, I'd just like to better understand your philosophical views on hospital takeouts broader than HR. So if the price is right, are you interested in going to hospital or do you have philosophically against it? Shankh Mitra : I'm not going to comment philosophically what I think on hostile and not, frankly speaking, it's an inappropriate for us to do that. I will guarantee you that we will not go hostile. That's not how we do business. We believe that were win-win people, and we like to deal with people who actually -- it just think about it just very simply, reciprocation is how the world works. You walk into an elevator, you smile at a person, 95% of the time that person smiles back at you, that's called mirrored reciprocation. We like to deal with people who believe in mirror reciprocation or we can do win-win transactions with people. We have zero desire to go hostile on HR or anybody. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Rich Anderson : So, if I can just kind of use HR as a platform, but think more broadly about how you're thinking about the investment horizon. If your offer price is at a low 5% type implied cap rate on that stock, would you be would it make sense for you to kind of deploy this distressed model here? I don't think there's a whole lot of distress, but relatively speaking, sell the very good stuff, keep the older stuff and feed it redevelopment platform and thereby make your IRR hurdle. Is that kind of the mindset for HR and generally speaking about how you're going to approach almost like a contrarian approach to investing where you are dilutive to start, but much more accretive to end? And specifically to -- are you now only sitting idly by to see how it plays out. No more activity there. And finally, the $163 million break fee, that's not paid to HR, if something were to happen. Is that correct? So that's my one question. Shankh Mitra : Okay. You asked three questions. I'll see if I remember all of these. So, first is, I will say that we invest, and I think I said this before, and I'm going to say this again, we invest -- and if there are two conditions that get satisfied. One, we think it's at a reasonable basis relative to replacement cost; b, we think we can add significant value on the operational side. These are the two things that needs to come together for us to invest capital in no matter what the specific one is. My view of this hasn't changed. I'm not going to get into buy this, sell that that do this. It just not -- that's not just -- that's not appropriate for a conversation. It just depends on what asset you're talking about, right? So we're not going to obviously get into that. But I will tell you, what I have mentioned in my prepared remarks. At the price, you know for us, we do everything at a price. At the price that we offered we thought HR shareholders will be much better off than going with the HTA merger. That was our opinion, right? And that the price was for the assets as well as releasing them from a potential transaction, which all of you have described as a significantly dilutive deal and market voted as such, right? So you got to think about asset plus liability, not just assets. That is a fundamental mistake of characterization of what's happening here. Regardless, that's not, as I said, that each of our shareholders and their Board, which is representative of the shareholders progress, not ours. So it is very inappropriate for us to keep talking about something, but there's nothing to talk about, right? We're much more focused, as I said, about 30, 40 other owners who are very happily engaging with us to see how we can transact, how can we have a win-win transaction. And I don't have anything more to add to that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Hill with Morgan Stanley. Adam Kramer : It's Adam Kramer on for Rich. And congrats on a really strong quarter here, and I appreciate all the commentary. I'll kind of keep this on aside from HR and kind of ask about April occupancy trends within SHO. Anything you can add about kind of sequential trends in April or second quarter to-date, I think, would be really helpful. Shankh Mitra : We are encouraged by the April as well as early May trends. And we're also encouraged very much where the pricing is going. Remember, John's focus is on revenue maximization and frankly, NOI maximization. But we're very encouraged by both occupancy and rate trends and I'm assuming you're asking a senior housing, so in the senior housing portfolio. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Michael Griffin : This is Michael Griffin on for Nick. I'm curious, what do you need to see before being comfortable issuing full year guidance? Shankh Mitra : We need to be comfortable to see that COVID is not around us. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : I wanted to stay on, I guess, or touch on the seniors housing pricing power topic. I mean, how much higher can RevPOR trend RevPOR growth trend, particularly when the occupancy gets back into the high 80s or even the low 90% range. I mean, I'm assuming there's only so high you can push rates on the existing residents, but would this dynamic help push street rates higher and then that could drive RevPOR higher. I mean, how should we think about that? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So Mike, you were asking about my favorite topic, and you are asking me to venture a guess, right? So this is a pure guess and I understand you asked about it. But just start from the position of -- I don't know of any other sector where you can have pricing power in the high 70% kind of occupancy or mid- to high 70% occupancy range, right? So we're very encouraged what's happening. But today, the pricing is driven by the necessity, as I described a couple of calls ago or maybe last call, on the necessity of keeping up with the quality of service, cost of everything is going up, including labor, and we do not believe cutting on services. So that's just sort of the -- what's happening right now; however, there is going to be at a point, not so distant future and probably in the high 80% occupancy rate, where you will be -- you don't -- you wouldn't have rooms to sell. And then you're going to have a different type of pricing increase, right? So that -- these two obviously provide a very, very good backdrop, and if you think through what are the development deliveries, right, that in the next few years are -- a couple of years are. And obviously, it takes a lot of time to bring supply back particularly as you think through what happened, right? The last sort of nail on the coffin for a development project was the financing cost, and that's also now gone completely crazy. So you have costs going up every month for 1.5% to 2%, no one is going to give you a GMP for beyond these days before you lock something in for more than a week. That's kind of a crazy cost environment we are. So in putting it all together, pricing car can sustain for a very long period of time in this kind of demand supply scenario. Now going back to your street rate conversation, I'll just give one example, and one example doesn't obviously is not represented on the whole portfolio. We have seen in April, some of our operators have raised street rates by 15%, while that in-house rate increases 8%, 9%, 10%, right? So we're starting to see for at least for a handful of operators, street rates has already -- increases are going above in-house rate increases. A phenomena we haven't seen, I don't know don't hold me to it. Probably, I don't know, probably 2013, '14 time frame. But so we're pretty excited about it. We think that we have a long runway of pricing increase here. And frankly, as we fundamentally believe that our residents expect a lot from us, they're paying a lot and they expect a lot to reserve a lot and for that, it just costs more today. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nick Yulico : Just wanted to go back to the Senior Housing operating segment and how we should think about sequential monthly occupancy gains. I wanted to see if we can get actually the specific number for April. And then also as we think about moving into May through September, third quarter, right. I mean you did make the comment hearing that you expect your year-over-year same-store NOI growth to improve meaningfully in the back half of the year, which would presumably factor in higher sequential occupancy growth than what you're seeing in the second quarter. So just trying to understand about like how we should think about the monthly pace, occupancy gains that could happen, maybe even in relation to last year? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So Nick, if you look at Page 12 of our business update, you will see some sense of how seasonally plays out, right? We have laid that out. Obviously, we expect better than seasonal trends, significantly better than seasonal trends. In the second quarter, but where you see the ship really takes off within the third quarter. So thinking about it without getting into month-to-month, as I have already indicated, the selling season, the summer selling season just started, right? We see very encouraging signs already and we think it will continue to improve as we go forward. Also remember, usually, every year in the Q1 is sort of when you go into -- from Q1 to Q2, going to start at a hole, right, because you lose occupancy. This year, we did not start at a hole, right? We built occupancy where you see occupancy decline. That will have a tremendous impact as you build the revenue line through the rest of the year. Tim, do you want to provide anything else? Tim McHugh : Yes, I'd just add that from an average occupancy perspective, kind of speaking to that same point John just made, but because 1Q is historically negative, but even in this case, small game, average occupancy, which is kind of build off of the prior quarter and the current quarter recovery will accelerate into 3Q and does so historically. So, when we think about kind of sequential, the drive -- the part of it that's driven by occupancy will be its highest in the third quarter. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Austin Wurschmidt : So sticking with SHO and based on that move in street rates you mentioned were up in the double-digit range. Are you considering pushing rate increases even higher on future renewals through the balance of the year? And then I'm curious if you have a sense how below market your in-place rents are today relative to market? And does this sort of acceleration in fundamentals make you more upbeat about future shop acquisitions and more willing to take on the initial dilution that you talked about in your prepared remarks? Shankh Mitra : Three questions there, but we will welcome to our call. I will try to remember everything you want. First is, no, it doesn't excite us more or less investing is about price. It's not about exposure. I cannot say this million times enough and if we call for you guys to understand how we allocate capital. It is all about price. We own more senior housing than anyone. We bought more senior housing than anyone even the last 18 months. So senior housing is going to do significantly better. There has been no other beneficiary more beneficiary than us, right? So having said that, you think about the point, I also want to make sure you hear me. I said for a specific operator, I don't want you to think street rates are going up 15%, right? So everywhere, that's not what's happening. But we see broad momentum of increasing street rate pretty much everywhere with every operator, okay? So let's just put that in the context of understanding how senior housing works. Remember, you have an acuity creep as people age in place or age in a community, okay? So you will always have the portion who is living versus the person who is coming in, there's a gap, right? There's a gap because of that to decrease, the frailty and the acuity creep. What we are seeing, this rapidly rising street rate is closing that gap pretty meaningfully. And we hope that we'll see at some point that gap is going to come together. But at the same point, I understand, as we sort of get to the next year, right, there's going to be significant in-house rate increases again. So, you create another gap and you chase that gap again, right? That's how you build revenue. So, we're pretty optimistic. Generally speaking, the tone of your question is the right one, which excites us very much this moving, obviously, rates that we are starting to see, we'll see that will be sustained, all things being equal through the year and will show up in our top line growth as well as the NOI growth that Tim and John talked about. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Just a quick expense question. It looks like your same-store SHO compensation has been running about 3.25 for the past two quarters. Can you remind us what portion of that would you say is abnormally high because of COVID and agency costs, where we could see that portion of it decline in the subsequent quarters? Tim McHugh : Yes. So we peaked out at a little over 7% or 7.5% of our compensation line was agency in the fourth quarter. That came down to high 6x and we continue to expect that to normalize throughout the year. But just thinking about that from -- I think that's what you're asking, Mike, is just kind of what portion of that is agency. We expect that agency to continue to deflate. But remember, that gets backfilled by full-time hours. So it's not -- there will be some offset of that from full-time employees coming on. I'll just note that, that's something that we're certainly seeing progress on coming out of the first quarter and in April is that the focus our operators have put on hiring full-time employees and we all know that's the solution to agency. That's why we're seeing progress on the agency front because occupancy continues to build. So we're not seeing less of a demand for employees in the buildings. We're just seeing an ability to fill it more and more with our own staff versus agency. Shankh Mitra : In fact, April probably was the best month we have seen from a net hiring perspective since we've started tracking this from the beginning of COVID. So you haven't seen the impact that we're talking about, you'll see that obviously in Q2 on a sequential basis, but again, I'm not going to comment on COVID. I have no way to predict what COVID is happening, not happening, going. But in a normalized market conditions, you will see that will improvement and will significantly expect the second half of the year. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just hoping, if we could touch a little bit on the triple net business, you mentioned the Legend transition and a little bit of dilution there. But just holistically speaking, how should we think about the potential for further transitions, I guess, to shop at this point? And how same-store NOI should track towards the historical 2% to 3% given you're still kind of below the target rent coverage? And kind of what you expect that timing to be to get coverage back to a more sustainable level for those to kind of normalize the same-store growth in the coverage level? Shankh Mitra : One thing about me that you probably have noticed over the years, we know each other that I'm extremely consistent. In 2018, I said there are two portfolios that I hope that we had in the RIDEA portfolio. In 2022, I'll tell you the same thing. And maybe if I couldn't convince the last one, I'll keep saying the same thing for years to come. So you should not expect a lot to change unless we believe, there is fundamentally economic reasons to change from RIDEA to triple net. Fundamentally, we believe it's the same business, different structures for different reasons, different growth profile. So I've gone through this in the call before, so I don't want to waste your time. But that just -- you should not expect a lot more except that one that I have hoped for, for many, many years. So let's just now take the second part of your question. So where you are today, Tim talked about it probably three, four calls in a row now, that we have a significant portion of our triple and portfolio in cash collection, right? And he mentioned when the growth comes back, you will see the other side of it. We have taken it on our chin, right, by putting in cash collection. And now we're on the other side. So obviously, that line item for these operators are behaving like RIDEA, right, because that's what they are. They are cash collection. So on top of that, we have a substantial number of leases that are marked to inflation. And as inflation is going up, so you have overall portfolio is going up. So, that probably -- these two together, probably 35%, 40% of the triple-net portfolio, and that's why you are seeing, obviously, that's why not only you are seeing, we continue to see significant sort of above average growth as long as we have average inflation that sort of in the system. Tim, do you want to add anything to that? Tim McHugh : No, I'll just add, Juan, on your comment on coverages. So -- and restructuring -- so Shankh mentioned, we restructured a Legend lease in the quarter. We also restructured another triple-net lease in the quarter. And I would think about it from the timing makes sense given what we've talked about in the past, which is our operators were staying current with rent and resetting rents when they're staying current, and there's no line of sight and recovery doesn't make sense for other party. So I think what you've seen here is an ability to come to the table on Legend to get to an agreement that makes sense for both parties, and we think we'll do very well for Welltower shareholders over time. But as you look at the Welltower triple-net portfolio coming out of the first quarter, we're at mid-80s coverage on a portfolio that's 70%, 70.5% occupied. So, I think -- the important thing about the sustainability of that, I think, is quite high, given our view on the recovery. We said it all along. It's all recovery dependent, but we saw a strong recovery last year. We've seen rents continue to be paid. And we think given the occupancy there and the outlook in general in the space and where coverages are currently at, we're a pretty strong spot as far as sustainability of these rents and coverage recovery over the coming quarters. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : So, Shankh, all your comments on the HR situation were obviously helpful to clear the air. I guess my question is if the HR HTA merger does close and actually goes through is the existence of that merged entity changed any of the strategic dynamics for Welltower in the MOB category, that is the positive or the negative that are worth calling out at this stage? Or is that merger really is just expected to be immaterial to either MOB industry pricing going forward or just perhaps immaterial to what Welltower is trying to accomplish in the MOB area based on what you see now? Shankh Mitra : Steve, I have no comments on HR HTA merger. I will say that it remains a fragmented industry that one player size or lag thereof doesn't really make a difference. It's a health system driven industry and remains a very, very fragmented industry. So I have no comments other than the fact we don't see anything changing. But I will offer a comment that I already have offered and bore you with details of what I've already said. At Welltower, we don't have a strategic acquisition. The only strategy that we have is to make money on a per share basis for existing shareholders. That is the only strategy we follow. And anything that doesn't fit to that model, we don't do it, right? So please understand, never count on us to do a strategic acquisition because we'll never will. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : I just wanted to have one follow-up. Tim, when you kind of looked at the second quarter guidance, obviously, NOI growth is kind of above FFO growth. And I know you kind of highlighted a couple of issues that seem to be pulling that down FX, G&A and development deliveries. I guess my question really is, as you move into the back half of the year and maybe into '23, do you see some of those headwinds dissipating? And should we start to see growth materially accelerate in line with NOI growth? Or does some of those headwinds persist for a bit longer? Tim McHugh : Yes. Thanks, Steve. And I think this is -- this will expand a bit on the comment in my opening remarks around just our continued steady allocation of capital to distressed situations, near-term dilutive, even developments, the idea that we're seeing core earnings growth that's really driving the portfolio now. And we're making long-term capital allocation decisions that are going to create sustainable growth over a multiyear period. And if I kind of take that in think about it in perspective of this quarter, and talked about same-store NOI growth on a year-over-year basis. So you go back to the second quarter of 2021, on the call, I spoke to a $0.77 per share number, if you back out out-of-period government grants. So this compares to $0.835 number ex HHS with our 2Q guide. And I think the right way to think about bridging this is kind of three different buckets. So you've got the core portfolio, which is to your comment on same-store driven by same-store growth, 9% cash same-store growth equates to about lever 10% FFO growth number. Then you've got accretion from investments over kind of the last three quarters, you've got an offset of $0.03 from a combination of higher interest expense, higher G&A and then lower exchange rates on a year-over-year basis. So if you dig in that investment accretion number a bit more, over the last three quarters, we have invested about $4.8 billion in capital. We've delivered another $500 million in developments. So we've got $5.3 billion of capital fully funded on the balance sheet as of 3/31 and it's expected to yield in the low 4s in that guide. So keep in mind that these assets are significantly under earning where they're going to be long term and near term, it's because of operator transitions and lease-up within our recent deliveries. And of course, agency has also been a factor there. As these investments stabilize, they represent about $0.10 per share of FFO per quarter or $0.40 annually. So just from the last kind of three quarters of capital allocation. And lastly, I'd just note, we've talked about our NOI bridge in our investor presentation and this is under 1/3 of that upside represented there. So it's kind of a snapshot within our year-over-year growth, showing how the capital we're putting to work is just creating the sustained earnings growth over a number of years going forward. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Rich Anderson : Thanks for the follow-up. I had some technical difficulties, so hopefully not repeating a question. But in terms of the use of OP units, obviously, your distressed model would imply older assets and hence, the attractiveness of units in a deal. How would you model out funding one point what do you say, the pipeline is $1.5 billion pipeline, plus another $2 billion that is under -- in the works. What percentage of that would be OP-unit deals? And then how would you time line the remaining forward ATM equity just so we can get our models in the right order. Shankh Mitra : Okay. I will -- I hope I remember all the questions. First, we're not going to get into how many of these transactions will be in OP units or not. We might have given some indication of our previous press releases on some of the transactions. But beyond that, we're not going to get into how many will be or will not be. We have a general sense, but we're not going to get into that. But let's just talk about something else that you asked, which is if you think about the pipeline of $1.5 billion under contract, right? Think about what Tim said, the $1.8 billion of capital that's raised in the ATM, but not settled. We have a few hundred million dollars of disposition, and that's just the equity piece, right? You add X million that you think will come from the OP side, and then on a 65-35, you will see our investment sort of dry power for investment is actually $3-plus billion today, right? So that's sort of the question. And is there anything else I did not answer. I can't remember three questions at the same time, Rich. But -- so I think I answered all your questions, if not just call me on my cell and we'll just walk you through. But we have ample capacity to invest capital that in the pipeline or could be in the shadow pipeline. Pipeline costs to deals under contract. Shadow pipeline is what we are negotiating. And as I said, off that $2-plus billion, we might do zero because we transact at our price and the price is the price. And if we can convince someone to come to our price, we will do that transaction. So very much of we have the capital raised, but I cannot guarantee you that we apply to any of these transactions. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : Just one modeling related item for me. Could you give me a sense, Tim, what percent of food and utility costs are ultimately passed through to the tenant on the SHO portfolio? Tim McHugh : You think about a pass-through, I guess, you mean from like a direct billing? John Pawlowski : The higher rents, higher rents and higher fee income. Tim McHugh : I'd say, all of it, we have an operating profit in that business. So you're making a profit on 1 basis. You're certainly seeing part of the rationale for rent increase being to offset inflationary pressures in both those categories. But those aren't things -- food is something -- you're certainly in a lot of these different contracts you're highlighting as being a separate cost. Utilities generally not, but that's all wrapped into how pricing for the product works. So, I think when we talk about kind of seeing inflationary plus type rental increases. We're talking about the ability to offset the pressure we're seeing in food and utility inflation. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Chantal, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  Matt McQueen, General Counsel. You may begin. Matt McQueen : Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review high-level business trends and describe our capital allocation priorities before handing the call over to John, who will detail the operational trends and provide more details on the operating platform that he is building. Our total revenue is up 29% year-over-year, driven by both organic revenue growth and contribution from significant capital deployment activity over last 18 months. On a same-store basis, our senior housing operating portfolio revenue is up 11.5% year-over-year, driven by a 5% occupancy growth and a 4.5% REVPOR growth. All this translated into a 15.4% same-store NOI growth in Q2. Our annual EBITDA is back above $2 billion. Annualized in-place SHOP NOI is at $895 million.  Though shy of $923 million of pre-pandemic numbers, our revenue has surpassed pre-pandemic levels. However, I'm not happy with these results, which I would characterize mediocre at best. Why? Because the size of our portfolio is much bigger today, given the significant amount of capital deployment over the last 18 months and yet our quarterly results are not reflecting the cash flow that this portfolio is capable of generating. I'll give you a few things to reflect on. First, we have about 120 senior living -- senior housing properties that are generating negative cash flow today. In other words, if we just shut down these buildings, our earnings would be significantly higher. Clearly, we would not do such a thing as they were recently developed or going through a value and repositioning program. Hence, the timing mismatch.  Second, while I don't like to fix it on short-term trends and instead focus on long-term prospects of the business, I'll offer a few observations on the second quarter. We started the quarter with results coming in better than expected, only to get hilt simultaneously by multiple challenges primarily related to another COVID spike during the last couple of weeks of June. Only this time, we didn't see it coming as the testing requirements have been lowered in recent months, particularly for those residents who are not experiencing symptoms. In instances where few residents or team members develop symptoms and an entire building would be tested only to find out many asymptomatic residents and staff actually were COVID positive. This created some disruption to move-ins, but particularly impactful to the use of agency labor in June. Our operators are walking through as we speak and made very good progress in July. Let me dig into some recent trends even a bit more. From a demand standpoint, we always see first half of July as two last weeks, similar to the last weeks of December as families celebrate 4th of July weekend and don't usually move parents and grandparents in. This July, we lost an additional week. And as a result, almost a whole month was shut from a move-in perspective before we gain significant traction later in the month with tour activities returning to the levels experienced in June. We and our operators have a few theories of why that might be the case. One, the hyper-positivity rate of COVID over 20%. Despite people on a reporting to government, families know from home testing they're COVID positive and are delaying move-ins as they wait for this wave to subside. And number two, travel. Summer travel has surged as families took advantage of looser COVID restrictions. Again, I would describe this as our conjecture because we don't know for sure. But we are clearly seeing broad-based demand recovery continues, particularly towards the second half of the month in terms of leads and tours, which led to a recent rebound in move-ins across the portfolio over the last couple of weeks. On the cost side, it is important that you understand the progress we made on the agency labor. In the U.S., most of our operators are decreased from June to July, resulting largely from a favorable net hiring trends. The July books have not closed yet, we're expecting a decline in agency labor expense in high-single digit from month of June. In terms of net hiring, our operators have continued to make significant momentum with July increase alone in headcount nearly equal to the net hires of past six months of the year combined. As a result, we're already starting to see benefit of this trend, which should reduce the dependence on agency labor in the second half of the year. The downside of high-frequency data is that you get a lot of noise. And I strongly believe that's what you're seeing in the numbers today, a lot of noise. I encourage my team and will encourage you not to confuse any short-term high-frequency noise whether good or bad as a signal and project that into the future prospect of the business. For a few quarters, I've been talking about the run rate earnings or the true earnings part of this portfolio being significantly different from our current reported earnings. Clearly, some of the anticipated second half growth has slipped into the next year, but this should only be a timing mismatch. As we focus on '23 and '24, I continue to believe that this earnings power will shine through. Before I move on to the capital allocation priorities, let me make a comment on ProMedica. When we bought HCR ManorCare portfolio out of bankruptcy, we did not outsource our underwriting to rating agencies. Clearly, there was no way for us to predict a global pandemic or a day when almost every hospital system in the country would lose money similar to what happened in Q1 of this year because of COVID. We got comfortable because our basis of $57,000 per skilled nursing bed, we saw very minimal risk of permanent capital loss, which is at the core of how we think about risk. Of all the structuring bells and whistles aside, which we're very proud of, we fundamentally believe investment basis not cash flow in a given building at a given point in time determines investment success. Having said that, the ProMedica team has been able to make reduced agency labor almost by half over the last four months and significantly narrowed their operating losses. We have below market basis, and thus, below market rent here. I remain very comfortable with our rent and longer-term expected IRR from this investment that we discussed with you when we did this deal four years ago. Turning to the capital deployment. I cannot overstate how favorable of an environment we find ourselves in today. During the second quarter, our off-market, privately negotiated transaction machines kept humming, having deployed an additional $1.1 billion of capital. Today, there is definite stress in the lending environment given the significant rate and credit volatility and increasing recession talk. Cap rates are going up across the board and most institutional capital is waiting to see where the chips fall. We're seeing many high-quality opportunities, and we think the environment will only get more favorable as Fed continues to raise rate at a rapid clip. Our pipeline remains robust, having replenished after all of our Q2 and Q3 closings. Our fundamental investment thesis remains intact. One, we need to buy at a favorable basis relative to replacement cost; and two, we need to be able to add value through our platform. We're not spread investing deal junkies and instead remains laser focused on total return or unlevered IRR. I continue to believe this year will be a record year for Welltower from a capital deployment standpoint.  Cost of capital has surged for everybody, including governments and access to capital remains very sparse for most people. In this environment, we remain in a very favorable capital position with $2 billion-plus of equity capital that is raised but not settled and almost full availability of our $4 billion line. Sellers who did not like our price six months ago are realizing that glossy broker package and nonbinding LOI are not cash in a bank. This environment reinforces the value of a counterparty like Welltower, which always acts on a very simple principle. We say what we do and we do what we say. And in that vein, as our long-term investors have come to expect from us, we exercise utmost discipline on every transaction we look at, large or small and will not chase any deal. As we have said in the recent past, price is the price, and we only act in a manner that creates long-term value for -- part share for our owners.  With respect to capital deployment over the last 18 months, some of you have asked me if I'm satisfied with the performance of these properties. In many cases, in the case of many of these acquisitions, including some larger ones, the answer is no. The same-store challenge that I have described above are accentuated in many non-same-store properties, which are being repositioned through operator changes. However, I do believe that we have turned the corner as we approach the completion of our operator transition and system integration for the COVID class of acquisitions. We should see significant progress from these properties as we enter next year. Please recall, we make investment decisions based on long-term IRR with an exit cap rate going up every single year from the duration of the ownership. And we feel strongly about achieving those return targets as we have discussed with you. As frustrating as near-term challenges of operator transition might be for reported earnings and trust me, I share those frustrations with you, we have to do what's right for long-term interest of our owners. I will give you two examples. Vintage and Gracewell, two of the most ill-fated HCN acquisition from many months ago. Despite some of the most coveted locations and CapEx plans, these assets did not live up to our expectations. We finally pulled the plug over last 12 months, frankly, because we're not permitted to do so earlier. Our Gracewell assets were transferred to Care UK and the Vintage assets were mostly transferred to Oakmont with one each to Kisco and Cogir. Oakmont has already made incredible progress with the first tranche of the asset they received last fall, with occupancy up 13%, and I believe you will see this repeated in the most recent tranche as well. Care UK is having similar success with Gracewell assets taking occupancy above 80%. And I believe they will be stabilized or get close to it in 2023. We made similar decisions for our other properties, which come with some short-term pain. But as we capital allocators strive every day to create per share value by compounding over a long period of time, while we hope near-term priorities do not conflict with those long term, practically speaking, we often encounter situations where those time horizons diverge. And it is critical for our investors to understand that at these crossroads, we'll always follow the path to long-term value creation at the expense of short-term gains. The good news is that -- all of these, as my partner, John Burkart, would say, is baked in the cake.  With that, I'll hand the call over to John, who will describe to you perhaps the most exciting set of initiatives that will transform the business as we know today and creates tremendous value for our residents, team members, operating partners and most importantly, our shareholders. John? John Burkart : Thank you, Shankh. My comments today will touch upon the performance of our operating business and provide additional color regarding our vision for senior housing as well as an update on our platform initiatives.  Starting with our medical office portfolio. In the second quarter, our outpatient medical business sequentially increased occupancy by 30 basis points and delivered 2.5% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter. We continue to see strong retention rates over 89% in the quarter, good demand and rising new lease rates. Now turning to our senior housing operating platform -- portfolio. The recovery in the sector continues. As Shankh mentioned, revenue in our same-store portfolio accelerated to 11.5% in the second quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. All three regions showed good revenue growth led by the U.S. and UK with growth of 13.1%, 14.7%, respectively. The revenue for the quarter was driven by a 500 basis point increase in occupancy and another quarter of healthy rate growth. Sequentially, the portfolio increased occupancy 100 basis points during a period in which sequentially average occupancy has historically been slightly negative. While expenses grew at a rate of 10.5%, our operators continue to control [EXPOR] or expense per occupied room, which only grew at a rate of 3.5% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. And as Shankh indicated, we're encouraged by recent trends in terms of agency hiring and new hiring, which we believe should drive a deceleration in the second half expense growth. Despite short-term challenges driven by COVID, the tight labor market and inflationary pressures, the portfolio delivered 15.4% year-over-year same-store NOI growth in the period, the second highest in the company's history with the U.S. portfolio generating over 20% same-store NOI growth. Going forward, we expect the portfolio to deliver outside NOI growth over a multiyear period with strengthening supply and demand backdrop compounded by our efforts to optimize the business, which I'll get to shortly. Regarding the overall market, the traffic this summer has been influenced by COVID in various ways. For example, the traffic was very good in June and then fell significantly as expected for the 4th of July weekend and continue to remain low until it accelerated in the last couple of weeks of July We had total July traffic was about equal to total June traffic. We expect to increase traffic in the later part of July to lead to increased move-ins in August. The average occupancy for the portfolio in July was up over 40 basis points in the same-store portfolio. I also want to quickly comment on recent management transitions within the SHO portfolio. As we make adjustments to our operators' portfolios and the related assets are in transition, we appropriately remove them from the same-store portfolio as they tend to underperform early in the transition and subsequently outperformed later in the transition which can create noise in the same-store portfolio performance. This is very similar to removing an asset for full renovation. Transitions take substantial amounts of time from the point of notice to the actual transition of management which negatively impacts staffing, sales leads and other operational aspects of the asset. The challenges the new operator faces upon takeover are significant. However, over time, they get resolved. And of course, the assets performance improves over the pre-transition baseline, which is the purpose of the transition to begin with. The fact that we have 59 assets in transition is meaningful and that management is willing to take short-term earnings pain for improved performance in the future. If we had not removed transition assets from the same-store portfolio, our year-over-year NOI growth for the quarter would have been 14.9%. Bottom line, strategic transitions are undoubtedly worth it, and they can drive significant value despite creating near-term noise for the same-store portfolio. Shifting to an update on the operating platform. Previously, I mentioned the opportunity to fundamentally change the growth potential of this business by creating a full-scale operating platform and bringing operational excellence to our senior housing portfolio. In terms of industry life cycle, I would place the senior housing business in the infancy phase, but rapidly transitioning into the growth phase. This is very similar to the multifamily business years ago, whose transformation I witnessed firsthand. Businesses that are in infancy phase of the industry life cycle focus on effectiveness, which is essential. Without it, the business would not be able to exist long term. As an industry transitions from the infancy phase to the growth phase continuing to remain effective as the core objective is essential. However, the winners focus on operational excellence, including efficiency. The analogy that I've used is the diner business of the 1950s. To survive and thrive, you had to serve a good meal, a good burger, fries and shake in the case of the McDonald Brothers. However, to grow as the industry moved from its infancy to growth phase, a focus on operational excellence was imperative, including an obsessive focus on efficiency, which is what Ray Kroc did when he franchised McDonald's. The senior housing operators faced many small business challenges, including the inability to recruit and retain top talent and key functions from technology and data analytics to process and facilities management due to their size and inability to compete from a compensation perspective. Additionally, the fee-based structure limits the economic incentive to fully invest in optimizing the business as an owner-operator would. For example, if a fee manager is paid 5% of revenues, the most they would logically spend to collect $1 of revenue is $0.05, whereas owner operators would theoretically invest $0.99 to collect $1. As you all know, we have worked to change this unfavorable incentive structure through our aligned RIDEA 3.0 contracts. And we are now working on our next generation of contracts that will provide Welltower with a greater ability to help address senior housing operators small business challenges. These challenges are across the board, including basic functions to illustrate in a relatively simple areas such as billing. In the two reviews we performed, we identified that care revenue was underbilled by 25% or more, meaning that the necessary quality of care was provided to the resident. However, they were under billed. Other challenges are much greater, including keeping up with modern consumer expectations such as building-wide, high-speed Internet connectivity, identifying and integrating quality technology systems and creating and delivering real time, insightful and actionable reporting to improve operational results. Focusing on operational excellence is more than a digital transformation. It's about people, processes, data and technology, recognizing that everything starts with people. Our residents living at our communities, the employees serving those residents and the operators leading the effort. We start by focusing on the customer experience and the employee experience and optimizing the various processes. Then we evaluate the data that may -- that we may leverage to draw meaningful insight into the business in a way that improves the experience of the various stakeholders. Finally, we implement cutting-edge technology to simplify and automate the processes as we will provide real-time actionable, insightful information, improving the customer and employee experience while optimizing results. This isn't simply about buying the latest software. It's about fundamentally transforming the business. Over the years, many businesses have transformed from buying books to used cars to buying homes and finding vacation rentals. Digital transformations have fundamentally changed these businesses and improve the overall experience. One of the key imperatives of operational excellence is the recognition that data is the asset. There is no entity in this space better positioned to leverage data than Welltower as we are effectively building the operating platform to improve the overall experience on what we call Alpha, our data analytics platform that has been developed over the last six years. Welltower will improve the customer and employee experience and create shareholder value through leading transformation of the business.  I have gone from full emergence and observation to planning and now action mode. I will not give away all the details of my future playbook, but I will say the following : We are moving very fast. Several recent highlights include forming an internal multidisciplinary team of experts focused on improving the senior housing operations in Q2, hiring a Chief Technology Officer in Q2 to lead the technology aspect of the operating platform, completing the implementation of Welltower's ERP last week, which is central to this effort. And frankly, I want to thank the Welltower team that executed this massive project with great speed and excellent execution. Initiating a data analytics pilot on the correct information that we have available with an expected rollout over the next six months. This step alone will enable us to start driving value. Finally, creating the sales force automation plan with expectations to launch a pilot in early 2023. We have numerous other modules in the works and we'll update as appropriate. Although this is a huge effort, Welltower is uniquely positioned to execute it faster than historically possible. Our strategy is to leverage existing quality modules and only create new modules where they don't exist or where they give us a strategic advantage, such as our revenue management module, which we're developing. Another unique benefit that Welltower has relates to the number of top quality operators in our portfolio. We are separating the pilots of the modules into parallel initiatives, each with a different operator, which will minimize the potential delays that can be caused by a lack of employee bandwidth or overall fatigue and have slowed down other transformations. Ultimately, as we perfect each module, we will then rapidly roll it out to the broader group. This business transformation will continue to deepen and widen the moat Welltower has built while improving the overall experience of all stakeholders. I'll now turn the call over to Tim. Tim McHugh : Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2022 results, the performance of our triple net investment segment in the quarter, our capital activity, a balance sheet liquidity update; and finally, our outlook for the third quarter. Welltower reported second quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.20 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.86 per diluted share, which included $17 million of Provider Relief Funds from the Department of Health and Human Services, approximately $11 million or $0.02 per share more than was assumed in our initial guide for the quarter. This quarter represented our second consecutive quarter with a year-over-year normalized FFO growth since the start of the pandemic, a positive 8.9% or 7.7% when normalized on HHS funds received and year-over-year changes in FX rates. We also reported our second consecutive quarter of positive total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 8.7% year-over-year growth. Turning to our triple net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. These statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending March 31, 2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 9.9% year-over-year, driven by improvements in rent collections and leases currently on cash recognition and the early impact of rental increases tied to CPI. Trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage increased 0.01x to 0.83x in the quarter.  Next, our long-term post-acute portfolio grew same-store NOI by positive 2.8% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage is 1.31x. And lastly, health systems, which is comprised of our ProMedica Senior Care joint venture with the ProMedica Health system, which had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was negative 0.29x as operation continued to be impacted by high agency utilization in the first quarter. Turning to capital market activity. We continue to enhance our balance sheet strength and position the company to capitalize on our robust and highly visible pipeline of capital deployment opportunities by utilizing our ATM program to efficiently fund those near-term transactions. At the start of the second quarter, we sold 18 million shares via forward sale agreement at initial weighted average price of approximately $87.67 per share for expected gross proceeds of $1.6 billion. We currently have approximately 22.5 million shares remaining unsettled, which are expected to generate future proceeds of $2.0 billion. Taken together, our unsettled equity proceeds includes some committed OP units on pipeline deals and $257 million of expected property dispositions and loan payoff proceeds, totaled $2.3 billion in equity capital, providing ample capacity to fund our current investment pipeline. During the quarter, we closed on an amended $4 billion unsecured revolving line of credit, along with an upsized term facility comprised of a $1 billion USD term loan and a $250 million CAD term loan. At quarter end, when factoring in cash and restricted cash balances, our liquidity position exceeded the $4 billion of borrowing capacity on our line of credit. And when combined with the previous mentioned $2.3 billion of unsettled equity proceeds and expected disposition proceeds, we remain in a very strong liquidity position. Lastly, moving to our third quarter outlook. Last night, we provided an outlook for the third quarter of net income attributable to the common stockholders per diluted share of $0.12 to $0.17, and normalized FFO per share of $0.82 to $0.87 or $0.845 at the midpoint. This guidance includes $7 million with HHS funds expected to be received in the third quarter. Excluding HHS funds, guidance represented a $0.005 increase at the midpoint from 2Q normalized FFO. This $0.005 increase composed of $0.025 from incremental SHO NOI growth and SHO investment activity and $0.01 from performance across the rest of our investment segments and from lower sequential G&A costs. This is offset by $0.03 of higher floating rate interest costs and unfavorable FX rates. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated third quarter total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 7% to 9%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical 1.75% to 2.75%, long-term post-acute of 2.5% to 3.5%, health systems of 2.75%, senior housing triple net of 5% to 6%; and finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 20%, driven by year-over-year revenue growth of 10%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation for approximately 400 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy growth and continued robust rate growth. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of the top line recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio, driven by a combination of rate and occupancy growth.  As I remarked last quarter, as we realize the recovery in our core portfolio, we have made the conscious decision to steadily allocate capital to distress under-operated and often initially diluted properties, along with high-quality development projects. While this capital allocation is the effect of offsetting some of our core growth today, it should substantially amplified in years to come. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim. If I may distract you all from the short-term noise and focus on the main drivers of long-term earnings and cash flow per share growth, there are really four large buckets that we must pay attention to : occupancy, rates, labor cost and external growth. In 2021, whenever we're hit by a massive COVID wave, it felt as though we are taking one step forward and two steps back in terms of occupancy, rates and labor costs. Thankfully, the health impact of COVID has been getting more mild and the psyche of the population has significantly improved. Now we are taking two steps forward and one step back in terms of occupancy and labor cost and it appears from the July trends that we're making that one extra step back forward very quickly. So COVID impacts are getting less pronounced and rebounds are getting quicker as we learn how to live with COVID. Despite the reported issues of agency labor, the team member count in our communities has grown significantly off let and we have not seen any let up -- though we have not seen any let up of the cost of labor, there is no question that we have seen the availability of labor increase meaningfully off let. The portfolio has almost the same net hiring in July as we had in the first six months of the year combined. Though our operators have had success in net hiring members over the last few months, as you can see from the case studies on Slide 7 and 8, it appears that the labor market is finally on demand from the significant success of hiring trends in July. Assuming these trends continue, this bodes very well for agency labor cost as we get second half of the year. And where we continue to make the largest strides is through pricing power. The recent COVID spikes have not in any way dulled our operators' ability to push through strong rates. What is particularly encouraging is the Street rates, which are up from high-single digits all the way up to 15%, 20% in case of some large operators. Given the sharp acceleration in growth of the senior population and plummeting new supply of few projects penciling for developers today, our confidence in driving occupancy and rate growth for the next few years continue to strengthen. As for external growth opportunities, our prospects, which have been very good are only getting better, the willingness of owners to transact has grown over the last two years as they struggled with COVID-related challenges and debt maturity. And now with recent surge in borrowing costs and tighter lending standards that are keeping many borrowers at bay. If we overlay all this with how John is fundamentally transforming our business, I have not been more excited of the future prospect of our firm. We know we need to translate all of this into significant higher earnings run rate and cash flow per share and our team, which thinks and acts like long-term owners is hyper focused on that mission.  With that, we'll open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Griffin with Citi. Michael Bilerman : This is Michael Bilerman here with Griff. Shankh, I was wondering if you can just step back and look, I appreciate the comment about the downside of using high-frequency data and the noise and effectively not to confuse the short term, whether it's good or bad to protect on the future. And you guys have been very all over COVID providing us a lot of business updates. And I think back in June, you use that data to lift guidance, right? And you issued the business update. And so I'm trying to understand whether you're thinking about a change and how you communicate to the Street and the reads that you're feeling, right? Because you took that data and you lifted the Street and you raised a bunch of equity and now things are a little bit lower. And I'm wondering, as you think about that short term, whether it makes sense to really start putting out the building blocks for all these things that you've done, I mean 20% of the portfolio has been bought since the late to 2020 and start to pencil that out on a three- to five-year basis and go through all the building blocks of all the deals you've done, the 120 assets that are negative cash flow and all these things to try to model out where that future growth really is because of all of these, what you call them noise today? John Burkart : Yes, Michael, I'll start with that and then Shankh can come in. I think the point on NAREIT and the guidance change there, I think Shankh spoke to this in the script. But we've tightened guidance at NAREIT based upon the trends that we saw and those trends reversed towards the end of the quarter and up towards the lower end of that range. So I hear you on the high frequency of data and frankly, what we've been trying to do give updates because the longer-term view has been tougher to project. And given COVID is a backdrop, right? And we've been trying to balance essentially since we've been able to be able to provide less of that long term need to provide more of that short-term information. And I will speak for Shankh, if you can give a comment on this. But I think part of the commentary on the short-term noise is just trying to see the long-term trends continue to be strong in the recovery side. And we're certainly focused on that, and we continue to evaluate that piece of it. And although we understand the market's need for frequent updates on data, we're trying to make sure that you see how we're looking at it and keeping our long-term focus on kind of the core fundamentals of the business. Shankh Mitra : Yes. I'll just add one thing, Michael. As I mentioned, if you look at when we got hit by BA.5, second half, it was about a week after NAREIT. And that impact, which is sort of followed through about the middle of July. And you probably have noticed that we provided another business update a few weeks ago, is to make sure that everybody knows that our view has changed because of things that we talked about NAREIT. So there was another business update, not just the ones that you mentioned. So we have -- we provide information as investors know. They see what we see. But fundamentally, as I mentioned in my last quarter call that all our -- we tell you how we think, but if we get hit by a COVID wave, are better off. I mentioned that in the last call, I mentioned that in five calls before that, and that continues. The good news here is with every passing wave, we're seeing the impact is lessening. And we're seeing the rebounds are getting faster. But the fact of the matter is we just went through one and rather we're sort of coming towards the tail end of one. And we have no way to project how and when we're going to see COVID in our communities. That's just not what we can do, and I'm not aware of anybody else can do. We're just telling you as we are seeing things, but we're hoping at least we're trying to help you understand the fundamentals of the business, right? For example, if you can see, there's a tremendous amount of, obviously, noise on the agency labor. If you look at that was obviously reported quarter of June, we see a pretty meaningful improvement in July. But if you truly see the improvement that we are excited about, it's the net hiring number because July net hiring number doesn't impact July agency numbers, right? It's sort of -- there's a lag between when you hire people versus when they impact your numbers because you got to train them and there's a lag between when you hire them and then they hit the floors, et cetera, right? So we're just telling you what we are seeing. And it's important that we communicate if trends change because of COVID and otherwise. But we -- I hope that you appreciate that we remain transparent, and we report things to you as we see things. And if things change, things change. Operator : Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra : So maybe, Shankh and John, Tim, as well, I just want to kind of take the pricing power comments you echoed and just think about leaving costs aside, as you mentioned, COVID comes and goes, it's tough to predict. But would it be unfair or reasonable to say given what you're seeing on the bumps, the re-leasing spreads, as we head into '23, given demand supply, pricing power should only accelerate, and I should not be surprised if we see call it, a mid- to high single-digit REVPOR growth for a couple of quarters? And lastly, can you just translate that pricing power into your latest thoughts on margins in the senior housing space? Shankh Mitra : Vikram, I'm not going to get into sort of giving you guidance on pricing power in particularly for next year's pricing power. But I will tell you that we are seeing that Street rates are significantly accelerating. There has been talks -- not talks. I mean I was in the UK for a few weeks. Our UK operators are talking about giving a midyear pricing increases in September, October time frame. I've not seen that before. There are some talks of U.S. operators thinking about something of that nature. But most importantly, Street rates are just going up very significantly. So all this should translate into continued pricing power in our portfolio, especially if you look at next year, demand supply is even more favorable, right? But we're trying to optimize the revenue growth and frankly, so from our standpoint, we think that pricing power should continue. As you can appreciate that we had pricing power last year, right? So we obviously had REVPOR growth. We continue to push that, and we'll -- as we move forward, you'll see that we'll continue to push that pricing power. As I've suggested before, the two types of pricing power that you should see. Frankly speaking, the one you are seeing today is arises from the need of pushing pricing because of cost inflation, and that's sort of we're sort of going through that. But as we stabilize different buildings, you will see another set of pricing power which is we're raising prices because we don't have a lot of rooms to sell, right? So hopefully, you see a lot of that going through next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel Bernstein with Capital One. Daniel Bernstein : I just wanted to ask something quickly about the differences in labor cost growth between AL, mem care and IL wellness and how that's factoring kind of into your capital allocation of what you want to buy and invest in? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So on the wellness side, there's not a lot of cost, right, on the people side. So you don't have that. Though, I will say that sort of cost mostly driven by taxes as well as the energy cost increase. Our capital allocation is not driven by what we think of labor. You can just price that in. It is driven by what is the opportunity set, was the price relative to what the replacement cost is. So that's how we think about it. And if we have to think -- let's just say that you come with this idea that labor cost is going to be high forever, which I don't think is going to be the case. Labor cost has been a problem for this industry for a very long period of time. And as I said, who are finally probably see that it's on the map, right? We'll see whether -- how that plays out, but we'll likely probably see the first sort of shot across the bow. But you can absolutely price that in. We're price-driven investors, not necessarily. So we take some thematic ideas and just run with it because you can price that in. Hopefully, that's helpful then. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : Could you just talk about the recurring CapEx spend trajectory. I see it is expected to kind of more than double through September from last year's pace. Is that higher spend due to some deferred or lower spending in the past few years during lockdowns and we're just catching up? Or much higher construction costs, a bit of both? And then kind of an extension of that, how that CapEx spend should trend in the next year and help fuel increased competitiveness of your properties and ultimately, revenue growth potential. Tim McHugh : Yes, I'll start with that, and then John can add anything. Part of it is, we have been certainly in 2022 playing a bit of catch-up in the costs of senior housing space and just the buildings being less accessible over 2020 and 2021. And then efficient for us a lot of the acquisitions we've made have had substantial value-add opportunities. So we've highlighted that with some of the larger ones and explicitly stated how much kind of redevelopment capital or value-add capital we put into it. But I think that's what's driving that right now is a combination of a little bit of deferred or catch-up capital from a period of time in which the buildings were for safety reasons less accessible. And on top of that, we put a lot of capital to work into opportunities that have high return value-add investment. John Burkart : Yes. And I'll just add. You're actually pulling something from a certain sense from a future script because I talked about the operating platform. The next initiative that I'm focusing on in a big way or workflow really relates to capital and internal investments, what I'd call it as how we reposition the portfolio, our senior housing business portfolio age is at the absolute sweet spot, just right under 20 years old on average, providing tremendous opportunities to reposition those assets. So I'm actually building out a capital team right now, and we will align our CapEx with our value-add initiatives and drive pretty substantial value over the coming three to five years. So it will be a very big effort, and we're at the very front of that effort right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Austin Wurschmidt : I'm just curious for the 120 senior housing facilities currently generating negative cash flow, what is the NOI drag from those facilities. Can you give us what percent of the $538 million of total NOI upside in SHOP that they represent? And do you expect them to stabilize at a faster pace than the overall portfolio? Shankh Mitra : Well, Austin, we're not going to give you a number on how much capital -- how much cash flow that's losing today? Maybe I'll talk to Tim and see if we can kind of quantify that for you. Should they grow faster, the answer is obviously, yes, right? They are losing money because they're at a lower occupancy. And as they stabilize over, say, a number of years, just from the base they're coming out of, and if you think about the trajectory of the margin, they should grow faster. But a lot of these properties have been recently built or we bought the properties at a very, very low occupancy, right? So if you look at the last tranche of, for example, the StoryPoint acquisitions we did, I think the average occupancy was like 40%, right? So if you think about it, average age of the portfolio, I think that we bought is between 2 to 4 years, and they're at 40% occupancy. So there's no question there's a lot of those buildings that opened in last year, 1.5 years, and we bought a lot of these things, right, from developers from multifamily developers from banks. They're just a drag. But the point here is they're not a sequential sort of a linear progress to your NOI growth, right, as they go from a negative sort of margin to the margin inflection and that sort of margin grows after you hit the J curve, right? So that's sort of the way to think about it. I mentioned that for you to understand that something very simple, right? Just take an example of our East 56th Street property. That property opened 7.5 months ago. It's what? It's probably low 30% occupied today. And our average rate of those residents that we have received, of the people who are living there is $23,000, $24,000, okay? Clearly, that has negative margins. But you would think about it as we thought about that property when we developed it, we're getting significantly high rates and trajectory of East sub is doing better than we thought. Still that's a negative value add. So as you think about negative value, as you think about putting a multiple on our income understand that you are valuing 120 buildings at a negative value. That's all, right? So I'm not going to add anything more to that at this point, but something to just reflect on what's sort of dragging on our earnings and cash flow today. Operator : Our next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : On John Burkart's operational initiatives, what's his team hoping to accomplish and really to build confidence these endeavors can bear fruit. How are you guys measuring success? And what's the upside here? John Burkart : The measuring success -- actually, let's go back to what I hope to accomplish is, again, really bringing modern processes, technology, et cetera, to the business. And to give you an example, a very specific example. So one of the things I tested when I came in as I tested how we respond to our customer, customer experience. And what it found out after about 200 customer inquiries, was that 50% were never returned. And of the 50% that were returned, the average time was about 13 business hours. So if a family member needs help on a Monday, and my father falls or something like this and I decide he needs to go into assisted living. I might get a call back on a Wednesday or I might not ever. That's a horrible experience and that is a very solvable situation. If you look at the current CRMs that are in place, they're basically relying upon the salespeople inputting data. It's like I write a sticky note. I put it in a file. That's my CRM. It's glorified because it's electronic, but it's the same thing. So for example, I went to one of our large operators and gave them their results, which were six out of six calls did not get returned, six out of six, zero return and they said, \"Gee, I'm shocked because I'm looking on my desk at our report, our pretty report, PowerPoint report that shows that 85% of the phone calls that come in, we respond to it an hour.\" So that's shocking, but this is all something that we can work ourselves through because you can just test it yourself. I said, but first, tell me how does that get reported. And he said, \"Well, it gets reported because our salespeople report it themselves.\" Well, therein lies the issue. The tracking systems weren't in place, et cetera, et cetera. It's really a bunch of sticky notes from a receptionist that get lost and picked up by the janitor and the calls get lost. So that's the type of professionalism that we're going to apply to the business, and the results will be to the financial benefit, most obviously, increased occupancy, increased rates and a better overall experience for the consumers. So that hopefully answers the question. As far as the details and time lines, we're obviously not giving that out. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : I appreciate the case study pages showing that you're hiring in recent months. I guess I still don't have a sense for the magnitude of understaffing, assuming occupancy starts climbing. So to the extent we get positive surprises on the occupancy upside is next six to 12 months, are you going to have to lean on agency expense to kind of meet that demand? Or do you think properties on average or staff properly right now to handle additional occupancy? Shankh Mitra : I think, John, that's a very fair comment, which I should -- we talked about July was obviously a very positive month for net hiring. And we hired -- for the portfolio overall, our operating partners have hired as many people in July as they did six months ago. But what we haven't told you that hiring puts us finally to a 2% plus above what the total number of employees were last year. We should have added that. It's a fair question -- comment from year end. So as you recall, this whole agency sort of cost drama started about a year ago, and we have finally worked our way through that with this July hiring we're finally about 2% above where total employee count was on a net basis above last year. So what you're saying is possible, but I would say probably unlikely as we are finally seeing, as I said -- I talked a little bit about that that -- our operators have been talking about the overall availability of labor is increasing in June, it feels like, again, I'm going to be very careful how I describe it because it is not that we know everything that's happening. But it feels like that finally that labor market is on the mend from -- at least from an availability, for sure, it's on the mend. And hopefully, that translates into price of labor in not a distant future, but at this point, at least, we're hopeful -- not just hopeful, we're seeing it in the numbers that agency lever, which were obviously pretty ugly number in June, but came down in July. And hopefully, obviously, there's net hire numbers in July, you'll see that should impact pretty positively as we get towards the end of the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : I wanted to actually touch on the study that you just answered, but I guess the -- just to frame it slightly differently, not to get redundant here. What percent of total open positions across all the senior housing were filled in July? If you think of it that way, are we talking 75%, nearly 100%. I think that's 2% above where you were before, it's still kind of hard to, I guess, frame that perfectly in our own minds. So another thing is just on the double staffing, what's the typical time period of training where you have that double staffing? Are we talking weeks or months? Just any rule of thumb would help around that, too, as we think of magnitude of potential expense reduction for 3Q versus 4Q, et cetera? Shankh Mitra : So net hiring in July was about 3%, just about 3% of total employee count. And you should think about the second half of your -- of course, you should think about weeks, not months. So July higher should impact August and September sort of agency numbers. There is a case study that you can see on Page 7 and 8. Page 8, we'll show you, this is an interesting case, right? Page 7 and 8 has two large operators, which constituted roughly half of our agency labor costs. Page 7 would show you an operator who has already made the strides and the cost has come down meaningfully. Let's just say, call it from a $2 million a month to, call it, $0.5 million a month. Rough numbers in a matter of four months, call it, from April to July. The Page 8 shows you an operator, which actually has it. The numbers have been pretty much flat from June to July. But if you look at the number of hours booked, that has come down pretty significantly which tells you if that trend continues, they should see significant improvement in August and September, right? So we in case take two examples. I want to give you diversity of example and two consequential examples with sort of two constitute of pretty much half of the total cost. But hopefully, that sort of gives you a sense of what we are seeing. Rather than predicting the future, we're sort of giving you the positioning of our portfolio, which probably should help fully translate that into the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : I was wondering, can you tie together the 4.5% on same-store revenue REVPOR growth? And maybe talk a little bit about the sequential trend there relative to Q1? And can you dissect a little bit and talk about roll downs and just, I guess, pricing by unit type? Tim McHugh : Yes, yes. And I will -- on the REVPOR side, I think the way to think about it is we talked about this last quarter, but we get a large amount of -- half of our portfolio roughly resets on Jan 1. So you see that occurred -- that part of the portfolio actually happened to also be heavily weighted towards our higher acuity unit types. The Jan 1 increases tend to be the daily billers. The daily billers are the part of the business that have your higher acuity assisted living weighting. So you saw those increases in the first quarter and what you're seeing now kind of spreading from the first quarter to the second quarter is we've talked about in this business, historically, you've seen kind of 10% or high single-digit roll-downs between move-in and move-out rates. A lot of it's acuity related, but that's actually -- that got as wide at 20-plus percent last year and it started to tighten into the mid- to low single-digit range. So you're seeing some of those Jan 1 increases I'd say bleed off a little bit with there is still some negative leasing spreads on that, and that's being offset by annual increases that are hitting throughout pretty much evenly throughout the year and the other half of the portfolio. Shankh Mitra : And as I mentioned, my last call, right, if you have pretty much a scenario, which we haven't seen in a long time, which is if Street trade continues to go up, the way it is going up, that gap will continue to narrow. And sort of it is conceivable that they come very close. We have seen a couple of operators where actually it has crossed over. But there's a portfolio-wise, it is conceivable that they come very, very close and that negative re-leasing spread that comes from the acuity clip that Tim talked about goes away. And so but remember, what we are also talking about, this is sort of a problem that you chase again as you raise -- you send the in-house increase letters again, right? So and you change that number again, right? So this is a phenomenon. But frankly speaking, we haven't seen in a long time, eight or nine years where Street rates are getting very close to in place. So we're pretty encouraged by that. Operator : Our next question comes from David Rodgers with Baird. David Rodgers : Shankh, you and Tim both mentioned ProMedica, I think, in your prepared comments. And you went through some of the coverage ratios and agency labor statistics and basis. But I was kind of curious the fact that you spent a little bit more time this quarter. Was that just related to where their coverage has gone and you're reiterating comfort with that? Or are you having conversations or have they approached you about maybe making changes? I guess that would be the first question. And the second question is what about that portfolio relative to the other portfolio that you own? -- has made them kind of lag in some of the recovery statistics that you've mentioned. Shankh Mitra : Yes. So I'm going to be -- I'm going to repeat what I said before. First is to understand, a lot of that portfolio has a skilled nursing, which has been impacted, obviously, very significantly. And it has been a very significant hit from agency labor in that portfolio. What we report is a one-quarter lag sort of a four-quarter average type of EBITDAR.  What I mentioned -- if you look at -- reread the transcript, you will see that the improvement that they have seen has happened really in the last four, five months. And that they have significantly narrowed their loss as occupancy has gone up and agency labor has come down, right? So that's sort of the overall underlying picture of what's happening.  It is very important for you to understand, as we have described before, that rent doesn't come from the four-walls of [indiscernible], right, that rent -- with the only reason we did that transaction, -- they -- and we mentioned this before, that rent was guaranteed by the market share, right? So that's very important for you to understand where that lies. As I mentioned again, I'm going to say this again, as I've mentioned before, right? We fundamentally believe that below-market basis translate into below-market rent, like there's nothing -- there's no special insight into that. If you have a low basis and your market rent constant, you will get to a level by market rent, right? So on an average basis, for example, on the average bed rate, the ProMedica portfolio is roughly around $7,000 per bed of rent. If you look at any other skilled nursing provider, let's just take an example of Omega, you will see the average rent is about $10,000, right? So that sort of gives you a sense of if everything was exactly the same, the rent is 30% below, right? So they sort of give you order of magnitude. I'm not talking about specific because it's hard to compare assets from portfolio one to portfolio two, but that would give you a sense, which gives us a lot of comfort that about, a, first, our income from that portfolio; and b, what we strive to do, which is to achieve long-term returns as we deploy capital. And as I mentioned, I'm going to mention it again, I remain very comfortable that we're not losing our sleep over that income or that return from that portfolio. That\u2019s all I am going to say. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico : I was just hoping to understand for the operator transition assets in senior housing. What's embedded in the guidance for the third quarter about any incremental sequential NOI drag there since I think you said those assets are not in the same-store calculation. Tim McHugh : Yes, correct. They're not in the same-store. So the assets, just to clarify, the assets that we -- in our July business update, that we talked about transitioning. Those are still in the same-store portfolio, they completed the quarter in -- under the management of the prior manager. And then they're coming out going forward. From a sequential basis, we expect a slight drag from a [build] perspective, about 0.5% from those transitions. Operator : Our next question comes from Rich Anderson with SMBC. Richard Anderson : So I think we all get the message here on the short term versus the long term, but I want to see if I can get some kind of quantitive evidence of that. So the occupancy guide for the third quarter is 400 basis points year-over-year, and that seems to imply 120 basis points sequentially, which compares to 100 basis points sequential in the second quarter. So we didn't get the seasonal pop in occupancy and understand for the reasons you described. When you were sitting in your seat at NAREIT and you were thinking about the third quarter at the time, how much do you think we lost by virtue of what happened with the COVID wave in June and the kind of the lost month of July? And where do you think the sequential number, landing at 120 basis points as of now, would have been, if not for the disruptions that you faced after NAREIT? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So let's just -- I'll take the essence of your question, and there's no debate about the fact that for -- specifically for third quarter, and I mentioned this in my script that some of the growth has leaped into next year because we're not getting that growth in the third quarter. Why? Because we lost the month of July, right? So if you lose your traffic that much in first half of the month, it's very, very -- it's almost impossible to recover from that as you think through the sales cycle of tours translate into sales, right? So it's very important for you to understand that last month with sort of -- it's a very important month, right? So we got an average occupancy growth in that month, as John said, about 40-plus basis points, there should have been double that. And that's was not the case because we got hit. So the only good news here, as I will suggest to you, and I think John mentioned this in his script, that we started first, call it, first 10 days, first 15 days of July, but tours were 40% below June, like with just the market just went away. By the time we ended the month, we caught up on a cumulative basis almost to the 95% of June. So if you think about, you start at a 40% hole, and you end up at a 5% hole, that sort of suggest to you, there's a remarkable progress made in the second half. And that's sort of we're seeing that now the move-ins are coming back on back of the tours. But by no question, but absolutely no question, Rich, that we -- because of this COVID hits are sort of, just call it, try to be specific on something that it can be that we saw between mid-June to mid-July, has hit our June numbers on an expense basis, which sort of recovered in July or at least hopefully recovered a lot in July, and it hit revenue because all the tours went away. It hits revenue in July. I hope that sort of gives you a sense of how this wave hit us and how that translates from one side of the quarter from the other side of the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : John, I know you're hesitant to provide too many details on your data plan, but I wanted to touch on your comments in your prepared remarks that Well is initiating on a data analytics pilot that's expected to roll out over the next six months. I guess what does this actually mean? And how does this different from the company's current data analytic programs that you have right now? John Burkart : Yes. So, it's better to look at it versus the operating platform. So the operating platform will drive -- will provide tremendous amounts of data because we'll be able to gather all the nuanced information from the web hits the traffic all the way through. But currently, we can gather more information from our operators, and that's really the opportunity that I'm taking midterm is to gather some more. So we've been working with our operators to connect. And in this particular case, we connected with our cloud system to pull down on a daily basis the information that they currently have from the platforms that they're currently using. So we haven't done that level of detail before. We get good reporting from them, but now we're upping that gain. And so from an interim basis, that will inform us much better than we have right now from an operating level the company -- what the company has done from the investment side is untouchable. But from an operating perspective, there's some more opportunities that I'm going after and that should help us from an asset management level. Operator : Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just a longer-term question, I guess, you noticed some transitions happening and near-term drag for a long-term opportunity. But at this point, how should we think about the risk of further transitions into 2023? Are you confident that we're past 90% of any potential transitions? Or is that just part of the business where there's always going to be some laggards and maybe like I think about kind of Goldman calling 10% of the staff annually. Is that kind of the way we should think about? There's always going to be some underperformer you're going to kind of rectify that as things go? Or is this kind of -- we're at the end of that, given where we are in COVID and cyclically? Shankh Mitra : So Juan, I think the way you should think about it for the COVID class of acquisitions that we have done, the transition, operator transition, system integration, all of those things are reaching nearing completion, right? So they are nearing completion. Now from the perspective of what you are asking, which is more of a philosophical question than a planning question, right, we are of the belief that you have to earn your keep if you want to manage our properties. It's very simple, right? Managing our properties, which had substantial amount of capital is a given. And you see that in all other businesses, whether it's a competitive business, whether just take an example of multifamily, right? And if you look at people who are managers, fee managers, they expect to earn their right to manage for fee. And frankly speaking, in senior housing business, there has been very significant amount of complacency, and we have not seen that. So as long as people perform, we have absolutely no desire to move assets because it's disruptive. No one wants to do that. But if people don't perform, there will be transition. It's a lot of capital -- for our shareholders' capital are tied up into these buildings, but we're not going to see it tear and take underperformance. That's just not what we do. Near-term underperformance because something happened to an asset completely understandable. But as John mentioned to you, some of the basic operating standards are expected. And if people don't perform, they're not going to be in our portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Griffin with Citi. Michael Bilerman : It's Bilerman, again. I just had two quick follow-ups. Shankh just on ProMedica, who is funding the operating cash flow losses today? Or is the entity just taking on increased debt for that? So maybe you can just talk through the capital structure and how all of that's happening. And then secondarily, just going back to my opening question about sort of longer-term and focusing on all of the initiatives and investments that you've made, I think Burkart, when you were at Essex, you've put out a three-year plan, and I remember UDR and Aimco and there was a lot of that, do you think the company would benefit a little bit about -- you have done a lot of sending out all of the impacts and opportunities to start to understand the earnings as well as the asset value, NAV, because it just feels that the market is focused to short term and you can provide a lot more details. You've dropped little things like the transition, the $120 million negative cash flow, but actually getting the details and really putting the building blocks to your three-year return based on everything that's involved, I think, would be really helpful. So if you can address those two things, that would be good. Shankh Mitra : So I answer the first question. ProMedica is funding and the operating cash flows. As you guys know, it's an entity that has -- how their funding is very simple, that entity has really have $2 billion of cash on their balance sheet, so they're just using that cash to fund it. So John, do you want to add anything? John Burkart : Yes. I mean I will continue to provide more insight into the platform. And as I'm a very simple person, as you know, I call it the [indiscernible]. Literally, we'll start all the way from traffic, i.e., web and that type all the way through sales force management, all the way through the operating platform, the ERP, so to speak through every other aspect of the business, HRIS, et cetera. And we'll start to lay out more information. I will say from the past the -- my experience -- the companies typically aren't laying out specific time lines for dollars. You lay out paths as to what you expect to accomplish and how that will positively impact the business, but not necessarily time to dollars, and I don't intend to do that. But I'm glad to give more clarity over time. We're running extraordinarily fast at this point in time, and we'll provide some more detail on the coming calls and at NAREIT, et cetera. Tim McHugh : And Michael, just a continuation to answer to your first question. I think overall, you should certainly hear from us that we've adapted the way that what we've disclosed over the last 2.5 years in a pretty dynamic environment. So a lot of it has been driven certainly by what we think is important. And a lot of this has been driven by feedback from individuals with yourself and investors. So I hope you've seen that and certainly continued to have dialogue with the market on what is helpful to be seen, and we'll continue to adapt what we disclose based upon that. So you shouldn't think there'll be any change in the way that we -- our approach to that. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there\u2019ll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir. Matt McQueen : Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to describe our capital allocation priorities, ProMedica Senior Care transaction and the rapidly evolving capital markets environment. I will also review some high-level business trends before handling the call over to John, who will provide details on operational trends and a brief update on our operating platform. I'm very pleased with the progress we have made since we last spoke 90 days ago, despite a flattish earnings trends on a sequential basis, driven by several existing headwinds, including FX, interest rate and utility expenses, our underlying business is actually improving meaningfully and setting up for the coil spring recovery that we hoped for. In our senior housing operating business, same-store revenue is up 10.8% year-over-year, driven by strong occupancy gains, and most importantly, pricing power. 5.3% same-store rate growth is the best we have seen in our recorded history and I want to remind everyone that we're compounding already industry-leading rate growth from last year. From these early trends, I believe you will see a further improvement in Q4, which will create a strong setup for 2023. However perhaps what I'm most excited about is the progress we're making on the labor front with compensation for occupied unit is up 4.3% year-over-year, the lowest level of growth we have reported since the beginning of pandemic. Our operating partners are experiencing a significant surge in applications, which has translated into strong increase in net hiring. In fact, in September, total portfolio monthly contract labor spend was the lowest since August of 2021 and subsequently improved in October. We believe this trend will continue into year-end outside the normal pickup agency use during the holiday season and into well into the next year. We strongly believe the labor market is changing for the better, and it will help our sector to be a total standout amongst all real estate sectors next year on a relative basis. SHO portfolio same-store NOI growth was 17.6% in the quarter, led by U.S., which posted third quarter of 20-plus percent growth and assisted living product reported same-store NOI growth of an impressive 25.1%. Let me highlight three operating partners for you, that provide further insight into why I'm so pleased with our progress over the last 90 days. Number one, Oakmont. As you recall, we transitioned 10 top California assets to Oakmont in August while we expected some initial disruption to occupancy NOI during that transition. In actuality, we recognized an immediate benefits due to remarkable performance from Courtney's team. These assets have experienced a slight increase of NOI and occupancy despite challenges that are normally incurred during a transition. This is the first time I've seen a transition with no negative P&L impact, apart from the six assets we transition to Oakmont last year. I expect these properties as well as the other assets that we transition to Oakmont to add significantly to our 2023 growth. If you're visiting San Francisco this month for NAREIT Conference, I recommend you to join our property tour and experience firsthand the remarkable job this team has done. To my earlier point on shift of labor market during the summer, open positions across Oakmont platform was 16% of total jobs. It is down to low single-digit at this point. Number two, StoryPoint. StoryPoint is one of our best operating partners perhaps will be the source of biggest NOI swing next year, with a billion dollars of investment with low occupancy properties, which is generating approximately 2.7% yield in Q3. StoryPoint made remarkable improvement a top line on both occupancy and rates, but the properties have not generated a significant NOI in 2022, as these properties were just over the breakeven occupancy and agency cost was very detrimental. Their open positions are now down more than 50% through the end of October and we expect 80% reduction of agency by the end of this month. We believe that stabilized NOI for this group of portfolio is about circa $80 million, which will be substantially achieved in 2024. While will not close this gap in 2023, I expect will make significant strides next year, and really over the half year way mark. We cannot be more pleased with execution Dan and the team has pulled off. Number three Sunrise. Sunrise is our largest operator due to a national presence Sunrise experienced significant labor challenges and has had to rely on contract labor for last many quarters. Jack and his team has made remarkable progress in this area over the last 60 days. Contract labor down 52% from year-to-date run rate and I believe sunrise will be the biggest contributor to contract labor improvement in the coming months and quarters. Given strong rates Sunrise benefit from in this incredibly well located Welltower building, we should see extremely strong NOI growth contribution from Sunrise. While we're encouraged - very encouraged by these trends, and our fourth quarter guidance of 21% growth at the midpoint, I'll remind you that we are at the very early inning of senior housing recovery. We\u2019ll remain as excited as ever about the growth prospects in coming years and the 80-plus population growth will continue to accelerate and as new construction in the sector will come to come to near a standstill. In fact, 2023 should see 4.5% increase in 80-plus population. As you may have observed only 2,700 units got started in Q3. And frankly, I don't even understand how these people will make any money in development. While new development should continue to come down, assuming people want to develop to make any money. Another interesting phenomenon we're observing is that the thousands of units have been taken offline either because of obsolescence or because of higher and better use like behavioral health. As of 9/30, almost 15,000 units were taken offline on a TTM basis. I also want to highlight consistent and steady performance of our outpatient medical group under Ryan's leadership. Our retention rate for the quarter is a remarkable 92.7% and rent spreads are ticking up into the mid-3. Both new and renewal leases -- for both new and renewal leases, I'm pleased that our weighted average escalators are now about 3%. I'm also pleased that the low interest rate environment and the wall of capital that drove 2% to low 2% escalator seems to be a thing of the past. Kelsey-Seybold, which is our largest MOB tenant, and also represents a very significant portion of the Helmand pipeline was acquired by United Health during this summer. The significant credit upgrade of our largest tenant and our development client represents a meaningful value creation for our shareholders. The most significant change we observed in this, however, in the MOB space, is the remarkable widening of cap rates. I've stayed like a broken record for a long time that MOB cap rate made no sense to us, given where the forward view of inflation was relative to underlying growth rate on the cash flow. I'm pleased to see other capital sources are now waking up to the ugly realities of real return on capital in this inflationary environment. There was nothing wrong with this asset class except price. And I relieved to see that has finally changed billions of dollars of transactions were consummated at low cap rate, often which short-term floating rate debt, the party's over with - is over with capital structure and cash flow, as many of these vehicles are now upside down. We'll be observing the space closely in coming months and quarter. Now, I would like to discuss our recent restructuring of a lease with ProMedica health system. I'm not going to bore you with the details our fundamental thesis of this investment in 2018. I laid it out, clearly when we did this transaction, we didn't predict COVID and the impact and its impact on the cash flow portfolio, and frankly, were underwhelmed by the execution. But the fundamental investment thesis of the original transaction should still protect our shareholder\u2019s capital, that basis, and appropriate structure are critical to any real estate investment. While we have historically relied on our operatively to drive cash flow and that yield, we never make real estate investment decision based on yield. We believe success in real estate investment over a long period of time, is a function of right basis and staying power. If you own an apartment in New York City for $400,000, while everybody owns equivalent apartment for $1 million, you can still charge rent for that unit and generate strong returns. That is such a simple yet perhaps one of the most overlooked concept on Wall Street. The cacophony of noise around ProMedica as negative dark coverage over the last few months have reached a fever pitch. And we honestly understand and empathize with this Pavlovian response as the history of healthcare REIT sector is full of remedies, such as massive red cards, or disposal of assets at fire sale prices that result in significant value destruction to shareholders. Even though I'm personally humbled by the cash flow deterioration in the ProMedica portfolio, let me repeat that we are not experiencing a rent cut on a cash basis, and our investors are the beneficiary of a satisfactory total return to date. And that goes back to an incredibly favorable basis and structure. To continue my metaphor previous metaphor, Manhattan apartment rents might come down from 5000 to 4000 in a bad year, but we never hypothetical even charged 4000 as we bought our unit at such a low price. That is why our rent is now going up not down after this transaction. And I continue to believe it remains below market and will be a source of future value creation. As I mentioned in our last call, ProMedica has made significant strides in reducing its operating losses, which are farther narrow the last 90 days to both occupancy gains and lower labor cost contract labor costs particularly. Integral or its parent entity which we have done multiple transactions previously, has successfully executed many turnarounds, including those involving at our assets and we sold it to them in last couple of years and is well positioned to return these assets to its previous glory using a regional operating strategy, just like they have done over the last couple of years. We are looking through integrates parent entity and the owner for the downside protection through subordination of their equity as well as significant other guarantees and will subsequently share significant value creation with us. But I cannot overemphasize that the fundamental idea of below market rent basis equals to below market rent is not about ProMedica, it is about our belief how we invest and protect our shareholder\u2019s capital. If a business has demand growth, and you can own it for significantly less than what it costs to build, the low leverage capital structure, it is challenging for me to see how lose money in most scenarios. We remain partner with ProMedica, albeit on its surface on a much smaller scale and we'll be delighted to see the significant credit improvement of this important institution in Toledo. Finally, let's discuss the current capital markets environment, which excites me to no end. Before I go into what we might do in the future, let's discuss what we have done in the past under this leadership team. If we go back and read all our comments about capital deployment in the last few years, you will notice a few attributes, one, was unlevered IRR buyers and we underwrite significant cap rate expansion at exit. Hence, the recent rate increase doesn\u2019t fluster us, just as we have never chased low rates down under the guise of low cost per capital. Two, our unrelenting focus on basis relative replacement cost, and as a result, we seriously dislike low cap rates in stabilized occupancy scenarios. Nothing has happened so far, even in this turbulent capital markets backdrop that require us to change how we invest capital. We are experiencing historic volatility in the treasury market, in every part of the -- with every part of the yield curve inverted right now, with significantly the most important two to 10 curve is as inverted as it was during Paul Volcker's time 40 years ago. One approach for us would be to ride out the storm in a shelter and do nothing. But those of you know as well, know, we're unlikely to do so. We maintain a fairly favorable capital position and a war chest due to our extremely talented capital markets team under the leadership of Tim. Despite our unfavorable public cost of capital on a spot basis, today, we have no dearth of global institutions who want to partner with us. And let me remind you, again, a simple capital allocation framework I've described to you before. Every company effectively has four choices of raising capital, one, tapping internal cash flow, two, issuing debt, three, issuing equity and four, disposition of existing assets. It also has five essential choices of deploying that capital. One, investing in existing assets, two, acquisitions, three, buying debt at a discount, four, paying a dividend and five, buying stock at a discount. You can loosely call the first set of choices as selling, but the right description would be sourcing or raising capital, you can loosely call the second set of choices as buying, but perhaps the correct description will be deployment of capital. Following the same line of thinking loosely speaking, consistently, buying low and selling high creates value for shareholders. In a more wholesome and thoughtful description, optimizing these choices from this menu of sources and uses in a tax efficient manner, creates meaningful value for continuing shareholders on a partial basis. Our goal is to maximize partial value and partial cash flow, not to become the biggest or the most revolutionary. Our capital allocation team on both sides of the balance sheet is poised to pounce on these great manual opportunities, while the most volatile and interest rate environment in four decades has put in front of us. And at the same time, John's team is just getting started on the journey of cash flow and platform optimization. With that. I'll pass it over to John. John? John Burkart : Thank you, Shankh. I'll provide some insight into our operating business, starting with the medical office portfolio. In the third quarter same-store NOI growth for our outpatient medical business was 1.4% over the prior year's quarter which was below trends, due to some timing issues on tenant improvements, delaying moving and higher utility expenses. We continue to see strong retention levels at 93% in the quarter and accelerating renewal rates in the marketplace. Turning to our senior housing operating portfolio, the recovery in the sector continues. As Shankh mentioned, revenue in our same-store portfolio came in at 10.8% in the third quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. All three regions showed strong revenue growth starting with Canada 4.4%, the U.S. and UK growing in an impressive 11.6% and 18.9% respectively. Revenue growth for the quarter was driven by a 390 basis point increase in occupancy, and another quarter of healthy pricing power with REVPOR growth of 5.3%. As Shankh mentioned the highest we've witnessed. Sequentially, the portfolio occupancy continued to improve with a gain of 110 basis points during the quarter. While expenses remain a challenge, our operators continue to control expense for or expense per occupied room. The cost for compensation per occupied room only grew at 4.3% in the third quarter over the prior year's quarter. The lowest growth rate since 2019. Expense for grew at a rate of 3.7% in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis, well below our REVPOR growth and 5.3%, driving expansion of 130 basis points on a year-over-year basis in our margins. As our operators have pivoted from the COVID state to normalized operations and as labor and materials have become more available, we have aggressively addressed maintenance that was delayed during COVID. Which resulted in slightly elevated repairs and maintenance during the maintenance expense during the quarter. Overall, the quarter's occupancy gains strong REVPOR an expense controls enable the senior housing operating portfolio to deliver 17.6% year-over-year same-store NOI growth in the period led by the U.S. with over 20% year-over-year growth. While Canada NOI grew at 6.3% and UK was up 9.8%. Going forward, we expect the operating portfolio to continue to deliver outside NOI growth with each geography expected to experience accelerating NOI growth in the fourth quarter. As we look forward to what many believes will be a weaker labor market in 2023, it's important to realize that labor as an expense represents about 60% of our total expenses. Additionally, nurses are only about 5% of the labor force at the communities. And although there are other more specialized positions at the communities, most of the physicians require skills that are transferable from other sectors of the economy, allowing us to benefit from the softer labor market, as Shankh noted. Regarding our operating platform, we continue to quickly move forward on plans to pilot our first module in early 2023 with several other modules in the works. Like all technology rollouts, it's about people, processes, data, and then technology. So it's not about flipping a switch, it takes teamwork. The results will show up over time. Our meetings with our operators have been very productive as we bring together their skills and experience with our own to build a better future for the industry. Finally, I would like to thank our operators and their employees for making these results possible. It's been a full sprint since the beginning of COVID. And they have addressed one challenge after the next. We are finally at a point where it seems like there's light at the end of the tunnel. Occupancy continues to rise, net hiring is occurring month after month. REVPOR continues to outpace expense for which will drive further margin expansion, and so much more. We wish to thank everyone and wish them a wonderful Thanksgiving. And thank you for your hard work. I'll now turn the call over to Tim. Tim McHugh : Thanks, John. My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2022 results. Performance of our triple net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, our balance sheet liquidity update, and finally our outlook for the fourth quarter. Welltower reported third quarter normalized funds from operations of $0.84 per diluted share, representing 6.2% growth over the prior year period when adjusted for HHS funds received and changes in FX rates. Marking our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth since the start of the pandemic. We also reported our second consecutive quarter positive total portfolio same-store NOI growth, the 7.2% year-over-year growth. Turning to our triple-net lease portfolios. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6, 30 2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 1.6% year-over-year, below the low end of our guidance range, which is primarily timing related. Trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage is 0.83 times in the quarter. Next, same-store NOI and our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 3.1% year-over-year, in trailing 12 month EBITDA coverage of 1.31 times. And lastly health systems, which comprise of our joint venture with ProMedica Health System. Had same-store NOI growth of positive 2.75% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month EBITDA and EBITDAR coverages were negative 0.01 and negative 0.6 respectively, as operations continue to be impacted by higher agency utilization costs in the second quarter relative to the prior year. What are these coverage figures in context of our announcement last night, trailing 12-month ProMedica senior care EBITDAN coverage of negative 0.01 implies trailing 12 month EBITDAN of negative $1.6 million relative to $106.68 million of cash rent paid in the trailing 12-month period ending 6, 30 2022? The transition of the skilled nursing business will bring the remaining ProMedica senior care EBITDAN back to profitability with the trailing 12-month coverage of nearly two times relative to the remaining rent and the 58 assisted living facilities they will continue to operate. Thus, the transition to Integra Health has a dual benefit providing us a well-capitalized strategic partner to focus on the skilled nursing properties while also leaving ProMedica senior care a substantially better financial state following the transaction. Turning to the capital market activity. In the quarter we continue to enhance our balance sheet strength by utilizing our ATM program to raise approximately $760 million afford equity an average price of $80.12. We settled 9.1 million shares for total proceeds of at $842 million to fund $1 billion of net investment activity, leaving $1.5 billion of unsettled forward ATM as of 9, 30. Post quarter end, we settled additional ATM proceeds to fund investment activity and pay down $850 million of total debt. $817 million of which was floating rate. Post that pay down, we have the full $4.0 billion available borrowing capacity on our line of credit, and no one secured maturities until 2024. We expect to finish the fourth quarter with consolidated net-debt-to EBITDA below 6.5 times for the first time since 2020. From liquidity perspective, in addition to $4 billion, we pass in line of credit we have $1 billion of cash and forward equity and $580 million remaining near term dispositions and loan pay down proceeds and a 4.6 yield representing $5.6 billion of total near term liquidity. Lastly, moving to our fourth quarter outlook. Last night, we provide an outlook for the fourth quarter of net income attributable to common stockholders, of $0.08 to $0.13 per diluted share, and normalized FFO of $0.80 to $0.85 per diluted share, or $82.5 at the midpoint. As mentioned in the release, our fourth quarter guidance contemplates no HHS funds to be received in the fourth quarter. So after adjusting for $1.5 of non-recurring items, including HHS funds receiving the third quarter were effectively flat for sequential FFO. The sequential change is composed of $0.02 from sequential increases in senior housing operating portfolio and $0.01 from sequential increases in outpatient medical and senior housing triple net. These are offset by $0.03 of interest expense and foreign exchange headwinds. Underlying this FFO guidance, is estimated total portfolio of year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 8.5% to 10.5%. Driven by sub segment growth of outpatient medical, 1.5% to 2.5%. Long-term post Q 2.5% to 3.5%. Senior housing tripled net, 5% to 6%. And finally, senior housing operating growth of 18.5% to 23.5%. Driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.5% year-over-year. Underlying this revenue growth, is expectation approximately 200 basis points of year-over-year occupancy increase and rent growth approximately 7%. And with that, I'll hand the back the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thanks, Tim. One of my mentors, Peter Kaufman often says, life is not about predicting, it's about positioning. Did we predict that ProMedica EBITDA coverage will turn negative? Absolutely not. But we positioned for it and structured as such. Did we know COVID will happen and availability of credit in senior housing sector will weaken? No, but we positioned for it. We own more than 11,000 units of age restricted and age targeted apartments that will benefit from government agency backstop financing at very attractive pricing from which we can generate a couple of billions of dollars of proceeds. Did we predict that our stock will be in the low 60s and we'll lose our access to equity capital? No, we didn't. But we positioned for it and raised $3.28 billion of capital at an average price of $86.55 this year. We have no idea if rates are going back down or going back up and how ugly the capital markets environment might turn before it gets better. We're laser focused on what we can control and have an incredible organization that is rallying to take advantage of the opportunities with how thoughts as opposed to gambler thoughts. I cannot be more excited about the period of unprecedented far share value creation that we are embarking on for our existing owners. And with that, I'll open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra : Morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just a quick 2-parter here. One, you talked a lot about pricing power. You gave the examples across operators on how pricing in labor is improving. Just how sustainable is this across your regions maybe within the U.S., but also globally? And then can you just add on to that, any early signs that the elevated flu is impacting fundamentals? Shankh Mitra : I'll take the pricing power, John, if you take the flu, that's great. So from a pricing part standpoint, Vikram, if you just look at what we said at the beginning of the year, nothing really changed, except if you think about what happens is in the industry, not at least for our portfolio, you've got a lot of renewals in the beginning of the year. And this year, we got very strong pricing, obviously. And given that the gap between where market rent is as well as where your renewal rates are obviously with the rents that are rolling off, there's a gap over a period of the year that sort of comes down, right, that's sort of what happens in the normal year. What we have said this year, given that market rents have been rising at a faster rate than annual rates, first time, honestly, like a decade. So we have seen that gap close down pretty meaningfully, and you're seeing RevPOR increases are actually getting better through the year. You adds on top of that, that we are seeing some early renewals for next year in that sort of, call it, another 10-ish percent range, and we expect that obviously, we'll do similar type of pricing increases as we come to next year, you will see that pricing power will continue to hold up and RevPOR rate increases will continue to hold up. So we're pretty excited about it. But remember, pricing power also comes in many forms and substances, right? So you have occupancy of the portfolio and many parts of the portfolio is getting to a point overall portfolio might still be at 80% occupancy, but there is segments of the portfolio is well above high 80s and 90% occupancy, where it starts to get pretty meaningful pricing power because you have no innings to sell anymore, right? So as we get into that environment more and more, I believe that you will see sustainable pricing power. I have no crystal ball on exactly what the macroeconomic environment would be next year. But as we sit here today, we feel very good about pricing. John Burkart : Yes. On your question regarding the flu, I most certainly can't predict the future. But what I can say is that the COVID protocols, I think, will mitigate the situation within our community, they're still in place. I was at one of the properties very recently, and I'm waiting in line to get in, we wash hands, temperature check, wear a mask, et cetera. And I'm going to align with employees any vendor, all of us. That's the protocol. It's a safe, thoughtful protocol. And so my expectation is that, that will have a very positive impact in the communities, how the flu season goes in the U.S. and otherwise, I don't -- I can't predict that. But I do think the COVID protocols will be very positive going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Hi, everybody. Good morning. Can we discuss the newly authorized $3 billion in share repurchase program? How do you feel about the shares at current levels? And I guess, the possible timing of execution given the announcement comes in conjunction with earnings, which is seems unique? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Good morning, Derek. I think I laid out pretty clearly what our possible capital deployment opportunities look like, buying back shares is one of them. And frankly speaking, as you know how we think, we are unlevered IRR buyers. And we look at everything from that lens or you can look at from the basis lens, and you will see that we find our stock to be very, very attractively priced, and we'll measure that against every other opportunities we have.  I cannot predict on timing. That's just not -- we just don't do that, as you know. But we know -- you know how we think. We think through a lens basis to replacement cost, and we think through an eye of total unlevered IRR. And if you do those calculations, you will come to the perhaps the same conclusion that we have come through. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : Thanks for the time. John Burkart, as operations recover in the SHO portfolio, in between AL versus IL, do you expect structurally different margins between the two businesses once fundamentals fully stabilized? John Burkart : There naturally are different margins starting out. But I think that the endpoint will change. I think what we're doing with the operating platform will change that across the board and because AL has perhaps might say more opportunity, though the impact might be slightly greater there. But I think the whole business is going in the right direction at this point in time. And I think we're benefiting across the board. Shankh Mitra : John, you didn't ask for my opinion, my $0.02 on this topic is that you will see more improvement in AL than IL, but you'll see improvement in both. But you asked the right person, that question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Ma with Evercore. Wendy Ma : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So could you please give us some color about the moving trends of different senior housing project types like IL, AL and the senior apartments? And also given the current slowdown of the housing transaction market, have you observed any slowdown of your independent living move-in? Shankh Mitra : I'm not sure I completely followed that question, but do you think -- I think you asked about the moving trends in the senior\u2019s apartment business, if I heard that correctly, I will tell you that \u2013 go ahead, Wendy. Wendy Ma : And also -- sorry, can you give some color for different senior housing types like IL, AL and also the senior apartments? Shankh Mitra : Yes. Okay. So I think I understand the question. So look, I mean, if you think about from a product-type perspective, as I mentioned, that the assisted living is going through probably the most robust recovery perhaps for nothing other than the fact that it is the most need-based environment. It's more susceptible, least susceptible to in the macroeconomic environment. When you need it, you need the product when you need it. And obviously, it also fail farther. So we have more rooms to climb back up. So that's why we're seeing the most sort of robust recovery. As I mentioned, the NOI growth in that sector for the quarter was 25-plus percent, right? So that's sort of -- let's just then talk about the senior\u2019s apartment business. That business has been as good of a business as any business I've seen has been very strong. Through COVID, it's been very, very strong. Through times, I mean our portfolio is at 95-plus percent occupancy. As you know, we operate in the mid-market portion of that business, which is very dependent on social security and everything else. And you've got a massive cola increase next year, which we also think will be very beneficial for the pricing power increase in that business next year. Independent living, obviously, independent living did not fall as far as assisted living, and it's coming back more slowly. But that is a -- I personally think that's a good business when you combine that with other property types. And I think, obviously, Canada, which is our majority of our independent living exposure, has been so hard to recover, but as John noted, that we are starting to see improvement there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Bernstein with Capital One. Daniel Bernstein : Hey, good morning. I just wanted to kind of expand on your comments about the upside down, I guess, private buyers in the MOB space. Just trying to understand there a little bit more if lenders are actually foreclosing on assets? And maybe if you are already seeing some opportunities there to buy assets at a better IRR? And maybe on a related question, does that just do your comments also apply to seniors housing and skilled nursing where I believe there are some upside down loans as well? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So Dan, we haven't seen lenders are foreclosing on medical office loans yet. But my comment was if you -- it's just called the convexity of the situation, right, when you have very, very low rates, and people buying cap rates that are in that environment makes sense and then treasury card moves 200, 300 basis points. The treasury cards sitting on top of or above the cap rates that you are paid that's a prior upside down convexity situation, and that's the comment I was making, it takes time for lenders to foreclose, it takes time.  But we are starting to see some meaningful increase in the cap rates there, which is interesting. We're not yet to talk about whether we are going to look at that and execute on that yet. We have lots of opportunities that we see on a relative basis. We talked about, obviously, senior housing is one of those. Nothing changed. I'm specifically pointed out in MOBs because that has changed. Senior housing as an opportunity was there for last 18 months and when executing on it, nothing changed there, right, and continues to be super attractive. On top of that, to the earlier question Derek asked, our stock isn't really attractive.  So we look at every opportunity and think about what's the unlevered IRR on a risk-adjusted basis and what's the sort of execution risk as well as obviously the frictional cost that comes with the execution risk. But is the way finally first time in years has become interesting. And yes, but it's interesting at a price. And that price is likely a lot lower than most what you think. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Just 1 2-parter. Just looking back at the slide in the deck, on the long-term $543 million embedded NOI. My question is just on that $230 million that comes from getting back to 4Q '19 NOI levels. Your comments sounds like you're pretty constructive on sort of margin improvement still with sort of the acceleration you saw in revenues relative to expenses this quarter.  Can you just remind us how you're thinking about the margins of that $230 million versus sort of the 4Q '19 level is part one? And if I could take in a part two, which is just on the ProMedica consideration, about $0.5 billion, how much of that is the 15% stake that they're giving up? And how much of that is sort of the working capital. Tim McHugh : Yes, I'll start with the first comment on the margin side. The assumption is we get back to pre-COVID levels. So no assumption on change in margins. We assume we get back to pre COVID level profitability and operating margins of about 30.8% across the portfolio. Shankh Mitra : On the consideration, it's roughly half and half. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : Yes, I just wanted to touch on the new SNF JV. I know you just kind of highlighted the rough size of the operating reserves ProMedica is going to be providing. But how is that going to be distributed to the new operators? Are they simply earmarked to fund near-term cash flow losses during the transitions? And what happens if these new operators don't actually need to access those reserves? Shankh Mitra : The reserves are earmarked for the operating losses, working capital losses and that reserve will go to them to improve the quality of the portfolio. So if they do a good job and don't need all -- that's good for them. So they share the risk and they get the benefit of their savings there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Tayo Okusanya : Yes, good morning. Again, congrats on the quarter and the transition. I have been covering this from15 years. I don't think I've ever seen a rent restructuring where the rents went up. So that's pretty cool to see. In regards to Integra, and again, this idea that they're going to be subleasing a lot of the assets to regional operators. Just curious a little bit again. Your mantra in the past is always going to be as close to the operator as you possibly can. You add even on the Board at ProMedica. How is that relationship going to be with these subcontracted operators? And how do you kind of manage that to ensure you continue to kind of get operational excellence out of them? Shankh Mitra : Tayo, extraordinarily good question, and thank you for your comment there. I'll just add one thing to that not only the rent is going up also the previous tenant being close to $0.5 million on the table. To make sure that these properties are taking care of going forward. So we think our partner for that. So I'll just add to the question of why we didn't go and find the offers. Our mantra is to get close to the operators, but that's in the senior housing business. I fundamentally believe in the expertise, and we have worked with Integra and its parent company on many of these transactions before. There's no caution that they are significantly better in the skilled nursing business than we are aware and will ever be. So we are sharing and for creating that value, I've mentioned in my script that we're seeing very significant upside that they can create with them. And return, they're providing us the downside protection, which is very important for us. So you think about it, you got to do in life, what you are best at. Think about from an op standpoint, we think we understand operations of senior living, the wellness housing business as well as MOB business. And we want to partner with people who we fundamentally believe on the other hand, are very good in other businesses, and that's what you're saying. Fundamentally, it is sort of going through the decision-making is going to the people who are the best at what they are good at. At the same time, it sort of cut the risk reward in terms of who creates value. It's just as simple as that. As I've said before, you can see the value still remains at very attractive basis, what you can get to. You know the total rent, you know what market sort of rent sort of constant of significant business is, and you can divide it to a value and you will see that value is still extraordinarily attractive and thus, the rent is extraordinarily attractive and remains below market. So there will be hopefully a lot of upside as the regional operators bring this portfolio back to his previous Glory, which we actually -- this is not a guess. We have -- we kill how many assets we have transacted, Medicare assets we\u2019re transacted with Integra and its parent. About 21, 21 assets. We have seen them doing it. And we are going on an execution path that we have seen in the last couple of years. So fully, there's a lot of value to be created for residents, for employees, for capital, and that will be shared between the two parties. But it is fundamentally the belief of they're giving us the downside protection for which they should enjoy very significant upside that they create -- on the other hand, for us, it's all about where we sit in the risk spectrum.  So it's a win-win-win for all three parties. ProMedica wants to focus on its core business, and wants to be in the higher margin business and that's the leadership that they are taking that forward. There's a very significant improvement in their credit. For Welltower, it's obviously a great day for some value realization as well as, obviously, taking this portfolio to the hands where we can create another round of very significant up step of values. For Integra, they can ping it at a very attractive basis. And obviously, they're creating the value that they will share the upside with us. So it's a win-win-win on all fronts. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Hi. We appreciate the expanded development disclosure. But what's the time frame that you see for ramping the developments from the 1.6% initial yield to the 7% stabilized yield? Tim McHugh : Yes, Michael, I appreciate recognition that we're trying to help just the ramp or the kind of trajectory of how that cash flow comes through and it depends on the type of development. So we think about our -- where a lot of our starts have been as of late is more in the senior apartments to on the housing side. And there, you're talking about more 12, 18 months type ramp towards stabilization in the traditional senior housing side, it's more of a 24, 36-month ramp. And that's where more of the lower yields negative by able to come in the first 12 months. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Yulico with Scotia Bank. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just want to go back to ProMedica. Clearly, strong pricing you got there and the cash rent going up as attractive. I just want to see, though, if you could let us know the GAAP impact because I didn't see any mention of lease escalators for the new arrangement you had previously. So just trying to understand the FFO impact from this. And separately, if you had -- I don't know if you're going to be filing details on the new lease, but if you had anything you can share right now in terms of escalators, financial covenants CapEx requirements because those were specific, very sort of onerous conditions of the last lease with ProMedica, which kind of strengthened I think, the whole process you went through. So any detail there would be helpful? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Very good question. The escalators remain the same, 2.75%. And the GAAP impact, as we mentioned, will be roughly neutral to slightly accretive. One of the leases are remaining the same lease ManorCare, the Aramco senior living lease is going to 10 years. So you have a negative GAAP impact there. So net-net, you will be roughly neutral to slightly attractive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc. Austin Wurschmidt : Hi, good morning. Curious, first off, if there were other partners you approach for the ProMedica joint venture. How do we think about you going from a health system investment with feeders into these assets to the more regional operator approach? And then just lastly, I'm curious, kind of going back to 2016, 2017, wasn't the plan to ultimately exit the SNF business. And so curious how you think about the strategic direction of that segment of the portfolio? Shankh Mitra : So can you please repeat the first part of your question again? Austin Wurschmidt : Yes. I was just curious if you approached any other partners beyond just Integra for the new joint venture. Shankh Mitra : So look, it is no secret that we have been thinking about in the industry that we have been thinking about this particular portfolio for a long time. We have been approached by at least five parties who are interested in being this transaction similar or higher value similar or higher structures. We went with a partner that we know very well, where we felt the execution risk is much lower. But I think if you have heard that you have correctly heard that we have been approached by many groups because these assets are not only very attractive assets, they have very good history, but also the basis remains very, very attractive. Going back to 2016, '17, I think your question was to exit the SNF business. I -- we are very clearly laid out two years ago when I took over as CEO we have a very simple strategy that we want to make money on a risk-adjusted basis on a partial basis for our existing shareholders. That's the strategy, and it's a very simple strategy whether it's skilled nursing, whether it's medical office or the senior apartments, whether it's senior housing, what is debt to equity, value-add development, opportunistic will go anywhere we can find opportunities to make money on a partial basis for existing shareholders. That's a simple strategy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good morning. Shankh, I was just hoping you could talk to maybe opportunities you see outside of the U.S. given the unusually strong U.S. dollar and whether that presents a wider opportunity set for potential acquisitions? Shankh Mitra : One extraordinarily good question. As you know, we get really excited about basis and were USD, we raised capital in USD, our expenses are mostly in USD, capital structures and USD. And we think about basis in terms of USD. And as you can figure out, U.K. on a U.S. dollar basis has never looked more attractive and Canada also looks pretty attractive. But U.K. particularly given what happens to the currency situation, it's extraordinarily attractive. If you add on top of that, that you don't have a super functioning debt market in U.K., like you have the agency support in U.S. and Canada. It's a very, very interesting market. I have never seen U.K. opportunities as cheap as it looks today from the U.S. dollar investor. And that probably perhaps goes for any asset class, anything even for shoppers. So you're picking up the right thing, we're absolutely thinking about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with SMBC. Richard Anderson : Thanks, good morning. Congrats on the ProMedica Integra transaction. The market seems to be rewarding you for that resolution. But the way I look at it is your kind of married ProMedica in 2018, but you signed a prenup, and that protected your downside. And all this is based on basis and it's all clear and understood. But now you're selling 15% to Integra, what happens to base for that 15%?  In other words, 85% I assume, stays put -- but are you selling -- are you upping your basis and eliminating some of that \u201cprenup\u201d component so that if there is a disruption going forward with Integra and its regional partners, that you still have an equal amount of protection should something go wrong here? Because a transition isn't a silver bullet. It usually -- it sometimes works, but sometimes not. So I just want to get a gauge in the future in terms of how you're protected going forward? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Yes. So our basis remains the same, and you can do the calculation on -- again, you have the total rent. You know what the give or take yield is in the business. And you can get to the total value, rent divided by the yield give will get you the value. You can divide that by the total number of beds, and you will see Integra basis are also very attractive. So our basis remains attractive. Remember, what we sold to Integra is what we got for ProMedica for nothing. So it's important for you to understand the nuances of what's happening here. So our basis remains very attractive. Obviously, we got the support for the operator who is living and living, as I mentioned, living close to $0.5 billion on the table. We created another structure where that 15%, which Integra is paying for remains subordinated that further lowers our net basis, which is the first time when you remember, I talked about that, that condition remains, we have obviously other guarantees in place, as I said. And if that's not the case, remains -- remember, in the last question, I said that people want these assets because they're very well-located assets, and a very good location and the very attractive basis. So we don't see, as I said, look, anything can happen, Rich. But as I've mentioned before, four years ago on this topic, that low basis, well-located assets that have demand that's held in low-level structure, it's hard to see how we lose money. Anything can happen, anything is possible. But if you think about we have to leave within the realms of probabilities, not possibilities, it looks pretty good to me. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Nick Joseph : Thanks. It's Nick Joseph here with Michael. You've talked a lot about the opportunity for improvements in modernization in senior housing. But when you look at the skilled side, and I recognize it's a very different business, more regulatory considerations and everything like that. But are there opportunities to improve either the operations or share best practices from a well perspective that maybe could help coverage going forward? Shankh Mitra : Nick, first, congratulations for getting the top job. We have been a big fan of yours for a long time, and obviously, thank you for your question on the call today. So look, I've mentioned very, very clearly that we do not consider ourselves a skilled nursing expert. If we did, then we would not bring in our partners in this deal, who we consider knows the business better than we do. So I will leave that to our partner to execute the strategy, which we have mentioned, as Nikhil just mentioned, that we have done just from these portfolio 21 assets before, we'll leave it to them to maximize where, in this case, is this sort of a structural protection is what we are after, not maximizing value through operators. That's what they're bringing to the people in this case, and we remain focused on our core businesses, where -- whether it's senior living, whether it's well in housing or medical office, and that's what John is spending all this time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Steven Valiquette : Great, thanks. Good morning. Just sticking with ProMedica for a minute here. I guess 1 of the expected operational synergies from ProMedica acquiring the ManorCare SNF assets in the first place was likely centered around good flow of patient referrals from ProMedica hospitals into a lease of the ManorCare SNFs where it made sense geographically. I guess I'm curious, with hindsight, it that part of the strategy plays out the way everyone thought it would maybe just perhaps the underwhelming execution that you alluded to, Shankh, was just more a function of just tough industry dynamics for SNFs overall?  And also under the new agreement then, does ProMedica patient referrals to the SNFs under Integra's operating control stay intact going forward as part of the strategy for Integra to turn things around is really to maybe widen and expand the Medicare post-acute referral sources to improve the occupancy? Shankh Mitra : Let me try to address your question, Steve, and then Nikhil, you jump in. First is the fundamentally the strategic part of the patient flow point that you made has not played out. And has it not played out because we walk directly into a very tough environment of COVID or has it not played out because the idea we couldn't execute or ProMedica could not execute. I don't know the answer to that question. Hindsight is 2020. But there is no caution that it hasn't played out and the leadership at ProMedica firsthand will tell you that they're under wound with the execution as well. So no question, it hasn't played out. And the second -- but if you think about it, again, I would recommend you, it's hard to say things, easy to say things sort of looking back I would like you to go back and to the call where I've described why we did this transaction, and we'll see how much we emphasize that we fundamentally think everything goes away, what we still have is the basis. Think about Steve as I mentioned, that you have a 2-bedroom apartment in New York City where cost it costs everybody $1 million bucks, but you bought something for $400,000 doing JC. You don't need to charge the rent that everybody else is charging. That is the fundamental idea of how you make money will stay without taking a lot of risk. And that's what we saw, and that has played out, hopefully, you'll agree in this transaction. Nikhil, do you want to add anything to the second part of the question? Nikhil Chaudhri : Yes, I think from a clinical programming perspective, I think this portfolio ManorCare ProMedica has always been good at providing good clinical programs, and they work closely with hospitals across different markets, whether it's for medical hospitals or not in creating programming that serves the need for the local hospitals. And that programming stays in place. And obviously, as new operators come in, they'll decide if they want to keep that in place, scale that back, enhance it. But this whole platform has been known to have incredible clinical programming and that stays in place. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rogers with Baird. David Rodgers : Yes, maybe for John Burkart. John, as you obviously grow occupancy in the SHOP portfolio, you have more and more assets that are likely now at kind of stabilized occupancy. Can you talk about the margins at the stabilized assets? And if they stabilize to pre-COVID levels. And then any delay between the occupancy stabilization and margin that you're witnessing in that larger group of assets? John Burkart : Yes. Let me just give you an interesting piece of data. One of our operators that has very high occupancy in the 95% actually had expenses going backwards. And so you see some tremendous margin improvement there. The whole portfolio is going that way. And no doubt that the higher occupancy levels, as Shankh mentioned, was pushing able to push rents to achieve higher rent, which is, again, then driving better margins. But on the expense side, we continue to see opportunities to improve as we go forward and move out of the situation during COVID. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, one of the situations during COVID was there's a challenge to get some maintenance done, get people into the buildings, et cetera, et cetera. So our numbers today even reflect some elevated maintenance expenses, which will be reduced over the coming quarters and again, provide a stronger run rate. So yes, things are going very good. They're going good at all levels. The -- as Shankh mentioned, we have maybe four buckets of assets with different levels of occupancy across the board and at the top occupancy assets. We're achieving fantastic margins as you get down the run, obviously, that's not the case, but we're continuing to improve occupancy and things are all looking forward. So hopefully, that answers your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : Yes. No, I appreciate all the color on ProMedica. I guess maybe one question on the senior housing side for the ProMedica. Was there any discussion of potentially moving that to another operator or you guys are pretty comfortable with how they're performing? Shankh Mitra : As Tim mentioned, those assets actually a decent amount of profitability for them. And ProMedica, that is part of ProMedica strategic, obviously, planned, and those are, as you know, high margin businesses, and they have been even before COVID and we expect they will continue to come back to -- remember, where pre COVID assets on mid-80 to person occupancy was generating high 30% margin. So I expect as you sort of come back from the COVID and get that occupancy stabilize. Frankly speaking, I will venture a guess that will be the best sort of margin part from all of ProMedica's businesses.  So look, I mean, that's where we stand today, and there's no reason to believe that those assets will not. As you can see, as part of this recovery from these occupancy levels in the business, margins are coming back. I'm not happy with where margins are today, and we're seeing obviously a lot of signs of improvement that we discussed. But the margin of this business should come back to a much higher level, and ProMedica should enjoy that like everybody else in the business. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead. Matt McQueen : Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement are detailed in the Company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I will review fourth quarter and the year and describe high-level business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on operational performance of our SHO and MOB portfolios. And Tim will walk you through our triple-net business, balance sheet highlights and 2023 full year guidance. Nikhil, our newly appointed CIO, is also on the call to answer questions. While we are happy to bring back full year guidance after three years, I'll point out that many macro and business uncertainties remain. I would recommend investors and analysts to focus on 2023 exit run rate to understand the earnings power of this platform and not overly emphasize the calendar year guidance. I have mixed emotions as I reflect back on 2022. As I've described to you in my prior calls, our results frankly underwound our expectation during the first half of the year. While we don't like to fix that on short-term stock performance as we believe, an appropriate window to gauge our performance is at least three to five years, you should so to measure that [ph] for generating an unsatisfactory return -- total return in 2022. But remember, a stock is a fractional ownership of a business and not a ticker. We view our fellow investors as partners for the long haul and continuously strive to improve the prospects for long-term compounding of this business. In spite of some of the headwinds that we experienced in 2022, my team and I are pleased with the underlying improvements we have seen in this platform and our talent base, resulting in a strong rebound of performance in fourth quarter and farther improving momentum being carried into 2023. Our recent progress is only the tip of the iceberg of many of our initiatives, will truly manifest themselves in the year -- next year or two, which I'll go in a minute. While overall macro headwinds persist, we have seen a considerable improvement in the key indicators of the unit economics of the business as reflected by expense per occupied room or EXPOR or revenue per occupied room, or REVPOR. On the expense front, we have seen significant progress on addressing certain challenges we have faced over first year plus, most notably on the agency and temp labor situation. In fact, export has moderated to -- in Q4 to 3.4% driven largely by a deceleration in compensation per occupied room or COMPOR to 2.6%, the lowest level we have seen in our recorded history. At the same time, REVPOR, again, the revenue per occupied room, remain a consistent bright spot for us, increasing 7.5% in Q4, a clear reflection of strong pricing power resulting from our premier locations, product and operator base. As I mentioned on our last call, one of our largest operators pulled forward January rental increases in Q4. Even without that, our Q4 REVPOR would have exceeded 6% plus, reflecting a broad-based strength across our portfolio. And while we achieved record REVPOR growth in 2022 of 5.5%, we expect to surpass this level of growth in 2023. While we achieved an impressive 19% SHOP NOI growth in 2022 and expect circa 20% NOI growth in 2023, I believe we're only at the beginning of a multiyear double-digit NOI growth, resulting from a long runway of occupancy gain, rate growth and operating margin expansion. And despite significant macro uncertainty already weighing on the fundamentals of many other sectors, our confidence in future growth of our business is supported by the need-based nature of our asset class along with a favorable demand-supply backdrop, which is getting better every single day. I'm pleased to report that 2023 is already off to a great start with January move-ins up 16% of our '19 levels, representing a meaningful acceleration from the fourth quarter. Forward-looking indicators are also showing promise in January with our total volume -- tour volume across our senior housing operating portfolio is up 25% year-over-year. I would be completely remiss to ignore perhaps one of the most important milestones in the 53-year history of our company, and that is the Private Letter Ruling we received, which permits us to both own and self manage independent living assets. The PLR provides us significant flexibility in operating our assets, and its timing coincides almost perfectly with the build-out of our industry-leading operating and asset management platform, which John and his team have been tirelessly working on. We remain optimistic that farther investment in our platform will not only result in a better margin profile of our assets, but also will meaningfully benefit the third-party operating partners across the senior living spectrum, who we choose to do business with in the future. We continue to see a tremendous opportunity to professionalize and modernize the operating side of senior living business, following our instinct where there's mystery, there's margin. And our PLR gives a significant ammunition to accelerate the pace for what Welltower 3.0 might look like. I want to thank Mike Garst, our tax team and many others whose efforts have led to this game-changing achievement. Before turning to investing environment, I want to highlight the addition of Retirement Unlimited, or RUI, to Welltower's roster of exceptional operating partner. RUI is one of the best operating performing senior housing operator in the East Coast with the highest program quality programming and care standards. RUI has consistently maintained occupancy levels at north of 90% and with hardly any use of agency lever over past few years. We announced today that RUI has assumed the management of our first community together in Alexandria, Virginia, with plans to meaningfully grow our relationship in near term through acquisitions, transition and development. We are extremely excited and humbled to partner with the Fralin and Waldron families and RUI\u2019s all star President, Doris-Ellie Sullivan, and welcome them to Welltower family. In terms of other growth partners, it was exactly a year ago when we announced our partnership with David and Simon Reuben, along with their acquisition of Avery Healthcare in the UK. As you know, Reuben Brothers is one of the most sophisticated, forward-thinking and well-capitalized global investors with the reputation of attracting best-in-class talent and technology platform. Our thesis was validated when Reuben Brothers attracted Lorna Rose, one of the most well respected operating -- senior housing operating executive in UK to join Avery as the company\u2019s CEO view in December. Lorna has spent 25 years in the industry and was most recently with Barchester, one of the UK's largest senior housing platforms. Next, on the capital allocation side, we have rarely seen a favorable environment across all our product types in all three countries we do business with in. There are 20-plus-billion of exit cue for core real estate funds and then perhaps even a longer one for non-traded REITs. This along with the challenging debt market, give us an enormous advantage to buy the right product at the right location at the right basis. Please note that while we are underrunning by more than $0.5 billion of EBITDA from pre-pandemic levels, we just reported debt metrics that are better than Q4 of 2019, along with more than $5 billion of near-term liquidity -- available liquidity. We have many avenues to access and deploy capital that I've described before, and we remain busy on all fronts. But our North Star remains consistent and simple. We strive to create per share value for our existing owners by compounding over a long period of time within our circle of competence, which we define as the area where we can assess and allocate capital with house odds rather than gambler\u2019s odds. With that, I'll pass it over to John. John Burkart : Thank you, Shankh. I'm excited about our operating performance this quarter and the acceleration in growth, which we've witnessed. My first conference call at Welltower was in Q2 of July 2021. Total portfolio same-store NOI was a negative 7.1%. Since that call, the portfolio's performance has continued to improve. In 2022, despite challenges, growth was in the range of 7% to 9% for the Q1 through Q3. However, in Q4, we accelerated a 12.9% portfolio NOI growth driven by senior housing operating business with NOI growth of 28.1%, despite all the challenges of the current economy. This amazing performance is a result of both the fantastic supply-demand dynamics of the senior housing sector and aggressive asset management. I continue to see many opportunities to professionalize the business, which are being proven out through various initiatives as noted in the case studies we presented in the slide deck and clearly come through the financials when looking at the massive improvement in agency labor, which I'll outline in a moment. It is this abundance of opportunity, the opportunity of applying proven industry solutions to the senior housing industry, which led me to chat to my friend, Jerry Davis, and engage Jerry as a Strategic Advisor. As many of you know, during my multifamily days, Jerry was my counterpart at UDR, one of the largest multifamily REITs with the national platform of 60,000 apartment homes. Jerry spent 30 years in various roles at UDR and nearly 15 overseeing all the company's operations before retiring in 2021. He and I have always shared similar views that the operational excellence requires a focus on people, processes, data and technology, which, if well done, results in a superior experience for both residents and employees and ultimately drives stronger financial performance. We have made substantial headway over the past 1.5-year in enhancing our management capabilities, and Jerry's expertise will accelerate that progress. He\u2019ll focus his efforts on specific opportunities while I\u2019ll continue to build the broader operating platform from asset management and operations to capital, resource management, renovation, et cetera, as Welltower transforms the business. Jerry will help us to continue accelerate -- continue to accelerate change in the senior housing industry. Our work together will not simply be additive, it will be exponential, J squared. Now, I'll provide some insight into our operating business, starting with the medical office portfolio. In the fourth quarter, same-store NOI growth for our outpatient medical business was 2.1% over the prior year's quarter. Same-store occupancy was steady throughout the year at nearly 95%, while retention remains extremely strong across the portfolio at 93% for the second straight quarter and nearly 92% for the entire year. This robust retention rate helps us drive improved lease rates and continued strong re-leasing rates. Turning to our senior housing operating portfolio. The 28.1% fourth quarter NOI increase over the prior year's quarter was driven by revenue growth of 10.3% for the period. Year-over-year margin growth of 320 basis points was also the strongest of the year. All three regions showed strong revenue growth, starting with Canada at 6.6%, the U.S. and the UK, an impressive 10.6% and 19.2%, respectively. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by a 200 basis-point increase in average occupancy and another quarter of healthy pricing power with REVPOR growth of 7.5%, which, as Shankh mentioned, is the highest we've ever witnessed. Sequentially, portfolio average occupancy continued to improve with a gain of 20 basis points during the period. Turning to expenses. Agency use has obviously been a key factor in 2022 expenses. However, in Q4 2022, just as Tim had mentioned many times, agency expense is acting as an expense deflator. Agency in our same-store portfolio is down 44% year-over-year in Q4 '22. We often quote agency as a percentage of compensation. So looking at it that way, in Q4 of 2021, agency expense was 6.9% of compensation and in Q4 of 2022, it was 3.7%. Regardless of how you look at agency, the expense is declining in the U.S. and Canada, where over 90% of our senior housing portfolio is located. The UK is still impacted by overall labor shortage as well as some rigid staffing models, which have led to lower occupancy properties being overstaffed. Management in the UK is slowly adjusting to a dynamic staffing model, ensuring appropriate staffing at various levels of occupancy. Overall, COMPOR, the compensation per occupied room, which represents about 60% of the expense per occupied room, increased only 2.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter, which is the lowest growth rate in over five years. This moderating COMPOR growth helped drive the deceleration in overall expense growth, despite continued inflationary pressures in several line items, including food and utilities, which rose 10.5% and 10%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2022 on a per occupied room basis compared to the prior year's quarter. Food and utilities represent roughly 12% of expense per occupied room. The combination of 7.5% REVPOR growth, the highest in over five years with a 3.4% expense POR growth led to remarkable growth rate in net operating income per occupied unit of 25%. Regarding our operating platform, we continue to be on pace to pilot our first module in Q1 '23, with several other modules in the works. I must say that I'm purposefully not giving out the details as they're proprietary. However, I will say that I'm proud of the creative accomplishments of the Welltower team and I'm grateful for the wonderful operators that we are partnering with on these first modules. The successes that we have had through aggressive asset management, as noted in the slide deck, are the result of brute force and prove the opportunity. Operational excellence is achieved by a focus on people, processes, data and technology, and that is exactly what the team has done and the various initiatives that are outlined in three case studies on agency labor reduction, revenue management and care revenue. We will continue to leverage our team to drive results, yet the greatest opportunity will be realized as we roll out the operating platform in the coming years. Finally, I would like to thank our operators and all their employees and the Welltower employees for making these results possible. Our teamwork has clearly paid off, leading to improved resident and employee experiences and stronger overall results. I'll now turn the call over to Tim. Tim McHugh : Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on the fourth quarter 2022 results, the performance of our triple-net investment segment in the quarter, our capital activity, our balance sheet liquidity update, and finally, our outlook for the year ahead. Welltower reported fourth quarter normalized funds from operations of $0.83 per diluted share, representing 7% year-over-year growth after adjusting for prior period government grants and FX headwinds. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth in the quarter of 12.9% year-over-year. Before getting into our segment results, I want to provide an update on our recently closed ProMedica restructure and the go-forward reporting treatment. In late December, we announced the closing of our restructure joint venture with ProMedica Health System and our newly formed joint venture with Integra Health. The ProMedica Health System JV consisting of 58 private pay assisted living assets will continue to be operated under a lease with ProMedica Health System and it is now part of our senior housing triple-net reporting segment. The Integra Health joint venture, consisting of 147 skilled nursing properties, comprised of a property joint venture and a master lease with Integra Health. The lease commenced upon closing in December adds to the first tranche of the property JV with Integra acquiring 15% of Welltower's stake in 54 of the assets for $73 million. As previously expected, subsequent to year-end, the second tranche of assets closed in January, Integra acquired 15% interest in another 31 assets for $74 million. The remaining 52 assets are expected to close in the second half of the year. As for the underlying operations, the subleasing of the portfolio is progressing in line with expectations. 75% of the beds have already transition management with the remainder of the portfolio waiting on state specific approvals. We will continue to update the market as the progress of management transitions in addition to underlying property level fundamentals. Now turning to the performance of the rest of our triple net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. These statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 9/30/2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 4.3% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.86 times in the quarter. Next, same-store NOI in our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 4% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.34 times in the quarter. Turning to capital market activity. In the quarter, we settled $1.5 billion of previously raised equity through our forward ATM program, helping to bring debt to EBITDA down to 6.3 times at year-end, a substantial decrease of nearly 7 times at year-end 2021 and below pre-COVID levels of Q4 2019. For the year, we settled a total of $3.7 billion of equity to fund $3.7 billion of net investment activity, allowing us to continue to deploy capital into a desiccated private market while materially delevering the balance sheet. Looking forward, we ended the year with $722 million of cash, full capacity on our $4 billion revolving line of credit and $383 million in expected proceeds from near-term dispositions and loan pay-downs, representing $5.1 billion in near-term available liquidity. Before moving on to our 2023 guidance, I wanted to add more context to Shankh's earlier commentary around the opportunity provided to our company by last year's Private Letter Ruling. Nearly 14 years ago, Welltower structured first day of management agreement, giving a direct economic exposure to senior housing operations. Over the last five-plus years, we built a better and stronger alignment within this contractual structure, ultimately reaching a point in 2021, where we can generate meaningful ROI through centralized human capital and technology investment at Welltower. We hired John Burkart and started to build the team around him. The PLR we received last year allowed us to meaningfully accelerate that effort as the ROI friction is entirely removed under self-management. This Welltower platform investment is evident through G&A. With greater than 80% of our expected year-over-year increase in overhead costs being driven by technology investment and new position additions in '22 and '23, focused primarily on asset management, data analytics and technology. We continue to believe that the opportunity to both modernize operations and drive efficiencies through scale in our business is vast and creates a sustainably strong cash flow tailwind when combined with the demographic-driven demand of the next decade plus. Lastly, moving to our full year guidance, which we are reintroducing for the first time since COVID uncertainty began impacting our business in March of 2020. Last night, we provided an outlook for 2023 of net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.57 to $0.75 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $3.35 to $3.53 per diluted share or $3.54 at the midpoint. As mentioned in the release, our 2023 guidance contemplates no adjustments for other government grants we receive in the year. So, after adjusting for $0.07 of nonrecurring government grants received in 2022, we are guiding for 5% year-over-year growth. This year-over-year increase in FFO is composed of $0.36 from growth in our senior housing operating portfolio and $0.03 from growth across the rest of our segments. These are offset by $0.04 of prior mentioned higher G&A and Welltower platform costs and $0.19 of floating rate interest and foreign exchange headwinds. Underlying this FFO guidance is estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 8% to 13%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%, long-term post-cute 2% to 3%, and senior housing triple-net of 1% to 3%, and finally, senior housing operating growth of 15% to 24%, the midpoint of which is driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.5%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 230 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth of approximately 6.25. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim. While we ended 2022 on a positive note, it was also a year of sheer grit and perseverance from our team. As we face different challenges in our business, be it the expense pressure, development cost pressure or ProMedica, we remain steadfast in our belief that our job as stewards of our shareholders' capital is to solve problems when we encounter on this journey and not rip the band aid off and give away potential future upside to private equity -- to profit from either because, one, it is the easiest thing to do instead of working things out or two, the feeling on instant gratification as Wall Street tends to cheer such decisions. We see too many market participants mix up short-term volatility with long-term risk apartment capital loss. As our partners in the business, our investors can count on us to take tough road to deliver strongest returns we believe are achievable when we face challenges. This is evident in the build-out of our operating platform and our transaction with ProMedica and Integra. To paraphrase Mr. Munger, you can rest assured that we have a deferred gratification gene imprinted all over our culture, and we remind ourselves every day that big money is made not in buying and selling, but in winning. Lastly, I'm extremely delighted to see many of my partners recently appointed to the executive and senior management roles within the organization, developing the business fighting it together in the trenches, and I'm convinced that we have the deepest bench strength along with the longest runway as I look across the real estate space. Supplementing this talent is our unmatched data and machine learning capabilities, which allows us to efficiently and cost effectively evaluate new investments as well as reinvestment in our portfolio. In addition to our strength of our existing team, we continue to attract best-in-class talent from outside the industry who share our belief that the future of our business may look very different from the past. Simply said, we want to attract talent that comes from the industries with high standards. And to that point, I could not be happier that John has convinced Jerry Davis to join our team. As you all know from his many years in multifamily sector, Jerry has one of the sharpest operating minds in real estate. I have known and admired Jerry for 15 years and cannot be more excited to work with him and learn from him. I'm more convinced than ever that John along with Jerry will have an exponential impact and transform this industry. If you are or know someone of that operating caliber and more importantly have an outsider\u2019s mindset from a related or frankly unrelated industry who wants to join the formidable team of J squared, please let us know. Welltower is wide open for business, not only for asset acquisition but also for talent acquisition. With that, I'll open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Jonathan Hughes at Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : I just wanted to ask about the increasing operator relationships. Obviously, we just saw another one yesterday with RUI and you talked about more opportunities -- or expected opportunities in the future. But I'm wondering what the landscape looks like after three years of these pandemic headwinds? How many high-quality operators remain as an opportunity that you don't already have a relationship with and what's the size of those individual opportunities? Are they smaller or larger in terms of investment volume than the relationships established over the past few years? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Yes. Jonathan, you asked a very, very good question. So, as I think about -- if your question is specific to senior housing industry, I see that -- obviously, we have most of the operating partners that want to do business which we already do business with. So expansion of new operating partners is less of a focus and going deep rather than going broad is our focus. We are looking for striving for regional density with our existing partners across the different countries, right? Now, we have, I mentioned before that we have -- there are operating partners in the business, there are operators in the business that we have admired for a very long period of time. And this is a long dating process. It takes a long time for both parties to understand how we can add value to each other, right? Capital is a commodity. Just capital, us bringing capital to an operating partner, frankly speaking, in any relationship is not enough. And for our perspective, so we bring in data analytics and other operating platform initiatives that John is doing to the equation. At the same time, we want to understand whether these operating partners are thinking about the business or where the business is going 10, 20 years from now, not where the business was 10, 20 years ago, right? There's a significant mind shift that is needed in the business. And frankly speaking, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we need higher standards, higher standards of employee engagement, higher standards of customer service and higher standard of how we treat capital and what we -- and how we deliver results for the capital. And those are the type of operating partners and business partners that we're looking for, and we're grateful that we have a fundamentally a fantastic roster of these people to drive business with. Now going to the second part of your question, from an investment volume standpoint, I want to reemphasize, you're going to see a majority of the investment volume with existing partners as well as sort of the partners that we have already announced in the last couple of -- two, three years. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Griffin at Citi. Michael Griffin : Maybe just on transaction activity. I mean, Shankh, I know you've always talked about how you're an unlevered IRR focused investor. I'm curious if you've seen any change and maybe hurdle or return rates that might get you more excited about one property type relative to another. I know you seem pretty positive in your opening comments, but any additional clarity there would be helpful. Shankh Mitra : Michael, if you think about -- different times give us opportunities for different types of product. You have seen us buy and sell every product that we own in last, call it, 7 years, 8 years under this -- under the leadership of this team, right? So, because different times, you get opportunities to buy different products at a very favorable basis. This might be the first time we're seeing across all our product type, across the three countries that we do business with, we're seeing opportunities, right? This is a very, very disruptive time from not only from debt side but also from equity side. The people who we normally compete against, right, the core funds, the non-traded REITs and others, everybody is facing very significant flow -- outflow, either because of the denominator effect that you see in pension fund world as well institutional world or some other reasons such as availability of -- not availability of debt and other situations. So, we're seeing across all product types, we're seeing very significant opportunities -- and frankly speaking, an ability to achieve IRRs that we haven't seen in some of the product types, frankly, forever. Operator : We'll move next to Jeff Dennerlein (sic) [Josh Dennerlein] at Bank of America. Josh Dennerlein : I appreciate all the color on the asset management platform. Just kind of curious how we should be thinking about kind of is this like the full investment year and then payoffs start happening in 2024? Is there anything kind of built into guidance as far as like a payoff -- and how are we thinking about the J squared run rate for returns? John Burkart : Yes. I'll start and Tim may want to comment. I'm not definitely -- for clarity, not commenting on Tim's guidance. But, I think what we're seeing and what we're trying to show is the returns are already coming through. I mean, if you look at what's going on from an aggressive asset management perspective, you see that in the agency move and what the team has done, which is tremendous amount of blocking and tackling. The additional work that we're doing really relates to scaling those things. And partly why we included that in the deck is I came in and I had a view of things from my gut, you might say, so to speak. And I probed around and got confirmation, and then we started workflows and now that that's proving out, and that's what we wanted to show because that is critical. We were right. There is tremendous opportunity here. And the more I got into it, the more opportunity I see. When you look at J squared, this exponential opportunity, it's huge. My view is where I'm working right now is across the whole platform, as I mentioned, and Jerry will be able to focus in on individual items and execute highest of all levels, which will speed up our process. So bottom-line is we're already delivering numbers. It will continue for many, many years and it ultimately relates to significant margin improvement across the board. Tim McHugh : I'll just add on cost. We look at this as an investment, right, on the human capital side and on the technology side. So, you know that we run our platform very efficiently, and we don't take the costs lightly as far as any further investment. But we think there's a lot of return here on investment. And so, there is a bit of a lag between dollars in and hires, in that return. But on a go-forward basis, I expect us to be very prudent about it and continue to show high return for dollars spent. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Mike Mueller at JPMorgan. Mike Mueller : Hi. I\u2019m curious what's the range of margins that you think the SHO business could operate at full occupancy, and to use your term, when it's fully professionalized? Shankh Mitra : Mike, I was just not going to sit here and try to speculate what might or might not happen, but I will repeat what I've said before. If we went back to pre-COVID occupancy and pre-COVID margin, I will be really disappointed. If that's where we end, we'll be disappointed. Operator : We'll go next to Derek Johnston at Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : In addition to the REIT community, a lot of generalist investors are closely following WELL. So, I know we touched on it in the opening, but can you expand on this favorable Private Letter Ruling with the IRS. I think around 45,000 independent living units are not really being designated as healthcare facilities and/or subject to RDEA. [Ph] And so what does that mean, right? And importantly, how the decision may drive further earnings growth, especially given the beefed-up asset platform? Thanks. John Burkart : Yes. I'll touch on that. So, what it means, I think the easiest way to look at it is if you just go back and read history a little bit and you look at the multifamily world when everyone kind of came together in the mid-'90s when I started -- where I was at. And what you saw is this move from fee managers to owner operators was a fundamental shift. And what I think a lot of people missed was there was a basic economics behind that. In essence, as a fee manager, you get paid a percentage, let's say, 5% to collect $1, and that means you wouldn't spend more than $0.05 to collect the dollar; as an owner operator you paid $1 to collect $1, so that's -- you would spend $0.99 to collect $1. And so that fundamental shift enabled us as owner operators to move much, much faster and changed how we looked at the world, whether it be investing in websites, technology, et cetera, or bringing things in-house, marketing in-house, et cetera. All these things enabled a tremendous improvement in margins. And that's what it ultimately means is it will allow us to step into that business and have tremendous impact on the margins. More than that, I would say, I break the business down into three components overall. There's a real estate or multifamily component. There's what I call the hospitality component, which relates to meals, housekeeping activities, and then there's a care component. And so, our various residential businesses have one to three of those parts. So, as we step in, we address the real estate as well as this hospitality component at our independent living, we'll be able to take those best practices and move those into the assisted living, which we're obviously not managing. But if we find better ways, more effective ways to deliver higher quality meal service, et cetera, that will all be pushed out through our platform, no different than what we're doing right now in our case study on revenue management, how we push that out to one of the assisted living properties. So, the same concept will apply. So, this is pretty huge, and it will impact our overall residential platform. Shankh Mitra : I'll just add, Derek, one thing to that. Just as I mentioned before, we're working towards regional density and going deep and not going broad with our existing partners, right? So, think about it, I don't know, just -- you will see the future is with our select operating partners, strategic partners, we're going to have bigger density or higher density and a bigger scale in a market and with our investment in the technology platform and the operating platform with our operating partners, the ability to execute on the ground I think, again, this is going to be not only a great win for our owners, our assets, but also a great win for the select operated partners that we'll choose to do business with going forward. So, it is a very much of a focus on win-win, and that's the way business got to be. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Carroll at RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : How has Welltower's relationship changed with its existing independent living operators since the PLR announcement? I mean, are they more willing to work with Welltower, given certain goals or targets, or has there been any noticeable change since that was announced? Shankh Mitra : The forward thinking ones who are thinking about where the business needs to go 10 years from now, 5 years from now, 15 years from now, has come forward and want to participate in building out the platform together. The ones that are holding on to the notion of what the business was in the \u201890s are clearly realizing their future is not with us. Operator : Next, we'll go to Ronald Kamdem at Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : Hey. Adam on for Ron. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask about the ProMedica, Integra assets. Wondering kind of with the new operators in place there for some of them, if you could kind of comment on the rent coverage, I'm not sure if it was in the supplemental. I know there's some changes there in terms of the reporting structure. So I'd love to just hear about the rent coverage. I think it would be helpful for investors kind of given the kind of the prior history there. John Burkart : Look, I think with the new operators, we've transitioned to at least 16 operators so far. And by the time the dust settles, it will be north of 20 operators. But all these transitions have happened over the last month, 1.5-month. So, it's too soon to have numbers and performance conversations about their performance, but overall transitions have been smooth. And in the upcoming months, we'll have better data to share on performance trends. But for now, the focus has been on getting the buildings in the right hands. And as you'll see, with 16 to 20 operators that the focus has been very deep and very sharpshooter-esque where you want to find for every single asset, the right operator. So, that's been the top priority so far. Operator : We'll go next to Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Shankh, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the investment opportunities that you're sort of seeing out there? And sort of the distress in the system, you guys were obviously very active last year. I'm just curious what it takes to sort of shake the tree and how the returns might have changed kind of looking forward on the new deals? Shankh Mitra : Steve, I don't think I have much to add. Maybe Nikhil has something to add after I'm done. I would just tell you that this is sort of the only time I've seen where there's opportunity in all three product types across all three countries, right? You usually don't see that. And that's driven by -- last couple of years have been primarily debt driven, right? So, we have seen a lot of opportunities in the IRR. So, we have done senior housing 9%, call it circa, 9%, some higher, some lower, but call it around 9%. Historically, I've said medical office is an interesting business to buy or interesting space to invest around, call it, 7-plus unlevered IRR. Finally, we're seeing opportunities in 8-plus level. And on the wellness side, where the cap rates have been very, very tight, IRRs have been in the 6s, we're finally seeing they're in the high-7s, right? So, that's sort of, I would say, where the different investment landscape where we're seeing opportunities, but depends on -- some are obviously higher. We're still seeing some double-digit opportunities. But I will tell you the other thing is because it's not just debt driven but also equity driven, most of the stuff that we have bought in last couple of years, we're fundamentally focused on right location, right product, right basis. And we have bought lots of assets with no cash flow, negative cash flow. And finally, we're seeing because people have to transact, right, what's happening, we are seeing opportunities that with very good bases, with very good locations, assets are also starting to come with cash flow. That's sort of, I will say, the slight change in nuance of the investment landscape. But I don't know, Nikhil you want to add anything? John Burkart : And I think the other thing I'll add is we just go through a lot of pain and effort to try and be the highest quality counterparty for someone to deal with. Whether it is the speed of execution, whether it is across the time frame of a transaction sticking with what we started off saying initially, the deal was, and in times like these, it just makes us the preferred counterparty. And so, there's a lot of recognition for that across the Street. And it's times like these that we really are able to shine. So, very excited about our pipeline for the year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rich Anderson at SMBC. Rich Anderson : If I could just -- on the PLR, very, very interesting indeed -- just some thoughts around it. Does this mean that we should see sort of a pace of investment from you guys to bring managers in-house for what you have currently? And how much of the IL portfolio that you have today didn't qualify? Will there be cut changes there to have them pass the test so that they also can qualify for the PLR ruling? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Yes. So I'll take the second part. Think about we have independent living at a standalone, for example, Holiday Atria portfolio as well as our Canada portfolio. That's roughly, I would say, 2/3 to 3/4 of the independent living that we own that obviously qualifies. How this relates to, when independent living is a part of the continuum, we will figure that out. Most importantly, I want to focus on what I said before that you will see with our forward thinking select operators who have density, you will see that we will -- building out the platform, right? John has mentioned very clearly that he is building out the platform with our best operators, right? This is not a question of what part will do in-house versus in what part we'll do with operator. We have also another 15,000, 20,000 units in the wellness housing sector there, which obviously we always could have done in-house, right? So, this is finding the right balance of retail density with all the products that are out there region, and bringing in-house where we have the density versus -- or keeping it outside when our partners have density. So, the game is not to who does what. This is not a fight of just because we do something, we'll do it better. The main goal is with our operating partners build this operating platform to the highest quality technology and systems and processes and data to deliver the best outcome for our residents as well as frankly, employee experience. John, do you want to add anything to that? John Burkart : Yes. I mean, that's said perfectly. And I would just add in a sense of the speed, you can only imagine we're moving and we have been moving extremely fast to address the opportunities that we see. We'll definitely build on success. It's not exactly -- what Shankh's saying, it's not about going out and trying to control everything, it\u2019s about creating success that drives value to all the various stakeholders. So, that's where our heads are at. And in the end, there'll be a little bit of the lag in the sense of where we spend money on G&A versus where we start to offset that because of reduced fees because we're just moving it like the multifamily, moving the property management services on to the book. So, a little bit of a lag there, but ultimately, it will offset and the improvement will be in margins. Operator : We'll go next to Juan Sanabria at BMO. Juan Sanabria : Just wanted to hit on the SHO -- same-store NOI growth guidance Shankh, I think you mentioned in your opening remarks about the exit run rate and focusing on that. So maybe hoping you can provide a little color there? And should we assume that there's any incremental transitions in '23? You mentioned RUI having growing -- going forward through transitions as well. So just curious if you could maybe just comment on those two moving pieces. Shankh Mitra : Yes. Thanks, Juan. So the transition piece, we'll start with that. There is not a contemplation of further transitions in our guidance. So, our first quarter has about 85% of our open and operating buildings as of 12/31. Our first quarter has 85% of that same-store and that grows to mid-90s. So on average, kind of 90% of the open and operating assets in that pool. What was the first question? Juan Sanabria : The cadence of the exit run rate. Shankh Mitra : Yes. So, if you think about it, we're building occupancy, right? You know that Q1 is sort of the weaker point in the occupancy spectrum, and you build occupancy -- occupancy growth happens through spring and summer. So your occupancy build on an average basis, you get closer to sort of that Q3, Q4 level where you get a better revenue, if you will, right, sort of in that annual journey. Now, think about expenses, which are also coming down, right? So you have -- you probably have a better -- significantly better exit run rate in Q4 than Q1, right? So following both revenue as well as expenses. Think about how other situation that I've described before, I think the last call, maybe the one before, is how REVPOR builds, right? You move your rents on a bunch of people at the beginning of the year and as well as our -- for our portfolio, just call it, half and half. We also have a very large operator who moved in Q4, but just think through how that plays out. And then you chase that in-place rent through your market rent, which is also going up for the year. So, if you think about from an occupancy, from rates, from expense improvements, which is we're glad that agency cost is down from, call it, 7 to sub 4. We were very unhappy. It's still sub 4. It should be significantly lower than that. So if you think through all of the main drivers, you're going to get a much higher exit run rate in Q4 than Q1. Operator : We'll move next to John Pawlowski at Green Street. John Pawlowski : John Burkart, could you just give me a sense for how much more pushback your operators are seeing on rent increases today than in recent quarters, so they've had no issue pushing rents? And if there's any segments of the portfolio that are starting to hit a wall just in terms of absolute rents? Any color there would be appreciated. John Burkart : Yes. No, glad to. I'm not aware of any pushback. It's not to say, of course, when a rent increase goes out, there's not a discussion. But in the sense of defining pushback as a market response to that, no, I'm not aware of that. I think, the -- our partners have done a phenomenal job of communicating the increases and the reasons behind those increases. And I think our residents understand that they don't want to see important services and care cut. They want to have what they paid for, the best of that, and we're just not aware of any issues there. Shankh Mitra : John, as I mentioned, I expect REVPOR increase to be better in '23 than '22. So, that sort of gives you -- we'll see what the market gives us. But as we sit here today, we think the pricing environment is getting better. Operator : We'll move next to Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra : Just maybe building upon the pricing power, maybe Shankh or John, if you can just elaborate. You talked about the exit run rate, earnings run rate sort of as a guide to the earnings power. Can you talk about both on pricing and say, CapEx, as you see inflation come in, your costs come in, your maybe ability to push higher rates. You said near term is not hampered. But as you see inflation come in, but occupancy is still low, can you just give us some context on how you see pricing power evolving until occupancy recovers? And then, similarly, CapEx-wise, after 2, 3 years of COVID, what do you need to invest from a run rate standpoint, maybe percent of NOI? Is there an uptick needed over the next few years on CapEx? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Let me try that. So first on CapEx I do not believe, other than inflationary changes, anything change from a CapEx standpoint, right? So just understand that we bought predominantly in the last two, three years, new assets. We bought one or two portfolio as the value-add portfolio. And when we bought it, for example, the Holiday Atria portfolio, we told you exactly what we underwrote to spend on CapEx, right? We bought in an extremely cheap basis. And we told you exactly what that CapEx needs are and how we plan to invest. So from that perspective, as you think about going forward, I do not believe -- outside those couple of value-add investments that we have done, and we told you otherwise, when we have done it, we do not believe the business\u2019s CapEx needs outside the sort of inflationary increases that are happening anything has changed. Now, I think John has a very large plan, a very big plan to reamenitize the portfolio and sort of fundamentally changing what the value proposition might look like. Obviously, we'll do that if think that we're getting fantastic return on that incremental investment. But from a regular CapEx perspective, I don't think anything has changed. From a pricing power standpoint, I don't think -- what else I can add other than to what I said to John's question and the earlier question, which is we are feeling very good about the pricing power across all our countries and across all our product types. As you know that Canada has been a laggard, feels like Canada is starting to catch up. UK and U.S. has been strong and continue to be strong. So, we're feeling pretty good. John, do you want to add anything to that? John Burkart : Yes. I mean, again, I would just say, on the value-add side, this is purely opportunistic. I mean, I just look at the world and see our portfolio is positioned so well to come with another layer of value-add opportunities because of the age of the portfolio, which are really the highest returns because the infrastructure is all in great shape. And so, you're talking about what some people would call fluff and buff, but reamenitize, enhancing the units a little bit really improving that value proposition and getting paid very well for it, very much similar to what many of the multi have done, so. But that's all enhanced the returns. Shankh Mitra : Vikram, I missed one part of your question. I'll just tell you that from a pricing power standpoint, this is something I mentioned in the last call that we are -- despite our average occupancy of the portfolio, call it, circa 80%, there's a significant part of the portfolio, call it, give or take, half of the portfolio, 45% of the portfolio is in that high-80s, mid- to high-80% occupancy. There, the pricing power changes to raising price because have no rooms to sell, right? So there is a dynamic that's going on and increasingly we'll get to the point as we move average occupancy for the portfolio, more and more properties within the bucket that you will get to that pricing power because, frankly, you have no room to sell. So that transition is happening and will continue to happen in '23. Operator : We'll take a follow-up from Michael Griffin at Citi. Michael Griffin : I just wanted a clarifying question. I don't recall if I heard this earlier, but on the assets that continue to be operated by ProMedica, the assisted living and memory care. What is the coverage on those? Do you happen to have that handy? Tim McHugh : Yes. Those are covered one-times on EBITDA basis. Operator : And we'll go next to Derek Johnston at Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : \u2026won't make the habit of it. But on staffing levels, at 80% occupancy in senior housing, I believe that's near fully staffed, and please correct me if I'm wrong. But the question is, what are you modeling or including in guidance for '23 relative to agency labor as a percentage of labor expenses? And do you view this as possible low-hanging fruit to get back to pre-pandemic levels of agency especially as John and the team increase property level accountability. Shankh Mitra : Let me try to take part of that and Tim will take part of that question. So, we do not view this as a low-hanging fruit, but we do view this as a fruit that can be plucked, right? So there's a lot of effort that's going on. Tim will tell you what's modeled. Frankly, I don't know. But I will tell you that this is -- agency labor is a function of, frankly, weak management. That's just what it is, weak leadership. And we're working with our best-in-class operators to get the right people in the right place so that we should, over a period of time, see that improvement. As I've said, coming below 4% is an achievement when you start from 9%, but by no means, I want you to think that I'm actually happy with that number. That number needs to be substantially lower. And we need to really get full-time employees in the communities. This is not just a question of cost, but also, as John alluded to, it's also a question of culture and the customer experience. Tim McHugh : From a modeling perspective, we're essentially in the high-3s as a percentage of compensation. So pretty flat from where we came out of 2022. Operator : We'll move next to John Pawlowski at Green Street. John Pawlowski : Thanks. I just had one follow-up on the Private Letter Ruling. I guess what else needs to happen internally in terms of people, systems, technology before you're actually able to self operate a substantial amount of IL units? I'm just curious how quickly we could actually see Welltower operate these assets. John Burkart : Yes. So, I'll comment on what would need to happen, but not necessarily the speed at which. But if you look at it, I mean, one way to look at it is really just to simplify the world a lot and to say what would happen when a company -- from my past experience, when the two companies merge, you look and say, okay, if I step into their systems and start to fly the plane with what they have, that could happen pretty fast, right? That's not that complex. And so, the timing of it could be -- can be faster if we wanted it to be faster by stepping in that way. Obviously, what -- going back to what we're building, as I've mentioned previously, we're using largely existing modules. There's some creative stuff going on right now with the team. But generally, it's existing modules that are out there. And so, that doesn't take that long either. So, the speed can go fairly fast. The bigger issue is we're focused on success, and we're focused on working with people to deliver the success. It's not about us necessarily doing it. It's about us delivering success for all the stakeholders. So, that's where my mind is at. But the speed could go pretty fast. Shankh Mitra : It will not surprise me to see that we start to self manage some assets -- some IL assets in calendar year 2023. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. And that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Welltower First Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and please be advised that this call is being recorded. After the speakers' prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir. Matt McQueen : Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the Company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the Company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review our first quarter results and describe high-level business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on the performance of a senior housing operating and outpatient medical portfolio. Tim will walk you through triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and revised guidance. Nikhil is also on the call to answer questions. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with results that exceeded our expectations. Our strong performance was once again driven by outsized growth in our senior housing operating portfolio. We generated 23.4% same-store NOI growth, with both revenue and expense trends continue to move in the right direction. In fact, we produced our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth on the back of strong pricing power and occupancy build, with each coming slightly better than expected. But perhaps equally, if not more encouraging, is the margin expansion story, which has been driven by a significant improvement on the cost side. While we generated strong revenue growth in 2020, these gains were largely offset by pressure across the expense tax, which ultimately resulted a lost year in terms of partial growth. We are delighted by the progress made on various expense items, but particularly pleased by the sharp decline in agency labor or temporary staffing across the portfolio. Over the past few quarters, we have noted the headway our operating partners have made in net hiring, as JL employment rates have been weakening. This has ultimately translated into a meaningful reduction of prohibitively expensive temporary staffing, which -- with cost declining over 50% versus the first quarter of last year. Though we still have a long way to go to eradicate this problem which we largely attribute to committee leadership challenges, we believe that this trend along with strong pricing power will continue to be a tailwind for further margin expansion. From a product and geographic standpoint, while assisted living continued to outperform independent living, IL pricing is starting to strengthen. This is reflected in our Canadian portfolio, which is finally rebounding after a disappointing couple of years. We have seen standout performance from our operating partner Cogir, which has returned to almost 40% margin for the first time since COVID. We're grateful to our partner Mathieu Duguay and his team for their hard work and dedication. Sticking with that international team, our UK portfolio continues to produce strong revenue growth, and we're starting to see some green shoots on the cost side. During our call, I expressed my enthusiasm around the appointment of Lorna Rose as a CEO of a largest UK operator, Avery. Lorna is already making significant impact with a strong commercial acumen and impeccable leadership skills. We expect our UK portfolio to be a strong source of growth as we look at 2024 and beyond. Returning to the U.S., our largest operator Sunrise continues to produce strong top and bottom line results. There is meaningful embedded upside to this incredibly well located and virtually impossible to replicate portfolio which sits at mid-70s occupancy today. Also during our last call, I mentioned that we expect meaningful step function growth from a large regionally concentrated portfolio of StoryPoint. I'm pleased to report that Dan and his team has started the year off with a bang, as their no excuse culture and relentless focus on performance is paying off significantly. And last but not least, Oakmont. A year and a half ago we moved six well-located California properties to Oakmont and at that time, Courtney Siegel, Oakmont\u2019s CEO made me a promise that our team would lease up this portfolio in two years. I'm pleased to report that the portfolio today sits at 86% occupancy, while NOI has gone up 13 times since then. Courtney has set a simple performance-driven culture at Oakmont. If you're not 95% occupied, you're not performing. I'm confident that I will be able to soon report to you that this portfolio has reached 90 plus percent occupancy level. Pursuit of higher standard is prerequisite of high performance. Last year, I described to you that we as capital allocators strive to create partial value by compounding over a long period of time. By doing what's right in the long-term for our continuing shareholders may result in short-term pain. Our proactive portfolio management efforts, which includes transition of properties to strongest operators is an example of this philosophy. I encourage you to look at the case studies within our business update presentation for more details on Oakmont success and the other key operators including Peace Capital, which has created substantial value for our shareholders following the transition of a portfolio of skilled nursing facilities two years ago. By operating these facilities more efficiently from an expense perspective while increasing quality mix, Peace has been able to improve EBITDAR by more than 75% relative to the pre-COVID levels. This point is further underscored by our COVID class of acquisitions and our further efforts to transition other assets over the last few years. We're just beginning to capture significant embedded NOI from these properties as they return to their pre-COVID NOI levels and higher. And in fact, we have achieved 20% of that incremental NOI in the past quarter alone. Shifting to the operating platform and asset management initiatives. As you know -- as you have come to know, Welltower -- at Welltower, we vehemently reject mediocrity and are in relentless pursuit of high standards. We continue to behave -- believe that there's an opportunity to recognize meaningful cash flow from our own portfolio as we optimize location, product, price point, and operators using our data analytics platform Alpha. To further add to this multi-dimensional optimization problem using machine learning, our operating platform initiatives are now becoming more tangible, moving from drawing boards to pilots, while a few weeks don't make it trend, we are optimistic that John and his team are on the verge of some real creative breakthrough more on that incoming quarters. In terms of recent operating conditions, while I don't like to fix it on short term trends, I want to mention the consistent rise in demand for our seniors\u2019 product in Q1. Total volumes are up roughly 20% in the quarter, partially attributed to an easier comparison period last year due to Omicron variant, but also because of great organic demand as we enter another year of significant growth of the 80-plus population. Lease and tours have picked up further in April. While we remain confident in the prospect of business, I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the rising macroeconomic uncertainty as we approach the summer and fall leasing season. We're encouraged by what we are seeing so far, which admittedly is also the seasonally lowest -- slowest point in the year. Therefore, we need to see the -- what market gives us during the all important upcoming leasing season. The need-driven nature of our product gives me hope that we will outperform majority of the asset classes, not just real estate but it is also important for you to understand that we have no delusion of certainty. Moving to capital allocation, since our last call, U.S. banking sector has started to show some significant signs of strains, resulting in material declining trade flow in the economy. While no one is rooting for macroeconomic uncertainty, the current backdrop has certainly created a further expansion to our already attractive set of capital deployment opportunities. We remain disciplined and will not risk the enterprise that we built with blood, sweat and tears, but we remain optimistic that we'll be able to grow our portfolio with well located asset at highly favorable bases and in-place cash flow. To illustrate that point further, we acquired $529 million of asset during first quarter at a great basis and in-place cash flow. The K Street medical office building that we acquired in DC perhaps tells you how favorable the investment environment has become. We continue to see underwriting standards starting meaningfully, leverage levels decline, and banks are now requiring more commercial deposits and more recourse. As a low leveraged buyer, this backdrop is very beneficial for us. Our pipeline today is robust with opportunities to deploy capital across senior housing in all three countries, outpatient medical in the U.S. and data opportunities on the skilled side. Our team remains active and yet highly disciplined and price conscious as always. From a balance sheet standpoint, I wanted to quickly highlight the continued progress we made in terms of leverage and liquidity under Tim's leadership. He will get into more details. But I'm very pleased with significant deleveraging that we have achieved in past year with net debt to EBITDA falling almost a turn to 6.3 with further organic deleveraging going forward. And our ability to source over $1 billion of capital this year in the midst of a very challenging capital markets environment is a testament to the confidence entrusted in us by the banking community, the lenders, our investors and our other partners. With approximately $700 million of the cash on the books and undrawn line of credit, we are not only positioned to endure further capital market volatility, but also to deploy capital as opportunities arise. To summarize our optimism regarding the long-term growth trajectory of the business remains firmly intact. Top-line growth remains strong, expenses are moderating and our external growth opportunities continue to expand. While -- all the while John and his team are making progress in turning our vision of creating a world class operating platform into a reality. And with that, I will turn it over to him for an update on the operational element of the business and build out of the platform. John? John Burkart : Thank you, Shankh. Another great quarter, 11% same-store NOI growth of the prior year's quarter led by the senior housing operating portfolio with 23.4% year-over-year growth. These results speak for themselves. They're great. So, I'll provide limited color this quarter. Medical office portfolio's first quarter same store NOI growth was 1.6% over the prior year's quarter. As our guidance outlines, we expect the MOB portfolio to deliver between 2% and 3% same-store NOI growth in 2023. And therefore, we expect the remaining three quarters to be well above the first quarter number. Same-store occupancy was 94.9%, while retention remains extremely strong across the portfolio at 91.4%. The 23.4% first quarter NOI increase in our senior housing operating portfolio was a function of the 10% revenue growth and continued expense control for the period. I want to remind everyone that last quarter's revenue growth was driven in part by an operator pulling forward rental increases. Excluding that specific operator revenue growth in Q1 would have been 10.8%, 130 basis-point increase over the growth for Q4 2022 for the comparable portfolio. All three of our regions continued to show strong revenue growth, starting with Canada 7.7% and the U.S. and UK growing 9.3% and 17.4%, respectively. Revenue growth for the quarter was driven by a 240 basis-point increase in average occupancy and another quarter of healthy pricing power with RevPOR growth of 6.8%. The 10 basis-point increase in sequential occupancy during the first quarter period that has historically seen an occupancy decline due to seasonal factors reflects the continued increased demand for senior housing as we move into the all important spring and summer leasing season. Turning to expenses, agency use continues to decline, leading to a 53% expense decrease year-over-year for the same store portfolio in the first quarter of 2023. Welltower's continued aggressive asset management to keeping expenses in check, enabling margin expansion. During the first quarter, the operating margin expanded 240 basis points over the prior year's quarter. Regarding our operating platform, I'm very pleased with the progress the teams have made. We are executing rapidly as planned. As many of you know, I'm somewhat secretive about the details of our platform for proprietary reasons. However, I will say that one of the challenges our operators in the pilot are having is keeping up with the increased qualified leads, a very good problem to have. We're at the very beginning of this process but all lights are green at this time, and I'm very excited about the future. I'm grateful for the diversity of operational experience, engagement and enthusiasm of those operators who understand how the platform will transform the business, lead to consolidation and great success for the operators who leverage our best-in-class platform to improve the delivery of service to our customers, the quality of life of the employees and returns for our owners. I will now turn the call over to Tim. Tim McHugh : Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our first quarter 2023 results, performance of our triple-net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, our balance sheet and liquidity update, and finally our updated full year 2023 outlook. Welltower reported first quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.05 per diluted share, and normalized funds from operations of $0.85 per diluted share, representing a 4% year-over-year growth and 13% growth after adjusting for the year-over-year impact from a stronger dollar and higher base rates on floating rate debt. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 11% year-over-year. Now turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So, these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31/2022. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 0.2% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage is 0.86 times in the quarter. Next same-store NOI on our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 4.2% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.33 times. Turning to capital market activity. In the quarter we raised $413 million through our ATM program, which helped fund accretive investment activity during the quarter and maintain debt to EBITDA at 6.31 times at quarter end, a substantial decrease from 7.1 times at 3/31/2022. In March, we swapped $350 million of our $1 billion 2027 floating rate term loan to a fixed rate of 5.335% through March of '24, bringing floating rate debt to 13.6% of total debt and just 4% of consolidated enterprise value as of quarter end. We ended the quarter with $639 million of cash, full capacity under $4 billion revolving line of credit and $393 million of expected proceeds from near-term dispositions and loan pay-downs, representing $5 billion in near-term available liquidity. Over the last 12 months, we've seen leverage meaningfully improve from its post COVID peak, reaching the first quarter of 2022. As our senior housing operating NOI has started to recover, we have experienced beginning stages of a cash flow growth driven deleveraging. And we have amplified this organic leverage reduction, the disciplined approach to capitalization of our external growth pipeline. The result of this approach is a balance sheet that in its current form is poised to be substantially lower levered than it was pre-COVID as we continue to see senior housing operating environment recover. Lastly, moving to our full year guidance. Last night we updated our previously issued full year 2023 outlook, the net income attributable to common stockholders to a range of $0.57 to $0.72 per diluted share, and normalized FFO of $3.39 to $3.54 per diluted share or $3.465 at the midpoint. Our updated normalized FFO guidance represents $0.025 increase at the midpoint from our previously issued guidance. This increase in guidance is reflective of $0.02 of fundamental outperformance, mainly from our senior housing operating segment, roughly $0.005 of which is from subsidies received in Q1 and a $0.005 from investment activity completed in Q1. Underlying this FFO guidance is an increased estimate of total portfolio year-over-year same store NOI growth of 9% to 13%, driven by sub-segment growth of outpatient medical 2% to 3%, long-term post-acute 3% to 4%, senior housing triple-net 1% to 3%, and finally increased senior housing operating growth of 17% to 24% year-over-year. The midpoint of which is driven by better than expected expense trends to start the year, along with year-over-year growth expectations of revenue, approximately 9.5%. Underlying this revenue growth is expectation of approximately 230 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth from approximately 6.3%. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim. While we're very pleased with our quarterly results and our improved outlook, it's a bittersweet moment for us in Toledo as we mourn the passing of George Chapman. George was the former Chairman and CEO of Health Care REIT, Welltower\u2019s very sister company, and a gifted person and a visionary in the healthcare real estate space, and perhaps above all, an incredibly kind and generous individual. During his many years at Health Care REIT, George not only served as a leader of the company, but was also mentor and teacher to numerous individuals across the real estate space. He was raised in the Toledo area and always sought opportunities to give back to the community, including his high schools in Miami, and through his service on various boards to strengthen the northeast Ohio region. We are deeply appreciative of all he has done for us and he'll be missed dearly.  Lastly, before we go into Q&A, I wanted to highlight a document which we posted on our website last evening, which was also part of our shareholder letter published a couple of weeks ago. This document contents a set of ground rules or shared principles, which form Welltower's philosophical foundation for long-term compounding through capital allocation, risk mitigation, and culture amongst other factors, and ultimately the most importantly -- ultimately and most importantly, who we seek as our long-term investor partners as we execute our mission of delivering to them superior, absolute and relative total shareholder returns. I will now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question this morning from Derek Johnston of Deutsche Bank. Derek Johnston : Hey, everybody. Good morning. Can you share your thoughts on further transitions and potential consolidation of operators within the portfolio? Because in your case studies, we were most impressed with Kisco. Are there opportunities to expand this relation from seven or eight communities, like you did with the Kensington? And look, we ask given all operators are not operationally equal. So, is there a plan or potential for further accretive transitions? Shankh Mitra : So, Derek, you asked a lot of questions, so I'll try to -- I think I'll try to remember answer the question. Kisco is one of our best operating partners, and there are very significant opportunities to grow with Kisco. Whether that's through transition, that's through acquisition, that's through development, obviously, there's no question that they have absolutely hit it out of the park. So -- and we\u2019re having all these conversations going on. As I've mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, I believe that we finally have figured out hopefully how to do transition very creatively as you -- sort of your words, but I think that's a good one. I think, I've given some examples in my script and Oakmont. Let me give you another example. Probably last year, this time, we announced a large set of acquisitions with our partner, StoryPoint. And the first tranche of that acquisition closed in Q3. So, let's think about it. So, these properties -- the first tranche, there's 18 properties, the StoryPoint took over from a -- on the existing operator. At that point, that end of Q2, it had 74% occupancy, call it circa $6.5 million, $6.4 million of NOI, annualized NOI. And nine months later, they started taking this over in July, you would think that through transition, and all of those obviously moving this asset NOI -- that it will be great win, if occupancy and NOI held. Nine months later, today -- not today, end of March and the quarter end, occupancy was at 2%, NOI was $16.2 million. That tells you what a great operator with significant focus can do. So, it is my belief that now you got, obviously, John and his team and with our premium operating partners, who have done this many times over, during the most difficult time of COVID has figured out how to do this extremely well and creatively. I gave you a bunch of examples. We obviously provided more case studies. And we do think that there is significant opportunities to enhance our portfolio by what I said, optimizing four things, right? It's an optimization problem, which is location, product, price point, and operator, right? So, that's what you know, obviously Swagat and Kevin and their team are trying to constantly do, and we're executing that with our premium operating partners. Operator : We\u2019ll go next now to Connor Siversky at Wells Fargo. Connor Siversky : Question on labor for me. I can appreciate that Welltower, the operator base has made a lot of headway on improving labor sourcing methods across the portfolio and then the positive trends related to agency usage. And so I'm curious, what does the training schedule look like for a new hire in a senior housing facility? And can you provide any color or number as to what turnover levels look like currently compared to say this time last year? And then what your expectations or goals are related to that turnover metric looking forward? John Burkart : Yes. I\u2019ll answer that. So, a couple of things there. One is, things are going fantastic. We've fundamentally changed how we looked at or how the operators look at that personnel and effectively created a hiring funnel to move people through that process. The training is dependent upon position, but can take from a few weeks to a couple of months in some jurisdictions, as far as certain requirements that are there. One of the things that I want to bring up, it\u2019s pretty important, it's a subtle piece, but it's pretty important. We appreciate the agencies stepping in when necessary to provide some assistance, but it's obviously both disruptive and not very efficient. So, as we move forward and we reduce agency and create a group of steady long-term employees, that substantially improves the quality of life for our residents, it improves our effectiveness and our efficiency. So, the benefits are not just reduce the expense, the benefits will come through via increased occupancy, increased RevPOR et cetera. As far as for the turnover, the turnover at this point in time is going down. We have numerous initiatives to improve the quality of life for our employees as well. As mentioned in the past, we are focused on that. We're looking through the lens of the employees. They are very hard working people, and making sure that they have what they need really for the whole aspect of their employment. Whether it\u2019d be things as simple as parking to break rooms to time off, et cetera, we've put a lot of effort into that. We continue to put effort into that. So that's a very positive area. Thank you for the question. Operator : We\u2019ll go next now to Vikram Malhotra at Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra : Shankh or Tim, I have a broad two-part question surrounding investments. Just maybe first, one of your peers had some challenges with the debt investment, they had to convert that. There are some headwinds there. If you could maybe give us some color on your loan book, and particularly, the investment you made with HC-One, I think a couple of years ago. Correct me, maybe it was over $700 million. I just want to understand the structuring, perhaps kind of the time you underwrote that, and just maybe even an update on the status? And just related to investments, Shankh you have very unique cost of capital -- relative cost of capital in a world where equity and debt is very, very hard to get, a lot of fear in the market. I'm just wondering, can you broadly give us color on where you are greedy in terms of capital structure or type of property? Thank you. Shankh Mitra : Let me try to address both of those questions, and Nikhil will jump in if I miss anything. Okay? So let's just start with the second question first. We are always greedy when others are fearful, as you know. Where we're finding opportunities, as I mentioned, on my prepared remarks, that we see a substantial -- we have substantial actionable pipeline in seniors housing in all three countries. This is the first time we're seeing opportunities, not just in the U.S., but also in Canada and UK. So, we're very optimistic about senior housing opportunities in all three countries. And we are seeing substantial opportunities, albeit small deals. But as you know, Vikram, we're very focused on individual buying, individual assets, small transactions, outpatient medical in the U.S., right? So, that's sort of -- and we're seeing -- across capital structure, we're seeing opportunities on the debt side, in the skilled side of the business. So, that's sort of where we're seeing opportunities. First question, debt book. If you think about our debt book, you should think about our debt book in three different buckets. But before I get into it, I'll remind you that majority of these loans, right, just call it 80% of the book was originated after COVID. And we try to -- as we have discussed in many of these cases, so let's just talk about three buckets and you will understand. The first bucket is HC-One, you have specific question, I'll get to it. The second bucket is our partnership is related. And as I mentioned in previous call, these developments are structured as a participating means, right? That's the second bucket. Those are majority of the loans. If you take that -- go beyond that, the average size of the loan is like $12 million, right? So, we're focused on -- so let's just talk one at a time. We are very much focused on not just debt, but also last dollar basis of every bid, and possibly as a majority of these cases an equity feature that is attached to that debt. So let's talk about one at a time. We talked about the relative development pipeline, and that's obviously structured as a participating means. By definition that\u2019s equity like structure. Second, HC-One, if you go back and see what we said when we did that, that is a whole loan, that is a senior loan, unlike a lot of the things that you see. It is not a mezzanine loan. There is no senior in front of us. We are the senior. The last pound basis of that loan is $32,000 pounds per debt, which tells you how low levered that loan is. But to your question, if we were to take that over, which is we have no intention of, but if we were to take that over, there is no senior loan that sits in front of us, right? Understand our last dollar basis, what the values are in UK. That sort of gives you a sense of what it is. But more importantly, if you go back and see what I said when we did the loan, we have actually a substantial amount of equity behind that in terms of warrants, right? So -- and then you go to the last one, there are some pure debt, there's a lot of participating prep, participating mezz. So, that's sort of the convention of the loan book. So, we are -- we don't land anywhere where we don't think the last dollar is not significantly beneficial to us. We hope the people who borrow from us will do substantially well. And from the equity participating nature of many of these loans, we\u2019ll participate with them, not just get a return on and off our capital. Hopefully that's what's helpful for you. Tim McHugh : I'll just quickly add on the two related projects that have delivered New York and San Francisco. New York senior housing opened in January of this year, and so four months in occupancy is beyond where we underwrote at the end of the first year. And San Francisco, which has been over -- open for about a year, is also ahead of underwriting\u2026 Shankh Mitra : And rates are substantial above\u2026 Tim McHugh : Exactly. Operator : We'll go next now to John Pawlowski at Green Street. John Pawlowski : Shankh, you made the comment recently that if John and team are successful with their initiatives that the pace of improvement in expense growth will intensify from here. I'm just curious if some of the early operating initiatives you're currently working on were flowing through the cost structure of the business in recent quarters, how much lower would expense per occupied room growth been relative to like the 3.5% reported growth in recent quarters? Shankh Mitra : So, I'm going to take that -- answer that question in two parts. First is asset management initiative and that asset management initiative that John has with his team, that you are seeing the impact on the agency labor and replacing that agency labor with permanent employees. And John mentioned many other sort of initiative that's going on to attract and retain talent, which would continue to reduce that number. The other side of that, your question is operating platform question. Here today, John is entirely focused on top line and we are seeing some signs of, as I mentioned on my prepared remarks, that we've just moved on few places from drawing board to pilots, and we're seeing some significant successes on leads and other situations that obviously we're not prepared to talk about it, that you're going to see on top line, not on the expenses yet. He will get to the expenses, but he's focused on the big ball today on the revenue side. Operator : We'll go next now to Michael Griffin at Citi. Michael Griffin : Maybe turning back to capital allocation, I'd just like to get some color maybe around the MOB acquisitions. It seems like it's pretty opportunistic. I believe, you all were selling MOBs back in summer of 2020, when people were buying. Maybe some color around -- you list the initial yields here. The occupancy at least for the K Street one seemed kind low. Maybe Nikhil, in your underwriting, are you assuming maybe a stabilized high-80s, low-90s occupancy? And then, Shankh, as a capital allocator, if we go back to your third quarter prepared remarks about those -- those five sources of capital. Does any one of those, whether it's debt or equity, selling assets, does any one screen as more attractive right now? Shankh Mitra : Okay. Nikhil will walk you through the MOB acquisitions that we did in the quarter. But let me just answer some of the other questions you asked. So, as you think about it, the five sources of capital, we have accessed three of them this quarter. We have done public equity, we have done private equity. We have sold assets and took capital, and very attractive, obviously return. So you can see it, as an example, on slide 12, the case studies that we put together on some of those assets and how we significantly maximize value there. We still have some participation left in that transaction. And the other thing was debt but that was on the secured side. So as you think about menu of capital, don't just think this is public equity and public debt, right, which is obviously the good -- very good source of capital and has been for us, but also think about private source of capital, whether it's joint venture, asset sales and private source of debt. Senior housing is a housing business and we have substantial portfolio under leveraged portfolio in U.S. and in Canada, which has very significant agency support, right? So, this quarter, in U.S., we have executed one transaction. But as you think about capital, think about menu of options, and depending on -- what that manual auction, how it is priced on a given day, we execute and think -- and only think through that use of capital as it relates to what are the returns of that as we deploy the capital back on an unlevered IRR basis, and from the perspective of the long term return. That's just how we invest capital. Nikhil? Nikhil Chaudhri : Yes. I think to answer your question on the MOB, if you look at the K Street, that's roughly 20% of the capital we deployed to large medical office this quarter. K Street -- and we're buying it at less than half of replacement cost with a 6.6% in-place yield at low-80s occupancy. And we've underwritten this to be beyond an 8% stabilized yield with occupancy with a 9 in front of it. I mean just think about the quality of the real estate, right? I mean, it's 3 blocks from the metro station; it's 2 blocks from the George Washington University Hospital. You've got top grade parking. I mean, it has high quality of an asset that you can get, and we're getting it with very healthy in-place yield with a lot of upside. The other two portfolios, they are core as they get. They've got healthy lease terms, high occupancy, above 95%, and very good affiliation with great health systems. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll go next now to Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : Tim, I would -- you mentioned there's more delevering ahead. Just curious if you could kind of expand on those comments and how we should think about the trajectory of that deleveraging? Tim McHugh : So, we -- as we've talked about in the past, there's kind of two prongs to which we get the balance sheet back to the range, pre-COVID range, target range of 5.5 times to 6 times leverage. And the main one is just seeing NOI recover back to pre-COVID levels. We've been pretty clear in that, that that shouldn't be taken as a stated goal of where NOI and those assets sit, just more so a marker on the ground of where NOI actually was in those assets. And then what the impact, both on earnings and leverage would be just to get it back to that level. And then obviously, we plan to get well beyond that. So think about our current leverage profile. Part of our deleveraging from 7.1% last year has been driven by the kind of beginning stages of that NOI recovery. And then, as we've capitalized our external growth pipeline, we've continued to be pretty disciplined about the way that we've capitalized at the equity. And so, we've driven down current leverage much faster than what -- if it had just been purely through organic cash flow recovery. So now sitting at 6.3 times leverage this quarter, if you were to layer on kind of just a recovery of NOI back to pre-COVID levels, you get down to around 5 times flat. So that's kind of the comment on seeing expectation that if you just take our current capital structure, we knew nothing and you continue to see NOI recover back to pre-COVID levels, you'll see us get to a leverage level that's well below where we would have been or where we were pre-COVID. Operator : We go next now to Steve Sakwa at Evercore ISI. Steve Sakwa : Shankh, I was wondering if you could maybe just talk about the pricing power trends that you're seeing in senior housing and maybe some of the feedback you're getting from the operators vis-\u00e0-vis kind of the residents and how you see that pricing may be trending into the second half of the year. And does that continue in the \u201824. Shankh Mitra : John, do you want to take that? John Burkart : Yes, glad to take that. What we're seeing is tremendous strength in the -- across the board. The feedback from the operators is very positive. What's going on is people are appreciating that the environment that they have, they're appreciating the social environment and the demand is strong. And it's quite affordable. Obviously, it's an asset play for the assisted and memory care living. And so the expectation is as to how this plays out. We have nothing that we're seeing would indicate that it's not going to continue with great strength for the foreseeable future. It's a supply-demand situation at one point. And obviously, demand is substantial and supply is very, very, very limited going forward. Shankh Mitra : I'll just add one point of color perhaps. First thing is, Steve, as I mentioned, as you think about pricing power, the initial phase of pricing power has been that our cost has been going up. And obviously, to bring back these communities to a profitable level or the only which -- only way this will actually continue to serve the community if they're profitable, right, over a long period of time is to increase pricing. And as I mentioned in last call that you will see the next 12, 18 months handover from pricing because cost has gone up to pricing power because we have no room to sell, right? And that handover will come. And so the second point is just understand that we're not focused on absolute level of pricing but we are focused on the difference, the delta between RevPOR and ExpPOR. That's what drives P&L, right? So keep those two in mind, and you will see where our focus has been and continue to -- will be. As we think as just understand our portfolio, it\u2019s roughly speaking, half and half on an average basis and an average year is January versus throughout the year, right? And so we continue to -- as we roll these leases and market rate continues go up, we expect that pricing will continue to remain strong. Operator : We'll go next now to Mike Mueller of JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Current development pipeline, it looks like it's about 15% outpatient medical office and the balance in senior housing. I guess, as you think about anticipated starts over the next few years, do you see that mix shifting dramatically between those buckets? Shankh Mitra : Actually, if you look at into the senior housing bucket, you will see that majority of the new capital outlay has been on the wellness side of the house rather than on the senior housing side of the house. So -- and I expect that will absolutely continue. Medical office majority, obviously all of our medical office -- I shouldn't say majority. All of our medical office developments have been 100% pre-leased yield on cost development. So we're not exposed to the cost risk. Some hits in different quarters, so you saw a bunch of them hit this quarter, which we have been working on for many, many years, but we should not expect anything different going forward. And majority of that what is showing up at senior housing development are actually on the wellness side of the house.  Senior housing development as seniors product is very, very hard to make numbers work today. So we're not that focused on that side of the house unless it is a very special project in a very special location, such as some of the related projects that Nikhil talked about. Operator : We go next now to Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : So if the seniors housing operator wants to access Welltower's platform, what do they have to do? I mean, do they need to sign some type of exclusive agreement, or will you help any operator that manages your specific assets? And just one last thought. Are these -- are there different levels of services that you provide operators? So, if you have an exclusive agreement, they can kind of fully tap your platform and if they just manage an asset, then you kind of are offering them help, but maybe not allowing them fully accessing your data? Shankh Mitra : So, we're not going to get on this call about contractual agreements and what kind of different levels of service and situations that might be going. We'll just focus on the fact that we have aligned interest with our operators. As always said, for years and years that the RIDEA 3 or the structures are all about thinking and swimming together, right? And there is substantial upside to many of these portfolios for us, but also for our operating partners. So this is -- we have different types of arrangements with different people. We're not going to obviously get into on this call. But understand, at the end of the day, the goals are very simple. We're trying to create a very good environment for our residents. We're trying to create an environment for our employees to stay and -- turnover, resident satisfaction, employee satisfaction and frankly, owner satisfaction. That's the goal. And if we can match those goals, it will be great for us and it will be great for our operating partners Operator : We go next now to Austin Wurschmidt at KeyBank. Austin Wurschmidt : Shankh, you highlighted a robust investment pipeline with opportunities across all your regions. I know you're return-driven as you consistently highlight. But given the pricing power you're seeing in IL in Canada or the acceleration in growth you highlighted in the UK, heading into 2024, are returns more attractive in those regions today? And are you considering kind of leaning in, I guess, more international versus domestically in the senior housing side? Shankh Mitra : I wish the answer to your question was yes, but the answer is no. Canada is a very tight market with very significant -- a few handful of owners, handful of banks and very significant CMAC presence. So returns in Canada usually are pretty tight. We're seeing opportunities to create value through our great operating partner that's there. UK, we're actually now starting to see very significant returns. We made one investment in UK this quarter, like last quarter. And we are seeing that. So UK returns are good, actually very good. But I will tell you the vast majority of opportunities are in the U.S. And frankly speaking, there -- because it's such a deep and robust pipeline that you can pick your spots and make some significant returns as -- we're seeing the unlevered IRRs in the senior space today without getting into which country -- what return for which country, but roughly speaking, I'll say, close to double digits. We're seeing opportunities that are in the double digits. Medical office today, IRR opportunities are 8.5% plus, I would say. And obviously, we are very focused on sort of participating debt structures in the SNF side where we can create high-teen returns despite using some debt and some equity like features that I talked about in probably in the high-teens. So that's kind of our focus. We're purely return driven. We're purely basis driven. And all we are trying to do is we're trying to figure out where can we add value, not through just financial capital, but those four things I talked about. It's an optimization problem, right? It's an optimization problem of location, product, price point and operator. That's how you make money in this business. And that's how we're trying to create value. Operator : We go next now to Steven Valiquette at Barclays. Steven Valiquette : So, just to follow up on your earlier comments on the senior housing pricing power for the rest of '23 and into '24, I think you kind of suggested for us to maybe not focus as much on the absolute price increases at this stage, but just more on the spread between RevPOR versus ExpPOR. I guess really the question is, without giving any specific guidance, can you just give us maybe just a general sense or range of what you might be targeting for the spread between RevPOR versus ExpPOR over the next few years? Is 200 to 300 basis points a reasonable assumption, the trend you've seen over the past several quarters, or should we think more conservatively at this stage when thinking beyond '23? Shankh Mitra : So I was trying to add value -- added color to the question that previously was asked. Tim already gave you our view of RevPOR increase as we sit today, right, 6.3% increase that we talked about. So, I was trying to provide more color as we think about long term. Long term, we're focused on the spread between RevPOR and ExpPOR. By no means, I'm trying to say that we're seeing anything in that sort of -- around us that says that pricing power is cooling down. In fact, it's powerful. And I think John probably mentioned that. All I was trying to point out that long term without thinking about is it 6%, is it 12%, is it 3%? The way you're going to get the P&L right, which is ultimately what we are focused on, is the spread between that RevPOR and ExpPOR, right? So, that's what I was trying to answer. We do think that we'll see significant pricing power continue, as I mentioned, half of our portfolio gets renewed at different points in the anniversary cycle and street trade continues to go up. Hope that's helpful. Operator : We'll go next now to Nick Yulico at Deutsche Bank. Nick Yulico : Just turning to the guidance, I want to make sure I'm understanding this right. So in terms of the NAREIT FFO guidance range coming down, there's various normalized items, expenses that are being added back to normalized FFO. A lot of that\u2019s transaction costs, promotes. I know you guys break this out. But just trying to understand what's driving that. It's a pretty regular line item going back for the last year? And how we should think about -- is this still going to be other transaction costs hitting the P&L for the rest of the year, but it's just not in your NAREIT FFO guidance right now? Thanks. Tim McHugh : Yes. Thanks, Nick. So, the transaction costs you're referencing, so other expenses, which is predominantly transaction costs, think about that being, as I described in the footnote, non-capitalizable transaction costs, a lot of that tends to be dead deal cost. So, tough to predict kind of how that comes through. We're a pretty active firm. I'd say that's stepped up a bit this quarter just because of -- as we've talked about and as Shankh has highlighted on a few prior calls. Our underwriting standards have picked up a bit, and we've seen cost increase. So, you think about some developments that we've gotten beyond kind of early stage development spend and we think in a fairly disciplined manner walked away from. So if we kind of look forward, similar to the way we don't try to guide to acquisition cost, we try to have flexible framework is how we think about acquisition volume. Flexible framework is how we think about investing dollars. And the same goes for -- as we pursue things with the intent to move forward, if we end up not moving forward with them, they could not coming to this line item. But it's not something that we kind of have -- we've made decisions on right now or else it would be coming through this quarter. Operator : We'll go next now to Ronald Kamdem at Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Just the presentation has sort of highlighted that the outsized occupancy gain was in AL and in other parts of the business. Just a little bit more color on sort of the IL versus AL difference would be helpful because some of the NIC data suggests IL is accelerating. I think you mentioned that as well, would be helpful. And then the follow-up was, post the PLR ruling, just what are the updated thoughts and vision in terms of having an in-house sort of operating platform? And any color on timing, cost would be helpful. Shankh Mitra : Let me try to take the first one, and John, why don't you take the second one? As I mentioned on my prepared remarks, assisted living continued to significantly outperform independent living. The only thing I was trying to highlight that after underperformance, independent living is starting to pick up, particularly in Canada. And that's what we are seeing starting to come through our Canadian numbers, right? But if you just look at an absolute performance between the two, there is no question that assisted living has been outperforming. And if economy continues to weaken, on a given rolling 12 to 18-month period, my guess is that it will continue to outperform very significantly, given the need-driven nature of the business. John Burkart : Yes. Regarding the self-management of PLR, I want everyone to keep in mind, our focus is and always has been on driving results. That is the number one most important thing to whether we're managing directly, whether we're asset managing and our partners are managing is less the point and it's more about getting the results. So with that said, I think it's probable that we end up in some form of self-management this year. And I would say as far as the costs go, what's happening right now is we're working very quickly on the technology aspect and data analytics aspect of the operating platform. And that really is just swapping out. So, our operators have modules. They're paying for those modules, and now we're switching them to our module. So, that is close to a net zero on the cost side. There are a few other costs as we improve things, which will provide some more clarity going forward. But none of these are really big numbers. So, I wouldn't worry about that in the sense of very big surprises. It's just really changing out and getting improved modules going forward. Hopefully, that's helpful. Operator : We go next now to Michael Griffin at Citi. Michael Griffin : Great. I appreciate the follow-up. Just a quick one. I noticed in your investor presentation, I think it's slide 7, last quarter, it said the comp for growth decelerated at 2.6. I know it\u2019s kind of nitpicky and I didn\u2019t see anything on the slide in the current deck. So, I don\u2019t know maybe McHugh or someone, if you just clarify if there's that number available. That would be helpful. Tim McHugh : Yes, Michael. So, the -- what we've provided is the pool change. I think one thing you're noting is that we've seen kind of export pick up from fourth quarter to the first quarter. And we gave the number on what first quarter would have been based on the fourth quarter pool, as you noted in the footnote. And then just on the pickup in general, the reported same-store number in 4Q, 1Q, it's actually because we continue to expand the same-store pool. So, you've got 95% of our operational properties that we've owned for more than four quarters in our same-store pool now and a lot of the transitions that came in were from the UK. And U.K., we've just seen expense growth run higher than the rest of the portfolio, largely driven by utilities, which we've talked about a lot on this call. So, some of the increase you're seeing just in 1Q is from that mix shift and inclusion of more UK properties. Shankh Mitra : Also, UK is at the sort of the earlier stages of normalizing labor cost. So, it's the addition of UK that it makes it look like the comp has gone up. But if you look at on a same-store basis of -- not a same-store basis, but the same pool of fourth quarter, you will see it was relatively the same. Operator : We go next now to Juan Sanabria at BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : Just a big picture question. Curious if you guys could comment on overall seniors housing penetration. Talking to some of the privates and just reading some of the trade racks, it seems like acuity levels have gone up and maybe seniors are waiting to come in. Just, I guess, are you seeing that? What does that mean for the business? And what are your thoughts about overall penetration rates and the ability to effectuate that through marketing or what have you as part of this new data-driven platform and efforts? Shankh Mitra : So, I'll try to address first part of your question. So, acuity actually went off I would say, in 2020, right? If you didn't absolutely need it, you would avoid the product pre-vaccine. So we obviously have seen acuity gone up in 2020, but since then, we have seen acuity sort of normalize. So, I'm not sure that I subscribe to this idea that acuity across the board for the industry has been going up. In fact, someone just asked earlier in the question pool about Kisco. I was with the Kisco team last week and Kisco\u2019s CEO was talking to me that acuity -- they have seen acuity actually gone down, right? So probably gone down for some, gone up for some, but I do believe that acuity has normalized from that 2020 peak levels as we have seen vaccine come into play. You want to answer the second? John Burkart : Yes, I'll just add a little bit. So obviously, as I said, the supply-demand incredibly favorable. We've said it many times. Then you get to the next piece, which is penetration, which you're talking about. And I actually see penetration increasing. And what we're seeing is the senior desire, the loneliness of the desire for social -- safe active location as well as the cost of care. The cost of care has continually gone up. We all know that. The labor for care has been a challenge, and where you see that the most is in home care. And so we've had people move into our properties because they can't afford or cannot get the level of care. And so, their costs actually net go down, which is a benefit. So I see that playing itself out over the next couple of years, so we get the benefit of supply-demand. Additionally, we get the benefit of penetration. And then finally, the platform will drive greater market share, and we'll get that benefit as well. So I see a very, very favorable future going forward. Operator : We'll take our final question this morning from Vikram Malhotra at Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra : Just two clarifications. Tim, I guess, in your last call you had mentioned in the guide, you were keeping the temp usage as a percent of total intact or flat through the year in your guide. And with what you've seen in 1Q, are you changing that in terms of it being lower? And then second, in the medical office side, I think the OpEx went up maybe 7% or 8%. I'm just wondering, is there anything onetime in that number? Tim McHugh : Yes. So, I'll start with your first question on senior housing and John can add any color on the MOB side. So for senior housing, yes, you're correct. We came in -- our first quarter results were better than expected as far as how agency came down. And of course, some of that benefit gets netted out with full-time employees coming on, but net-net, we ended up in a more favorable spot for compensation. And as I kind of noted in my guidance outlook, that's largely what's moving our outlook for the year is just a better trend coming out of Q1 on expenses with that being the main piece and the assumption revenue kind of holds given that we're moving into the revenue building months as we speak. John Burkart : And then on the MOB, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're expecting guidance is between 2% and 3%. And so that is a timing issue for Q1, and it will reverse as we go through Q2, Q3 and Q4. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that will bring us to the conclusion of the Welltower first quarter 2023 earnings release conference call. We'd like to thank you all so much for joining us this morning and wish you all a great remainder of your day. Goodbye.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead. Matthew McQueen : Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review our second quarter results and describe high-level business trends and our capital allocation activities. John will provide an update on the performance of our Senior Housing Operating and Outpatient Medical Portfolios. Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and revised guidance. Nikhil is also on the call to answer questions. We are delighted to report results, which exceeded our expectations in both our Senior Housing Business as well as Outpatient Medical Segment. Let me first dig into the Senior Housing segment. The key drivers of this business, occupancy, rate and expenses all came in better than expected this quarter, supported by accelerating demand of our product and plummeting new deliveries. From a top line perspective, our Senior Housing Operating portfolio achieved approximately 10% growth on a same-store basis and 17.8% growth on a total portfolio basis driven by another solid quarter of year-over-year occupancy growth and significant pricing power. Last quarter, I discussed with you how the strong pricing trends, along with moderating expenses, resulting in significant margin expansions that we have been all waiting for. I'm pleased to report to you that this trend intensified in the second quarter as we saw revenue per occupied room or RevPOR growth of 7.3%, coupled with just 3.5% expense per occupied room or export growth, resulting in an approximate 25% operating margin, a level not seen since the onset of the pandemic. And while that still leaves significant upside before achieving our pre-COVID NOI margin of above 30%, we expect to meaningfully exceed our pre-COVID level of profitability over time through John's build-out of the operating platform. All regions and product types contributed significantly this quarter, resulting a 24.2% NOI growth for our senior housing operating segment. While Assisted Living continues to outperform independent living driving exceptionally strong results in the U.S. and U.K., Canada is also joining the party with 17.2% NOI growth. We firmly believe that our Canadian portfolio is finally in sustainable growth mode. In fact, we're in process of significantly optimizing our Canadian business, and have recently allocated a meaningful amount of investment dollars to the region. I'll comment on both in a minute. It is also important to mention that our Seniors Apartment business continue to drive double-digit NOI growth despite the broader deceleration in the apartment industry. We have put significant effort in the last 6 years to build our Wellness Housing business which now nearly totals nearly 17,000 units, and we are pleased to see that our thesis is playing out. All in all, we have finally exceeded $1 billion of annualized net operating income in our Senior Housing segment for the first time since COVID and believe we have a ton of growth left in the tank. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I want to reiterate our core belief on how to make risk-adjusted return in Senior Housing. Unlike a lot of empirical years in the business, which either focuses on the location or the operators we believe it is a four-dimensional optimization problem of location, product, price point and operators. And we do this objectively through machine and statistical learning using our data science platform alpha. I'm delighted to inform you that we made perhaps the most significant impact in this pursuit through a mutually beneficial restructuring of our joint venture with Revera. Through a series of by sales, we materially simplified our balance sheet, and we matched specific products and locations with the right regional operators in order to achieve meaningful density in their local markets. In the U.K., we took 100% ownership of 29 premier communities, many of which are located in the Greater London market and consider some of the best care homes in the country. We transitioned this care homes from Signature to Avery and believe we have a material upside in this virtually impossible to replicate portfolio, which was 72.8% occupied at the time of transition to Avery at the beginning of June. Though two months does not make a trend, I am delighted to inform you that these communities are showing positive trends right off the bat under Lorna's leadership with current occupancy around 73.5%. In the U.S. We took 100% ownership of extremely well-located assets recently built by Sunrise in high barriers to entry submarket in the West Coast, East Coast and South Florida at a favorable basis and sold a minority interest in 12 other assets. We also moved management of 28 incredibly well-located California buildings to Oakmont, the California communities were 77% occupied when they are transitioned to Oakmont at the end of June. I fully expect this portfolio to be materially additive to our growth in 2024 under Courtney's leadership. As you can see in the case study on the Page 32 of our business update, highlighting previous Oakmont transitions in California. Courtney's team has taken occupancy from 64% to 90% in 2 years at these committees. Though this occupancy has far surpassed their previous high occupancy of 86% in 2016, I fully expect these communities will hit mid-90s occupancy in near future. All things being equal, that stabilization path should be faster for the most recent portfolio of 28 communities that they have assumed the management of. If not for the lessons learned previously, it will be for a higher starting point. And just after four weeks of operations under Oakmont, these properties are on a path to achieve approximately 100 basis points of occupancy growth in first month and are showing positive NOI traction in NOI out of the gate. And finally, Canada, perhaps the most exciting part of this yearlong effort to optimize our portfolio. Through though there is a multidimensional value creation opportunity in this effort I'm delighted to inform you that we are launching a new platform with our partner, Matthew Deguet in English-speaking Canada. As you know, Cogier, under Matthew's leadership is one of the best operators in the business, and we cannot be more excited about launching our first operating platform in a post PLR world. We will double down -- we'll double down on our investments in these communities, dramatically enhanced resident experience and materially improve employee experience, resulting in exciting long-term carrier growth opportunity. I predict this operating JV will witness rapid growth in very near future. The series of steps, which is known as Project Transformer inside Welltower is one of the most complex yet value-accretive transactions we have ever done. Under Eric Chung's leadership in Canada and U.K. and Ras Simon's leadership in the U.S., this multidimensional project will truly transform our company in the next chapter of its evolution. This transaction marks the conclusion of our 7-year journey of contract modernization as virtually all of our contracts are now in RIDEA 30 and RIDEA 40 structure. I cannot emphasize enough how important this milestone is for our farm as we have now full alignment with all of our key senior housing operating partners. We think or swim together. To continue this team of capital allocation, the favorable transaction environment that I described to you last quarter has resulted in an incredibly active summer for us. We currently have approximately $2.3 billion of deals under contract in 26 different off-market, privately negotiated transactions. Opportunities within Senior Housing segment represents the bulk of these transactions with approximately $2 billion of deals comprised of 8,900 units across all three regions. We estimate our investment in these deals to be very attractive, 30% to 40% discount of today's replacement cost, with accretive in-place cash flow and significant growth potential. While I don't like to get into individual transactions, I would like to highlight a transaction in Canada with our partner, Cogier. We're recapping Cogier's existing institutional investor at Propco in highly desirable SaaS portfolio, and Matthew is investing is equity going forward. This CAD 935 million transaction of both recently built and attractive stable assets are a testament to the power of our relationship in this industry. Eddie and his team has been working tirelessly over the past two years on this transaction, and we're delighted to inform you that we signed a definite documents three weeks ago. Additionally, following the completion of this deal and others under recently in a contract, we have achieved another company milestone having closed or signed over $11 billion of transactions since our pivot to offense in fourth quarter of 2020. But we are busier than ever with a robust feasible and actionable pipeline of opportunities that we're underwriting right now. Again, heavily senior housing, but we are also seeing some outpatient medical and skilled nursing opportunities up and down the capital stack. All of which we expect -- all of which we expect to keep us very busy for the rest of the year. Our deal teams didn't get much of summer vacation and looks like they won't get much of a Christmas holiday either as many of these deals will close in Q4. As I described last quarter, both debt and equity capital continue to rapidly evaporate from the commercial real estate space, we're getting hits left, right and center from counterparties who truly appreciate our handshake approach to the business where we can bring both cash and operator to the closing table. We're seeing that the banks are no longer willing to kick the can down the road and in fact, are showing willingness to sell their loan books partially or completely. A handful of these transactions have taken place and many more are brewing. The increased capital requirement directive from the regulators last week will only intensify this trend, and we are ready to help banks release their capital as they execute their other strategic priorities. Nikhil and Tim's cell phone number has been on full display in our full page ad of the American Banker Magazine since the summer of 2020. Please give them a call. I promise you they will respond within hours, not days as it is customarily acceptable standard in Senior Housing Industry. I predict Welltower will play a meaningful role in helping to recapitalize distressed commercial rest loan portfolios that fall within our circle of competence. And lastly, at the risk of stealing Tim's thunder, I would like to point out that our meaningful strengthening of our balance sheet over the last few quarters. Just in the last 1 year, our leverage has fallen from high 60s to mid-5s through a combination of outsized organic growth and prudent capital allocation activity. Were now armed with approximately $7.6 billion of near-term liquidity to address upcoming debt maturities and fund our various capital deployment opportunities. In summary, we have never been more delighted with our operating performance and have never been busier on the deal side and build-out of our platform. While no one knows what future may hold, my partners and I remain as optimistic as they were on the future of our business. And with that, I'll hand the call over to John. John Burkart : Thank you, Shankh. Another great quarter like last quarter, just better. Our total portfolio generated a 12.7% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, led by the Senior Housing Operating portfolio with 24.2% year-over-year growth. These great results speak for themselves, so I will provide limited color on the quarterly results and focus more on the future, including the billions of dollars in value that are being unlocked as a result of the management transition we announced last night. First, on results. The medical office portfolio's second quarter same-store NOI growth was 3.2% over the prior year's quarter. Same-store occupancy was 95.1% while retention remains extremely strong across the portfolio at 92.5%, highlighting the stability of the relationships as well as the quality of the portfolio. The 24.2% second quarter NOI increase in our same-store Senior Housing Operating portfolio was a function of 9.9% revenue growth driven by the combination of 7.3% RevPOR growth and 190 basis points of occupancy. As a note, this number excludes the U.K. communities, we recently transitioned to Avery that were originally included in the guidance. These communities grew occupancy at 9% year-over-year. So including the communities, our total portfolio same-store occupancy growth would have been 20 basis points higher at 210 basis points. Though exclusion of these communities has a negative impact on our annual occupancy growth debt, we maintained our guidance given the market strength we are seeing. Additionally, expenses remain in control, coming in at 5.8% for the quarter over the comparable prior year's quarter. More specifically, the pressure we experienced from a tight labor market over the past two years and broad-based use of agency has continued to abate. In fact, agency expense as a percentage of total compensation for the quarter declined substantially from nearly 8% in the first quarter of last year. This outstanding revenue growth and expense growth led to substantial margin expansion of 290 basis points. All three regions continue to show strong same-store revenue growth, starting with Canada at 8.1% and in the U.S. and U.K. growing at 9.9% and 13%, respectively. The strong revenue growth in each region, combined with the expense controls have led to fantastic NOI growth in Canada, the U.S. and U.K. of 17.2%, 24.8% and 38.2%, respectively. On to the management transition. We're very excited about the value being unlocked as a result of these transitions. Having the right manager for an asset is critical. The fact that Shankh has repeatedly stated, these transitions accomplish that objective while improving each operator's concentration of Welltower assets in various markets, a key factor to operational excellence. Concentration brings increased effectiveness and increased efficiency through improving the value proposition for customers in numerous ways, including greater choices and frictionless transfers, improving the value proposition for employees, including improved training and career paths and improving the efficiency of vendors operating at multiple sites, translating into increased NOI growth. The benefits of increased concentration, which show up in margins have been proven many times over with the multifamily REITs. Welltower is now beginning to harvest those benefits. We continue to make substantial progress on our platform and the related rollout. To provide you with one example, one of our operators with over 50 properties is fully and rapidly transitioning to our platform over the coming three to 12 months. We've been working with them over the past year via our aggressive asset management program, enabling them to increase occupancy over 600 basis points in the last year. As I've mentioned in the past, the platform isn't only about technology. It's about people, processes, data and technology. After seeing the amazing improvement in occupancy in the 12 months related to our focus on processes, they are fully embracing our entire platform. I'm grateful that they see the opportunity and benefit of pursuing operational excellence, and I appreciate their partnership. Additionally, as Shankh mentioned, we are partnering with Cogier, the premier Canadian operator for the management of many of our Canadian transition assets. The best outcomes are achieved by working with the best people and the best operators. I'm very excited about the opportunity to partner with Matthew and Frederic and their team at Cogier on this new venture and the incredible value we will create for our investors. More to come in the coming year. I'll now turn the call over to Tim. Tim McHugh : Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our second quarter 2023 results. performance of our triple net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, a balance sheet liquidity update, and finally, our updated full year 2023 outlook. Welltower reported second quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.20 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.90 per diluted share, representing 4% year-over-year growth or 16% growth after adjusting for HHS and the year-over-year impact from a stronger dollar and higher base rates on floating rate debt. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 12.7% year-over-year. Now turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter, in our Senior Housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 3.1% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.88x in the quarter. Next, Same-store NOI and long-term postcute portfolio grew 6.1% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.48x. Turning capital activity in the quarter. In May, we issued a $1.035 billion convertible note due in 2028. The note bears interest at 2.75% rate and is convertible at $95.41 per share. We intend to use the proceeds from the note to address our 2024 unsecured maturities coming due in the first quarter of next year. In addition to our convert offering, we continue to issue through our ATM to fund ongoing investment spend, raising gross proceeds of $1.76 billion since the beginning of the second quarter. This capital activity, along with continued growth across our business segments, including the solid post-COVID recovery within our Senior Housing Operating business helped drive net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 5.62x at quarter end, which represents well over a turn of deleveraging versus 1 year ago. As Shankh mentioned, we are seeing ample opportunity to invest our large cash balance. But even so, we expect net debt to adjusted EBITDA to remain below 6x on a pro forma basis post deployment and to continue to move lower as the senior housing operating portfolio continues to drive organic cash flow higher. Additionally, filing this intra and post-quarter capital activity, we have a current cash and cash equivalent balance $2.7 billion. Along with full capacity on our $4 billion revolving line of credit and $910 million of remaining expected proceeds from near-term dispositions and loan paydowns, representing approximately $7.6 billion in near-term gross available liquidity and $6.3 billion of liquidity when netting for the $1.35 billion of unsecured maturities we have in 2024. Lastly, moving to our full year guidance. Last night, we updated our previously issued full year 2023 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to a range of $0.73 to $0.84 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $3.48 to $3.59 per diluted share or $3.535 at the midpoint. Our updated normalized FFO guidance represents a $0.04 increase at the midpoint from our previously issued guidance. This increase in guidance is reflective of a $0.02 increase in expected full year senior housing operating NOI, a $0.02 increase from capital allocation activity, which assumes no further investments in the year beyond what has been announced to date and $0.01 from HHS and other out-of-period government grants received in 2Q. And these increases are offset by a $0.01 increase in expected full year G&A and interest expense. Underlying this FFO guidance is an increased estimate of total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 10% to 13%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%, long-term post-acute, 3% to 4%; senior housing triple net, 1% to 3%; and finally, increased Senior Housing Operating growth of 20% to 25% year-over-year. The midpoint of which is driven by continued better-than-expected expense trends, along with revenue growth of approximately 9.7%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 230 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth of approximately 6.7%. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim. We're currently living in an uncertain macroeconomic environment where the outlook is getting marked here by the day. One day it is sunny and the next day, all people see our dark clouds. The Federal Reserve appears to be resolute in its fight against inflation and seems far less inclined to come to rescue private and public markets as most participants like to hope for. Against this backdrop, we continue to take a very balanced approach as we consider both growth opportunities and risk environment. On one hand, we remain prudent and continue our deleveraging through rapid organic growth and appropriate capitalization of our external growth opportunities. On the other hand, we're aggressively putting capital to work, though where ever more price and return conscious. We cannot predict the macro, but we can predict with a high degree of confidence what is likely to come on a micro basis. And that is while we are seeing growth rolling over in most asset classes, including most other real estate property types, both the demand and supply outlook are getting better for us as we look into '24 and '25. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter call, I believe we're at the beginning of multiyear double-digit NOI growth cycle for our business, resulting from a long runway of occupancy gains rate growth and operating margin expansion. At Project Transformers, along with the relentless optimization of our operating platform, the impact which will start to show up in next year and the constraint reloading of our external growth and or perhaps the growth Bazooka at this point, through a highly targeted deals, you get an ideal setup for accelerating earnings and cash flow growth as we look into next year. With that, we'll open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Your line is open. Jonathan Hughes : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time. I wanted to ask about the recent transitions. What's changed between how you're able to implement transitions today that minimize the economic impact versus prior ones in previous years that typically came with some lost income. Are these operators taking over just that much more sophisticated. Do they have more support from you? Is some of it driven by the very different supply-demand backdrop I'm just trying to better understand how to interpret the term transition because previously that came with some near-term negative impact, but now that seems to be a positive. John Burkart : It's a really good question. A lot of it really is what I would call relates to leadership, and that's because a lot of a transition relates to execution. So having the outstanding partners that we have, working together as a team to anticipate opportunities and issues, connecting with people. All these issues, all these items are about people, so connecting with the people, the sites and finding it all out flawlessly and executing flawless is what's changing that game. There's a lot of details involved each of these -- in each of these situations, there's literally transition teams that are 24/7 focus 100% on all the details and then there's operating teams that are focused on the operations. So a lot of work, but ultimately, it's leadership that changes that game. Shankh Mitra : Jonathan, we are not going to give away how we do these things today versus what we happened before. But I have mentioned in previous calls, that we have learned finally under John's leadership, how to do these transitions, right? But that's our proprietary obviously, you're seeing [indiscernible] that's showing up in the results, but we're not going to give away our secrets obviously on this call. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Connor Siversky with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Connor Siversky : Good morning out there. I appreciate the color on the prepared remarks and congratulations on crossing that $1 billion threshold. It's quite an achievement. Just want to switch gears to Integra. Wondering if you could provide an update on the portfolio transition process. specifically looking for color on how cash flow metrics within the portfolio are trending and perhaps as a bonus, some perspective on access and retention of labor within those skilled nursing assets? Nikhil Chaudhri : Connor, it's Nikhil. I'll take this one. So look, we're pretty pleased with the performance that we've seen so far. If you remember, there were a total of about 147 buildings that were being transitioned over of those 133 have already been transitioned to the new operators. And the results we're seeing are very encouraging. So if you look at those 133 buildings for the three months prior to the transition, those buildings on an EBITDA basis were losing roughly $90 million a year. three months later, first quarter of this year, and those same buildings that are making positive $70 million. Still a lot more work to be done, but the rapid turnaround has been really encouraging to see. And on the second part of your question, on labor, all the numbers, all the metrics seem to be following the broader trends we're seeing in our broader business that the labor situation is getting better by the day. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Your line is open. Steven Valiquette : Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the results as well. Yes. No, it's hard to answer for the whole industry. Your results are obviously incredibly strong in Senior Housing, but there are some pockets from some other players where maybe the occupancy was slowing down a little bit in the quarter. Just curious if you have any high-level thoughts on maybe why your results were separate from maybe some other players that did see occupancy decelerating a little bit? Is there any signs of price sensitivity in any pockets of the market? Just curious of your thoughts around that. Shankh Mitra : Yes. Steven, we're not going to get into what other players might or might not be seeing. We can only tell you what we are seeing, we're seeing a very strong start of the spring selling -- summer selling season. If you think about how this business works, Obviously, the activities pick up very significantly, sales start to happen in sort of second quarter. That translated into third quarter, early fourth quarter occupancy gains. That's seasonally how the business works. And we have seen some significant traction this summer as we're moving into third quarter. We're seeing pricing trends getting better, occupancy trends getting better. So I really have no idea what you're referring to. But I can tell you that we're very pleased with second quarter occupancy, right? John just mentioned, our reported same-store numbers are impacted by the removal of the U.K. assets. But we're very, very pleased with what we have seen. We don't know what future holds. I'm not going to try to sit here and guess what the future will look like. But the promise we made to you and our owners is very simple. We will get more than what the market gives us, right? That's our execution. And we're very pleased with what we have seen so far. If you look at the demand supply, trends are getting better every day. It's not the other way around. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Michael Griffin, your line is open. [technical error] Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Austin Wurschmidt : I just want to understand. So with will no longer having an investment in the Sunrise management company and sort of dissolving the joint venture relationship with Revera are the remaining Sunrise-operated assets still revenue-based management contracts? And if so, I guess, how does that change the owner-operator relationship moving forward? And is there more restructuring to do over time with that portfolio specifically? Shankh Mitra : The answer is the Sunrise contracts are not what you described. We restructured a contract with Sunrise in 2011 -- 2021, sorry 2021 and Sunrise is fully aligned with us with the principal philosophy that we're seeing ensuing together. So many years ago, I have described that our fundamental philosophy under my team's leadership has changed from owning part of management company's equity to contract. That's what we have described. And as you can see in one of the slides we have described a 7-year long effort to transform all our contracts from sort of top line focused contracts to bottom line focus contract where we think and swim together and virtually all of our contracts are there today. So that sort of hopefully gives you an answer to your question. We do not believe and we haven't done in sort of having influence on our communities through owning part of management contract part of management companies. We do it through our contracts, and that's where you can see in the evolution of those contracts. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Carroll : Yep. Thanks. I wanted to touch on the Welltower Cogier, I guess, operating relationship. I mean how is that relationship going to work? And how should we think about the growth of that platform? I mean when you're growing into new markets, are you going to be doing that with Cogier or another operator? Or would you be doing that yourself? John Burkart : The -- as far as for how it works, I'll talk about that and I'll let Shankh talk about the expansion. But as far as how it works, it's working fantastic right now. I'm partnering up with Frederic and we're working together really on the vision, the strategy and oversight. Cogier is handling all the execution on the daily decisions and all that type of stuff. And what you have is a very synergistic team, we're both extremely excited about re-envisioning the opportunity to reposition these assets. And so we're excited about what we're creating there. But I won't be involved in the daily aspects of it. I -- there a fantastic operator. There's no value there. I'm focused to get on the bigger picture items. Shankh Mitra : From an expansion standpoint, my comment that I made that this joint venture will have rapid growth. That comment obviously means that you will see that we're expanding where we're very excited about Canada and doing lots of expansions in Canada that will come. We're focused -- you think about it in a very simplistic terms, this platform that we're launching, we'll be focused on English-speaking Canada. Cogier has a tremendous brand in the French Canada and we'll watch this together from that. Now what we do in U.S. is a different conversation. Just understand that our PLR is on independent living and majority of our exposure in independent living is in Canada. That's why we're starting this. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Your line is open. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for the question. Maybe Shankh or Tim, you talked a lot about stress in Senior Housing referencing obviously, Fannie Mae delinquencies. I'm wondering if you can just -- and then you outlined the $30 billion decade opportunity. I'm wondering if you can give us more color on kind of how you think about the funnel in terms of all these distressed opportunities coming whether it's operational or balance sheet distress. But how do you think about the funnel and filtering it down to what is actually actionable for Welltower, whether it is analytics-driven or strategic driven. And then just combining that actionable pipeline, you mentioned with sort of the long-term earnings power. You talked about double-digit NOI growth, but are there any [indiscernible] leaves you can share on kind of the earnings, the underlying AFFO is likely to grow over a longer time period? Shankh Mitra : Let me see if I can answer your 5-part question. Likely, I will forget some pieces. So be -- frankly speaking, if we just take a step back and understand what's happening the stress that we see are not cash flow driven, the stress that we see are balance sheet driven. And the balance sheet driven comes in many forms. There's a significant lack of equity and debt capital today. In fact, when we say the debt market is functioning not functioning, most people assume that sort of the mid market remains, and it's not growing, it remains fairly flat. That's not what's happening today. The debt market -- Banks are under significant pressure from regulators to show up capital, which means they are actually selling they're shrinking, right? Then you add on top of that, a lot of the construction that happened between '15 and '19 time frame, they're on SOFR based loans, they're on LIBOR-based loans. And given how much that base rates have gone up, right, 500-plus basis points just in the last 12 months, is putting tremendous pressure. You think about it where a LIBOR plus 350, 400 it today, you are at 8%, 9% rate. And you just cannot -- these capital structures were not envisioned for that kind of rate environment. So you've got massive pressure on that. Then you see even people who put float caps, a lot of these floater caps are coming off second half of this year and next year. So and you add insert injury, majority of Senior Housing loans actually come with personal guarantees. So I can go on and on and on, but that's not the point. What you're asking is, is very simply, these assets are not stressed, the balance sheet behind assets are stressed. And we are ready and willing. And to do these executions, you just -- you need two things. You need cash because that we're not showing up with subject to financing, we're showing up with cash. And the other very important thing is operating partners. You need both to solve people's problems, their balance sheet problems and the go-forward problems, and that's why we're doing it. Now we're not going to get into on this call a multiyear sort of a earnings growth projection. As Tim has alluded to, DCR's earnings growth is significantly impacted by, obviously, our floating rate debt as well as strong dollar. You know what those numbers are. We have pointed out unless you believe rates are going from 5.5% to 11% again, you should not have those kind of impacts going forward, right? So from the NOI growth, with that, you can figure it out what that looks like. But from my comment, you can figure out that we're very excited about an accelerating earnings and cash flow growth trajectory as we look into '24. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. Good morning. In terms of the $2.3 billion of investments post second quarter. I know you talked about the discount to replacement costs and some of the IRR expectations. But can you just give us a feel for what these look like on a first year cap rate basis and then stabilized yield potential going on a couple of years. And any comments on occupancy or other drivers that are creating some of the NOI upside for the assets? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So I'll start with the last. Obviously, these assets have both occupancy and significant margin growth potential. With the occupancy, obviously, as you understand sort of the flow-through mechanics of this business. Majority of the profitability in the business is after, call it, 80% occupancy because there's very significant fixed costs. So incremental margin, if you will, after 80% occupancy is, call it, 70-plus margin. And then as you get closer to 90% or 90% -- about 90% occupancy we're at kind of 90 -- your incremental margins approach 90%, right? So majority of the profitable hockey stick profitability in that kind of 10% plus occupancy range. So that's what's the driver of the growth that we think baked into this. So we like buying low basis, lower occupancy portfolio. That's sort of what we do. We do not like to pay a cash flow on a highly occupied high NOI, which drives into obviously results into high-basis assets. We just don't do that here. That sort of gives you the answer to the second question, right? Let's just talk about the first question, which is a very simple question. You should assume a year 1 in this batch of acquisitions, roughly around 6%, going into 7 plus, following the math I just described to you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore. Your line is open. Jim Kammert : Thinking at the business update on the Revera transition Pages 9 and 10, could you just provide what is a reasonable time line for that NOI capture and what capital you might have to spend to capture that NOI delta? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So we have never gotten into the time line of our bridge. This is part of our bridge, obviously. We'll leave you to determine when we think stable occupancy will come. And so that's part of your sort of answer to the first part of your question. The second part, I just want to point out one thing is what we are suggesting here is that $120 million we mentioned is part of the $414 million or so of the bridge. So that's what it is. If we thought that's all we're going to get, we would not have done it. In other words, the bridge, the fundamental tenet of the bridge is we go back to fourth quarter of '19 occupancy. If you look at Page 32, which sort of shows one of these transitions we have done, not only the first 6 that we gave it to Oakmont, exactly two years ago, today is actually exactly two years. These occupancies are above 90% where the prior peak was 86% and change in 2016. That gives you and I expect -- fully expect to believe they will be in mid-90s in the next few months. That gives you a sense of where we think the occupancy will go and what the margin will follow. For example, let me give you another example, the Canadian example. The Revera properties that we mentioned, I believe one of the pages said is like low sites occupancy. That portfolio is sitting at 23% margin, give or take today. I mentioned to you that Cogier runs in their Canadian portfolio of 40-plus person margin, that sort of gives you a sense of where we think that these properties can go. 120 is part of the bridge that shows you 414. But if we thought 120 is all we're going to get, we would not have done it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Juan Sanabria : Shankh or John, maybe if you could just talk about what you're thinking or seeing or you're discussing with your operators with regard to the rent bumps either this fall or next year? I'm not sure if it's too early, but just curious on your thoughts on how that could change relative to last year's pretty sizable increases in a different inflationary environment? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So one, we're not going to sit here and try to predict what will happen 6 months from now, but I expect a very strong rate environment in 2024 as well. What will that be exactly depends on a lot of things, but I have no reason to believe in a better environment of demand and supply, we're not going to have a strong pricing power. But we'll see when we get there. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. Your line is open. John Pawlowski : A question on funding going forward. I know funding secured for the deals you've announced that are under contract. I'm just curious how -- what you think the optimal funding mix, the next $1 billion of external growth is? Tim McHugh : Yes, John, I think consistent with how we've been in the past, funding is going to be from the most attractive source you have, right? And whether that's public equity, debt or disposition proceeds, we'll continue to openly fund as we move along. So we would just hesitate to try to provide you forward guidance on that. It will be under made at whatever topmost time that we're funding. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ronald Camden with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ronald Kamdem : Just can we dig into the expenses a little bit, what just seems is trending better than expected. Historically, it's been on the labor, that's a surprise. But going forward, maybe can you talk about what are the biggest drivers that you're going to be looking at? And what areas do you have conviction in and where could you be surprised up or down? Shankh Mitra : We have a lot of conviction on both continue to optimizing the labor side and other expenses. I would rather not get into what drivers you might get in the next 6 months versus 12 months, but I will point out that the utility side, the energy side, last fall was very, very significant hit.  So at least as we lap going into '24, we should get from a year-over-year perspective and frankly, energy prices have come down, we should see some benefit. But we're not going to sit here and just try to predict what might or not might play out on, but I will say that you have heard from our prepared remarks that we're feeling very good about continued margin expansion, not just sort of going back to pre-COVID, but we do think that John will take these margins much higher over a period of time. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : For the loan portfolio, loan assets that you're looking at, should we be thinking of those as being straight debt deal at discounts or just more specifically targeted toward portfolios where you can ultimately get to the real estate? Shankh Mitra : So first thing is, I'm going to elaborate again. I think I've done it before. I'm just going to tell you, we don't lend against assets that we don't want to own at the last dollar basis that we -- our loan sits at. So that's sort of the fundamental premise that we have. Having said that, different transactions come in different forms, were here to help people provide -- were here to help owners and borrowers with liquidity that they might need or institutions which owns already owns those loans. How different transaction will play out, whether it's an existing loan or we're coming in to provide capital, I don't know that yet. We are -- our focus investors and simple debt yield will determine where we get to, but just a coupon is less interesting for us. We'll start, obviously, probably we're thinking about how we can get equity returns. If we're just going in and 100 on the dollar when we are actually loaning into a situation that doesn't have debt. Or if it is existing debt, we're going to have to think about what type of discount gives us the right return, assuming we get our money back. And if we don't, we're comfortable owning the asset at that last dollar basis, philosophically, that's what we think about it. Every transaction is different. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : John, last quarter, you mentioned you had rolled out a pilot program for drawing in leads to a couple of senior housing properties. And I think if I recall correctly, I guess the biggest challenge was just the sheer volume of leads. What's the latest on that pilot program? And maybe just how is that impacting pricing power? John Burkart : Yes. So the comments, if I remember correctly myself, was the COO called us and it was funny to me said, gee, you've done so much to increase leads. We're struggling in getting our hands around that in that pilot, and they definitely did get their hands around it. It's a staffing opportunity there. We're continuing to roll out -- move from pilot to rollout, and so we're pressing forward. And as I mentioned, we have another operator that's jumping on 100% on board and we'll be pushing forward their platform up with our venture up in Canada as well. We're seeing terrific results through the marketing efforts that we're applying. And what that does to pricing power, in essence, our focus is on maximizing NOI, right? So we're looking at combination between price, between occupancy, recognizing that occupancy comes with a price. So yes, we will push a little bit more on price and find the right point there, but it's what's providing our outstanding results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Michael Griffin : I know you've talked in the past about redevelopment industries you've undertaken at some properties. I'm just curious if you can give us an update on these redevelopments kind of what the expectation for growth in this platform is going forward? And any commentary there would be helpful. John Burkart : Yes. That's really a great question. And I think it's something that is -- we haven't talked about it that much. And the reality that I think it's completely underappreciated as far as the future earnings potential of this portfolio. You look at our portfolio is roughly 20 years old in the Senior Housing business, and that is the sweet spot for renovation. It's one I typically call fluff and buff because what you have is your infrastructure plumbing and roofing this kind of stuff is in typically good order. But what isn't in good order is the first impressions, amenities, units and that type of thing. So I have been aggressively building out a renovation team in-house team at Welltower experts, and we are launching -- what you'll see is we'll start launching on pretty massive renovation programs, West Coast, East Coast, Canada, U.K., all these things are lining up, and we're at the beginning stages but the impact should be very positive on NOI for certain, obviously, increasing occupancy first and occupancy and rate. The value proposition opportunity is significant. I've walked numerous properties in all the regions. And it's clearly a very big opportunity and having the expertise that we're bringing to the table will truly change the game in renovation of senior housing. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Pawlowski with Green Street. John Pawlowski : John, just curious within your U.S. portfolio, can you give me a sense for how the shortfall in independent living occupancy versus 2019 compares to the gap in your assisted living portfolio? Shankh Mitra : We'll have to get back to you on that. But generally speaking, you have assisted living fail further. So obviously, it has longer to come back. Independent living didn't fall that far, but it has been coming back slowly sort of slowly. But specifically, our portfolio has changed materially since '19 as far as Independent Living and Assisted Living is concerned. So we will have to those numbers and get back to you. But clearly speaking, I will tell you, the Assisted Living continue to outperform, we are seeing Independent Living is starting to come back. And frankly speaking, Independent Living for us, like 75%, 80% is Canada, and it's just sort of more of a -- I don't know it's a product comment or it's sort of it's a country comment, right? We're seeing very strong performance finally coming out of Canada, and we expect that will get better as all this sort of optimization that we're talking about around the [indiscernible] will play out but I cannot tell you, John, is it that if a product thing or just a country thing because majority of Independent portfolio sits in Canada. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to welcome Matt McQueen, General Counsel to begin the call. Matt, over to you. Matthew McQueen : Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review our third quarter results and capital allocation activities. John will provide an update on performance of our Senior Housing Operating and Outpatient Medical Portfolios. And Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and revised guidance. Nikhil is also participate in the Q&A session of the call. Against a backdrop of increasingly uncertain macroeconomic outlook, I\u2019m pleased to report another strong operating results with which continue to exceed our expectations. Our Senior Housing portfolio posted another quarter of exceptional revenue growth, which continues to approximate double-digit levels, driven by both strong pricing power and occupancy build. We are delighted to report that occupancy growth not only accelerated through Q3, but also that September occupancy gains marked the highest level we've seen over the last 2 years. From a pricing standpoint, we continue to achieve outsized rate increases as reflected by nearly 7% growth in RevPAR or unit revenue. As you may recall, we previously mentioned that last year, one of our largest operator pull forward its typical January increase to September 2022. This year, the same operator elected to maintain its historical cadence of rate increases and will therefore wait until January of 2024 to push through rate increases. As a result, reported pricing of Q3 this year may appear lower than what we are experiencing in the business and it bears repeating that our operators' pricing power remains strong. The story on the expense side is similar to that of our top line and result continues to outperform our elevated expectations. We reported 2.4% expense per occupied room growth or unit expense growth, the lowest reported export growth in the company's recorded history. This is largely driven by a 2.7% increase in compensation per occupied room, which represents a substantial step down in recent quarters. This combination of strong revenue and controlled expense growth has generated 333 basis points of same-store margin expansion, yet another record for the company as it marks the highest level of quarterly margin improvement in our recorded history. And our shop NOI margin of 25.6% is the highest level of profitability we achieved since pre-COVID. NOI growth for the quarter came in 26.1%, our fourth consecutive quarter of 20% plus NOI growth and the second highest level of growth in the company's recorded history. While we are pleased that margins are moving in the right direction, we are also mindful that our profitability remains significantly below pre-COVID levels and below where we believe the industry can attract external capital investment on a long-term basis. Our managers strive to deliver a superior product, experience and provide valuable choices for our retired seniors. Our product remains highly affordable at the high-end while we operate in the U.S. and the U.K. and they should continue to focus on highly differentiated services, even if that means rate increases need to remain at the elevated levels. As I've said many times, cutting corners is not in our DNA. We recommend that our operating partners serve fewer residents well than serve more of them poorly. As a result, one of our key items to focus is to work with the right operator to improve the customer and the employee experience. We believe that doing so will improve the experience of all [technical difficulty] all of our stakeholders. Conversely, we will be very disappointed if our operators take the path of lease resistance, which ultimately will impact resident and employee satisfaction. We continue to focus on the delta of RevPOR minus ExpPOR as the single most important operating metric to optimize. While it is too early to comment on anything specific relative to 2024, as I sit here today, I can believe -- I believe that the delta of RevPOR minus ExpPOR can expand, which we need to get to a sustainable level of margin. From a product standpoint, AL continues to outperform IL and from a geographic standpoint, Canada finally caught up to the level of growth that U.S and U.K were experiencing. We have further retailing to do in our Canadian business with a new operating platform being launched in next few weeks. And going forward, we believe both of our international businesses will have been significant contributors to our earnings growth in '24 and '25. From a capital allocation standpoint, we have never been busier. Last quarter we spoke about a pipeline of $2.3 billion. We closed $1.4 billion in Q3, and roughly another $900 million in October. Additionally, we have another $1 billion of deals just about to cross the finish line. Beyond these billion dollars of investments under contract, our pipeline remains large and near-term actionable. But the execution of these deals will depend on our access to capital. The extremely challenged debt and equity market in this higher for longer rate environment suggests that this trend will continue and perhaps will get better in '24. We'll continue to see credit evaporate from our investment universe and are selectively pursuing great opportunities in both whole stack and med stack levels with highly favorable last dollar exposure. These opportunities have potential to achieve equity returns with basis and credit downside protection typically seen in low leverage transactions. We're seeing opportunities across product types and geographies with equity investments in U.S senior housing, and credit investment on the SNF [ph] side, making up the large stewards [ph] of opportunities that we're constantly being pinned on. I want to remind you that we have a three dimensional lens through which we measured investment opportunities : risk, reward and duration. Given the substantial rise of real rates over the last 90 days, we have recalibrated the thresholds of these three thresholds higher. In other words, for the same risk we need higher returns today than we did 90 days ago or we can do deals with a similar return profile, but with a much lower risk and so forth. Where student of history and markets and cannot find many times when a lot of good has come out of a period of highly -- sharply higher real rates. If real rates continue to grow -- grind higher, we'll continue to calibrate our three guideposts higher. So far, we have no problem achieving these three calibrations as sellers understand the markets have changed, and will remain the best at many times, the only hope for liquidity. From a balance sheet perspective, amidst growing macroeconomic, fiscal and geopolitical uncertainty, we're pleased to have reduced our net debt to adjusted EBITDA to one of the lowest levels in our recorded history, which also represent nearly 2x decline from just 12 months ago. Our balance sheet strength and flexibility gives us opportunity to remain on offence, or provides shelter if the economic environment meaningfully what sits next week. We don't have a clue which direction the wind will blow. But I'm delighted that we don't need fair weather to meet our obligations or growth. As you all know, a wall of debt maturity and commercial real estate sector is coming exactly at a time when debt capital is evaporating from the market. We will not be surprised if significant dilutive capital is raised, or otherwise a lot of keys will need to be returned to the lenders. I'm certainly grateful to Tim and our best of class -- best-in-class capital markets team for keeping us ahead of the cadence that Nikhil and I can spend on as we look to capitalize on the best environment for investments that we have ever seen. Year-end is shaping up to be extremely busy. And Q1 also looks promising if we continue to have access to growth capital. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I want to reiterate, that will only grow externally, if and only if, we can grow value accretively on a partial [ph] basis for existing shareholders. I hope that you as our shareholders are as excited as I am about our operating results and capital allocation activities. But interestingly, those are not the most exciting things -- exciting areas inside Welltower today. What truly galvanizes us are the exciting prospects of John's operating platform, and especially the digital transformation of senior housing industry. As we have discussed ad nauseam, we refuse to accept the lack of 21st century business process and technology infrastructure of the primarily people driven business where individual community -- communities are on their own island. We have made tremendous strides in last 90 days on the technology backbone of what Welltower 3.0 may look like, and how far we can raise the bar for resident and employee experience. Welltower's engine room is buzzing with pilots and scaling, and traditional technology solutions like from ERP and CRM to advanced technology solutions around robotics and artificial intelligence. Our goal is to elevate the community experience by delighting the customer and their families and simplify and enhance the employee experience, all of which should lead to occupancy and NOI growth. Then, and only then, do we have to have a shot at earning a long-term sustainable return for our owners, which has been less than satisfactory over the last decade. My partners and I are truly inspired and are hopeful that we're turning the corner to achieve multiyear double-digit compounding growth rate. While supply and demand backdrop is squarely in our favor, we're far more focused on the value at alpha from our platform with you as our fellow owners have funded to build with our blood, sweat and tears. And with that, I'll pass the call over to John. John Burkart : Thank you, Shankh. I know that it sounds like a broken record, but again, another great quarter. Our total portfolio generated 14.1% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter led by the senior housing operating portfolio with 26.1% year-over-year growth. We are methodically moving forward focused on the customer and employee experience and that is driving results. We started with brute force effectively relying on our raw labor to identify issues and opportunities. We continue to improve the systems and processes and organize the data to make data driven decisions to improve the business, and we're just at the beginning. The medical office portfolios third quarter same-store NOI growth was 3.4% over the prior year's quarter, same-store occupancy was 95%, while retention remains extremely strong across the portfolio at nearly 93%. The 26.1% third quarter year-over-year NOI increase in our same-store senior housing operating portfolio was a function of 9.8% revenue growth driven by the combination of 6.9% RevPOR growth, 220 basis points of average occupancy gain and moderating expense growth. Expenses remain in control coming in at 5.1% for the quarter over the prior year's quarter. The strong revenue growth and expense growth led to substantial margin expansion of 330 basis points. As Shankh has mentioned many times, the marginal increase in expenses as occupancy continues to grow over 80% is relatively low for obvious reasons. Many of the expenses are fixed. Each property has an Executive Director, Head Chef, Maintenance Director regardless of the occupancy level. The bulk of maintenance utility and many other costs are largely factored in at 80% occupancy. As a result, our Expense POR or Expense Per Occupied Room continues to remain low, enabling the business to improve the margins. As Shankh mentioned, our ExpPOR growth for the quarter was 2.4%, the lowest in our recorded history. All three of our regions continue to show strong same-store revenue growth, starting with the U.S at 9.6%, and Canada and the U.K growing at 9.7% and 12.9%, respectively. The strong revenue growth in each region combined with the expense controls have led to fantastic NOI growth in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., of 25.4%, 27.1% and 37%, respectively. The management transitions continue to perform above expectations. We are grateful to our operating partners, who are working so hard to ensure that we achieve the improved operations that we set out to accomplish in our journey to operational excellence. Our operators continue to do an amazing job of managing through the complexities of the business to provide a superior customer and employee experience. Many of our senior customers were born in the 1930s. The Depression. They have worked hard and sacrifice all their life and now they deserve to enjoy the fruits of their labor. The product and services remain very affordable to a large segment of the population who have purchased and paid off their homes years ago, and are now at a point where they can sell their home, live off their assets enjoying a good quality of life during their golden years, which they deserve. Our focus with our operating partners on improving the customer and employee experience benefits all stakeholders. For example, our focus on materially reducing agency labor improves both the customer and employee experience, as both are benefited by permanent high-quality employees compared to the random agency employees lacking relationships with our customers and knowledge of the community systems and processes. Additionally, eliminating the agency or middlemen enables us to ensure the hard working people at our communities receive a fair compensation package with vacation and benefits as well as competitive pay, and our shareholders benefit from the reduced leakage to the agency company owners. Care is the essence of the service provided and ensuring employees can deliver outstanding care is one of our top priorities. Our operating platform efficiencies will increase the time available for care and reduce the stress on our employees. For example, at one site, one of my team members worked at, the Executive Director spends over 3 hours per move-in inputting the documents into the antiquated systems. The CRM, [indiscernible] and Care modules are disparate systems. Our platform has all the documents in E-Form and the modules are fully integrated, reducing the potential for errors and saving time, which enables the site leader to focus on the customers and employees, not paperwork. We continue to make substantial progress on our platform and the related rollout. I'm grateful for the engagement and participation by the leadership of our operators who are actively working with us to ensure the success of the platform. More to come in 2024. I will now turn the call over to Tim. Tim McHugh : Thank you, John. My comments today will focus on our third quarter 2023 results. The performance of our triple-net investment segments in the quarter, our capital activity, a balance sheet and liquidity update, and finally our updated full year 2023 outlook. Welltower reported third quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.24 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.92 per diluted share, representing 10.4% year-over-year growth, or 16.5% growth after adjusting for HHS and the year-over-year impact from changes in FX rates and higher base rates and floating rate debt. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 14.1% year-over-year. Now turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats are reported [indiscernible]. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 6/30/2023. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 3.9% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage is .93x. In the quarter, we agreed to convert 11 StoryPoint assets and triple-net lease to RIDEA, which will bring their regionally focused managed portfolio up to 55 Midwestern properties in the fourth quarter. Next, same-store NOI and our long-term post acute [ph] portfolio grew 5.3% year-over-year, and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.44x. Turning to capital activity. We closed on $1.4 billion of acquisitions and loans in the quarter, led by $618 million of senior housing operating investments. As a reminder, the Revera PSP joint venture online that was announced last quarter will close by geography in three distinct phases. The U.K portion closed in 21Q and the U.S portion close this quarter, resulting in $75 million of net investment. And the Canadian portion is expected to close by year-end. In the quarter, we continue to issue through our ATM to fund ongoing investment spend and position the balance sheet for future opportunities. We raised gross proceeds of $1.9 billion, at an average price of approximately $81 per share, allowing us to fully fund year-to-date investment activity and also extinguish $290 million of debt in the quarter. This capital activity along with continued growth across our business segments including the continued post-COVID recovery within our senior housing operating business, help drive net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 5.14x at quarter end which represents 1.8x of deleveraging versus one year ago. We expect net debt to adjusted EBITDA to settle in the mid 5s on a pro forma basis post near-term investment activity, and it continued to trend downward in future quarters, as a recovery in our senior housing operating portfolio continues to drive organic cash flow higher. Additionally, filing this intra and post-quarter capital activity, including $900 million of gross investments closed to date in October, we have a current cash and cash equivalents balance of $2 billion, along with full capacity on our $4 million revolving line of credit and $624 million in remaining expected proceeds from near-term dispositions and loan pay downs, representing approximately $6.6 billion in near-term available liquidity. Lastly, moving to our full year guidance. Last night we updated our previously issued full year 2023 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to a range of $0.91 to $0.95 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $3.59 to $3.63 per diluted share, were $3.61 per share at the midpoint. Our normalized -- updated normalized FFO per share guidance represents a $0.055 increase at the midpoint of our previously updated guidance. This increasing guidance is reflective of a $0.03 increase from higher expected full year senior housing operating NOI, a $0.035 increase from capital allocation activity, which assumes no further investment year beyond what is close the date, and this increases are partially offset by combined penny drag on increase in expected full year G&A and stronger dollar. Underlying this FFO guidance is an increased estimate of total portfolio year-over-year at the same-store NOI growth of 11.5% to 13.5%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2.5% to 3%, long-term post-acute 4% to 5%, senior housing triple-net of 1.5% to 2.5%, and finally, increased senior housing operating growth of 23% to 26%. The midpoint of which is driven by continued better-than-expected expense trends, along with revenue growth of approximately 9.8% year-over-year. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation of approximately 240 basis points of year-over-year average occupancy increase and rent growth of approximately 6.7%. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim. I want to conclude by turning your attention to three items that may not seem as important or exciting for our near-term results. On a combined basis, they may actually serve as a drag on our Q4. But nonetheless, it's extremely important to underscore as far as our stabilized or run rate earnings is concerned. First, we have convinced our partner StoryPoint to convert 11 properties from triple-net to RIDEA structure. 9 of these properties ran a historic lease structure with other operators, and 2 of them are recent acquisitions. StoryPoint is one of our best operators and a current RIDEA operator has cleaned up these billings, improved staffing, service quality and invested significant capital. These properties have gained 500 basis points of occupancy since beginning of the year to 70% in September, report is up 15% since they took over, RevPOR of the new movements in 2023 is up another 12% from the average of 2023 numbers. This is setting up the stage for significant cash flow growth in '24 and beyond. Debt to equity conversion at the bottom of the cycle, perhaps the most value accretive transaction we can complete today. As we have experienced in our recent legend conversion, we can expect to breakeven in 12 to 15 months relative to our previous contractual rent, and then our shareholders will get all the upside afterwards. This obviously will work only if you have great assets run by great managers and we are right about the trajectory of the cash flow. And that is the bet I'm willing to take at this point in the recovery cycle. We consider to -- we continue to seek additional opportunities to achieve similar outcomes when they check the boxes of great assets and operator quality and when we can expand the pie with our partner so that we can attain a win-win solution, an outcome for a long-term basis. Second, Kisco, one of our strongest operating partner, measured by margin, occupancy and other operating metrics, recently marched with another one of our operators, Balfour. Balfour, now a affiliate of Kisco, maintains a dominant position in the Denver [ph] metro area also has [indiscernible] buildings nearing completion in Brookline, in Boston MSA and Georgetown in D.C., both properties opening in 2024. We thank Schonbrun and Susan Juroe for their partnership at Balfour and wish them all the best for the next phase of their lives and welcome Andy Kohlberg and his team to take over the stewardship and growth of these communities. Like StoryPoint communities above, this transaction will be significantly accretive to our stabilized earnings and cash flow growth. Last but not least, when the final stages of Project Transformer, the transaction, which I described to you last quarter, with our teams working really hard with Matthew and Frederic at Cogir. Our brand launch is coming up in the next few weeks, and people are on both sides are working at a frenetic phase to achieve seamless transition. This is yet another transaction like the others above, which will look back at in '24 and '25 and feel really proud to have completed as they have added to our earnings and cash flow growth despite some near-term friction and the tremendous workload for the combined team. Speaking of earnings and cash flow growth, I would like you to provide a report card on the previous large transactions to Avery and Oakmont from Signature and Sunrise that we discussed with you in Q2. Both Avery and Oakmont have grown occupancy of approximately 300 basis points since transitions have begun. We, at Welltower, remain focused on the long-term price of getting this business to an elevated level of customer and employee experience and generating earnings per share that is substantially higher than where we came from. To sum it up, the powerful recovery in senior housing operating business, the rollout of our operating platform and a significantly accretive capital deployment are all setting us up for an accelerating earnings and cash flow trajectory for '24 and '25. With that, I'll open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess the sort of great opportunity on the external growth front, we have -- yesterday, we saw two of your peers merge, and I was hoping you could sort of give us a sense of as that process was explored, have you been -- is that something that's been of interest to you or could be of interest to you? And can you compare and contrast that line sort of entity deal with your sort of more granular approach going forward? Shankh Mitra : So Vikram, I don't comment on other people's deals. It seems like it's a great outcome for both of them. We were not engaged, and we will not be engaged in that process, just to be specific. As we said many times, what works for us is one asset at a time transactions even if we do, when we do portfolios, Nikhil is finishing up a portfolio transaction right now of 10 assets that we have gotten. We have picked from a collection of 80, 90-plus assets. So it's sort of -- we're very, very focused on going deep than going broad in our markets. And we genuinely believe in small transactions with one asset at a time. I believe there are median size of assets, transactions that we have done in the last 3 years, which constitute this $12 million-or-so of assets we've bought is like $30 million. That's what we like, that works for us, and that's what will continue. We have no [indiscernible] opportunities. I mean what we see today, the market is, I will not be surprised, you guys will recall that we had talked about a few years ago, there will be potentially $30 billion of opportunities. As we sit here today, we can say the TAM is actually bigger than that, given how much loans that coming due, how much of floating rate debts are rolling over. So we have no problem growing the company as long as we have access to capital and we can do it on a per share [ph] basis. But large M&A is something that I've never liked. I'm not saying I'll never do it. But frankly speaking, it's just not much interest to us. And specifically answer to your question, we're not engaged and will not engage in the process that you mentioned. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Connor Siversky with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Connor Siversky : Good morning out there. Thanks for taking the questions. I've got a three part one for you guys here. But on the Cogir transaction, can you offer a sense as to what occupancy levels look like in the properties earmarked to be managed by the operator in the future? And then is there a way to quantify the NOI upside potential from this transaction and ultimately, the transition of those properties? And finally, is that Regency case study outlined in the deck a good example to gauge what that NOI potential could look like for the broader Cogir portfolio? Shankh Mitra : Connor, you were talking about, if I understand your question correctly, the Cogir transaction if you're talking about the properties that Cogir is taking over from Revera, the property occupancy is roughly around 80%. And we think that, as you know, Cogir obviously runs their properties well north of 90% occupancy and 40% margin, and I think we'll get there. What was the other part of the question, sorry, I missed that? Connor Siversky : So you outlined that Regency case study in the deck for those -- I think you were in British Columbia near Alberta. Is that a good example to use as a gauge for the NOI potential of the broader Cogir portfolio? Shankh Mitra : Yes. I think you will see in this particular portfolio that we're talking about, the transition portfolio, Regency portfolio, Regency was a very well-run portfolio. This Cogir still has been able to get that margins, I believe, from around, call it, take up 40% to about 50%. In this particular case, I believe that the improvement will be better and will go from -- margins will go from, call it, say, up 20% to 40%. So I think we should see better enhancement in this particular case than the Regency example. Connor Siversky : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Impressive occupancy acceleration into September. Just curious what the early indications are for revenue increases to existing customers. I'm assuming some of the rate letters, apologies, have gone out already. So just curious how that year-over-year delta is looking for rent increases to existing customers? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Juan, as you know, we're sort of finalizing that as we speak, right? That's the discussion we are in. As I've mentioned in my prepared remarks that we expect that to be very strong like last couple of years and that's where we are. We are not there yet from a purely finalization standpoint. But I continue to believe that we'll achieve -- a customer is expecting an elevated level of service, costs are not coming down any place, the business overall for the industry, not just for us, remain at a suboptimal level of margins where you can attract capital to the business. So all these things putting together, I think you will see strong rate growth. What exactly that is, is too early to say, but I continue to expect that will be very strong. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jonathan Hughes : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Shankh, could you just clarify the any comments you gave in your prepared remarks where you said that the Kisco, Balfour merger might be a drag on the fourth quarter? I didn't quite understand why that might be the case? And then maybe one more, if I could sneak it in, the SHO portfolio outperformed that typical seasonality in the third quarter. I think that's expected to continue into year-end. Is that driven more so by the U.K. related changing same-store pool, something else? Just any additional color there would be great. Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Let me try the first one. So I did not say that specific transaction might be a drag on the fourth quarter. I said the three things that I described together could be a drag on the fourth quarter. But combined, all of them should be a significant driver of growth on 20 -- for '25 or just call it, stabilized earnings. That's the point I was trying to drive, not specifically about Kisco and Balfour. Tim McHugh : And on your question on the seasonality in the business, you're correct. We continue to outperform the historical seasonality, and we are not seeing major differences between our transition portfolio. As Shankh mentioned, we are actually seeing very strong occupancy gains in the transition portfolio probably greater than what we've seen in the core portfolio. Shankh Mitra : Jonathan, just the core portfolio, as you know, sequential occupancy growth was around 150 basis points and the transition portfolio, the two, I talked about was the majority of the transition we did in Q2. The occupancy growth in from signature to Avery and Sunrise to Oakmont, both portfolios achieved a sequential occupancy growth of roughly 300 basis points. So almost double of what the same-store did. Operator : [Indiscernible] with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Yes, I was hoping to get maybe a little bit of a preview about how G&A could trend over the next year. And I know this year, there was the build out of John's group and just trying to understand like how far along that is and how that could affect G&A growth over the next year? Shankh Mitra : Nick, as I mentioned early in the year, I think if you go back to fourth quarter call, we have at least another year of elevated G&A increase as a build out of the platform. So you should -- we have come long, but we have a long ways to go. So G&A versus NOI, just a geography of where you see occupancies versus revenues. So we do believe that the platform build out is paying off, has started to pay off in spades. But from a purely just looking purely at G&A item, we would expect that another year of build out -- at least another year of build out. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : Thanks. It's actually Nick Joseph here with Michael. Shankh, I recognize you said you're not engaged, you won't be engaged. But last year, you reportedly got involved in a similar public to public M&A situation within the medical office space. You talked in the past a lot about being an IR buyer and cost base focused and that you look at everything. So just curious in this situation or more broadly, is it kind of the current valuation and underwritten returns aren't sufficient against the other opportunities that you're seeing? Is it something about medical office that's keeping you on the sidelines here? Shankh Mitra : So first thing I mentioned that I don't comment on other people's deals. So I have nothing underwritten, so I can't even comment on what the underwritten returns looks like. But specifically to medical office, I think I provided some color last quarter that we're unsure at this point what the long-term inflation land. And because we are unsure we are unsure of at this point to make a huge bet on an asset class that we don't know what the growth profile versus the long-term inflation looks like, right? So that's a very important point. We are finding opportunities where we think we can small opportunities where we can do value add. We are buying assets at 70%, 80% occupancy and leasing up and so that we can see the growth rate higher. But from a stabilized 95%, call it, occupied medical office with a 2.5% increase or whatever it is, the traditional medical office, which provides a good long-term, stable growth for institutional investors is not interesting for us. For that one reason. And the second reason is, it's always -- it's relative opportunities is the question, right? If that's the only thing that was available to us, will be a different conversation. We are easily picking off at low double-digit plus unlevered IRR opportunities in the senior living side assuming that we don't add much value, and I'm pretty positive we will add value. So it's just a question of relative opportunities of where we see we will today. And that's why we have no interest. By no means that suggests that we don't think it's a good deal or not a good deal. I have no idea what the deal is because I'm not engaged in it as I specifically mentioned will not because of the reasons I just pointed out to you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : Yes. Hey, guys. I have a question on the transitions. Shankh, you mentioned you've been very active in terms of proactive portfolio management. You achieved a lot of early success recently with Avery and Oakmont. How have these operators driven such strong results so quickly? And just how would you encourage us to think about future transitions in the portfolio? Shankh Mitra : Yes, I'm not going to answer the first question, Josh. Obviously, on a public call, I mean, things called trade secrets that you don't want us to divulge on a public company call. But we'll say that this doesn't happen like automatically. As I've said before, we have learned. We have done a lot of transitions over the last, call it, 5, 7 years that I've been doing this, and we have learned our lessons from frankly, old school way of losing money. We have learned what we have done wrong. We have gotten better then sort of we learned how to start bleeding and then finally, we have gotten the other side of how do we -- how we can make an impact. What the prep work you need to do on systems and process and frankly, that's what John taught us, right? So it's just -- it's an evolution. It's a process that we have gotten over the last few years, and I'm very, very happy that we are there. Now from the point of view of transitions, is it the last transition, would we do 1,000 more transitions. It just depends on the performance we are trying to optimize our performance. I've said it many, many times that this is a business in our opinion, in our humble opinion. It's a business of optimizing location, product, price point and operator, right? So we'll keep optimizing it until we think that we were done. And that's kind of where we are. It's a journey I've written about that I'm willing to do even if we take short-term hits. And it appears, at least from near-term results, no guarantee of the future that we have achieved how to even mitigate that short-term hit. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : Hey, good morning, everyone. So I want to talk and perhaps to John on the rate number that you mentioned, the RevPOR number of 7% and specifically, the sustainability of that type of growth. It's always been my view that there was some sort of implied ceiling of growing rents for people that are 85 years old. And that at some point along the way that there's just a way of doing business. Now I don't know that there's a real ceiling of some sort, but it always seemed to me that was the case, correct me if I'm wrong? Number two, though, maybe it involves unpacking the rent, maybe it's rent between rent and care and so that kind of muddies the conversation. But I wonder if you could comment at any level about how rate might grow in the future considering what I would think would be some pushback for the reasons I just described? Shankh Mitra : Rich, let me try to start that. And John, you sort of finish anything that I haven't added. So I think your conversation that you have is a reasonable for -- if you think about a long-term tenant in the middle of the market, right? So there is a -- you have to think about the customer you're talking about. We -- our rate increase is because we have sold majority of our mid-market product, our U.K. and U.S. portfolio is primarily focused on very high-end customer, very wealthy customer and the product remains incredibly affordable to them. And at that level, we haven't seen any pushback. The second point you have to consider Rich, is you -- we have never raised rates like you have seen in other asset classes, multifamily stores, others, 20%, 25%. We have never raised that, right? So just sort of rates remains high single digits, whatever, like 8%, 9%, 10% is sort of what we have done. So it's much more sustainable than you think. But put that aside, just understand, put all of those comments in the context of average length of stay, you're talking about an average length of stay of 20 months. So we might be here talking about for the third year of increase of X percent. But just understand, the person who got the first year of increase, he or she is gone, right? She's no longer in the community. So if you put all of those together, you will see that if you provide the very important point, if you provide the differentiated services at the highest level, your customer is willing to pay you. Now we are, as I've said many, many times, we're not focused on an individual number, call a RevPOR or rate, right? We're focused on very much of a delta between RevPOR and ExpPOR and that's what we are focused on. I've said that last year and the year before. And we shall see what the market gives us, right? I have no idea what the market will give us if there's a pushback, we will adjust, but we haven't seen any yet. John Burkart : Yes. I fully agree. It's the difference between RevPOR and Expense POR and it's -- I think you're probably, Rich, thinking about multifamily where people are there for years and years and years, and it's a very different situation here. Operator : Our next question comes from James Kammert with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. James Kammert : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I certainly appreciate the operating leverage embedded in the SHO portfolio. And I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color sort of regarding labor trends for the general staffing there and what conviction you have and the ability to really continue to sustain pretty attractive or capitated growth of those expenses? I mean are you getting longer tenures, so it's lower turnover and lower recruitment costs or just a better labor talent pool. And again, I'm just thinking more beyond the Chef [ph] and the General Manager, what levers are contributing to nice profile in terms of growth on the expenses for labor? Shankh Mitra : Jim, you are correct that we are seeing turnover is coming down significantly. We are seeing that overall availability of employees who wants to be part of our business and part of the communities is increasing significantly. And we are seeing that our operating partners are getting better using technology and other resources to attract talent and keeping them in the business, right? So that sort of -- it's -- whenever you get hit by a crisis, people figure out ways to do things better, every crisis makes the business better if it survives, right? And that's what we are seeing. And what conviction do we have that RevPOR minus ExpPOR journey can continue very significantly. For a specific line item, on a specific thing, on a specific quarter, we have no idea. I said this a million times. Our goal here is not to predict the future. Our goal is to see what market gives us and do better than market. We'll see what market gives us. John Burkart : Yes. And I would just add, in my comments, my focus is on productivity. So we want our employees to be paid well. We want happy employees and happy customers. We also want to increase productivity of the business so that we can manage to accomplish all of that. So that's really, I think, the take home point. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Mueller : Yes. Curious, how are you thinking about, I guess, senior housing development today? And how do you see starts potentially trending over the next couple of years? Shankh Mitra : Yes. Mike, I'm just going to be repetitive here. I was asked this question at the NIC conference about a week ago or 10 days ago, whenever that was. I'll repeat what I said on the panel. I think if we're a debt provider in senior housing today, you have a better lot going to Vegas. And if we are an equity provider and senior housing development today, you have a better life buying lottery. I hope that tells you what my view of senior housing development is. I don't even understand why there is any start, any like more than 0 because the economics doesn't make any sense given where construction cost is, where capital cost is and where the margin of the business is. It should not have any starts and it seems like it's going there. I think any stock that you are seeing, people are still playing with other people's money, and that's coming down -- closing down pretty quickly. And I think you will continue to see it's moving down. Mike, did I miss any other part of your question? Mike Mueller : No, that was it. Thank you. Shankh Mitra : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. Given the dislocation that we are seeing in the private market, is it harder for operators that are having liquidity issues to provide the same level of care versus your operators that presumably don't have these issues? I mean are you seeing that in the marketplace at all right now? And if not, do you expect that this will become a bigger storyline over the next several quarters? Shankh Mitra : I can't speak for other people, Mike. I will tell you that we have -- our operators -- operating partners are doing extremely well. And we are getting hit left, right and center with new operating partner who wants to be part of our story. So whether that's because they're inspired to do what John is doing, our data journey or we are trying to professionalize the business or the detailed transformation journey or they're having troubles on their own end or both, I have no idea. But I could tell you that we have literally -- I mean, it is -- we've seen really good investment opportunities. but we have never seen anything like what we are seeing today. Whether that's because of a pull or a push, I have no idea. And we are seeing operators from all parts of the country, in all three countries we do business with, is calling us to be part of it this well-capitalized, extraordinarily well capitalized platform, but also the part of -- being part of John's platform. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, great. Just a big picture one. So looking at the presentation, the NOI, the incremental NOI build, I noticed that you guys added a bar here that looks like another $172 million. And I'm tying back to your comments about the focus on RevPOR versus ExpPOR. It's clearly a margin benefit here. So I was wondering if you could talk about that, why add that to the deck where -- is this -- are we supposed to read into it just more confidence in the ability to get back to pre-COVID margins, is the question. Tim McHugh : Yes, Ron. So we added that to deck through conversations with both investors and analysts alike. They're looking at it interpreting kind of a stabilized point to be reflective of 88% occupancy and 31% margins. When in fact, with the rent growth we've seen since fourth quarter '19, as we were ignoring that rent growth and -- or with it, we are baking in around 29% margin. So what we wanted to do is just show getting back to just the NOI level on today's rents means that you're getting to margins that are 200 basis points plus below where we were margin wise in fourth quarter '19, and what that final bar does is just shows you getting back to 88% occupancy, 31% margin in pre-COVID levels at today's third quarter '23 realized rents where NOI would be. Shankh Mitra : And Ron, I've said this before, I'll repeat it again. If that's all we go back to Q4 of '19 level or pre-COVID level, I would be very, very disappointed. If you have done this in Q4 of '19, you remember, those were not the greatest days of this business, right? So we were getting it for 4-plus years at this point and through our supply cycle. That is not a high point like a lot of other businesses are and we're very disappointed that's all we get back to. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Feldman with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Jamie Feldman : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm here with Connor. How should we think about funding assumptions for the next tranche of acquisitions? And then also, how does the quality of the assets you're looking at compared to the quality of your existing portfolio? Or put differently, how do you assure investors that you aren't moving up the risk curve to chase the return profile? Shankh Mitra : I don't want to assure investors of anything. I think investors are aware of our track record, and you guys do a very good job of visiting our properties. So you can see it. The chasing the risk curve to get investments might happen when things are really, really tight. It is an exactly opposite environment, Jamie. And when those environments have occurred in the past, we were massive sellers of assets. We don't chase risk curves to get return. That's just not what we do. Now going back to your actual -- the crust of your question is, frankly speaking, the initial part of COVID, what we are noticing was sort of a lot of broken cash flows, right? Assets while 60%, 70% occupied; new development, brand new assets, 3 years, 4 years, 2-year-old assets, but broken cash flow because that's normal for a business that had breaks even at 60% occupancy and your marginal sort of return, if you will, or your marginal or incremental margins sort of go hockey stake is normal for that period of time given how much occupancy we lost during COVID to have those kind of asset; great assets, broken cash flow because of what the occupancy is and how margins work in this business. That was 2 years ago, 3 years ago, that's what sort of we were seeing. Today, we are seeing broken capital structure, assets are generating the cash flow that you should be generating at 80% occupancy, 82% occupancy where the industry is, call it, 6%, 6.5%, whatever it is, the cash flow yield -- that's not the problem. The problem is the underlying leverage, which is now so far plus 350, 400 is at 9%. That's the problem and those loans are coming to you, you are upside down on a cash flow basis and your upside down on a leverage basis. And those are the ones that are transacting today. So frankly speaking, the number of trophy buildings, number of high-quality, high high-quality buildings, which core investor zone, the core [indiscernible] zone that we have seen in last, call it, 6 months even last 4 months, I haven't seen the 4 years before that, right? And so the quality of opportunities are going up pretty significantly, but it is up to you to decide what is the quality of assets we are buying. And we give assets, you can go and visit them, and I think you will come to the same conclusion. Did I miss any part of the question? Tim McHugh : And, Jamie, on your funding question. So in my prepared remarks, I spoke to kind of a liquidity build, and that's as of October 30. So we talked about $900 million in investments just quarter-to-date closed in October, $1 billion pipeline ahead of us about $2 billion in cash and $6.6 billion of total available liquidity to fund that. Operator : Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Austin Wurschmidt : Great. Thanks. Shankh, you were crystal clear with your thoughts on why development doesn't make sense broadly in senior housing today, but you did expand the development pipeline, I think it was up $600 million this quarter, roughly half of that was in senior housing. And clearly, you have a cost of capital advantage today. But I mean, is that what gives you the comfort moving forward with these projects? And then I'm curious, are developers coming to you to partner on future projects that can't sort of access construction financing? And how does that opportunity set compare versus acquisitions? Shankh Mitra : So I think, if I understand correctly, Nikhil correct me if I'm wrong, all our development starts are either fully 100% leased medical office developments that we have long-term tail or long-term contracts with our existing clients or their wellness housing development. I do not believe that we have started any senior housing development. I don't remember when was the last time we actually started the senior housing development. So because of the all reporting in the same bucket, Austin, but they're not senior housing development, there are what in the -- what we call wellness housing, which is age restricted and age targeted apartment. Operator : Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi. It's Juan here with Juan [ph] still. Just a quick question on the investment pipeline. Could you give a breakdown of kind of what you're looking at? And where do you think you see or where are stabilized deals say for what you're targeting in the major food groups? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So the pipeline today is, as I said, I don't know, Nikhil, but it's like 80% plus would be senior housing. And mostly, I would say, equity in senior living and probably maybe 90%. But vast majority of senior living and core equity opportunities in senior living just because of the size. It's just a lot of it is in U.S. And we just closed a large transaction in Canada. So if I think about -- remember it correctly, it's almost entire -- not entirely, but majority is U.S. senior housing and there are some credit opportunities in the [indiscernible]. I don't remember any transaction or pipeline about any MOBs, but do you know anything? Nikhil Chaudhri : Nothing meaningful. Shankh Mitra : Okay. And stabilized yields, I would say, in the senior living today, we are targeting close to 8 on a stabilized basis and going in. I think I said last call, we are seeing sort of opportunities that starting at 6, ending at 8 and given the rise of real rates, we are seeing better than that today. Frankly, we have ratcheted our return expectations higher. So that's sort of where we are transacting. But we are not a yield buyer. We are still happy to buy 1% yield, if we think that's the right basis and the right assets. But generally speaking, those are the kind of opportunities we are seeing. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : Thanks for the -- taking the follow-up. Nikhil or Shankh, can you just update us on the Integra process? How are those assets been performing? And by extension, is there -- are there additional opportunities? I just asked that because you had earlier outlined upon stabilization, you might look to sell some of that. So would just be helpful to get an update on Integra. Thanks. Nikhil Chaudhri : Yes, Vikram. So we are pleased with the performance that we are seeing. Last quarter, I talked about the first 133 out of the 147 buildings that have transitioned. In the last quarter, those buildings produced roughly $70 million of positive EBITDARM compared to negative $90 million for the 3 months prior to the transition. Now fast forward another quarter, those same buildings in the second quarter generated $127 million of EBITDARM. So in the 6 months since transition, you're seeing a cash flow swing of $215 plus million and obviously, every month continues to be better than the prior month. And so if you look at June end and you annualize that, you were roughly $170 million, which is north of the rent, right? So here we are 6 months in when we had underwritten this, we thought it would take us much longer 18 months, give or take, to get to this point. So we are incredibly pleased with the performance. But we think there's still a long ways to go. So your point about exiting upon stabilization, we are happy with the progress, but we are far from stabilization.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. And welcome to the Welltower Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that this call is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Matthew McQueen, General Counsel. You may begin your conference. Matthew McQueen : Thank you and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on a reasonable assumption, the company can give no assurances that projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and describe high level business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on the operational performance of our Senior Housing and Outpatient Medical portfolios and progress on our operating platform build-out. Nikhil will give you an update on the investment landscape. And Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and 2024 full year guidance. First, as I reflect back on 2023, it was a year of solid execution across the Board with significant progress achieved in all aspects of the business. Operating performance far surpassed our initial expectations. We had a great year, a record-setting year in terms of capital deployment and we meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet and liquidity profile. Just as importantly, perhaps, is the groundwork we laid to sustain this level of performance and continue to deliver outsized growth not only in 2024 but also well into the future. This includes the considerable progress John and his team have made on the build-out of our operating platform, which we continue to believe will transform the industry. On top of that, as we have discussed in recent quarters, we have executed a number of operator transitions across all our geographies, as well as converted a handful of properties from triple-net to RIDEA. All should bear fruit later this year and in 2025. We finished the year strong with significant momentum to set us up for another year of solid performance in 2024. In terms of our Senior Housing Operating portfolio, I was particularly encouraged by the occupancy growth in fourth quarter, which is seasonally not the strongest period. The portfolio saw 110 basis points of sequential occupancy gains, which translate into 330 basis points year-over-year occupancy growth, and the 330 basis points year-over-year occupancy growth is by far the highest level we have ever achieved in the fourth quarter of any year in our recorded history. Just as compelling is that looking at the intra-quarter trends, year-over-year occupancy growth strengthened each month, which is unusual given the aforementioned seasonality of the business. We\u2019re also pleased with the rate growth achieved by our managers. During our last call, I described to you that one of our largest operators, Sunrise, pulled forward Jan 1, 2023 rate increases into 4Q 2022. This year they have returned to their historical cadence of Jan 1 rate increases. While this distorts our show portfolio\u2019s reported Q4 2023 RevPOR or the unit revenue, the rest of the portfolio delivered RevPOR growth of 6.8%, reflecting the underlying fundamental strength of the business. While our 2024 guidance assumes some diminution of RevPOR growth from full year of 2023 levels of 6.6%, we still expect another year of near double-digit topline growth as occupancy continues to build at a solid pace. 4Q 2023, same-store ExpPOR or expense per occupied room grew 1.7% year-over-year. The lowest level of growth in Welltower\u2019s recorded history, driven by 4Q 2023 same-store compensation per occupied room growth, which grew 1.9% year-over-year, also the lowest growth in Welltower\u2019s recorded history. While the normalization of agency labor usage is helping to dampen COMPOR growth, we are also seeing some good trends in the salary and the wages line. All of these trends are resulting in a favorable spread between RevPOR growth and ExpPOR growth. The powerful combination of this revenue backdrop with continued margin expansion that should be expected due to the high operating leverage inherent in the business leaves us feeling very strongly about our 2024 NOI growth setup. Tim will give you our detailed buildup of our NOI guidance based on our current assumptions, but please understand that we have no false pretense about perfectly knowing what the business will look like as we move through the years, particularly the all-important summer months. But we are optimistic, given the demand-supply backdrop, which improves by the day and the rising system-wide occupancy, as well as the early success we have seen in John\u2019s operating platform buildout. While 24.4% NOI growth last year for our shop portfolio alone was very encouraging, I\u2019m extremely pleased with our capital allocation activities as well. In 2023 was the most active year in our history in terms of raising and deploying capital. We completed almost $6 billion of investments in the year, nearly half of which closed in Q4 alone. While I won\u2019t get into the specific transactions, I will mention that they share some common characteristics. First, we generally grew with our existing operating partners in their respective markets. Second, we acquired assets at a significant discount to replacement costs from core funds, PE funds, pension funds and financial institutions who were seeking liquidity. We also added a couple of new operating partners along the way who I envision us growing with in the near-term. More to come on this topic as we progress through the year. The torrid pace of investment activity in Q4 has continued with 2024 starting off with a bang. In fact, I do not recall having ever been this busy in first quarter on the deal front. While we have pre-negotiated documents and structure to leverage, it is great trust that we have built with our 2023 counterparties that will make follow-on transactions easier to execute. These counterparties also experienced what our promise always is, that we honor our handshake irrespective of circumstances, as evidenced by the continued -- our continued execution through this historic capital market volatility in the fall and winter of 2023. They know that we remain the clean shirt in an industry where re-trading counterparties is the norm. It is interesting and perhaps coincidental that we\u2019re experiencing another bout of market volatility after a few weeks have come. Over the past few weeks, another regional banking crisis driven by U.S. CRE debt appears to be rearing its ugly head from New York to Tokyo to Germany. We are currently staring at approximately $16 billion of Senior Housing loans maturing in the next 24 months in the U.S., which dwarfs roughly about a couple of billion dollars of agency financing completed in 2023. This should generate significant equity, as well as private credit opportunity for us. Suffice to say, our near-term capital deployment pipeline remains robust, highly visible and actionable, and with -- and squarely within our circle of competence, where we can bet with house odds rather than gambler\u2019s odds. Along with what we have already done in 2023, these acquisitions that carry an attractive basis, operational upside and significant value-add from Welltower\u2019s operating platform, we have a -- we will have a meaningful impact on what remains a true North Star, long-term compounding of partial value of our existing short loans. With that, I will hand the call over to John. John? John Burkart : Thank you, Shankh. Although most of my time at Welltower has spent doing the Welltower hustle, getting up every day, identifying and aggressively pursuing the opportunities that exist, focused on improving the customer and employee experience. I want to take a moment and reflect on how proud I am of the Welltower team for success in doing just that, improving the customer and employee experience, which in part is reflected by our performance. Focusing on Senior Housing for a moment, the Welltower team consists of our top operators and all of their employees, our key vendors, as well as the Welltower employees. We have all worked together to improve the customer and employee experience, which has resulted in fantastic results. On top of the industry-leading Senior Housing same-store NOI growth for the full year of 2022 of 20.1%, our full year 2023 Senior Housing NOI growth was 24.4%. Often on earnings calls, you hear the words, tough cost. That\u2019s certainly true here. Yet our guidance for 2024 same-store Senior Housing NOI growth at the midpoint is 18%. Therefore, based on our two full years that are completed and in the record books, 2022 and 2023, and our guidance of 18% in 2024, that indicates that the three-year compounded growth of our same-store Senior Housing NOI in 2024 will be over 75%. That\u2019s something to reflect upon. Thank you, Welltower team. Now back to our business. Our portfolio generated 12.5% same-store NOI growth over the prior year\u2019s quarter, led by the Senior Housing Operating portfolio with 23.7% year-over-year growth. The Outpatient Medical portfolio produced same-store portfolio growth of 2.8% for the fourth quarter of 2023. This was driven by favorable operating expense management, increasing the operating margin by 220 basis points year-over-year to 71.4%. Notably, our proactive appeal process achieved favorable real estate tax reductions. The 23.7% fourth quarter year-over-year NOI increased in our same-store Housing Operating portfolio with a function of 9.7% revenue growth, driven by the combination of 5.5% RevPOR growth and 330 basis points of average occupancy gain and moderating expense growth. Expenses remain in control, coming in at 5.7% for the quarter over the prior year\u2019s quarter. The strong revenue growth and expense control led to continued margin expansion of 290 basis points. Again, our ExpPOR growth for the quarter set a record for the lowest growth in our recorded history at 1.7%. All three regions continue to show strong same-store revenue growth, starting with the U.S. at 9.4%, Canada and the U.K. growing at 9.7% and 14.1%, respectively. The strong revenue growth in each region, combined with the expense control, have led to fantastic NOI growth in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. of 21.8%, 21.7% and 75.5%, respectively. We\u2019re flying along with our integrated platform initiative, which will start to go live at our first operator in the first half of this year. I will not go into all the details, but I will say that our focus on improving the customer and employee experience is coming together very well. The integrations of the various modules will simplify the customer experience and reduce the labor around basic tasks, enabling our site teams to focus on what they love, our customers. More to come in 2024. I will now turn the call over to Tim. Nikhil Chaudhri : I\u2019ll go next. Yeah. Thanks, John. On the transaction side, as Shankh mentioned, 2023 marked the most active year in the history of the company. Our new investment activity of almost $6 billion spanned more than 50 different transactions with a median transaction size of $54 million, in which we acquired 153 properties over the course of the year. I am sure you all have read about the confluence of a few factors that are creating the current investment backdrop, namely the great wall of CRE debt maturity, expiring SOFR caps, pressure on the regional bank balance sheet and the denominator effect. Welltower is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends and serve as a counterparty of choice for our private equity sponsors, large pension and asset managers, and entrepreneurs that are impacted by this challenge. We are able to source these opportunities directly from sellers or through our operating partners, given our reputation of being a good partner and a reliable and credible counterparty. We are then able to analyze and underwrite quickly and in great detail, thanks to the combination of our data analytics platform, Alpha, and our best in business investment team. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we then execute on the business plan for each asset through our deep network of aligned operating partners backed by the operating platform that John is methodically building out. These factors drive our sustainable competitive advantage for creating shareholder value. Our 2023 investment activity was focused on granular, off-market, high conviction transactions. A majority of the transactions were focused on our seniors and wellness housing businesses, where we acquired additional assets and markets where we already have high performing assets. By acquiring these assets at an attractive basis and consolidating operations under the same operator, we are able to reap the operating benefits of regional density. In the fourth quarter alone, we closed on nearly $3 billion of investments while remaining targeted and disciplined. We acquired 44 Senior Housing properties from 11 different sellers, growing our relationship with seven existing operating partners. We acquired roughly 8,800 units with an average age of around seven years at an average basis of $222,000 per unit at an approximately 40% discount to replacement costs. These transactions have a low 6s year one yield and are expected to generate unlevered IRRs north of 10%. I am also excited to provide an update on the performance of our Integra portfolio, where we have continued to see a sequential improvement in performance. For the 140 buildings that first transitioned to regional operators, we have seen annualized EBITDARM improve by more than $300 million, from losing more than $85 million in the three months prior to the transition to positive $228 million in the third quarter. While there continues to be meaningful remaining upside in performance beyond the current state, I am pleased to announce that EBITDARM coverage is now greater than one and a half times. We also transitioned the last seven remaining buildings earlier this month after getting the final set of regulatory approvals. On the back of our continued success turning around operations for our legacy Genesis and ProMedica skilled nursing portfolios, we have take -- we were active in deploying capital in the skilled space as we partnered with regional operators to acquire under managed assets. Given the credit nature of our skilled nursing investments, we always strive to have meaningful downside protection through a combination of right per bed basis in states with favorable reimbursement landscape and significant credit protection through personal and entity level guarantees. Looking ahead to 2024, we are off to an exciting start. We are delighted to announce our strategic partnership with Affinity Living Communities in which we are entering into a long-term programmatic development relationship and acquiring the Affinity portfolio of 25 active adult properties with an average age of less than eight years for $969 million or $233,000 per unit after allocating the NPV of interest cost savings to the assumed below market debt. Darin, Scott, Charlie, and John have built a fantastic business over the last decade as they have meticulously iterated and refined the Affinity prototype. Their vertically integrated platform and unwavering focus on efficiency has enabled them to grow their footprint in typically expensive Pacific Northwest markets at an attractive basis to provide moderately priced active adult housing at average rents of approximately $2,100 per month. We have been incredibly pleased with the operating performance of our moderately priced active adult business over the last few years and are excited to partner with the Affinity team to further grow that business. Our investment team remains incredibly busy as we continue to be the steady hand and trusted counterparty in our business and remain well-positioned to capitalize on capital structure issues across the industry. We are inundated with opportunities up and down the capital stack and continue to balance price discipline, operator selection and capital availability to be thoughtful stewards of our shareholder\u2019s capital. I will now hand over the call to Tim to walk through our financial results in 2024. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Nikhil. My comments today will focus on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, performance of our triple-net investment segments, our capital activity, a balance sheet liquidity update, and finally, the introduction of our full year 2024 outlook. Welltower reported fourth quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.15 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $0.96 per diluted share, representing 15.7% year-over-year growth. We also reported total portfolio, same-store NOI growth of 12.5% year-over-year. Now turn to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 9/30/2023. In our Senior Housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 2.2% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 0.95 times. It is also worth noting that our trailing three-month coverage in this segment moved above 1 times for the first time since the pandemic. Next, same-store NOI in a long-term post-acute portfolio group grew 5.2% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.36 times. Turn to capital activity. We invested $3 billion in acquisitions, loans and developments in the quarter, led by $2.1 billion of Senior Housing Operating investments. In the quarter, we continue to fund investment activity via equity issuance, completing a bought equity deal in November, which along with regular way ATM activity resulted in $2.8 billion of gross proceeds in the quarter, an average price of $86.20 per share. This equity issuance allowed us to fund investment activity, along with the extinguishment of approximately $250 million of debt in the quarter and end the year with a $2.1 billion cash balance. Staying with the balance sheet, as we finish 2023, I want to highlight the balance sheet transformation that has occurred over the last 24 months. When COVID hit in 2020, we acted quickly to protect the balance sheet by securing substantial incremental liquidity, in large part by reducing cash outlays and taking advantage of strong asset values by selling long lease duration assets into a zero interest rate environment. These actions helped alleviate the impact of nearly 50% drawdown in Senior Housing Operating NOI that bottomed out in the first quarter of 2021, driving peak leverage to nearly 7.5 times ex-HHS funds. After stabilizing the portfolio in the sevens in 2021, the combination of a strong recovery in Senior Housing performance and disciplined equitization of external growth over the last two years has allowed us to methodically lower leverage, finishing this year with 5.03 times net debt-to-EBITDA. Consistent with past commentary around the balance sheet, I want to underscore that despite the improvements in metrics, current leverage still does not reflect a full post-COVID recovery in Senior Housing Operating NOI, as our portfolio still sits meaningfully below pre-COVID NOI levels. A recovery back to these levels will drive leverage well below 5 times. In summary, in 2023, our post-COVID balance sheet recovery transitioned into a strategic repositioning, ending the year with substantially upgraded metrics from prior to the pandemic, an expectation for further improvement as our Senior Housing Operating portfolio continues to carry significant organic cash flow growth momentum into 2024. This positions us with substantial capacity to continue to make systematically opportunistic capital allocation decisions to drive long-term shareholder returns in any market environment. Lastly, as I move on to the introduction of our full year 2024 guidance, I want to remind you that we have not included any investment activity in our outlook beyond that which has already been announced publicly. Last night, we introduced an initial full year 2024 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders of $1.21 per diluted share to $1.37 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $3.94 per diluted share to $4.10 per diluted share or $4.02 at the midpoint. As mentioned in our release last night, our 2024 guidance contemplates no HHS or other government grants, so after adjusting for $0.03 received in 2023, the midpoint of our initial guidance represents 11.5% year-over-year growth. This year-over-year increase in FFO per share is composed of a $0.33 increase from higher year-over-year Senior Housing Operating NOI, $0.02 increase from higher NOI in our Outpatient Medical and triple-net lease portfolios, a $0.04 headwind from higher year-over-year growth in G&A expenses tied mainly to the continued build-out of our operating platform, and finally, a $0.10 increase from investment activity and financing activity. Underlying this FFO guidance is an estimate of total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 8.25% to 11.5%, driven by sub-segment growth of Outpatient Medical 2% to 3%, long-term post-acute 2% to 3%, Senior Housing triple-net 2.5% to 4%, and finally, Senior Housing Operating growth of 15% to 21%, the midpoint of which is driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.2%. Underlying this revenue growth is an expectation for RevPOR growth of approximately 5.25% and an acceleration in year-over-year occupancy growth to 290 basis points. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim. I wanted to address a few important topics before I open the call up for questions. As you may know, on November 28th, we lost my personal hero, mentor and friend, Charlie Munger. We\u2019re deeply saddened by his death and thank many of you for reaching out to my team and me during this difficult time. Charlie was truly generous with his wisdom, continually guiding us not only on the importance of compounding, but also behaving like owners, not managers and deserving great partners by being one, and taking far less crowded high road and acting with conviction when the conditions were right. We witnessed his wit, uncommon sense, simplicity, passion for multidisciplinary running and innate ability to cut through noise and arrive at the right decision. The influence he had on Welltower, its people and its culture is truly immeasurable. His serene guidance and sage, principled advice has been invaluable to me in my life and my career. Charlie was also an instrumental influence on the members of our senior leadership team to whom he gave his greatest gift of all time, his time. We\u2019re grateful for the time we spent in his presence. I owe him a lifetime debt that cannot be repaid, but we will carry forward his teachings in how we deal with our owners, partners, residents, employees and others. His most profound impact on us is perhaps cemented in the ground rule document that he guided me to write that you can find on our website. Moving on to a less somber topic, I want to draw your attention to some of the partners which we forged new relationship with in 2023. Beyond what we have announced so far, I want to highlight Affinity as our new growth partner. Nikhil walked you through the investment rational Affinity, but I would also like to express how excited I am to work with Darin Davidson and his team there. As we have gotten to know Darin over the last five years, he has proven to be a man of high integrity and thoughtfulness with a true compass on the future direction of how older Americans want to live. Despite adding a few handful of managers to our growth platform in 2023, our partner and geographic strategy remains to go deep instead of going broad and our consolidating roster of existing managers reflect that. In summary, I hope that the optimism conveyed by my partners today on growth prospect of our business has resonated with you. While we remain focused on the execution of our 2024 strategic and operational goals, I cannot help but draw your attention to the outsized multiyear growth trajectory in front of us, which is supported by five different growth pillars. Number one, some of it is questionably is a function of favorable demand supply setup that I think you all understand. This should only get better as we look into 2025 and 2026. Number two, a lot of my personal enthusiasm stems from the digital transformation and business process optimization that John is driving. We should start to see some fruits of his labor this year, but much more in 2025 and 2026. Number three, overlay that with the impact of hundreds of properties that we have recently transitioned or agreed to transition to better operators. I am excited about the improving resident and employee experience that is currently underway with a financial impact following soon thereafter. Number four, add our extremely targeted and disciplined growth, external growth opportunities. And last but not least, number five, our underleveraged balance sheet that which Tim just described to you. We will continue to experience further organic deleveraging, which will either support A rating or provide capacity for additional external growth. As we think about the next couple of years, we have never felt better about the growth prospects or accelerating growth prospects of our earnings and cash flow for our company on a partial basis. With that, I will open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Connor Siversky with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Connor Siversky : Good morning out there. Thank you for the time and appreciate the detail in your prepared remarks. So an observation, a couple short questions on wellness housing. The Affinity portfolio generating a 60% operating margin, not exactly comparable, but seems to be above the range that a traditional assisted living facility could achieve. So first question on this end, where does that 60% margin sit on the bell curve of wellness housing operating performance outcomes? Second, with what looks like a very solid return profile, how much should we expect Welltower to lean into this segment in the years ahead? And finally, how has RevPOR and NOI growth in that portfolio trended over the last two to three years? Shankh Mitra : You snuck in three questions. Let me see if I can understand or remember all of them. First is we laid out our strategy of how we see investing in the senior living space, which is high price point, very affluent micro market, high acuity product, if you will, where we provide a service that can be actually charged accordingly and hire people and pay them appropriately. So that\u2019s one strategy. On the other side of the barbell, we went from no acuity and build out a business over the last eight -- six years, five years, six years on this wellness housing side, where it\u2019s much lower price point, but almost no services. So it\u2019s sort of from an acuity standpoint and that provides obviously much higher NOI margin. That\u2019s the two business segment that we know how to do well and make money and that\u2019s where we are. I\u2019m not suggesting that anything in between is not something that is right or wrong or anything like that, but just not something that we\u2019re focused on. Going back to your question, where that 60% or so margin sits in that wellness housing spectrum, I will say it sits towards the upper end, probably, the upper half, but no means and aberration, right? So you think about, I think about this business from mostly a mid-50%s to mid-60% margin business. Your last question, how has the growth has been in the wellness housing? Historically, it has been growing, I would say, mid-to-high single-digit. In 2023, the NOI growth for our wellness housing portfolio on a same-store basis has been 12.2%. In fourth quarter alone, that was 13.1%. Hope I remember all your questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Spector with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jeff Spector : Great. Good morning and congratulations on a great year. A bunch of questions, but I\u2019ll just focus on one. After three years of very strong, better than expected internal growth, the market appears to be pricing in approximately 700 basis points to 800 basis points of deceleration. As we look ahead, does growth normalize from here or can the current growth trajectory continue? Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Jeff, for the question. I\u2019ll start probably with one of my favorite mongerisms, which is knowing what you don\u2019t know is actually a lot more useful than being brilliant. So I want to make sure you understand that, we have no hubris of what we don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m, frankly speaking, I\u2019m pretty surprised, for many months, I\u2019ve been reading about this in research reports, talking to investors, that sort of this idea that if you had three -- two good years of numbers, obviously, that has to go down pretty meaningfully. Frankly speaking, I don\u2019t personally understand that. I will tell you that we don\u2019t know how this year is going to completely play out. We give you our best guess that Tim described to you. It is possible that we have another year of that growth rate that\u2019s sort of similar to last two years, possible if we have a strong summer sort of leasing season, right? But I think we\u2019re going to have many great years in front of us with double-digit NOI growth. Now, with -- whether this year, next year, this quarter, next quarter, I don\u2019t know what chips will fall, but as we think about taking this portfolio to where it should be leased with our opinion, as we have told you, that we\u2019ll be very disappointed if we go back to pre-COVID. There is no reason we can\u2019t even go back to where 2015 levels were, because if you look forward next few years, you will see demand-supply has been significantly better and our platform build out should help us get well past that. We should have double-digit NOI growth for years to come. I hope that sort of answers your question. We have no hubris of sort of knowing what we don\u2019t know. But we think it\u2019s also this idea that, because our business has done so well for last two years, it has to go down, it has to meaningfully decelerate, it sorts of reminds me that, perhaps, we should have more humility of what we don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see how this plays out. We\u2019ll see what market gives us. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vikram Malhotra : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to -- you have very strong outlook on shop. I wanted to dig into that a bit more in two parts. One, can you talk about sort of at the high end of your guidance range, what you or maybe the low end, what you\u2019ve baked in for RevPOR growth? And then related to that, as you sort of trend towards 85%-ish, 86% occupancy, clearly there are benefits to the bottomline. But I wanted to understand, do you -- do the operators need to stuff up or spend more marketing dollars? Is there a maybe some broad trends that you can share with us to achieve that 85% of the margin flow too? Tim McHugh : Yeah. I will start with the RevPOR and then I\u2019ll hand it over to John for any comment on kind of the operating spend side. But thinking about the RevPOR, think about kind of 5 to 5.5 being kind of the range that drives, that kind of flexes from the bottom to the top of that range. John Burkart : Yeah. So on the -- how the numbers work, as Shankh and Tim has said for a long time, the flow through gets pretty fantastic as you get north of 80%. So when you talk about staffing up, you really have, and I mentioned this on the last call, the positions are in place. You have your head chef, you have your executive director, et cetera, et cetera. So it\u2019s very incremental. So this arc of the curve, there\u2019s a lot of money that comes to the bottomline as you increase occupancy. And additionally, as we\u2019ve said, because of supply-demand factors, that\u2019s just expected in the marketplace. We may or may not decide to spend more money on marketing to accelerate that, but the conditions are fantastic right now. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jonathan Hughes : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the time. I wanted to ask about the trajectory of external growth. You lay out in the business update deck the opportunity to deploy in excess of $3 billion annually with your current stable of proprietary developers and operators. And on top of that are, of course, the opportunities outside of those relationships that could be added of like Affinity. I know you don\u2019t provide guidance on investment activity, but is it fair to assume $3 billion is kind of the low end we can expect year in, year out, given that, these partners of yours, they want to grow their businesses and they can only grow with you due to the proprietary nature of your partnerships? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Jonathan, let me see if I can answer that question. We will not give guidance. Our shop is not designed to buy stuff. We only grow if we think we can grow to add value on a partial basis for existing investors. So, if that means it\u2019s $3 billion, it\u2019s $3 billion. That means it\u2019s $300 million, it\u2019s $300 million and that means if it\u2019s $8 billion, it\u2019s $8 billion. That\u2019s sort of where we are. Having said that, if you look at the page seven of our slide deck, we see there\u2019s a massive amount of loans in the Senior Housing space that are rolling. That\u2019s just a U.S. number. We\u2019re also seeing opportunities in both the U.K. and Canada, similar ideas and there is not enough credit in the system to reify this. So we think the opportunity set, obviously, in front of us is going to be very robust. Speaking of pipeline right now, I want to reiterate the comment that I have made in my prepared remarks. We have never been this busy in Q1. As you understand, there is a seasonality of the deal business as well, right? People work really, really hard into the year end to close out the year and Q1 is usually very, sort of, you don\u2019t see a lot of activity, activity starts to pick up, obviously, in Q2 and then that\u2019s obviously translated into heavy second half. And that normal seasonality, we haven\u2019t seen, and perhaps, because of the debt curve that we\u2019re talking about, perhaps, it\u2019s because of another thing that Nikhil mentioned, which is the interest caps that are coming up and regional banks were nowhere to be found, right? So, in that context, I think, we\u2019re going to have a record year again. But who knows? If we don\u2019t see the opportunities to invest, we won\u2019t. But the pipeline remains robust, it\u2019s visible, it\u2019s actionable and we can see massive amount of value creation coming through that. Operator : Your next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Shankh Mitra : Tayo? Tayo Okusanya : Hello? Shankh Mitra : Tayo, we can hear you. Hello? Tayo Okusanya : Okay. Shankh Mitra : Tayo, we can hear you. Tayo Okusanya : Perfect. So, good morning, and then congrats on a great quarter and a great outlook. On the regulatory front, again, in the past few weeks or so, there\u2019s been some discussion. The House was kind of doing some hearings on Senior Housing and some concerns around maybe ultimately you also see some minimum staffing rules in Senior Housing. Just kind of curious what you\u2019re hearing on your end, how you kind of see that evolving over time and what that could mean for profitability for Senior Housing operators. John Burkart : Yeah. Thanks, Tayo. Obviously, we\u2019re very aware of the conversations taking place on the regulatory side. I think something that\u2019s consistent with how we\u2019ve talked about this in the past is, this business, the Senior Housing side, we almost entirely play in a private pay business where the delivery of a high quality product and reputation in the market is the most important driver of your business on a go-forward basis. And so, I think, there\u2019s areas of the healthcare world where that\u2019s not the same and you\u2019ve got more of a captive demand audience and there\u2019s more concern over how you may run a business. But on the Senior Housing side, what we know very well, both the good and the bad, is that the business is entirely driven by reputation. So, it continues to be the focus of ours is that, whether it\u2019s the staffing levels, the level of care, the quality of the employees, they are what drives the business day in, day out and it\u2019s why we spend so much time focusing on creating these sustainable models for property level. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Kammert with Evercore. Please go ahead. Jim Kammert : Good morning. Thank you. Just tying some of the previous questions together, if I could, thinking about Affinity, those are pretty attractive margins, and obviously, they\u2019re very savvy operators and then you tie together the opportunity set in terms of maturing loans on page seven of your deck. Are there other wellness or active adult type opportunities within that set of the $16 billion or so debt maturities, thinking about your overall margin implications for your portfolio as it changes? Shankh Mitra : That -- I believe that the Senior Housing loan situation we\u2019re talking about is the traditional Senior Housing product. You can, for some lender, can sort of define this as multifamily, some can Senior Housing. So, there\u2019s no way to specifically know. We play into the mid-market segment of that active adult, the wellness housing segment. You think about there are four large players in that space that we know of is that there are others, but the four major ones that we know of, Clover, Calamar, Sparrow and Affinity, and all four of them are existing Welltower partners today. As I have mentioned before, I believe in going deep, not going broad. If we find more opportunities, we will obviously see how that stacks up against our growth potentials, et cetera, but we are definitely focused on growing our business. And I think you would say starting this business six years ago to about 25,000 units today, we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of it. But growth for growth\u2019s sake is something that I just can\u2019t get my head around. Our job is to create long-term shareholder value, compounding on a partial basis what we\u2019re after. So, we\u2019ll see if we can do it, but I will be optimistic that wellness housing over a period of time will become a very significant portion of Welltower portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Austin Wurschmidt : Yeah. Thank you. Shankh, just kind of touching again on the investment pipeline and all the factors you\u2019ve laid out today of -- and previously as to why that opportunity continues to expand. I guess I\u2019m curious how big the investment pipeline you see today is sort of fee simple real estate deals versus the credit opportunities and how much of that expansion that you\u2019ve seen in the investment pipeline more recently is a function of the credit opportunity side versus\u2026 Shankh Mitra : Yeah. Austin Wurschmidt : \u2026 the more traditional fee simple. Shankh Mitra : Austin, I just want to make sure I understand your question. A lot of opportunity that we are seeing are driven by current existing owners\u2019 credit situation, whether that\u2019s rate caps, whether that\u2019s LTV, whether that\u2019s DSCR, whether that\u2019s refi. So it\u2019s driven by credit situations on their end. How we execute that on our end could be credit or could be equity and vast majority of what we have done is equity opportunities. But we are interested in the private credit side as an equity owner. I\u2019ve said this many, many times that we\u2019re just not lenders. We are owner of those properties at the last dollar basis where we\u2019re credit stands, right. So that\u2019s how we think about it. In other words, that we\u2019re very comfortable taking back the keys if the buyer decides to -- the owner decides to do so. However, vast majority of our execution on our end is on the equity side, though we remain very interested for the right opportunities on the -- in the -- to play in the credit stack. However, I will tell you, we never loan against assets at a last dollar value at a given location for a product that we do not want to own. That is not what we do. So that\u2019s something that\u2019s very interesting for you to sort of think through. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Griffin with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : Thanks. It\u2019s Nick Joseph here with Michael. Shankh, you\u2019ve obviously talked about the robust acquisition opportunities a lot on the call and then the multi-year growth that you expect from senior sales. And so curious how you are seeing competition for both assets and loans. Is this attracting additional capital into the space and then also just some more question on the development side. Obviously, we haven\u2019t seen development pick up yet, but given the multiyear growth outlook, when would you expect that to start to pick back up? Shankh Mitra : Yeah. I think from a competition perspective, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, most of the transactions -- all of the transactions that we\u2019ve executed on, they have been privately negotiated directly with the sellers. So it\u2019s not that we\u2019re participating in auctions or anything like that and a big part of that is there is really no liquidity in the market. So we\u2019re not seeing any competition really. And then, I think, remind me again, what was your second question? Nikhil Chaudhri : Let me answer that question. That was the development question. Shankh Mitra : Yeah. Nikhil Chaudhri : We -- Nick, we put out a page eight in our slide decks that could be informative for some thinking about this question. If you think about there are some interesting things to think through. One, let\u2019s just talk about things that we all know. Cost of construction is up significantly. Cost of capital, you just think about it, a Senior Housing development loan today, if you can get one, good luck with that, even we struggling to get one, if we need one, is at 350, 400 over. So, you\u2019re talking about your debt cost-to-capital in the ninth and the 10th, right? No, we haven\u2019t seen a development pro forma that works. That\u2019s sort of a financial aspect you guys know, then obviously think through what it takes to an average, I\u2019m not talking middle of Manhattan, West LA, west side of Boston, places like that. An average Welltower location in a very wealthy micro market in East Coast, West Coast or locations like that probably takes two years to three years of redevelopment and you know that it takes a couple of years of construction after that. But what is more interesting that we have noticed is last 12 months to 18 months, that a lot of the changes that happened because of what I just described to you, in the platforms that have developed most of the Senior Housing assets, they have been dismantled. So if you look at page eight, we have added something for you to sort of ponder over is the first thing that needs to happen if people can find money and they think it\u2019s a good thing to do is to first build back the human capital side before you think about the financial capital side. The last thing I will leave you with to think about, my understanding is developers build or develop product to sell at a profit. When majority of the product traded in last three years at $0.70 on the $1, what confidence do you have that when you build a product for $1 that you will get a $1.30? I don\u2019t think the confidence would be very high on the equity side, and obviously, you\u2019ll take out financing when there is no acquisition financing, because that rollover we just described in the previous one, we think development in any meaningful way is years away. But again, as I said, we don\u2019t know the future. That\u2019s what seems logical. We\u2019ll see what the future plays out. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Mike Mueller : Yeah. I guess following up on development for the Affinity Development Program, how soon do you think we could see starts there and is there a way to size up how big the annual investment outlay could be that you could ramp up to? Shankh Mitra : Yeah. Mike, so my question, my answer to Nick\u2019s question was focused on Senior Housing development, as in what do you understand as a regular Senior Housing product. Affinity or wellness housing, these are apartments, right? These are not where care gets delivered. So that -- these are housing products. These are rental housing products. How can it be? I\u2019ll tell you, probably if you think about it, Nikhil said, average age is eight years. The portfolio size is 25. So just call it three, four starts a year, something like that would be something that I would expect. But we don\u2019t know, it depends on where the product is year-over-year. What the current pipeline is. But something like that can be expected over time. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead. John Pawlowski : Yeah. Thanks for the time. John, I was curious if you could share a current stat on average age and move-in for your traditional Senior Housing portfolio, how it compares to pre-COVID? And just any big shifts you guys are seeing in terms of the demographics coming in the door or the behavior of the current tenants again versus pre-COVID. We would love to hear? John Burkart : Yeah. Good question. And what I am seeing is a little bit longer stays. As far as for the details of that, I don\u2019t have that specific information, I can look to see if I can get it and get it back to you offline. Shankh Mitra : John, I\u2019ll just add that if you look at the coming out of the pandemic, average age and acuity went up right just coming out of the pandemic and sort of first three months, six months, something like that month where we\u2019ve seen the acuity has gone up and the average age has gone up. As we sort of things have normalized, I will say we\u2019re hearing more and more comments from our operating partners that average age is coming down and length of stay because of that acuity is coming down, but length of stay is going up because of that. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yeah. Thanks. I\u2019m impressed with your guys\u2019 occupancy gains reaccelerating. Is that mostly driven by move-ins coming in or is it kind of the dynamic that you\u2019re talking about in the last question related to move-outs as you\u2019re seeing longer length of stays? So maybe move-outs are trending a little bit lower to helping that that occupancy gain reaccelerate in 2024? Shankh Mitra : So, Mike, let me try to answer that question. I was just looking at this a couple of days ago. Interestingly, as we looked at the fourth quarter data is, obviously, we\u2019re talking about the context sort of seasonal trends that we have seen in fourth quarter, specifically looking at that, both move-ins and move-outs were better. So we have seen better move-in rates, move-in trends, and we have seen better move-out trends. So that sort of both created this unusual seasonal pattern. As you have noted, not only the quarter was kind of interesting, or frankly, confounding in a positive way from a seasonality standpoint, but what happened intra-quarter was even more confounding because as you go sort of get through more deeper and deeper into winter, we see the business slows down just seasonally and this year exactly opposite happened. So what\u2019s the reason? Just from a pure math perspective, as I said, both move-ins and move-outs are better, but obviously, we\u2019re not projecting that in the future, but we\u2019ll see how it plays out as we get through the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Please go ahead. Rich Anderson : Thanks. Good morning. So I guess a question for John and the optimizational -- optimization process that you\u2019re going through with Senior Housing. A lot of it is sort of, it\u2019s very interesting and believable, the work that you\u2019re putting into it, but yet to be sort of quantified. And I\u2019m curious if very soon or in some reasonable period of time that we might see sort of this optimization line -- a new line item on your slide, page 19, where you\u2019re bringing some of the work into real dollars and cents in terms of the effort, because right now, it\u2019s not really something you can model. And I wonder if that would be more in the way of expense savings, which I would expect or maybe there\u2019d be less frictional vacancy. So it would impact the revenue side. I\u2019m just curious if you could sort of triangulate it all, putting some quantified numbers into your effort or when that might come for all of us to look at? John Burkart : Great question. I -- as you know, I tend to avoid a lot of details, because everyone tends to copy things and it\u2019s better to execute. I think what you\u2019re seeing in our numbers, there\u2019s real numbers coming through. So it\u2019s not just discussing it. You\u2019re seeing it in the output. But I do appreciate you want to get some more specifics. You mentioned frictional vacancy. We\u2019re nowhere close to that right now. The opportunity to just literally increase vacancy without worry to -- worry or concern about frictional vacancy is there all day long and so there is really both. There\u2019s some level of opportunities on the expenses, but that really relates to productivity, because again, as I say it over and over, our focus is on improving the customer experience, not about trying to cut anything. So to the extent there\u2019s some productivity opportunities there, which the platform is focused at, in the sense of I mentioned last time, sometimes it takes hours to move someone in because of the paperwork and having a unified platform will solve for that and eliminate that wasted time, enabling our staff to spend more time with the with the customers. A lot of the opportunity, though, really is focused on the revenue side, whether it be increasing occupancy, because we\u2019re just simply out executing. Frankly, we\u2019re answering the phones and delivering that that quality customer experience that\u2019s driving occupancy or because we\u2019re changing the value proposition and the market says this is worth more. Hopefully that helps. Operator : Your next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nick Yulico : Thanks. Yeah. Maybe a question for Tim on the balance sheet. If we look at substantial amount of cash at the end of the quarter and then the outline to have another $1 billion of asset sales and guidance, it just seems like, relative to the acquisitions you\u2019ve announced so far that you\u2019re sitting in like a significant excess cash situation. So maybe you could just give us a feel for how you think about that. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any planned debt repayments or anything else we should be thinking about there? Tim McHugh : Yeah. Thanks, Nick. So you\u2019re correct on the excess debt side or excess cash side. I will highlight that, as you indicated in the past, we have $1.35 billion unsecured maturities here in the first quarter. So $450 million of which matured in January and we paid off and the remainder will be paid off in March. So that\u2019s one component of the uses and I think what you\u2019re hearing from the rest of our team today is a lot of optimism around opportunities to put cash to work. So I think the balance sheet is very well positioned for that. Operator : Your next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead. Wes Golladay : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Can you speak to the share gains you might be seeing in Senior Housing versus the local competitors that when you look at that 230 basis points of expansion this year? Shankh Mitra : Wes, I missed the first part of your question. Can you please repeat the question and get closer to your phone? Wes Golladay : Yeah. Okay. Sorry, can you hear me now okay? Shankh Mitra : Yeah. Wes Golladay : Yeah. Can you speak to the share? Yeah. Can you speak to the share gains you might be seeing in the Senior Housing versus the local competitors set, you did mention the 230 basis points this year, which is a record year? Shankh Mitra : Yeah. So, look, we have a very large portfolio, it\u2019s hard to speak in generalities, and obviously, across three countries. But if you look at all of the industry data that you will see, our portfolio has meaningfully outperformed both in rate growth, as well as occupancy growth. But what\u2019s new about that? But you can probably look at the data and others kind of decide that might get to that point. But as I said, we don\u2019t know what the future will give us. Our -- what we endeavor, what I promise to you that will put 200% effort to outperform the market and that\u2019s what we are trying to do. And so far, what I\u2019ve seen, I mean, John mentioned a stat that, if we do achieve our NOI growth guidance in the shop portfolio this year, there\u2019s no guarantee we will. But if we do, that\u2019ll be 75% compounded growth over three years. There is -- I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any precedence of that in a large broad sort of a portfolio. So we are meaningfully performing the market and that gap is widening and I think it will continue to widen. Operator : Your next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi. Good morning. Just a question on pricing trends for new customers. One, how is that evolved through the fourth quarter? Just to think about that relative to occupancy. And I guess the second part would be, you mentioned the operating leverage changes as occupancy improves and you\u2019re fully staffed. So how should we think about -- how are you thinking about the tradeoff between occupancy and price going into the rest of 2024 and into 2025? Shankh Mitra : Let me try to answer that question. So fourth quarter, if you look at, I\u2019m actually pretty very pleased with pricing trends. As you know, that we have a lot of the portfolio sort of radically turned through the year, right. So we have -- and so if you just look at the Sunrise situation that I talked about, RevPOR growth was up 6.8%. That\u2019s a very, very strong number and with that kind of occupancy growth, you don\u2019t expect that kind of numbers. But put that aside. Let\u2019s just think about what next year\u2019s look like and we passed the Jan 1. A lot of operators in Jan 1, a lot of operators\u2019 sort of have moved from Jan 1 to the February 1. I think I talked about that two years ago. Just not -- just the after holidays sort of moved a little bit out of that. So just generally speaking, talk about the half of the portfolio that sort of rolling in the Q1 specifically rather than just talking Jan 1, I would say existing customer rent increases has been relatively in the same ballpark of last year, but probably 100 basis points to 150 basis points lower. This generally feels right around that level. So, if it was 10 last year, it\u2019s 9 this year, something like that. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t hold me specific. Some operators have done more than 10 last year. I\u2019m saying generally speaking, in that range of probably 100 basis points, 150 basis points lower. And we will see what the rest of the portfolio does as we go through the year. There\u2019s also remember RevPOR is not just a function of ECRI, our existing customer rent increases, but it\u2019s also a function of sort of market rent, right? What that your mark-to-market and we will see, we don\u2019t know? Usually speaking, market rent are lower in Q1 and sort of goes up from the summer months and we\u2019ll see how this all plays out. There\u2019s a math aside. We feel that the second part of your question, which is a brilliant question, sort of thinking about in this kind of occupancy, just call it mid-80s occupancy. What is that sort of efficient frontier pricing versus occupancy? That question is hard to answer on a conference call, but I will tell you what you are going after is a very important one, because how operating leverage, because of operating leverage, how your incremental margins work. While it is in the late 70s, early 80s, it is obvious that you should go after the rate, not the occupancy, that may not be true in the mid-80s where your optimized level could be some occupancy, some rates. We\u2019ll see how this plays out, but we are -- we think it\u2019s our guests as we sit here today and nothing but a guest that will be largely in the same ballpark of close to double-digit revenue growth that we have seen last year. Operator : Your final question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Hey. I just want to sort of close the thought on the occupancy just because of sequential sort of improvement, as well as the guidance acceleration. Coming out of the different way, is this -- like how much of this should we think of as an industry wide phenomenon where we should expect other operators to see occupancy accelerate versus sort of John\u2019s operating platform, creating that Alpha is sort of part one. Part two would be when you think about that occupancy recovery slide in your deck, are we at the point where we should start thinking about 91% as the new target versus for the 88%, because based on the guidance, you\u2019re going to be at 85% at the end of the year. Just trying to get a sense of how much conviction and growing conviction you have and getting back to that peak occupancy level? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Well, let me try to answer that question. The second part is an easier one. If all we do is we end up at 91% occupancy, which is sort of 2015 achieved, then we frankly speaking, we didn\u2019t add a lot of value. Because if you think about it, I don\u2019t know, just pick a number, two years, three years, whatever your number of years is, demand-supply, I think, you understand, starts to get materially better starting 2025, 2026, right, sort of. And the delivery schedule, if you look at it, you know what the stocks are, which is not much, right? You can see the demand-supply imbalance gets really interesting next year and the year after, right? So at least we can say that, because we don\u2019t know, if there\u2019s other people that without our knowledge is building. It\u2019s unlikely, but we don\u2019t know. But at least we can sort of see next two years with a reasonable clarity and we don\u2019t believe that friction vacancy of this business is 9%, right? John is that it? John Burkart : It\u2019s absolutely not. It\u2019s a financial calculation and it is not 9%. It is substantially less. So that that\u2019s just not an option. Shankh Mitra : So do we believe that we\u2019ll end up at 91%? I\u2019ll be very disappointed if that\u2019s the case, but we shall see what the market gives us. What was the first part of your question, Ron, that I missed? Ronald Kamdem : Sure. It was just so we expect every operator to see occupancy reaccelerate 2024\u2026 Shankh Mitra : Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Ronald Kamdem : \u2026 or what are you guys doing that\u2019s different? Shankh Mitra : Yeah. So, look, I can\u2019t speak for others, right, clearly, right? What do I know about others? My promise to you and our fellow shareholders have always been that we will put 100% effort to outperform the market. So far, we have done it, right? I don\u2019t think Q4 numbers will be much different and I think our hope will be that we will continue to do so. My confidence in our ability to outperform the average of the industry is widening. I think that gap is widening and my confidence is increasing. But we still have to -- this is February 14th. We have to see what the year gives us. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. This will conclude the Welltower fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Thank you all for joining us today. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt McQueen, General Counsel. You may begin. Matthew McQueen : Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company's filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'll review first quarter business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on the operational performance of our senior housing and outpatient medical portfolios. Nikhil will give you an update on the investment landscape. And Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and guidance update. I'm very pleased with the strong start to the year as we delivered nearly 19% year-over-year growth in FFO per share with contributions from all parts of our businesses, but I remain particularly excited about our senior housing business, which continues to surpass our expectations. Despite continued uncertainty with respect to the direction of the economy and turbulence across many sectors within commercial real estate,  the demand supply backdrop for senior housing gets better with each passing day. We, along with our operating partners are proud yet humbled to provide an important solution for the rapidly growing number of seniors who make the choice to leave in a curated and purpose build environment. And while this demographic driven end market demand continues to strengthen, the new construction remains extraordinarily difficult, pushing off any impact of new supply many years into the future. In terms of our Q1 results, we posted another quarter of double-digit same-store revenue growth coming in 10.3%, driven by strong occupancy and rate growth. While Q1 is usually a seasonally weaker period than Q4, same-store occupancy grew 340 basis points year-over-year basis, which represented an improvement from Q4. This is the strongest growth we have seen in our history other than Q1 of 2022, when the comp year was a negative number as we lost occupancy in Q1 of 2021 due to COVID. We also saw outperformance on the rate side. Reported same-store RevPOR or unit revenue growth of 4.8% was dragged down by the leap year impact of an additional day in February, However, adjusting for this extra day, RevPOR growth remained strong at 5.6%. Overall, same-store expenses were up 5.7%, and unit expense or ExpPOR was up 0.4% driven by same-store compensation expenses up 5.4% or just 0.1% on an occupied room basis. Reported ExpPOR was understated because of the leap year impact and otherwise would be up 0.9%. Regardless, we are very pleased with the underlying trends as unit revenue growth far outpaced unit expense growth resulting in another quarter of significant margin expansion. And this combination of strong revenue and moderating expense drove same-store net operating income growth of 25.5% marking  of the strongest quarter in our history. This growth was broad-based with all 3 regions posting year-over-year same-store NOI growth in excess of 20% with growth in the U.K. reaching nearly 50%. From a product standpoint, our independent living and wellness housing portfolios delivered another quarter of extraordinary growth. but our assisted living continued a streak of strong outperformance. And as for our non-same-store pool, we're even more pleased with the performance of these assets as numerous properties we transitioned within past year have seen a strong improvement in performance, while some recent acquisitions have also outperformed. We continue to mine for opportunities within our own portfolios to effectuate farther triple-net to RIDEA conversion or of operator transition in an effort to enhance the resident and employee experience, where we believe financial performance will eventually follow. We are confident that this informational feedback loop created through this continual focus on employee and customer is a long-term driver of lower risk and superior operational returns. We don't always get the community and the manager combination right in the first go, but it is our responsibility to try again. Status quo is not an option for us. Speaking of conversions, I'm pleased to inform you that we are in process of converting 8 additional well-located communities from triple-net to RIDEA. Despite short-term drag, we believe this action will be significantly additive to our full cycle stabilized earnings as we have demonstrated in our recent transaction with Legend. These capital-light transactions and others similarly made in 2023 will create significant growth for us in '25 and beyond. Speaking of transactions, the capital markets backdrop remains very conducive to deploying capital. Since the beginning of the year, we have closed or under contract to close $2.8 billion of investments across 23 separate transactions, including $1.1 billion, which we spoke to in February, mostly made up of the Affinity transaction. These investments are predominantly with our repeat counterparties or existing operators. As excited as we are about this record level of activity in just first 4 months of the year, we remain incredibly busy parsing through granular opportunities in both the U.S. as well as the U.K. Our near-term capital deployment pipeline remains robust, highly visible, actionable and squarely within our circle of confidence where we can bet with the house odds rather than the gamblers' odds. As rates and credit space continue to march higher, our telephones are ringing off the hook as we are requested to provide solutions to institutions, families, operators and other sellers. 2024 will be a very active year for us. While I wrote extensively about our apathy towards entity-level M&A transactions in our -- in my annual letter, our enthusiasm remains unbridled for tuck-in acquisitions one asset at a time, while we can invest at an attractive basis with operational upside and irreplicable uplift from Welltower's operating platform. As we have said in the past, our goal is to achieve significant regional density seeking to grow deep in our market, not broad. And with the help of our data science platform Alpha, we're able to identify one asset at a time, which not only have the strongest growth prospects but also the strongest fit to our portfolio. Though we occasionally come across sellers who are disconnected from asset value as they appear to be living in a time capsule of yesterday's interest environment are simply hoping that we'll be back there soon. Many more pragmatic and smart institutions and families realize that perhaps hope is not a strategy, especially in face of a looming wall of debt maturity for the industry and [ data ] financing options. We continue to provide solutions to counterparties who want a sophisticated and reliable partner who shows up at the closing table without a fail with cash and operating partners. We at Welltower are in a handshake business and will remain so. Our stellar reputation is much more valuable to us than a few basis points here and there that we may leave on the table. After all, our NorthStar remains long-term compounding of par share value of our existing shareholders not to maximize the deal [ for  ]a quarter. In the end, time is the friend of wonderful companies that compound and the enemy of the mediocre. With that, I'll pass it over to John. John? John Burkart : Thank you, Shankh.. Momentum that continues to build in our business through 2023 has carried into the early part of this year, as reflected by our strong first quarter results. Our total portfolio generated 12.9% same-store NOI growth over the prior year's quarter, once again, led by the senior housing operating business. First, I'll comment on our outpatient medical portfolio, which remains very stable, producing year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 2% for the first quarter of 2024. Leasing activity remains healthy, and our retention rate once again exceeded 90% leading to consistent and industry-leading same-store occupancy of nearly 95%. The full year same-store NOI guidance is unchanged between 2% and 3%. As for the senior housing operating portfolio, our results remain impressive. The 25.5% first quarter year-over-year same-store NOI increase represents the sixth consecutive quarter, in which growth has exceeded 20%. Our top line growth came in at 10.3%, driven by strong occupancy growth of 340 basis points and strong rate growth of 480 basis points. All 3 of our regions continue to show favorable same-store revenue growth, starting with Canada at 9.1%, and the U.S. and the U.K. growing at 10.1% and 14.8%, respectively. Additionally, expense growth continues to moderate, up 5.7% year-over-year with the broader inflationary pressures continuing to abate. In terms of labor-related trends, we've not only seen broader macro pressures continue to ease, but also our various property and portfolio level initiatives have been paying off. For example, by creating greater regional density within our senior housing portfolio, employees are able to fill open shifts at other regional properties, reducing the usage of agency labor and improving the overall customer experience. Regional densification also creates more opportunities for career progression and lower turnover as employees can take increasing levels of responsibility at different properties managed by the same operator in the same region. And equally important, through the build-out of our operating platform, we're beginning to create efficiencies, which will allow for more time to be set on resident care, improving the customer experience, reducing the administrative burden and related stress on site employees. Shifting back to the quarter, we reported 320 basis points year-over-year improvement in margins as unit revenue growth continues to solidly outpace unit expense growth. While NOI margins are below pre-COVID levels, the significant operating leverage inherent in our business and benefits of our operating platform should allow for multiple years of further margin expansion ahead. This year is still young, with peak leasing season ahead of us, but we remain encouraged by the start of this year. Ultimately, our Q1 numbers speak to the great work that the entire team is doing. We are relentlessly focused on improving the customer experience and employee experience and we'll continue to pursue operational excellence. Thank you, Team Welltower, including our operators, WellTower employees and vendors. I'll now turn the call over to Nikhil. Nikhil Chaudhri : Thanks, John. Before speaking to our recent investment activity, I wanted to share some high-level market observations. As we have indicated before, we are in a unique environment in which business fundamentals are very strong, and at the same time, the opportunity to deploy capital remains extremely compelling. In large part, this backdrop is a function of the challenged seniors housing debt, which sits on the balance sheet of the largest lenders in the space. While we have previously spoken about the $19 billion of seniors housing debt maturing this year and next, a deeper look into the performance of these loans is helpful. A great case study is Fannie Mae's senior housing debt book, with a total outstanding principal balance of $16 billion. It's worth noting that borrowers typically seek out agency financing upon stabilization. And so a vast majority of these loans are for assets that were previously stabilized at some point. Of these $16 billion of loans, $5.9 billion are subject to floating rates. But despite that, 44% or $7 billion of Fannie senior housing book is considered criticized, suggesting loans with high risk of default. In addition, over $1.1 billion of loans are more than 60 days past due. While the agencies are the lender of choice for stabilized product, borrowers typically seek out banks for riskier development and lease-up bridge loans. Unlike agency loans, these loans are almost always based on floating rates and have shorter durations. While granular information is hard to find on the status of these loans on bank balance sheet, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that at least a similar percentage or almost 50% of the $20 billion plus senior housing loans on bank balance sheets are showing similar distress. In fact, as I listened to first quarter earnings call, several regional banks that have historically been among the most active in the seniors housing space, I heard a consistent theme of concerns about their sector exposure and the desire to reduce it. This is not surprising given the poor performance of these loans over the last 5 years. Given the staggering level of maturing and underperforming loans, current borrowers are left with tough choices. On one side, borrowers can capitulate and accept the ultimate downside of losing a significant portion or perhaps even all of their equity. On the other side, for those with staying power and the right set of incentives to continue to come out of pocket for incremental capital to service and rightsize the debt load with the hope that some combination of continued improvement in asset level performance and a reversal in the trajectory of interest rates will allow them to achieve a meaningfully better exit value over time. Perhaps unsurprisingly, with inflation showing signs of reacceleration over the last few prints and interest rates rising, the hope trade for a quick reversal in the trajectory of interest rates is dwindling and counterparties are coming back to us in droves with the hope of achieving an outcome somewhere in between the 2 extremes I just highlighted. Given our reputation of being solutions-oriented and creative dealmakers that honor our original price through the course of the transaction, we continue to be the counterparty of choice for motivated sellers, seeking surety of execution and continue to engage with repeat sellers on follow-on transactions. During the first quarter, we completed gross investments of $449 million, comprising $241 million of development funding and acquisitions and loan funding of $208 million, comprised solely of seniors and wellness housing property types. We acquired 3 senior housing communities with an average age of 8 years for $158,000 per unit. We also received repayments of $36 million across 3 outstanding loans over the course of the quarter. In addition to the transactions closed in the first quarter, we are currently under contract or have closed on $2.6 billion of gross investments across 15 different transactions spanning 146 properties across the U.S., U.K. and Canada. These transactions have a median value of $37 million. As Shankh mentioned earlier, we are sticking to our mantra of building regional density through focused and granular transactions, and continue to grow with operators that are producing strong results for us in these markets. Our recent activity includes incremental new business with our partners at Oakmont, Cogir, Sagora, Discovery, Liberty, LCB and Healthcare Ireland to name a few. I'll end by extending a warm and heartfelt thank you to our best in business investment team located across our offices in Dallas, L.A., London, New York, Toledo and Toronto. We have been fortunate to be able to hire, train and retain the brightest young minds from leading universities across the country year in and year out, while many other competitors eliminated or drastically reduced their teams during COVID. We had the foresight to plan the seeds of talent many years ago and are now able to enjoy the fruits from the trees that has since grown. While on one hand, the work at Welltower is incredibly challenging, fast pace and perhaps never ending. On the other hand, I believe that the training, opportunity, autonomy and accelerated career growth are unparalleled. The dedication, thoughtfulness and integrity exhibited by the professionals on our team is all inspiring. I couldn't be more proud of our team or more excited about the opportunity ahead of us. I'll now hand the call over to Tim to walk through our financial results. Tim McHugh : Thank you, Nikhil. My comments today will focus on our first quarter results. The performance of our total investment segments, our capital activity, a balance sheet and liquidity update, and finally, an update to our full year 2024 outlook. Welltower reported first quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.22 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $1.01 per diluted share, representing 18.8% year-over-year growth. We also reported total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 12.9% year-over-year. Now turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage and occupancy stats were reported a quarter in arrears. So these statistics reflect the trailing 12 months ending 12/31, 2023. In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 3.8% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was 1.02x, which marks the first time this coverage has moved above 1x since the pandemic began impacting the segment. Next, same-store NOI and our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 3.1% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage is 1.23x. Staying with the long-term post-acute portfolio, the Integra Healthcare JV entered our same-store pool and coverage metrics this quarter. As a reminder, the 147 properties were put into a master lease in 4Q 2022 and the individual assets will then transition to local and regional operators over the following 5 quarters. The entire master lease enters the same-store pool this quarter while the individual assets will enter the rent coverage metrics as they complete 5 quarters of operations under their respective operators. In Q1, 95 of the 147 assets entered our coverage metrics with trailing 12-month EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage of 1.58x and 1.13x, respectively. As we've noted on previous calls, the Integra portfolio experienced continuous upward trend in cash flow over last year, as reflected in the trailing 3-month EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverages for these 95 assets at 2.23x and 1.74x, respectively. As we move through the year, the rolling forward of last year's positive operating recovery as well as the addition of the remaining transition Integra assets into coverage pool, should lead to a continual upward trend in our coverage metrics throughout 2024. Turning to capital activity. As Nikhil just walked us through, we have $2.8 billion of closed or announced investments year-to-date, inclusive of the Affinity transaction announced last quarter. In the quarter, we continue to fund investment activity via equity issuance, raising $2.4 billion of gross proceeds at an average price of $91.22 per share. This allowed us to fund investment activity, along with the extinguishment of approximately $1.5 billion of debt in the quarter, including $1.35 billion of senior unsecured notes and ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash and restricted cash on the balance sheet. Staying with the balance sheet. On the third anniversary of our COVID leverage maxing out in the mid-7s ex-COVID relief funds in the first quarter of 2021, [ rented ] this quarter at 4.03x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. And we expect to end the year at a target leverage of approximately 4.5x net debt to EBITDA implied by last night's full year guidance update. Consistent with past commentary on the balance sheet, I want to underscore that while our key credit metrics are at historical levels, over half of our NOI is represented by senior housing operating portfolio, which currently sits at just 82.5% occupancy, with NOI still well below pre-COVID levels. As NOI recovers back to pre-pandemic levels, the meaningful recovery in cash flow is expected to drive debt-to-EBITDA below 4x from projected year-end 2024 levels, further enhancing our financial position and access to capital. Lastly, as I move on to last night's update to our full year 2024 guidance, I want to remind you that we have not include any investment activity in our outlook beyond the $2.8 billion to date that has been closed or publicly announced. Last night, we updated our full year 2024 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to $1.48 to $1.61 per diluted share. And normalized FFO of $4.02 to $4.15 per diluted share or $4.085 at the midpoint. The incremental increase of $0.065 from prior normalized FFO guidance per share at the midpoint, is composed of $0.03 from an improved NOI outlook in our senior housing operating portfolio and $0.055 from accretive investments and financing activities, offset partially by $0.01 from higher G&A expectations and $0.01 of near-term drag due to a triple-net [ through day ] conversion. Underlying this increased FFO guidance is an increase in estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth to 9% to 12%, driven by subsegment growth of outpatient medical, 2% to 3%; long-term post-acute, 2% to 3%; senior housing triple-net, 2.5% to 4%. And finally, senior housing operating growth of 17% to 22%. The midpoint of which is driven by revenue growth of approximately 9.2%, made up of RevPOR growth of approximately 5.25% and year-over-year occupancy growth of 290 basis points and total expense growth of approximately 6%. And with that, I will hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim. While we are very pleased with our execution thus far in the year, we're on the cusp of all important summer leasing season. So let's see what the market gives us. And while we are proud of our recent operating results we have reported, it's important to recognize that it's not by happenstance. This is not a commodity business with a narrow range of outcomes. Our results are a function of capital allocation and portfolio management decisions of yesterday. To paraphrase buffet, someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago. Similarly, capital allocation decisions of today will drive operating performance tomorrow. So even after nearly $15 billion of capital that we have deployed since the depth of COVID and hundreds of communities undergoing operator transition, we still have our hands full to optimize location, product, price point and operators on the asset side of the balance sheet. On the liability side, under Tim's leadership, we're absolutely hitting it out of the park. A sharp improvement in cash flow, coupled with our recent capital raising efforts, has driven a net debt to adjusted EBITDA down to 4x, which represents the lowest level in our recorded history. In the very short term, we maintained significant dry powder with over $6 billion of total near-term liquidity to pursue attractive capital deployment opportunities and fund other near-term obligations. In the medium term, we have built significant debt capacity to take advantage of when we eventually get to the other side of the Fed cycle and still maintain an extremely strong balance sheet. Said another way, we don't believe that one's balance sheet should be viewed as an object of vanity, but instead as a countercyclical tool to prudently tap into to drive par share growth. Our balance sheet was one of the 5 pillars of growth, which I articulated during our last call. And while I won't repeat all the 5 of those pillars today, I'll just reiterate that our confidence in delivering outsized levels of our share growth to our existing shareholders remain as strong as ever. And while we are fortunate to have a strong multi-decade tailwind at our back, just note that we will not settle for the beta of the business, and instead, we are committed to creating significant Alpha again for our existing shareholders with a years of compounding growth ahead of us. We appreciate your support. With that, I'll open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Ronald Kamdem : Great. Just starting with the SHOP guidance range -- guidance rate almost 20%. Looking at the assumptions, it looks like the occupancy and RevPOR assumptions haven't really changed, and it was really sort of same-store expense driven. So I was just wondering if you could comment on some conservatism is baked into that? And any early indication in the peak leasing season? Shankh Mitra : Ron, as we have indicated, this is too early in the year. Just as you know, our annual results will be pretty much defined by what the summer leasing season gives us. You know we have -- though while we're pleased with what we have seen in the year, there's this healthy level of paranoia in our team. We don't know what the market will give us. We'll report to you. Our promise to you remains that we'll get more than our fair share of the market, but we need to see what the market gives us, and we'll update you in 90 days, and we'll see where we land. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra of Mizuho. Vikram Malhotra : Maybe, Shankh and Tim, just -- can you just talk about perhaps your outlook for underlying FAD growth. FFO was strong, but FAD growth was even stronger in the quarter. Just how do you see FAD trending? And if you can dovetail that into the dividend, your coverage is very, very healthy. So I'm just wondering how do you use those free cash flow proceeds or perhaps even grow the dividend. Tim McHugh : Yes, Vikram. On the FAD side, we've had an ongoing conversation around this just FAD growth. And we continue to focus on the long term. On the CapEx side, growing an internal or internalizing our capital management team and growing that team has been a main initiative over the last 1.5 years. And so as we've done that, we've continued to identify value-add projects, it's really attractive basically returns. And so CapEx, probably a bit elevated here from a long-term run rate. But is helping drive cash flow alongside of it. And as long as we continue to see those opportunities, we'll continue to put capital to work. On the dividend part of the question, I'll start, and I'll let Shankh add anything. But when we cut the dividend at start a COVID, we referenced cash flow as being the main driver of our dividend policy. And so that hasn't changed. And so as we sit here today, not only is cash flow recovered pretty meaningfully from the COVID lows. So too is our confidence around the ongoing recovery in senior housing, and that was reflected with our updated guidance last night. So consistent with past commentary on the topic and our current financial position, you should expect that our current dividend policy is something we're actively discussing with our Board of Directors. Shankh Mitra : I have nothing to add to that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico of Scotiabank. Nicholas Yulico : Just a 2-parter here on the acquisitions. In terms of the $2.6 billion, closed under contract. Can you give us a feel for the first year stabilized yield -- sorry, first year yield and then ultimate stabilized yield expectation. And then -- is any of the distress in the market or the higher interest rates pushing up yields on new investments? And then just in terms of the funding, so I just want to be clear. It seems like you've already sort of raised the equity to fund that pipeline. But going forward, how should we think about an equity versus debt mix for additional investments since you do seem under-leveraged right now? Tim McHugh : Nick, I'll take the first part. So on the $2.6 billion, it's 100% senior housing and wellness housing. And if you look at the spot capital markets environment today is very similar to what it did in the fourth quarter as interest rates had run up, so we'll provide more disclosure next quarter as these transactions have closed, but you can expect the return profile to look very similar, both in terms of going in and stabilized yield as what we had in the fourth quarter. Shankh Mitra : Yes. Nick, you are correct that we have raised capital to close, obviously, all the transactions. I want to make sure that you understand that, that $2.8 billion that we spoke of is not our pipeline, it's the deals that have closed or under contract to close. Our pipeline is beyond that, and it remains a very robust pipeline. That we think are very near-term actionable, we'll see where we end up. But that's sort of our view. Speaking of -- I absolutely subscribe to your view that we remain unleveraged.  Our goal is to maximize our stabilized our full cycle earnings. And as I mentioned that you should fully expect us to use the balance sheet liability side of our balance sheet to drive significant additional part share growth on the other side of the Fed cycle. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Austin Wurschmidt : With respect to senior housing operators that have changed their strategy by pushing back the annual rent increases into the earlier part of the key selling season, I guess, how does that trend appear to be playing out so far from a retention perspective? And would you expect that benefit to potentially flow through to new lease rate growth? John Burkart : Yes. So as it relates to the increases that are going out, there really hasn't been pushback. People understand what's going on in the cost side of the business. They appreciate the value proposition and so that has been going very smoothly. As it relates to market rents, again, we're seeing robust demand out there. So it's -- the 2 are related in the sense of -- obviously, the market drives the overall economics, but the -- it's not that renewals drive the market. The market drives the renewals at some level, and the market is strong. Supply-demand fundamentals work very well and the value proposition is there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes of Raymond James. Jonathan Hughes : On the increased expected headcount spending this year, can you talk about the investments being made in the analytics and/or operations team and the scaling potential to address the capital deployment opportunities? John Burkart : Yes. As it relates to the ops team, we are finding tremendous opportunities to build out that team and do things more effectively more efficiently than are currently being done. That's simply a surprise that we can bring operational excellence at our size. And so we continue to lean into that. We're finding that really throughout each of the areas that I'm involved in as it relates to investments [indiscernible]. Nikhil Chaudhri : Yes. I think, Jonathan, if you think about the sheer number of transactions that we do, but beyond that, everything we look at we can humanly impossible to do that without having incredible tools, right? So that's what -- and you've seen a lot of this, but the tools and the capabilities on our analytics team are the only reason what we do. And so they are an integral part of every step of the investment process from a pretty screen to shift through hundreds of buildings to them be able to predict the stabilized NOI for each building under different operators and find the right operator for those buildings. It's integral to what we're doing. So all the investments that we've made are paying off in space. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria of BMO Capital Markets. Juan Sanabria : I just wanted to ask around the senior housing portfolio that non-same-store pool that Shankh mentioned was doing well. Just curious how many of those -- I think it's nearly 150 assets are in the transitions bucket, not in same-store, will be added over the course of the year. And how are those faring relative to the same-store pool? And should we expect those to be additive to growth as those are folded into same-store? Shankh Mitra : One, the -- a lot of these early transitions will eventually come into after 5 quarters. So depending on when they were done, they will come towards the end of the year. you should expect strong growth from them, whether they will be additive or not, it's too early to say. Probably, there will be similar growth or they will add to the growth. But it depends also -- remember, they're coming up with strong overlapping strong quarters behind them as well. What was the other part of your question, Juan that I missed? Juan Sanabria : That was essentially it. Tim McHugh : Juan, just on the kind of numbers there, the 159. So the Canadian assets that have transitioned, there's about 62 of those in our transition portfolio. Those transition in the fourth quarter. Those will be -- those will come back in '25, the majority of the rest of them come into the pool of '24. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin of Citi. Nicholas Joseph : It's Nick here with Michael. You touched on what's happening on the bank side and on the lending side, but also on kind of the long-term drivers and the supply-demand imbalance. So I guess, are you seeing more capital that you're competing with for some of these deals, get more interest in the space? And I guess on the flip side, just on development, obviously, we haven't seen starts bounce back, but are you starting to see anything from a planning stage or any green shoots of supply starting to at least be contemplated? Nikhil Chaudhri : Yes. Nick, I think the answer to both of those questions is a simple, no. We haven't seen any new capital come into the business. And there's really not much capital out there that is not reliant on the debt market. And the debt markets are just completely [ open ], and then we expect them to continue to be focused for the foreseeable future. And that obviously plays into the development cycle as well. So we've actually seen the opposite rather than folks take on new predevelopment and new potential projects, folks are giving us on products that they're previously pursuing, disbanding teams and all of that. So to answer your questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America. Joshua Dennerlein : John, I wanted to follow up on a comment you made on the operating platform and how a big part of the strategy is to create efficiencies to reduce the admin burden and put more time into care. I was hoping you could elaborate on where you are in building out this capability. And just in general, just provide more color on this aspect of the operating platform. John Burkart : Yes, absolutely. I would rather quite honestly about it, we're getting very close. There's not a lot of detailed updates to give other than we're right on plan right now. As it relates to the types of savings we expect and that we're identifying pretty substantial when you look at how a person starts as a prospect and move through the process ultimately into the community reducing the paperwork pretty dramatically, reducing the repetition of input of information because the system is a singular unified system. And so all of that reduces errors. It reduces wasted admin time and really enable senior people like the nursing teams, like the executive directors and others and sales teams to really focus on their job and leverage technology to drive value there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll of RBC Capital Markets. Michael Carroll : I guess, John, sticking with you, can you provide some color on the performance of the Cogir, PLR portfolio in Canada? I mean how has that relationship worked so far? And are there plans or discussions to kind of create new PLR relationships to kind of build off of the structure in different parts of the market? John Burkart : Yes, I'll start with the broader question as far as plans for broader PLR, our focus is and always has been to drive value from a customer employee perspective and, of course, from a shareholder perspective. So it's not the process to say, let's create, a bunch of those types of partnerships. The objective is to drive value. In this case, the value is substantial. Our partner, Cogir and my partner, Frederick, are fantastic to work with. That is doing very, very well. The assets have embraced Cogir -- the teams have embraced Cogir and Cogir management -- and we're very satisfied and appreciative to all the work that is being done there. Our expectations of that portfolio will perform fantastically this year. Of course, this transition has occurred during the quiet period. So it's not a lot of activity as it relates to leasing. It's just starting at this point in time up in Canada. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Kammert of Evercore. James Kammert : It looks like there's some real standouts on the senior housing side among your larger operators in terms of in-place NOI contributions. I mean, Sunrise was up 30% sequentially, Oakmont 11%, StoryPoint 19%, et cetera. And John, you speak to sort of the benefits of densification and regional operators, was such gains in the NOI really driven more by that, do you think in best practices? Or was this more of a cyclical episodic each portfolio in terms of NOI advances traditional occupancy, et cetera gains? Shankh Mitra : We're not going to give on specific operator-level performance on this call, which we never do. I'm not going to start that today. We'll tell you that it was a very broad-based outperformance from all of our operators, across 3 regions. And obviously, that's not -- as I said, is a happenstance, right? Some of the operating partners, you mentioned have done terrifically well for us over a long period of time, and that continues. But this is a very deliberate strategy that we put together years ago to go deep and not go broad. And that's as we continue to double down on this strategy.  And John gave several examples of that, that plays out, whether that's on the employee retention side, their long-term career and others. And that's also true, we can give you several examples how that plays out, obviously, on the revenue side where customers have different options within a close proximity to each other, right? So at the end of the day, that's what we are trying to do. We believe, as many of us mentioned on the call, that great customer and employee experience eventually drive great financial results. And we continue to double down on the simple strategy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller of JPMorgan. Michael Mueller : Tim, a quick question. Was there a change in the same-store operating expense guidance for show? Because it looks like your same-store revenue drivers didn't change, but the NOI growth expectation increased? Tim McHugh : Yes. Thanks, Mike. It did. So our expense -- our overall expense that were underlying our initial budget were 6.5%. So our revised outlook today moving down to 6% and the change 50 basis points lower. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pawlowski of Green Street. John Pawlowski : Nikhil, when your team's underwriting new skilled nursing investments, can you give me a sense for kind of a range of EBITDA reductions you're potentially contemplating in your underwriting for staff mandates [indiscernible]. Nikhil Chaudhri : Yes. I think, John, in the skilled business, we are essentially structured credit, short-duration providers of capital. And we're super focused on basis and [indiscernible] beyond that. And so at the basis we play out, it doesn't really have a meaningful impact just given the downside protection we have. I think this question is probably a better question for folks that play [indiscernible]. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson of Wedbush Securities. Richard Anderson : Great quarter. It keeps getting better and better. Shankh, used the word were abundant amount of paranoia in the company, which is good to hear. And I want to sort of tackle that side. I'm sure that you focus not only on the opportunities, which you're clearly doing but also on the potential risks that can materialize. And think of a company like Prologis obviously, like you and industry thought leader, but down 21% this year and trading near its 2-year low. How does Welltower anticipate potential pitfalls that may materialize. Some of the things that you're thinking about to manage around today, to your point, about deploying capital and making sure that it produces the end results that you're envisioning. I'm thinking about 25% same-store NOI growth and how someone might say why is Wall Street getting rich at the expense of seniors? Is there a rent control conversation potentially out there? I'm just wondering some of the things that frame your paranoia and how you might respond to that? Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Rich. I said a healthy amount of paranoia and we do, and we're constantly thinking -- constantly looking over a shoulder to think what can go wrong. Now let's talk about numbers. The law of numbers are very unforgiving, right? When your NOI goes down by 50%, $100 become $50, you need to go up 100% to go back to just where you started, right? So while 25% NOI growth is impressive, let's just be honest, like I think I said this in an industry conference a few months ago that we haven't made any money over the last 10 years as an industry. So while year-over-year numbers are impressive. We got to understand the basic numbers. Just to go back to where we started as an industry. And if NOI was -- let's just say it was down 50%, somewhere down 40%, but somewhere on cut in half, and that's what will happen if you lose 20 points of occupancy you need to just go back 100% to go back to a high watermark.  So if you put that in perspective, you realize that, obviously, the profitability of the industry remains pretty challenging. And you can see that in the margins. Margins remain significantly below where pre-COVID and frankly speaking, the peak of this business was not pre-COVID, was peak of the business was 2015 in last, call it, 1.5 decades and we're not even close to that. So all these points that you're raising, which are very good points are very interrelated, right? If we can't get to a basic level of margins, that will obviously be driven by basic level of rates and occupancy, then investments, particularly new investment going back to Nick's question on development doesn't make any sense. You need to attract capital to invest in the existing community doesn't make any sense, right? So all of these things are very interrelated. We're trying to do the best we can to provide a great level of service to our communities, our residents, our employees. And we also have to put in perspective like a lot of other types of operational real estate apartment stores, single-family rentals, which in the heydays have raised rents 20%,  25-plus percent our rent growth has been good, but it has never been sort of a double-digit plus, right? So it's always sort of hovered around 8%, 9%. That's purely driven by demand supply on one side as well as obviously an escalating cost environment. So we feel good about it. We will see where we go from here as we are talking about this kind of rate growth. Also, I would like you to remember that just on a same employee basis, rates in the sort of cost of employees are up 30%, 40% in the last 5 years, right? So all of these things come into play. We're always looking over our shareholder. You can see how we're managing our balance sheet. Prologis is a terrific company. It will continue to be a terrific company regardless whether the stock is down in a given year or not. They've created a massive amount of value over the years. Stock goes up and down. That's not as managed as we control. Our responsibility is to manage the business and look for opportunities to create long-term value. Short term -- okay. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay of Baird. Wesley Golladay : For that $19 billion opportunity over the next 2 years, is that a domestic opportunity only? And can you highlight what you're seeing in the U.K. and Canada? Shankh Mitra : Yes, that is a domestic number we're talking about. We are seeing similar situations in our international markets. And one of them where particularly that market is challenged is U.K. and we're seeing significant opportunities in the U.K. And I think I mentioned that. And I think you will see us many granular transactions in U.K. this year to take advantage of that. Lack of credit, real estate -- health care real estate credit in U.K. If it is possible to be worse than the U.S., which is very hard today, it's probably U.K. market, debt market is worse than that of U.K. today. I mean U.K. debt market is worse than that of U.S. today. Operator : With no further questions, that concludes today's Q&A session. We thank you for your attendance.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Welltower's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Matt McQueen, General Counsel. You may begin. Matthew McQueen : Thank you and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on a reasonable assumption, the company can give no assurances that the projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Shankh for his remarks. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I will review first quarter business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John will provide an update on operational performance for our Senior Housing and Medical office portfolios. Nikhil will give you an update on investment landscape and Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and guidance updates. We're very pleased to report another quarter of significant bottom line growth with normalized FFO per share up 17% year-over-year or over 19% adjusted for prior year subsidies. Quarter was once again led by our Senior Housing portfolio, but with notable contributions from all other areas of the business, including investments. Last night we announced another $1 billion of acquisitions under contract since our last update at NEREIT Conference in June, bringing our acquisition activity to approximately $5 billion year-to-date. There continues to be no dearth of capital deployment opportunities in front of us at extraordinarily attractive economics, which I'll get into shortly. Ultimately, we're pleased to once again be able to raise our full year FFO per share guidance as we continue to capitalize on the unprecedented internal and external growth opportunity in Senior Housing. Before John goes into details, I wanted to first provide some high-level thoughts on the Senior Housing business and why we remain as optimistic as ever about its future prospects. RevPOR: RevPOR: While margin remains well below pre-COVID levels, I would note that we have made significant progress since hitting the trough levels of profitability in 2021, with farther upside remaining through the scaling benefits achieved through higher occupancy aka operating leverage and as the operating platform begins to bear fruit. Overall, while we are pleased with the results we achieved this quarter, what we are much more excited about is the fundamental backdrop is for us to dramatically improve as we look forward to 25 and beyond. It starts with end market demand. Baby boomers are just entering their eighties and pickup in demand, which we have recently witnessed, will only intensify going forward. Not only is the 80 plus population growing at a fastest clip in decades, but what's even more compelling is the growth of this group of seniors will accelerate to 5% to 7% per annum as we close out the decade, driving demand even higher and there is plummeting new supply. The second quarter construction starts were once again negligible, falling well below trough levels you've seen even during GFC. It remains extraordinarily challenging to secure construction financing as regional banks that served as the most prolific lender to the sector in previous cycles has effectively shut down all activity. And despite the attractive growth prospect of our industry, most developers have thrown in the towel due to a lack of development economics. We think this will continue as returns, or should I say lack thereof, were made on other people's money, no longer available as investors lick their wounds from the last cycle. While the beta of the Senior Housing business remains extraordinarily attractive, what truly sets us apart are our efforts to generate outsized alpha for our existing owners. This is reflected by the difficult but important steps that we continue to take to further amplify our long-term growth trajectory. This not only includes the build out of our operating platform, which John will get into in a minute, but also involves numerous capital light transactions such as operator transitions, conversion and conversion of triple-net and to RIDEA leased structures. We are confident that several operating platform initiatives will start to impact occupancy and NOI next year. Expanding on the theme of enhancing long-term growth through capitalized transactions, we announced transition of 89 Holiday by Atria assets to six Welltower's strongest operating partners with deep expertise and local scale in their regions. We have experienced tremendous success with hundreds of transition we have effectuated in recent years and we expect similar outcomes from this most recent set of assets. More importantly, we hope to achieve over $70 million of additional NOI upside when new operators stabilize these properties. And separately, we converted or agreed to convert 47 triple-net leased properties to RIDEA structure in Q2, allowing us to directly participate in substantial growth of these properties that are poised to deliver in coming years. StoryPoint: To illustrate that in new investment terms, you need $2 billion of new acquisitions to achieve that level of NOI accretion, assuming 2% long-term accretion of our investment model. That's how impactful the math is for our near to medium term growth and clearly our owners will capture all the upside from stabilization of this asset, which should enhance our long-term earnings growth trajectory as well. Turning to investment activity, last night we announced additional investment activity that brings us to nearly $5 billion of transactions closed or under contract to close year-to-date. The U.S. and UK comprised of the bulk of our recent transaction with virtually all transaction being completed in Senior Housing space. Our investment teams remain busy as ever as the opportunity to acquire senior housing assets continue to expand, largely from resulting of the broken capital structure and other debt driven situations that Nikhil described on last call. Notably, while 2023 was a record year for us with $5 billion of investment, we have achieved this level of transaction activity in just first seven months of 2024. Our pipeline beyond these transactions remain robust, visible, granular and actionable. S&P: And yesterday, we announced the recast and upsize of our revolving credit facility to $5 billion, bringing near-term liquidity to nearly $9 billion. Our new revolver comes at an improved pricing and extended term relative to our previous facility, a testament to the strengthening of our credit profile and growth outlook of our business even in these challenging times for real estate credit. We will remain disciplined in our funding of our future opportunities. But as I have previously mentioned, we have created significant debt capacity to tap into creating another lever for us to further augment our earnings growth. With that, I'll pass it over to John. John Burkart : Thank you and good morning. As Shankh mentioned, we reported another strong quarter with total same-store NOI growth, once again achieving double-digit levels led by our Senior Housing operating portfolio, which I'll provide more details on momentarily, but I'll first touch on our Outpatient Medical business. We reported 2.1% year-over-year same-store growth, which is in line with our expectations. Leasing velocity remains healthy, our retention rate remains strong at 93%, and our industry leading occupancy continues to be stable at 94.3%. Turning to Senior Housing, we continue to be pleased with the level of same-store NOI growth being generated by this business, which once again exceeded our expectations at 21.7%. Attaining 20% plus NOI growth for any sector is an incredible achievement, but seven consecutive quarters is truly exceptional. I'd also note that the strength of our business remains broad based, with all regions and property types posting outsized levels of growth. And as Shankh described, our confidence in generating elevated levels of growth in future years continues to grow given the extraordinarily demand-supply backdrop ahead of us and our focus on improving the operating business. In terms of same-store revenue in the quarter, we posted 8.6% growth compared to the prior year's period, with contributions from both occupancy and rate. Same-store occupancy increased 280 basis points, the highest level of year-over-year growth we've achieved in the second quarter of any year outside of 2022, when we were coming out of COVID. RevPOR growth remains healthy at 5.3% and ExpPOR increased just 1%. On the expense side, we're witnessing a couple of different factors at play. First, we continued to see a reversal of the broader inflationary pressures which impacted the business in recent years and second, we're benefiting from the operating leverage inherent in the business as we experience slowing incremental cost as occupancy increases. Another reflection of this trend is growth in comp core [ph] for compensation for occupied room, which rose just 0.9% year-over-year, well below our historical average due to the operational scaling benefits we're beginning to witness. Overall, as Shankh mentioned, our focus remains on driving the delta between RevPOR and ExpPOR substantially higher as part of our platform initiatives. To give a real time example, over the last few months, we've gone through an extensive review of different care levels across our assisted living portfolio in an effort to create greater simplification for residents and their families. As a result of this exercise, we also made the strategic decision to focus our leasing efforts on lower acuity assisted living residents across many of our communities. While a lower acuity resident pays less than a higher acuity resident for the same room, they also consume far less human resources and tend to stay longer. This creates a healthier rent roll over a longer period of time, leading to higher NOI. We are pleased to report that these initiatives are paying off as we've been able to attract a substantially lower number of lower acuity AL residents during the summer leasing season. I'm proud of what our team has been able to pull off in close coordination with our operating partners. Beyond that, we continue to make important strides in our efforts to optimize our portfolio and improve the resident and employee experience to the build out of the platform. We're going live with properties in Q3 and anticipate rolling out the end-to-end tech platform to the first operator in the near-term. The excitement of the community and corporate team is palpable as we truly streamline the business, integrating and digitizing the flow of information from the website through the CRM, the ERP and the care module, as well as other modules. Our communities will be able to eliminate most paperwork and materially reduce administrative time and simplify many processes, including the onerous move in process. Our objective of leveraging technology to improve the overall resident experience and enabling employees to focus more of their time on residents is being realized. We continue to achieve success in other initiatives, including the creation of the Cap team at Welltower, which enables Welltower to directly execute capital, renovation and facility projects on our sites in partnership with our operators. The result is that we are dramatically driving down costs 20% to 50% while improving the execution and improving the customer value proposition positioning Welltower's assets to drive compounding earnings growth for many years. Since the start of the year, we have completed or are working on about 2000 separate projects with 17 different operators at over 150 sites in three countries. As a result of the success of the teams, Welltower and our operators, we have expanded our work more than originally planned, which includes thousands of units taken offline. This important initiative will result in some near-term disruption, but has the potential to meaningfully contribute to our growth in 2025 and beyond. This tremendous amount of work requires the highest level of collaboration ever attempted and accomplished at Welltower between our operating partners, our vendors and our corporate employees. I am grateful for the support and teamwork by all involved people and most certainly the leaders of our operators who are standing side-by-side with me as we re-envision this business focused on improving both resident and employee experience. In conclusion, another great quarter, great demand-supply dynamics, technology platform is launching, the Cap team is executing and many other earnings drivers are in place to enable years of compounding earnings growth. Thank you and I'll turn the call over to Nikhil. Nikhil Chaudhri : Thanks John. It's hard to believe that we're almost at the end of the summer. We have worked tirelessly over the last three months since our first quarter call, expanding on our investment activity by an additional 2.1 billion. Since we have been working at such a torrid pace, I thought it would be helpful to summarize what we have accomplished so far this year. We closed on $200 million of transactions in the first quarter and announced additional transaction activity of 2.6 billion on our first quarter call. We subsequently signed up and announced another $1 billion of transactions at NAREIT in June and last night announced an incremental $1.1 billion of acquisitions, bringing this year's total closed or under contract transactions to $4.9 billion. We are pleased to report that as of the end of the second quarter, we have closed on $1.6 billion of these transactions and we are diligently working towards closing the remainder of our announced transaction activity by year-end. The incremental $2.1 billion of investment activity announced since our first quarter call is essentially entirely made up of seniors and wellness housing assets in the U.S. and UK and spans a total of 17 transactions with a median transaction size of $65 million. These transactions comprise of 82 communities with nearly 7000 units, an average age of seven years and a stabilized yield above 8%. Through these transactions, we are growing our relationships with Legend, Storypoint, QSL, Care UK, Arrow Senior Living, to name a few operators. Welltower's stellar reputation permeates globally as we remain the counterparty of choice for sellers, as evidenced by the unabated quality and pace of our investment activity. I want to highlight an emerging new trend that we have witnessed recently, inbound inquiries from Asian and continental European investors who own seniors housing product in our target markets. Perhaps driven by the strength of the dollar, but we are seeing direct inquiries to acquire senior housing assets from foreign counterparties who we have not transacted with before. During this quarter, we had net loan funding of $349 million as we originated $486 million of new loans and received repayments of $137 million across 17 loans. A vast majority of the new lending activity was with one high quality sponsor from whom we also acquired a portfolio of seniors housing assets. As I have stated before, we are creative deal makers with a problem solving mindset. I spoke last quarter about the dearth of debt capital in the Seniors Housing space, and I'm pleased to announce that we have been able to close out a creative win-win transaction with a counterparty given that backdrop. We previously transacted with this counterparty last year when we acquired 10 Seniors Housing assets for $469 million. We reengaged with them this year for a follow-on transaction. In this case, for a subset of the portfolio spanning roughly 1000 units we were able to see eye-to-eye on upfront pricing of $271 million and acquired those assets outright at a greater than 35% discount or replacement cost assuming a maximum payout on the performance based earn-out. For another subset of assets, we couldn't find alignment on the current valuation, but we were able to offer a creative debt solution. This $456 million first mortgage loan carries a 10% yield and spans nearly 1000 units across several newly built marquee senior housing properties with the last dollar basis at approximately half of replacement cost of these light new assets, this loan reflects a 56% loan to value based on our underwritten stabilized values. As with most of our loans, there are several structural enhancements to potentially convert these shorter duration debt investments into long duration equity investments. This entire transaction is underwritten to achieve an unlevered IRR north of 10%. Moving on to capital light transactions, as announced earlier, we are transitioning 89 former Holiday assets from Atria to six different regional managers. 69 of these transitions are already complete, and the remaining 20 are scheduled for later this week. As was our business plan all along, we have plans for significant capital investment across all these buildings. 65% of these projects are either completed or underway, with the remaining working through plans, scopes and budgets to start soon. With an inventory of over 900 modernized light new units, the newly appointed regional managers are hard at work in training the sales teams to market the enhanced value proposition of these communities. While we have been disappointed with the results achieved to date, we remain optimistic that we'll soon recognize significant operational upside in this portfolio through our focused regional density strategy. Sagora: Bryan: I'll now hand the call over to Tim to walk through our financial results. Sagora: I'll now hand the call over to Tim to walk through our financial results. Timothy McHugh : Thank you, Nikhil. My comments today will focus on our second quarter results, performance of our triple-net investment segments, our capital activity, our balance sheet liquidity update and finally an update to our full year 2024 outlook. Welltower reported second quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.42 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $1.05 per diluted share, representing 16.7% year-over-year growth or 19% year-over-year growth after adjusting for relief funds received in Q2 2023. We also reported total portfolio of same-store NOI growth of 11.3% year-over-year. Now turning to performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage stats are reported a quarter in arrears, so these statistics reflect the trailing twelve months ending 03/31/2024. In our Senior Housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 4.3% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage is 1.4 times, marking a new post-COVID high in coverage. In the quarter, we reached agreements to transition 36 properties operated by Storypoint and New Perspective from triple-net to RIDEA effective 3Q bringing total year-to-date RIDEA transitions to 47. Consistent with our strategy over the past two years, these conversions, despite being short-term dilutive, should prove highly accretive over time. As Welltower moves into the equity position these assets continue to benefit from post-COVID recovery in fundamentals and the industry's long-term secular growth trends. In the case of these two operators, it also moves our entire relationship to RIDEA, creating complete alignment across our portfolio of properties with them. Next, same-store NOI growth in our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 2.7% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDA coverage was $1.47 times, which represents an increase from 1.23 times last quarter as more of the recovery in the Integra Healthcare portfolio is reflected in our coverage metrics. Moving on to capital activity. We continue to equity finance our investment activity in the quarter, raising $1.6 billion of gross proceeds at an average price of $96.64 per share. This allowed us to fund $1.2 billion of net investment activity in debt paydowns and end the quarter with $2.9 billion of cash and restricted cash on the balance sheet. In July, our treasury team, led by Matt Carrus, refinanced our revolving line of credit, achieving increased capacity by $1 billion, resulting in $5 billion of total borrowing capacity, while reducing our borrow costs by 7.5 basis points, through reduction in facility fees and base rate to so far plus 72.5 basis points and extending the maturity by two years. I want to thank our banking group for the support they continue to provide Welltower. We deeply value these longstanding relationships. In July we also issued 1.035 billion convertible notes due in 2029. Note bears interest at 3.125%, is convertible to equity at $127.91 per share. We intend to use the proceeds from the note to address our 2025 unsecured maturities coming due next June. The combination of these efficiently priced refinancings increased the total duration of our debt stack to six years and brings our total current available liquidity to $8.7 billion. Staying with the balance sheet, we ended this quarter with 3.68 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA and after completing our incremental $2.7 billion in net investment activity, we expect to end the year at approximately 4.25 times net debt to EBITDA. The resiliency of our business model, trajectory of our future growth and strength of our balance sheet recognized by S&P and Moody's in the quarter as they both moved their outlooks on our BBB+ BAA1 credit ratings to positive during the quarter. Lastly, as I move on to last night's update of our full year 2024 guidance, I want to remind you that we have not included any investment activity in our outlook beyond the $4.9 billion to date that has been closed or publicly announced. Last night, we updated our full year 2024 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to $01.52 to $01.60 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $04.13 to $04.21 per diluted share, or $04.17 at the midpoint. This guidance increase represents an incremental increase in the midpoint of $0.06 per share from a NAREIT guidance and 8\u00bd cents per share from our first quarter normalized FFO guidance. The 8\u00bd cents at the midpoint is composed of 3\u00bd from an improved NOI outlook in our Senior Housing operating portfolio and 6\u00bd cents from accretive investment and financing activity, offset partially by a 1\u00bd penny from higher G&A expectations and near-term drag from triple-net to RIDEA conversions. Underlying this increased FFO guidance is an increase in estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store NOI growth to 10% to 12.5%, driven by subsegment growth of Outpatient Medical 2% to 3%, long-term post-acute 2% to 3%, Senior Housing triple-net 3% to 4% and finally Senior Housing operating growth of 19% to 23%. This is driven by the following midpoints of their respective ranges. Revenue growth of 9.2% made up of RevPOR growth of 5.25% and year-over-year occupancy growth of 290 basis points and total expense growth of 5.5%. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim. In an effort to give you our owners a bit more insight on how we're thinking about the world today, we'd like to share a few macro observations. As we think about the last few decades over, there were several factors that provided a strong tailwind for investment returns of risk assets. Rates have gone from high to low. We printed an awful lot of money. We brought future demand forward through fiscal borrowing almost everywhere in the world, including U.S., Europe, Japan, and China. We benefited from globalization that led to lower inflation, and we benefited, for the most part, an era of peace and cooperation after the cold war. Our management team has and continues to debate if some of these tailwinds will turn into headwinds as we think about our investment time horizon, at the very least, questioning if these factors become the lack of tailwind. This is especially relevant in the context of a few additional questions. First, society is aging quickly in our markets. Is this trend inflationary or deflationary? Second, given the current sovereign debt levels and fiscal policy, what will happen to the long end of the rate curve, regardless of Fed actions? Third, now that the anchor of global yield, Japan has overcome zero lower bound, will the normal be higher for U.S. rates? We have no idea how to answer any of these questions definitively. And to further complicate the picture is the interplay of this question against the backdrop of substantially reduced tailwinds, which I mentioned before. We do acknowledge that they will have an impact on investments we are making today, some negatively, some positively. However, the beauty of our strategy and the platform is that we don't need these tailwinds to work in our favor. Let me expand. Would we benefit from a lower rate environment in which our assets we own will be worth more? Would such an environment turn our incredibly low leverage balance sheet into a powerful asset that we prudently tap into to drive partial earnings? Absolutely. Would it be fine, if not thrive, if we remain in a world of high long rates for an extended period of time? Unquestionably, as construction will remain subdued for foreseeable future and will continue to help solve broken capital structure problems? Let's consider another issue, the aging of the population. While we're extremely excited about the higher end market demand that this trend will drive for many years, it also begs the question, is the demographic shift inflationary or deflationary in nature from a societal standpoint? If you are certain that the grain of our society is deflationary force, then we would be investing in middle market AL product, which we are not. We're sticking to AL product in micro markets where we have conviction that we can achieve sufficient pricing power to pass on inflation and then some. This is especially important to us given overall lack of growth of caregivers commensurate with an older population. Hence our obsession with product market fit. Amongst all these uncertainties we contend with on a daily basis, whether it be the direction of the economy, rates or geopolitics, what is certain is that we're in the midst of one of the most pronounced demographic shift ever witnessed, and it's occurring at the same time at which the challenges for new construction remain extraordinarily high. To put simply, we believe that we are in the very early inning of an exceptional multiyear growth for the industry and add into John's and what our operations team is doing to drive digital transformation of Senior Housing industry, which should result in higher employee and customer satisfaction. We're confident in our ability to compound on a per share basis over a very long period of time for our owners. We as capital allocators and long-term investors will take compounding per share of earnings over speculation of macro all day long. Long-term compounding is the only way we're aware of is to create real shareholder wealth. As Buffett tells us, predicting rent doesn't count, building an ark does. I truly believe we have built an all-weather compounding ark that will continue to reward our owners across different environments for the years into the future. As proud as I am of the exceptional execution of the Welltower team in recent quarters, I'm convinced the best days of this company are squared in front of us. And with that, let's open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Your line is open. Jonathan Hughes : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time. Shankh, I think I heard you say there's $70 million and $40 million of future cash flow upside over the next few years from recent triple-net to RIDEA transitions and about 7.5% is in place NOIs from Seniors Housing triple-net. I realize that's going to decline as we see some of those announced transitions be completed. But how much of the 7.5% could we see or do you want to see convert to RIDEA so that Welltower can participate in more cash flow and value creation upside? Thank you. Shankh Mitra : Yes Jonathan, we are focused on growing with a set of operators that we find to be exceptionally good in their region at their price point for their product. And there remains portfolios in our triple-net that fits that bucket and over time, you can expect us to continue to work through that and convert into RIDEA. And there will be assets in triple-net that will remain triple-net because we think, though for those assets, primarily midmarket assets, that's the right structure. We've got to think about long-term. Obviously, as I mentioned last time, I think our last call I mentioned that our underlying EBITDA in our triple-net portfolio is actually growing slightly faster than our RIDEA portfolio purely because of the geographic mix. That's primarily U.S. and UK. But it will not be prudent for us to think, let's just convert the whole thing, because right now we have the growth. We have to think about long-term and think about the growth prospects beyond stabilization relative to what we think inflation will be over a period of time. But there are opportunities, and you can imagine that we're hard at work, continue to work through with our partners to structure win-win deals. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Your line is open. Vikram Malhotra : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just Shankh, building on your last comment, I mean I don't know what innings we are in terms of the recovery, but whatever phase we're in. Can you just maybe elaborate give us color on sort of what gets you through this next phase of growth, both internal and external? And I just mean like the components that drove internal expenses and better pricing power seemed sustainable. If you can comment on that, as well as on the external growth, just curious, the acquisitions you're doing, like how much occupancy upside do they have relative to the portfolio? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Yes Vikram, let me see if I can remember all the questions you asked. Let's just start with the acquisitions. Roughly, you should think industry is in low-80s occupancy and there's no reason to believe for obviously in the aggregate amount that we are acquiring anything, but in that sort of market rate occupancy, call it low 80%. So we think there is substantial occupancy upside. And I've said many, many times, really the toughest part of the margin story is sort of call it 80% to low 80% occupancy and majority of the flow through happens after that. So not only occupancy upside, you should see tremendous amount of cash flow upside into that. We have never been yield buyers and will never be yield buyers. We are total return buyers and that's how we think about investments, so that's sort of one aspect of your question. The second question is harder to answer, and I absolutely do not want you to sort of take this as my forward-looking comments. I have no idea. But as we are thinking about supply/demand in our markets, but more importantly, my earlier comment that all the platform initiatives that John and his team has been building towards, we should see impact starting 2025. So if you just sort of think about that aspect of it, I think occupancy can, I'm not saying it will, but can take a leg up as we think about 2025. But now if we sort of look into the different strata of pricing in different types of occupancy in our own portfolio today, I will share an observation with you that above 90%, let's take it this quarter, obviously to make a point not to specifically numbers, just if we think about 90% plus occupancy cohort of our portfolio, RIDEA portfolio, RevPOR growth was close to 7%. So our goal is for us, what we are trying to do is to get the portfolio to that level as the industry also fills up. So is it possible that as we go into a 2026, sort of summer of 2026 or summer of 2027, we see a leg up in rates again? Absolutely we can. But this is too early to comment, but we'll see what market gives us. We're so far very pleased with how this summer season is playing out. July has been a very strong month for us and we hope that sort of the summer season play out strong, but it's too early to comment how next couple of years play out. But I wouldn't leave this question without answering the crux of what you asked. What innings we're in this growth cycle? Very early. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. Good morning. Just a question first on the Senior Housing guidance, can you just talk about why you didn't revise the same-store revenue guidance for the segment? And then if we look at the sequential occupancy growth in the quarter, bit lighter than it's been previously in second quarter, so just trying to understand that impact in the quarter. And then for the back half of the year, it feels like there's a bigger sequential ramp that's going to happen to get to the full year guidance. I just want to make sure that's correct. And maybe you had some commentary on July or anything else that gives you sort of confidence in that back half of the year occupancy plan. Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Nick, let me try and I think John or Tim, you can jump in as you fit. There are several questions I'm not sure I remember of them all. First is the occupancy. I think you heard John's comment that we have thousands of units that are under renovation that's going through. A lot of units are actually offline, so that might have contributed, as John said, that will impact or has impacted some near-term fundamentals. I've said this million times that we will always sacrifice short-term for long-term. We would expect that will augment our 2025 growth, but we are confident achieving obviously the NOI growth that we have put out otherwise we would not be raising that guidance. What was the other question, second half? Look, the thing is, if you think about the summer selling season, I sort of think about that June, July, August, September phenomenon. We got one month obviously in the quarter. We're pleased with June. That's sort of, this is the second quarter is always the second half sort of growth as we come out of the spring season, and it's really July, August, September that makes or breaks the year and we're very pleased with July and I have nothing more to add to that. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is open. Joshua Dennerlein : Yes, good morning, everyone. Tim I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you plan to lean into the balance sheet as a driver of future growth. Maybe you've really taken the leverage down and just thinking about like the opportunity set as you go forward? Timothy McHugh : Thanks, Josh. So I think the key point for us is there is no plan to lean into it. As we sit here today, it just represents optionality. And so think about how, where we're at from a leverage standpoint and how we're still continuing to fund our investment pipeline. It's all about what we can't plan for. And at that point, it provides you the backstop and the ability to continue doing what we're doing and the business model doesn't need to change in really any macro backdrop. Shankh Mitra : But Josh, if you just think about longer term basis, there is massive organic deleveraging that's happening, and at the same time, the free cash flow generation is significantly picking up. You are onto something as you think about a longer term capital structure. We clearly don't think if we just stay where it is and organic deleveraging continues to happen, we'll be three times leverage soon. We don't think that's where a company of our size and scale should work at. So there is definite capacity to tap into to drive partial growth. But as Tim pointed out, that if the optionality, that's what I'm focused on. It's not a question of what we will in a given period of time do. It's the question is what we can. And as sort of, as you think about worst and normalized earnings for this company, if you think about that in terms of normalized balance sheet, not a point in time balance sheet that's too highly leveraged or too lowly leveraged as we are. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John [indiscernible] with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. In your opening remarks, you mentioned the operating leverage that's inherent in the business. Maybe could you talk about run rate where you think that that can take margins to? Shankh Mitra : I think you're asking us to speculate on longer term margin. I'm not going to do that. I will just say that we are -- that depends on occupancy and all the -- some sort of all the operating platform initiatives that John has been building towards. But as we have said before, that if we can take margin higher than pre-COVID margins, that at the very least you can expect the significant G&A savings for both me and John stepping down. Either way we should be making money either through that margin expansion or through our failure of getting to where we think we should be through G&A reduction. Operator : And the next question comes to the line of Michael Griffin with Citi. Your line is open. Michael Griffin : Great, thanks. I'd be curious to get some more color just on the investment environment and acquisition opportunities you're seeing out there. Has there started to be more competition for the product that you are looking to acquire or are capital partners looking to come solely to you I think similar to what we've seen so far this year. And then maybe if you can comment on the transaction market broadly, are you seeing mainly stabilized product trade or some more of that value add component? Shankh Mitra : Yes. So I'll try to start. Nikhil, please jump in. So it depends on where in the product cycle you have availability of debt. So if you think about more stable product, which has in place significant occupancy and significant in place cash flow that still can be financed. So if there is any competition, then that competition is there. We have no interest in buying that product. We are total return investor. You have to think about if you buy in 90%, 95% occupied Senior Housing building, no matter what cap rate you buy at, you will end up being at a basis that at least for most cases is not acceptable to us. For us, it's always about basis and staying power. That's how we invest capital. So if there is any sort of interest or it's just purely on availability of debt. We play at a space where we are much more interested in future upside, much more interested in bringing our operators to change the operating platform and operating environment and that's why we don't. We just, obviously we have put up this kind of investment volume purely because people are coming to us directly before they go to market. You will see things that go to market a lot of times. We have looked at it and then decided that's not a fit to our portfolio. This company is not designed to buy. We're trying to invest capital and build our regional density. So we think about assets and one asset at a time, depending on what other assets we own in those markets with those operators and that's how we think about this business. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. Nikhil, I wanted to touch on your comment that you made in your prepared remarks regarding foreign counterparties. Do you know, or I guess, how much seniors housing exposure do these parties have and why are they looking to exit or reduce their exposure? I mean, are they just looking to completely get out of the business or are they just looking for a partner that can help them kind of capture some of the seniors housing upside that they might not be able to do themselves? Nikhil Chaudhri : Yes, I think I'll start with the reason they're looking to get out. It's the same as domestic counterparties, right? It's debt pressure. Now, obviously foreign counterparties have the benefit that their net outcome in their local currency is not as bad, given that the dollar is fairly strong, but the reasons are the same. And at least in the transactions that we're working on with a few of these counterparties, it has been to buy them out completely, not joint ventures or anything like that. So we're looking to do simple asset acquisitions like we have been in the U.S. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Juan Sanabria : Hi, a question for Shankh or John. You talked about platform investments starting to drive growth for the SHO business in 2025. So just curious if you can make some general comments about what success would mean for you with regard to the platform investments and the growth contributions in 2025? Shankh Mitra : One, I think I have already hinted about this to Vikram's question earlier, but we're very, as I said, we're very pleased with the occupancy growth over the last couple of years, including this year. But if we -- all the initiatives that John has been building towards, if that can enhance that growth, we'll be very pleased. We shall see. Even this year is not over yet. It's hard to comment on next year, but we'll be very pleased if that happens. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Michael Mueller with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. Your development pipeline and commitments are about 75% Senior Housing and 25% Outpatient Medical, I guess how do you see these dollars invested and the mix between the two trending over the next few years? Nikhil Chaudhri : Yes, I think I just want to clarify when you said 75% Seniors Housing. On our development page, we provide in the stock, we provide a breakdown by units. And what you'll see is, it's predominantly Wellness Housing, which is age restricted or age targeted product, low service. So it's not traditional Seniors Housing. I mean, there's barely any Seniors Housing in there in the U.S. There are a couple of projects in the UK. But as Shankh mentioned in his prepared remarks, we have not been able to make Seniors Housing developments spend and so it makes no sense to do something that doesn't work out. Operator : And your next question comes on the line of Jim Kammert with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. James Kammert : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Actually, just building on that prior question, when you think about the Wellness Housing segment, what is the organic growth profile there, say contrasted with let's call it more traditional Senior Housing, the [indiscernible] AL, et cetera? Thank you. Nikhil Chaudhri : I think I mentioned that two quarters ago or maybe even last quarter, I don't recall, but you can go back and check. But since 2018, we have built this business to about 25,000 units that the whole business, through a pandemic compounded roughly between 8% to 10%. So that's obviously, as you know, these communities are highly occupied and despite that, they're compounded at that level. I hope so that gives you a sense of why we're excited about the business. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, thanks so much. So looking at the cash flow statement, looked like you generated $1 billion of operating cash flow over a six-month period, which is looks to me like a first for the company. I know John is doing a lot on the operational side, which we'll see in 2025, but curious if there's any sort of thought either in sort of working capital efficiency, CapEx, as you're thinking about free cash flow, as you sort of scale and continue to grow these businesses, are there still sort of potential upside drivers to that? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Ron, I would say we're in the very early innings of seeing upside. I think John mentioned in his prepared remarks that for the exact same scope of work in exact same places, we're able to drive 25% to 50% lower cost on CapEx initiatives and all and more importantly, we can drive at a much faster turnaround. Just if you think through that, the biggest question that we have in front of us, what's the frictional vacancy? Time is much more important than even money, right? Because turnaround time equals to occupancy, equals to your higher NOI, permanently sort of your stabilized NOI. So you just think about that. We're super excited about it. There's a lot going on in the company, but we are excited about, at the end of the day about free cash flow generation. So that\u2019s to answer earlier question on balance sheet, I mentioned that just think through where free cash flow generation will be when we get to your definition of frictional vacancy. So we're excited about it. We're driving cash flow at the end of the day, that's all that matters and we think we're in the very early inning of that. There's a lot to come. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Rich Anderson with Wedbush. Your line is open. Rich Anderson : Hey, thanks and good morning. So I want to talk about the longer term growth potential of Senior Housing, SHO, assuming it's not 20%. And despite everything that you said, when you think about RevPAR or RevPOR, I know you're focused more on the spread. So even if inflation subsides, I think you still get what you want there. But then on occupancy gains, I wonder if you would agree that it's harder to get from 85 to 90 than it is to get from 75 to 80. Just generally in life, is that last mile of occupancy harder than the first mile? And so when you think about that, but then you layer in the fact this is a very small industry, right? It's 1 million, 1.5 million units in the U.S. and I wonder if that sort of dispels this occupancy theory I have, because there are so few options. And if you can, at the end of the day, when you roll up all these thoughts, is the sort of the growth profile of senior housing long-term still approaching 20% when you think about all this or is it something significantly less than that, but still impressive? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : So first, let's talk about what we disagree. Let's not take example of what exactly you said. I'll tell you, it's much harder to get to 95% than actually stay at 95%. So your basic assumption that it gets harder as you go on the occupancy assumption is exactly opposite of what our assumption is. So that's sort of the number one point. Number two is what is the future growth of senior housing as a business? We will debate that when we get there. Our first goal is, as I mentioned, you probably have picked up on my earlier comments, that as you stabilize assets, your ability to charge or your ability to get to higher RevPOR increases pretty dramatically. Right? So that's basic supply/demand. And so first, our goal is to get the whole portfolio there. And as you know, we're constantly reloading the gun. We're constantly buying lower occupancy buildings. And Nikhil bought a bunch of buildings this quarter that are 40% occupied, 50% occupied. Right? So we have a few years of work ahead of us to get to the portfolio to where we believe frictional vacancy is. And it sounds like you and we have a very different opinion of what the frictional vacancy is. But let's just get there and after that we'll debate what the long-term NOI growth of the business looks like. However, I'll give you a hint to think about on your own. Think about what operational leverage at different level of occupancy is. The NOI growth is a function of at a occupancy level, what your flow through margins are. And as you know, flow through margins goes up as occupancy goes up. Purely that's called operational leverage, right? That's just operating leverage. Once you think through that, you can come to that conclusion yourself. But we're not going to sit here and speculate. We first need to get to the Promised Land. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Austin Wurschmidt : Yes, thanks. I wanted to hit on John's comments around focusing on lower acuity customers, and I'm just curious how long the tail is to continue to draw upon that resident base. And given the longer lifecycle that you referenced, how does that play into your ability to sustain kind of the RevPOR, ExpPOR spread that you're focused on? Timothy McHugh : We have a long Runway here, but again, just going back a step. So we're all on the same page. So myself coming from the multifamily world, when you looked at rent effectively, you're looking and saying, okay, bigger rents are better because largely the expenses are banked irrespective of occupancy. When you switch into senior housing, it's a different story because higher rents are in part reflective of higher acuity. Higher acuity requires higher care and therefore cost and therefore higher RevPOR doesn't necessarily mean higher NOI. And so what my comments were in my script and what Shankh talked about is we're focused on optimizing NOI, increasing NOI, and in doing so, clearly targeting lower acuity residents coming in who have longer stays, all in lower care, all goes towards, in the AL world, all goes towards maximizing NOI and NOI growth over time. We're at the very beginning of that process and we put a lot of work into it, but obviously it takes time to work through all the different [indiscernible], all the different properties. So we have a ways to go and then that's completely obviously separated from all the other operating initiatives we have going on which have a positive impact in both areas, RevPOR and ExpPOR. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Omotayo Okusanya : Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone and again, congrats on another standout quarter. I'm curious about the SHO portfolio, again the operating margin is still in the high 20s now. I'm kind of curious that step to kind of go back to pre-pandemic highs of margins in the 30s, what has to kind of happen to kind of get there? Is it still further moderation in labor costs? Is it additional occupancy pick up even though occupancy is pretty high relative to pre-pandemic levels? I'm just wondering how we kind of think about getting back to that kind of NOI margin over the next 12 to 24 months. Nikhil Chaudhri : Yes, Omotayo, good morning. So first I just want to clarify that we're not just thinking about going back to pre-pandemic margins. As I said, that if that's all we do, we failed. So, but what needs to happen to get to a higher level of occupancy, a higher level of margin, is simply we need to get to higher level occupancy. So I think there's a lot of businesses you guys follow and cover and all and generally speaking, it's in our head that pre-pandemic was good. We have to remember that pre-pandemic for Senior Housing business was actually pretty bad times. Right? We got a few years of oversupply situations from call it 15 to 18, pre-pandemic wasn't good time. So we should not target to get to pre-pandemic. But to answer your question, occupancy needs to be higher for us to get there. And hopefully what you heard today, that we're excited about occupancy growth this year, excited about occupancy growth next year, and we hope that we will get to those margins as occupancy builds. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is open. Wesley Golladay : Hey, good morning, everyone. Can you talk about what is the timeline to stabilize your Wellness Housing developments and how much does falling lumber impact the development costs? Timothy McHugh : It's about 12 to 18 months. So that if we think about stabilization, just think about kind of two summers what it takes to lease up these communities. Nikhil Chaudhri : I think on the lumber point that has helped, but overall cost of development has not come down. If you put everything in the blender with different contractors, different trades, labor cost, construction cost is still higher than it was a couple of years ago, meaningfully. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Emily Meckler with Green Street. Your line is open. Emily Meckler : Good morning, guys. On the last earnings call, you mentioned a significant amount of distressing your housing opportunities in the market. What percentage of these at risk of [indiscernible] properties holding roughly on 16 billion inclusive of agency and bank loans outstanding? Would you consider the quality and price you'd be willing to buy? Shankh Mitra : Emily, I'm not going to try to speculate on what percent of that we will be willing to buy. We, as I've said that we don't have an amount in our mind that we want to buy. We're investors, we're not deal junkies. Our entire strategy is based on something very simple, which is want to build regional density and grow with our operating platforms. There are operating partners and as we see one asset at a time and we think about how it fits to the asset that we own in that area, we will make a decision to acquire or not acquire at a price. So it's a very strategic decision, deliberate decision that is taken on one asset at a time. You can see Nikhil said we acquired 7000 units to 82 different communities and we made 82 different deliberate decisions. This is not let's go buy senior living and buy x billion dollars at y percent spread. That's just exactly what we don't do. So I'm not going to sit here and speculate. But I will tell you that we see a lot of motivated counterparties who wants us to help them solve that debt problem and we're happy to do so. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Welltower Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that this call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Matt McQueen, General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir. Matthew McQueen : Thank you, and good morning. As a reminder, certain statements made during this call may be deemed forward-looking statements in the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Although Welltower believes any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the company can give no assurances that its projected results will be attained. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Shankh, for his remarks. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll review third quarter business trends and our capital allocation priorities. John, will provide an update on operational performance for our senior housing and medical office portfolios. Nikhil will give you an update on the investment landscape, and Tim will walk you through our triple-net businesses, balance sheet highlights and guidance updates. I\u2019m once again pleased to report another very strong quarter across the board at Welltower from operations to capital deployment, a further strengthening of our balance sheet, continued progress on our operating platform rollout. The result was a 21% increase in FFO per share and our fourth guidance raised for the year, this time by $0.13 per share, reflecting the extraordinary strength of our platform. This quarter also marks the first time in our company\u2019s history in which our quarterly revenue exceeded $2 billion. In terms of the senior housing operating portfolio, results continue to surpass our already high expectations. Year-over-year same-store NOI growth came in at 23%, eight consecutive quarters in which the growth exceeded 20%. And, despite macroeconomic uncertainty and heightened geopolitical tensions, topline growth on a same-store basis remain resilient at 9% driven by another quarter of outsized occupancy growth of 310 basis points coupled with strong rate growth. Particularly noteworthy is the 160 basis points of sequential spot-to-spot occupancy growth that we experienced, a reflection of both strong tailwinds of our business and especially our operating platform initiative, which will continue to bear fruit in the coming quarters and years. Not only we\u2019re pleased with the sequential growth, but the occupancy run rate exiting the quarter solidly exceeded the prior year and early fourth quarter results have been positive as well. Additionally, I would be remiss not to mention that the spread between RevPOR or unit revenue and ExpPOR or unit expense remains at historically wide level. This trend resulted in another 300 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion of our SHO portfolio. As we have discussed in the past, we remain focused on the delta between RevPOR and ExpPOR, not the absolute levels. Overall, we are delighted with our results and believe that we\u2019re carrying significant momentum into 2025 as tailwinds which we have lifted our business over the past couple of years continue to strengthen. As I have described in our recent calls, the backdrop of our senior housing business is only getting better as growth of 80 plus population picks up from here. Starting next year, 5,000 Americans will turn 80 every day. And remember, that we\u2019re only at the front end of this trend with the crest of the silver tsunami not being seen until well into the future. And, what is also irrefutable is the favorable supply outlook. Construction starts continue to drop and in the third quarter reached the second lowest level on record after the second quarter of 2009. Banks continue to wind down their senior housing loan exposure and have been reluctant to put new capital to work. And, given the extended timeline to build a new senior living community in our market, which we detailed on Slide 19 of our business update, we may not face the impact of new supply in our markets for years. Frankly, in today\u2019s construction cost and financing cost environment, it makes no economic sense to build. We have had couple of years of solid growth, but we believe that we are still in the very early stages of an extended period of extraordinary growth for the senior housing sector. And, without stealing John\u2019s thunder, this end market demand growth will be amplified by the rollout of our operating platform. I\u2019m delighted to report that during the quarter we went live with our tech platform at our first set of properties along with preparing to broaden and accelerate the rollout in the near-term. Beyond the technology rollout, we expect our broader operating platform initiatives including our hands on asset management to have a compounding effect on our portfolio\u2019s outperformance. Shifting to capital deployment, the only change we have observed since our last call is that the opportunity set has expanded farther. We announced another $1.2 billion of transaction completed or under contract since our last quarterly update, bringing our total year-to-date investment activity to over $6 billion. Nikhil will provide you more details, but as with the past few quarters, most of our investments have been bolt-on acquisitions within senior housing sector improving and benefiting from our already established regional density. Our goal remains to go deep in our markets, not broad. While 2024 is shaping out to be a record year for Welltower in terms of capital deployment, we continue to unearth compelling opportunities across all property types, geographies and capital structure and expect a busy Q4 and Q1. Lastly, I will quickly reiterate that through the exceptional cash flow growth we have achieved this year and prudent funding of our investment activity, our balance sheet has strengthened meaningfully. With leverage at 3.7 times and nearly $10 billion of liquidity, we remain well-positioned to address all near-term obligations and capitalize attractive investment opportunities. And, as we have created flexibility to lean in to the balance sheet to drive further growth at opportune time. To sum it up, we\u2019re starting to see the Lollapalooza effect of cyclical, secular and structural growth driven by our operating platform, which will be further enhanced by bolt-on acquisitions and balance sheet optimization to drive meaningful partial growth. We are singularly focused on this long-term compounding of our partial earnings growth for existing owners, our true North Star. We cannot be distracted, discouraged or dissuaded. With that, I will turn the call over to, John. John Burkart : Thank you, Shankh, and good morning, everyone. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, we posted another quarter of fantastic results with no let up and momentum, which continues to build across the business. Before getting into the details, I\u2019ll echo Shankh\u2019s sentiment that we\u2019re looking forward to closing out the year on a strong note and excited for another period of solid growth in 2025 and beyond. During the quarter, total portfolio same-store NOI increased 12.6% versus the year ago period, once again led by our senior housing operating portfolio. First, I\u2019ll provide an update on our Outpatient Medical business, which posted year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 2.2%. The consistency of the business remains evident with healthy leasing activity during the period and another quarter of strong tenant retention. Same-store occupancy remained stable at an industry leading 94.5%. As for the Senior Housing business, the business continues to deliver exceptional results. Demand for needs-based product is clearly on the rise and our proactive asset management initiatives, which I\u2019ll get into shortly, are unquestionably delivering Alpha. In the third quarter, portfolio achieved year-over-year same-store NOI growth of 23%, once again exceeding our expectations and allowing us to yet again raise our full-year outlook, which Tim will describe shortly. The strength in our Senior Housing business was broad-based with solid occupancy gains experienced across all our geographies and property types. It\u2019s worth repeating that while the summer months typically represent the most active period of leasing during the year, our sequential same-store occupancy gain of 120 basis points and spot-to-spot gain of 160 basis points are well above typical seasonal trends. In fact, this quarter tied a record for sequential same-store occupancy growth when excluding the second half of 2021 as we were coming out of the building. On a year-over-year basis, same-store occupancy increased 310 basis points, also amongst the highest levels ever achieved in our history. Rate growth across the portfolio also remained strong with same-store RevPOR growth increasing 4.9% year-over-year. While our budgeting process for next year is just starting, we believe that rate growth should once again remain favorable as portfolio vacancies decline further and our pricing initiatives begin to bear fruit, more to come in the coming months. In terms of expenses, we continue to be encouraged by trends within the labor market and further moderation of broader inflationary pressures. ExpPOR or expense per occupied room increased just 0.7% year-over-year, second lowest level in our history. Most importantly though, as Shankh mentioned, the spread between RevPOR and ExpPOR growth remains historically wide, contributing to another quarter of substantial operating margin expansion, at 26.5%, the NOI margin for our same-store portfolio remains below pre-COVID levels, but we expect continued improvement going forward as the operating leverage inherent in the business is recognized. The other big driver of future margin expansion will be our operating platform. Our operating platform includes a technology platform and other site level technology, an internal capital team, which I referenced last quarter, our data science capabilities and more. I continue to recruit top talent and build out various capabilities that we leverage with our operators and our asset management team across our portfolio to deliver Alpha. During our last call, I mentioned that we would soon be going live with our first technology platform in Q3, launching an end-to-end tech platform with our first operator. I\u2019m pleased to report that through the dedicated efforts of the Welltower team and our operator, it has been very successful for all stakeholders. The customer experience is a modern digital experience, substantially simplifying and shortening the move-in process for the family and the residents by eliminating paperwork. The employee experience has improved dramatically as we have simplified and or automated the processes as well as providing employees with important real-time data ensuring top care for our customers. As a result of the technology platform, the Executive Directors are saving five hours per move-in and enabling them more time for leadership and to focus on our customers. Additionally, potential errors are being avoided due to the singular database for the various modules, meaning that data is only input once, so there are no inconsistencies in the spelling of a customer\u2019s name or other critical care information. And finally, we deliver the technology platform at a lower cost than the combined disparate systems being replaced. At this point, we\u2019re preparing to roll out the tech platform to additional operators in the near-term. While we have a long way to go, we\u2019re excited by our initial success, which would not have been possible without the hard work and buy in from our best-in-class operating partners and the many Welltower team members who are working tirelessly on this effort. To sum it up, it was another strong quarter for Welltower between solid operating performance and our accomplishments on various operations and asset management initiatives. While it\u2019s too early to speak to the outlook for 2025 with any detail, we remain as optimistic as ever on the growth prospects of our business as the demand supply backdrop for senior housing is only strengthening and the benefits of the operating platform begin to be realized in a more meaningful way. We continue to execute on our mission to improve the experience of senior housing residents and employees. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Nikhil. Nikhil Chaudhri : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that our investment activity and pipeline remain incredibly robust, visible and actionable. Over the past three months since our last call, we have either acquired or entered into agreements to acquire an additional $1.2 billion of assets. This is a fraction of the $15 billion plus of opportunities that we consider during this time frame. These incremental transactions bring our year-to-date investment activity to a record setting $6.1 billion. This growth underscores the strength of our market position and the abundance of opportunities we\u2019re pursuing. As always, our focus and excitement are driven by the expected attractive risk adjusted returns of our transaction activity rather than the deal volume. Acquiring quality assets at a reasonable basis with significant cash flow growth prospects remain at the core of our investment strategy. In the third quarter, we closed on $2.15 billion of transactions. Our activity remains granular with Q3 closings spanning 15 different transactions across 13 different operating partners and a medium transaction size of $56 million. Our Q3 transactions were heavily focused on our seniors and wellness housing businesses, where we added 40 properties and more than 5,200 units. We acquired these assets, which have an average age of just over five years, at $244,000 per unit at a significant discount for replacement cost. We expect our transactions that close this quarter to stabilize in the mid-to-high 7s yield and generate an unlevered IRR in excess of 10%. Our team\u2019s reputation, expertise and network continue to drive our success. An impressive 94% of our investment volume by dollars this quarter was acquired through off market transactions. This approach has allowed us to source opportunities from a diverse range of sellers, including six transactions from developers facing maturing construction loans, three from foreign counterparties, including two from Asia and one from Central or from Continental Europe, four transactions with repeat counterparties, highlighting our reputation as a fair and reliable partner. I\u2019d like to quickly reflect on the macroeconomic trends we have witnessed recently. Despite the 50 basis point rate cut by the Fed, the 10 year treasury yield has increased by over 60 basis points since the announced cut as market participants are now wrestling with the likelihood of long rates staying higher for longer. We laid the case out for this scenario in detail on our last call. The impact of the rate cut to borrowers with floating rate debt is de minimis as they still face debt maturity challenges as bank lenders continue to reduce their senior housing exposure. 3Q earnings results for many banks that have historically been active in the senior space focused on highlighting their desire to continue to reduce their exposure to our sector. Agency financing also remained challenging due to limited stable product and elevated DSCR requirements and higher long-term rates. It\u2019s not surprising that with this backdrop, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s origination volumes are down 91% and 71%, respectively, versus their pre-pandemic peaks. This constrained lending environment continues to create attractive investment opportunities for us. On the back of this environment, we are engaged in direct bilateral conversations with eight of our highly respective private peers to evaluate significant portions of their portfolios for potential acquisitions. We are also seeing an increase in interest from sellers requesting to take Welltower OP units in transaction consideration in lieu of cash. This allows those exiting their asset level positions to have a mechanism for continuing to participate in the strong tailwinds of our industry, but in a manner not constrained by an unforgiving capital structure and with our best-in-business operating partners backed by Welltower\u2019s operating platform. This proactive and collaborative approach underscores our commitment to continuing to unlock interesting opportunities while conducting business in a first class and mutually beneficial manner. In conclusion, in this volatile capital markets environment, we remain focused on leveraging our expertise and data science platform with our operating partners and peer relationships to capitalize on attractive opportunities to create long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our team. I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Tim, to walk through our financial results. Timothy McHugh : Thank you, Nikhil. My comments today will focus on our third quarter results, performance of our triple-net investment segment, our capital activity, a balance sheet liquidity update and finally, an update to our full-year 2024 outlook. Welltower reported third quarter net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.73 per diluted share and normalized funds from operations of $1.11 per diluted share, representing 20.7% year-over-year growth. We also reported year-over-year total portfolio same-store NOI growth of 12.6%. Now, turning to the performance of our triple-net properties in the quarter. As a reminder, our triple-net lease portfolio coverage stats reported a quarter in arrears. So, these statistics reflect the trailing 12-months ending [6/30/2024] (ph). In our senior housing triple-net portfolio, same-store NOI increased 5.8% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage was 1.09 times, marking a new post-COVID high in coverage. Coverage in this portfolio continues to improve above pre-pandemic levels and greater than expected growth in this portfolio is being driven mainly by improving underlying fundamentals and leases currently on a cash basis. Next, same-store NOI in our long-term post-acute portfolio grew 3% year-over-year and trailing 12-month EBITDAR coverage of 1.74 times. Moving on to capital activity. In July, we issued a $1.035 billion convertible note due in 2029. We intend to use the proceeds for the note to address our 2025 unsecured maturities coming due in the second quarter of next year. We continue to equity finance our investment activity in the quarter, raising $1.2 billion of gross proceeds at an average price of $122 per share. This allowed us to fund $2 billion in net investment activity and end the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash and restricted cash from the balance sheet. Staying with the balance sheet, we ended this quarter with 3.73 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. And, even after completing $1.5 billion incremental net investment activity, we expect to end the year below four times net debt to EBITDA, which would represent over a one turn improvement relative to the end of 2023. This level of deleveraging is being achieved despite deploying a record amount of capital. Our cash flow capitalization of acquisitions and the significant increase in our cash flow generation allowed us to build a powerful asset that will allow us to prudently fund future investments and enhance our go-forward cash flow per share growth. To illustrate the substantial increase in balance capacity, as Shankh mentioned earlier, our annualized revenue exceeded $8.2 billion this quarter. This signifies a $3.2 billion increase compared to the end of 2019, while our net debt has decreased by $2.7 billion during that same period, reflecting a 20% decrease from COVID levels, concurrent with a 60% revenue increase over that same period. It is noteworthy that our current debt stack includes $2.1 billion in convertible notes that are in the money. This deleveraging should be amplified through the embedded upside within our senior housing operating portfolio, further bolstering balance sheet capacity and providing for increased flexibility and optionality. Lastly, as I turn to our updated 2024 guidance, I want to remind you that we have not included any investment activity in our outlook beyond the $6.1 billion to-date that has been closed or publicly announced. Last night, we updated our full-year 2024 outlook for net income attributable to common stockholders to $1.75 to $1.81 per diluted share and normalized FFO of $4.27 to $4.33 per diluted share or $4.30 at the midpoint. Our updated normalized FFO guidance represents a $0.13 per share increase at the midpoint from our previously issued guidance. This increase is composed of $0.06 from an improved NOI outlook in our senior housing operating portfolio, $0.015 from taxes and FX, $0.01 from performance in our triple-net and OM segments and $0.045 from accretive capital activity. Underlying this increased FFO per share guidance is an increase in estimated total portfolio year-over-year same-store growth to 11.5% to 13%, driven by sub-segment growth of outpatient medical 2% to 3% long-term post-acute 2% to 3% senior housing triple-net 4% to 5% and finally, increased senior housing operating growth of 22% to 24%. This is driven by the following midpoints in their respective ranges : revenue growth of 9.2%, made up of RevPOR growth of 5.25% and year-over-year occupancy growth of 300 basis points and expense growth of 5%. And with that, we\u2019ll hand the call back over to Shankh. Shankh Mitra : Thank you, Tim. As many of you, my fellow shareholders know that my team and I are true believers that compounding is the only way to create substantial long-term value. Compounding not just in the context of middle school math, but in everything in life. We define compounding as dogged, incremental and continuous progress over a very long period of time. And for this team, it has been close to a decade since we took our predecessor company down to a start by turning over roughly 60% of the portfolio, changing out 95% of our human capital in middle management and up, evolving our operating partners while creating greater alignment through win-win structures and so on. More importantly, we change these companies culture as we build what you know as Welltower today, brick-by-brick. We founded a culture of owners not managers with agency problems, a culture or shared value with our operating partners to deliver real value for our customers and site level employees shoulder-to-shoulder no matter what. A culture of resilience having endured four different crisis over last past decade, crisis included oversupply, a crippling pandemic, labor shortage and the worst inflation in 40 years. A culture of extreme excellence to build and create true residual Alpha for our owners not defined by Wall Street\u2019s view of real estate industry which has a checkered history of creating value. We\u2019re focused on creating Alpha, not levered beta for existing owners. Over the past decade, we have built a unique data science platform, the first of its kind in real estate industry, powered initially by machine learning, then deep learning and finally by AI well before many of these terms got into the folklore. And finally, with Chutzpah and perhaps Na\u00efvet\u00e9, we launched an operating platform initiative by attracting John and hundreds of our new colleagues who followed him from a dozen industries of higher standards during a pandemic no less when we didn\u2019t even know if the business would survive. I sat down this past weekend to reflect on our Q3 results and for the first time since I arrived at Welltower, I felt a sense of satisfaction in that the compounding of our efforts over the course of many years is beginning to pay off. Not because of the strong results we posted in the quarter, but because of a feeling that our audacious dream of transforming this industry is finally coming together and what that may potent for next few years. Having said that, this feeling lasted for about five minutes as my usual healthy paranoia set in. We have a long journey ahead and frankly that our pursuit of dogged incremental and continuous progress will never be over. Mediocrity and complacency have no place in our culture. Like Navy SEALs, we believe the only easy day was yesterday. Where occasionally in moments like this, looking at the scoreboard may not be so bad, we\u2019re in this game because of our love for the game. And with that, we\u2019ll be back to the game. Operator, please open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Jonathan Hughes : Hi there. Thank you for the time and great to see the strong results. Hoping you could talk more about the historically wide gap between, unit revenue and unit expense and margins and specifically trying to understand the incremental margin at today\u2019s 86% occupancy and where that incremental margin goes once occupancy surpasses 90% or even higher since variable costs at that point are minimal? Thank you. Timothy McHugh : Thanks, Jonathan. So, you\u2019re right in highlighting that the way that, that kind of RevPOR, ExpPOR math is expressed through our financials is in that flow through margin. So last quarter, we noted that flow through margins had gone above 60% for the first time since the kind of post-COVID recovery. Again, this quarter, we were in the low-60s from a flow through. Important to note in that, that we had one operator making about 1% of our same-store pool that through some kind of changes to their operating model they\u2019re implementing and higher expenses right now than we\u2019d expect. So, ex that operator, flow through margins would have been closer to 67%. So, consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past, you should see flow through margins kind of move into the mid-60s and approach 70% as we start to re-approach kind of pre-COVID levels of occupancy of 88% and then from thereon improve. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Griffin with Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Joseph : Thanks. Nick Joseph here with Michael. Shankh, you had made the comment that it makes no economic sense to build. And, I know it\u2019s hard to generalize and obviously it\u2019s regional, but I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of kind of how far off we are before it does make economic sense either from a rent growth perspective or costs coming down, just trying to quantify that a bit? Thank you. Shankh Mitra : Nick, really good question. It\u2019s hard to say in a general matter because cost is a function of local situations, labor etcetera. We haven\u2019t seen construction costs come down. You have seen some material costs have come down which has been surpassed obviously taken up more by insurance and labor costs. So, if you just want to sort of have a general rule of thumb, remember rent growth will not get you there. Rent growth relative to labor cost, operating labor cost growth will get you there, right. So, you need in markets 25%, 30% increase of RevPOR minus ExpPOR where construction will start to make sense. I always believe people will do what make economic sense and we have tried to make it work in the best location where pricing is not a question, even we\u2019re struggling with that. That\u2019s the best locations such as Palm Beach and Cupertino\u2019s of the world. Imagine your question is that average of the industry where this makes no economic sense whatsoever. Operator : Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Ronald Kamdem : Hey, just a quick one from me. So, I\u2019ve been sort of reflecting over this top line growth of 8% where you got over 300 basis points occupancy gain, but, 5% sort of, pricing growth which is basically the fastest out of any rates that we cover. And I think we\u2019re all trying to figure out what that number is going to look like in 2025. So, I guess my question would be, as you sort of reflect on that number, maybe a little bit more color of what drives that. Is there anything sort of one timing? And not putting words in your mouth, but is there a reason that we should expect that to decelerate as we flip the calendar? Thanks. Shankh Mitra : Ron, very good question. We\u2019re not going to sit here and try to speculate what 2025 will look like. I\u2019m going to point out a couple of things. John made a specific comment in his prepared remarks about how he\u2019s feeling about pricing. We\u2019ll see what the market gives us. I will tell you that we would get we would have market share increase. So, we\u2019ll but at the end of the day, everybody is subject to market. We are focused on RevPOR minus ExpPOR, not RevPOR. Having said that, you can focus on what John said in his prepared remarks. I will remind you from an occupancy standpoint, remember revenue is a function of pricing and occupancy. I\u2019m going to refocus you what I\u2019ve said on the last call. And I said occupancy can not necessarily saying it will, but can get growth, can get better next year. And hopefully after this record sequential occupancy change in third quarter of this year that gives you probably gives more credence to the comment I made. I\u2019m willing to sit about that much. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful, but just understand it\u2019s too early to say. We\u2019ll see what market gives us. Operator : Our next question comes from Nic Yulico with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Nicholas Yulico : Thanks. Yes, just following up on the topic of occupancy, maybe Shankh or John. Can you just talk a little bit about what you saw in the quarter in terms of traffic trends, maybe year-over-year sequentially? And also how if there\u2019s if you feel like you\u2019re getting an even bigger benefit right now from lower turnover in the portfolio? John Burkart : Yes, I\u2019ll jump in. Traffic is up, addition with what we saw is higher closing ratios. In other words, our execution is improving, which is important and it\u2019s a function of the operating platform there. As it relates to turnover, that\u2019s been consistent, no issues there. But the bigger issue is we\u2019re executing and taking market share. Operator : Our next question comes from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Austin Wurschmidt : Great. Thanks. Shankh, you highlighted that you\u2019re carrying significant momentum into \u201825 and kind of the tailwinds in the business continue to strengthen. Soon speaking kind of the demographics, but at the same time I think absorption has been stable in recent quarters across the sector. So, just curious if you think we\u2019re at the cusp of absorption reaccelerating and that being kind of going back to your comment about occupancy growth potentially getting better next year? Shankh Mitra : Yes. Austin, I\u2019m not going to comment on what may or may not happen in the macro. Absorption is a macro industry-wide phenomena. As John just mentioned that we\u2019re focused on market share. You can see what our sequential occupancy growth is relative to the industry, that you will see that we\u2019re entirely focused on using our operating platform and our best-in-class operators hard work to get market share, right. If we can get improvement in absorption, that\u2019ll be a gravy. That\u2019s just not something we can control. That\u2019s not something we\u2019re focused on. Operator : Our next question comes from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, this is [George] (ph) on for Vikram. So, you have highlighted an expanded visible, acquisition pipeline. Can you just provide more color on how much of the flow is non-US? And then as a follow-up, what percentage of the deal flow do you pass and say no to? And has that percentage changed recently? John Burkart : [George] (ph), on the second question, in my prepared remarks, I talked about how of the $1.2 billion of incremental activity we announced this quarter, the universe of opportunities we looked at was $15 billion. So, from the $15 billion we acquired $1.2 billion. This number fluctuates up or down every quarter depending on what we look at. But generally speaking, it\u2019s roughly a 10% hit rate. And then your second question about geographically, I think Shankh said it in his remarks, but we\u2019ve got active transactions we\u2019re looking at in all three months. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead. John Pawlowski : Great. Thanks for the time. Question on CapEx for the senior housing business. It\u2019s been running 30% to 45% of NOI over the last year and change. Just curious, over the next two to three years, I know there\u2019s kind of unstabilized NOI that\u2019s nominator, but over the next two to three years, where do you expect CapEx as a percentage of NOI for the senior housing business to start to stabilize at? John Burkart : Yes. So, I\u2019ll step in. John, the question is let me give you a broader answer here. So, as I mentioned last time, we\u2019ve created an internal team. We\u2019re executing at amazing levels where we\u2019re both reducing the cost by 20% to 50% on, say, a unit basis and speeding up the time lines. We\u2019re also changing the fundamental way we do things. Historically, this business is really the operators function kind of like on the PE model where it\u2019s very short time decisions. So, for example, you might have an asset that has three buildings and they\u2019ll do one roof. And then the next year following roof and the following year following roof. What that\u2019s doing is driving up costs dramatically because of smaller projects, because of three mobilizations. And then you have all kinds of other stuff flowing through like the roof leaks impacting the customer experience and all the issues along those lines. So, what\u2019s happening right now is we\u2019re doing things correctly with the long-term life cycle costs in mind, lowering the long-term run rate. So that means we\u2019re pulling some things forward and it won\u2019t change it will lower the long term run rate. But right now, there\u2019s some stuff that\u2019s elevated because in that example, we\u2019d be doing all three roofs, avoiding the future roof leaks and getting the project behind us and moving forward. So, there\u2019s a little noise that\u2019s going on right now, but it\u2019s all for the efforts to lower the long-term run rate and the unit costs are dramatically lower. So, it\u2019s just absolute great execution by the team. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carroll with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Carroll : Yes, thanks. Can you guys provide some color on the tech platform rollout that you mentioned? And I know that you have other initiatives that you\u2019re working on. But how does this work out financially? I\u2019m assuming Welltower has made the initial investment to build out these platforms. I mean, are your operators paying a recurring fee for this or just does it get reflected into significantly better financial results for you as these get rolled out to your operating partners? Timothy McHugh : Yes, Mike. The goal is clearly the latter part of your question, so significantly better financial results. How I would describe kind of the flow of the cost is you\u2019re right. The initial investment is coming through Welltower. There\u2019s a bit of duplicative cost upfront because as we kind of transition into this, you have a legacy technology systems of operators moving over to our own. In the end, this isn\u2019t intended to be a cost savings exercise, but it will be the tech stack will be less expensive because it will be scaled across our entire operating platform rather than subscale across all of our operators. And that\u2019ll come through over time. But beyond the investment, the initial thought should be there shouldn\u2019t be an uptick in costs. Shankh Mitra : Mike, just remember one of the things we have to think through, just in addition to what Tim said that software cost is already part of the SHOP margins, right? So, there is cost flowing through our P&L and it\u2019s duplicative in nature today because obviously you have to make a lot of initial or upfront cost. But just as a run rate cost, remember that technology cost is part of the SHOP expense stack. Operator : Our next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Juan Sanabria : Hi, thank you. Maybe a question for Nikhil. You mentioned talking to eight private peers. Just hoping you can maybe add a little color on that. Is that larger scale transactions or more of the singles and doubles you\u2019ve been doing today? Nikhil Chaudhri : Yes. Juan, as you would imagine, right, when you\u2019re talking to eight different groups, from some of those, you might not look to buy any assets either you don\u2019t like the asset quality or the valuation. And with some, you might see eye to eye on a lot. Right? So, it\u2019s hard to generalize, but just given the numbers we\u2019re talking about, the different range of outcomes that everyone we\u2019re speaking with. Operator : Our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Joshua Dennerlein : Yes. Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. I guess I was looking at your business presentation update, the path to recovery slide on page 21. So, the bridge assumes you go back to pre-COVID occupancy and margin at today\u2019s rate. That seems like it\u2019s a little kind of unrealistic just given the forward-looking backdrop. I guess, how should we think about what else gets layered in beyond this to kind of get to like a bridge? And then maybe tying that into the tech cost you flagged as being part of the SHOP expenses, like how should we think about that influencing this bridge? Shankh Mitra : Yes. Josh, it\u2019s a good catch that if you just look at the page of what we\u2019re trying to give you a sense of what occupancy growth, how that impacts obviously our NOI embedded NOI growth. Going back to pre-COVID, I\u2019ve said this before, if we only go back to pre-COVID, at least John and I are stepping down. We consider that as a complete failure. So, we expect that occupancy growth occupancy will go substantially higher than where the pre-COVID is. However, the most important point is what you made is at today\u2019s rate. Remember what should be added if we\u2019re just trying to understand what\u2019s a normalized earnings for this company, what you should add, not just whatever you think is the frictional vacancy of our portfolio should be, that\u2019s obviously one add. You have to decide how long it takes there to get obviously get to that frictional vacancy. And meanwhile in those years, what\u2019s your RevPOR minus ExpPOR, because our rates are growing faster than our expense growth, right? That adds to that. And just also point out that we will see that our first set of numbers we gave you few years ago when we started giving you the disclosure, that pool of assets, our NOI is actually $33 million higher than pre-COVID. Occupancy is significantly lower, yet it is $33 million higher. You\u2019ll see that in I believe the fourth bar on that page and that\u2019s because rates are much higher, right? So, you have RevPOR minus ExpPOR got you to that higher NOI despite lower occupancy and that same thing follows through as you are thinking about whatever to whatever your definition of frictional vacancy is. And that\u2019s how you sort of get to the number. We\u2019re not going to sit here and try to quantify what technology costs may or may not come down. That\u2019s not the focus. We think we\u2019re after the big ball, which is revenue. There is a lot of opportunity on the expense side, as we implement systems and processes and have site level employees focus on why to what they have signed up to do, which is providing care. That\u2019s a compassionate care is why they have signed up to be in this industry. So, we want to try to make people\u2019s life easier. As John pointed out, just one example, our tech suite rollout, it\u2019s saving about five hours of effort, far moving from an executive director\u2019s perspective, right? So, that she can focus on what she signed up to do, which is leading people and providing care to families, right? Care to residents and focusing on the resident and their families. So, you think about it, this is not just a question of cost. When we talk about margins, I don\u2019t want you to think about cost. I want you to think about how we improve overall resident and employee experience and what that means for residents\u2019 willingness and ability to pay. Thank you very much for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from John Kilichowski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Kilichowski : Hi, thank you. Just one on the transaction market, it feels like you\u2019re competing on your own with some of these deals. Could you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the way of capital flows and when you expect composition to start to pick up? Just trying to understand the likelihood of you being able to maintain the sort of cadence on investment activity? Shankh Mitra : Let me start and Nikhil you jump in. First, we\u2019re not trying to maintain the level of activity. I have said this before, our company is not designed to buy stuff. We\u2019re not a bunch of deal junkies. We\u2019re trying to invest capital to further strengthening our market position and drive partial earnings and cash flow growth. So, if the market opportunity is there, we\u2019ll do it. If the market opportunity is not there, we\u2019ll not do it. If we believe the market prices have gone to a level where somebody is willing to pay more for assets than what we are willing to pay for, we\u2019ll sell like you have seen pre-COVID we have sell $15 billion of assets. The focus is on value creation on a partial basis for existing shareholders. Having said that, if you have 94% for example in this quarter and number stays around that up or down couple points every quarter, 94% of what you buy is in a privately negotiated bilateral transaction. So, you have to compete with one person in that situation that is yourself, if it gets in your head what your cost of capital is. Our cost of capital is much higher than you guys believe, purely because we believe our normalized earnings is much higher. So, we are not trying to do a cost of capital game on a spot basis. We\u2019re trying to think what a long-term return from our individual stock is for existing owners and trying to make a decision by expanding the partnership, which is buying something, are we increasing the growth rate and terminal value for existing owners who are our investment partners today. That\u2019s how we make capital allocation decisions. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Anderson with Wedbush. Please go ahead. Richard Anderson : Thanks. It\u2019s a perfect segue to my question. So far this year, you\u2019ve grown the portfolio by 7%, $6 billion to $90 billion of an enterprise value. You\u2019ve grown FFO guidance by 7%. That\u2019s probably coincidence. But I noticed that $0.045 of the $0.13 this quarter was attributable to external investing. So, of that, how much of that was driven by this sort of spread investing phenomenon of a seven yield in your low cost of capital? How much of that was previous year outperforming to your point better growth profile of the company? You did $5.9 billion last year at a 7 :1 yield. I imagine that\u2019s a higher yield today. So, is the $0.045 purely from activity this year or outperformance from previous years? Thanks. Timothy McHugh : Thanks, Rich. I would just note that $0.045 is capital activity, right? So, that\u2019s how we\u2019re financing things and that\u2019s also what we\u2019re acquiring. And the bucketing is representive of incremental changes in guidance. So, that is all from incremental capital activity since we last provided guidance. The move in our kind of senior housing or outpatient or triple net, that will be like fundamental performance. And so things we acquired last year outperforming underwriting are showing up in kind of fundamentals. Whereas when I get the guide and talk about capital activity, it\u2019s really just incremental from last time we updated you what\u2019s being driven by the new acquisitions, the timing of acquisitions and the way we finance. Shankh Mitra : It\u2019s an extraordinary question, Rich, because if you think about the activity, which is obviously what we talk about quarter-to-quarter, but what impacts your number is when you close and majority of the closings are obviously happening in Q3 and Q4. So, the impact of that closings, you\u2019re not going to entirely feel this year that you\u2019re going to feel it next year, especially with a focus on growth. We are growth investors. We\u2019re not I\u2019ve seen enough companies have been destroyed by chasing yields. You can be assured that that\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing. So A, you have a timing issue of obviously how that flows to the number and B, assuming that we are actually buying what we\u2019re telling you buying, which is growth, your impact on a move forward basis will be higher. So, it\u2019s a really, really good question. Operator : Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead. Wesley Golladay : Hey, good morning, everyone. Can you answer what segments are driving the occupancy gains? Is it active adult, independent, assisted living and any potential mix headwind on rate next year and potential export benefit? Shankh Mitra : It\u2019s been across the board given the wellness housing portfolio is extremely highly occupied. You should assume that that\u2019s a drag on growth and majority of the growth that\u2019s flowing through our number overall is coming from assisted living and independent living. Sorry, on the export question, let me finish the call question. And on the export side, go back to and focus on what John said on his prepared remarks. Seems like labor cost is moving in our direction. We have no sense of we can\u2019t give you right now what that may or may not be for next year, but directionally it\u2019s moving in our direction. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from James Kammert with Evercore. Please go ahead. James Kammert : Good morning. Thank you. Looking at the SHOP portfolio, obviously the same store portfolio exhibits a little bit higher occupancy and margin versus the total implying obviously non-same store a little lower. Is there a reasonable expectation on cadence as to how fast the total portfolio sort of catches up the same store, if you will, in terms of occupancy and margins at two to three quarters as you apply your operating platform or that too short, too soon? Shankh Mitra : Let me take the first part. Maybe Tim, you can provide some guidance on how sort of non-same store flows into same store. But frankly speaking, Jim, we don\u2019t really care about same store, non-same store. All we care about is bottom line FFO growth. But there is no question that the non-same store given its lower occupancy will be growing faster. And that\u2019s a function of remember what I said on last call that we\u2019re buying assets and I think Nikhil mentioned this as well, that are lower than market occupancy, right. We\u2019re buying I think I gave bunch of examples last quarter, but Nikhil is buying assets that are 40%, 50%, 60% occupied, right. That\u2019s a drag to our earnings today, but that gets you to a higher earnings tomorrow and gets you better growth. Timothy McHugh : Yes. And to add, Jim, so that portfolio total portfolio is probably the biggest difference is you\u2019ve got deliveries on the development side. So you have preopening cost plus just general network capital drags and anything delivered and we\u2019re in a bit of a heavy period of delivery. So, that causes some change. Generally though, you think about kind of the difference between the same store and the total portfolio, the mix is relatively similar. So over time, you should see those margins converge. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mueller with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Michael Mueller : Yes, hi. In terms of the tech rollout, can you give us a sense as to what you think the annualized margin improvement could be at the property level based on what you\u2019ve rolled out just so far? Timothy McHugh : Mike, we\u2019re not going to get on a call and try to speculate what our margin improvement will be. We will tell you that focusing on what we said before, which is we believe that we\u2019re going to get this platform at a higher level margins than pre-COVID. And that is due to a function of where we think operating platform is taking us, where we think the operating platform initiative will take the occupancy to. It\u2019s just an inappropriate sort of a venue to try to speculate what will happen in the future. But we\u2019re optimistic we\u2019ll get to a better place in the future than it was in the past. Operator : Our next question comes from Omotayo Okusanya with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Omotayo Okusanya : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Good quarter, great outlook. In regards to the SHOP portfolio, and again, of late you have been comparing some portfolios from triple net to SHOP. Obviously, it is kind of improving or increasing your overall growth profile of the company as you kind of get more exposure to SHOP. I guess ultimately just kind of given what you\u2019re seeing in regards to demand supply fundamentals and how you expect senior housing to move over time. Should we still be expecting that the SHOP portfolio could be an even bigger percentage of your NOI going forward? Or at a certain point, do you start picking up again? Well, the downside when you do have supply or when fundamentals get softer suggest that maybe the up optimal exposure is some percentage of NOI to SHOP. Shankh Mitra : Very good question Tayo, I\u2019ll point out to you. Let me ask answer the easiest question you asked which is will SHOP continue to grow as a percent of the overall portfolio? The answer is a resounding yes. As you see that our SHOP portfolio is obviously low occupied, majority of the margin flow through is just starting to come. If you just think through what that means, even if we don\u2019t buy another asset, you\u2019ll get to a much higher place than where you are today. So just think through that from a portfolio composition for where it exists today and obviously you can see that\u2019s what we\u2019re buying mostly. The second question is an even a more important one as we think about long-term portfolio management. I would recommend that you go back and read the letter to future shareholders that I wrote few years ago. It\u2019s on the Investor section of our website where we focused on really on this topic, on what our true belief that is volatility is not risk, right? You\u2019re talking about okay, what happens in a year or two or whatever you might get a downside volatility of owning equity versus debt. That\u2019s why your question is, I\u2019m okay with that. That\u2019s what we have a balance sheet for to adjust for that risk. Just remember, volatility in our opinion is not risk. The probability of losing permanent capital in our opinion is risk. So, you are asking a question that is near and dear to my heart. I wrote a lot about this topic. I think you will get a kick out of reading the end section of the letter just focusing on this topic. Thank you. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. This will conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
