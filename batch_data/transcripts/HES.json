Hill - President and Chief Operating Officer of Exploration & Production John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Senior Vice President Analysts : Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Hess Corporation Conference Call. My name is Crystal, and I will be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. Jay R. Wilson: Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President, Worldwide Exploration and Production; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess: Thank you, Jay, and welcome to you, all, on our first quarter conference call. I will make some high-level comments on the quarter and the progress we are making in executing our strategy. Greg Hill will then discuss our E&P operations, and John Rielly will go over our financial results. Our results this quarter demonstrate continued execution of our plan to drive cash-generative growth and sustainable returns for our shareholders through a focused portfolio of world-class E&P assets. In the first quarter, our growth assets performed well with higher production from Valhall and North Malay Basin. In addition, current Bakken production levels are in excess of 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, following completion of the Tioga gas plant expansion. Tubular Bells is on track for first oil in the third quarter, and well results from the Utica Shale play are encouraging. Overall, we remain very enthusiastic about the prospects for our company in 2014 and beyond. With regard to our financial results, net income for the first quarter of 2014 was $386 million or $446 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.38 compared to $1.95 in the year-ago quarter. Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $1.4 billion. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, our results were impacted by asset sales, which reduced production by 77,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the shut-in of production in Libya, which reduced production by 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net production in the first quarter averaged 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 297,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a pro forma basis, excluding divestitures. This represents an increase of 11% from pro forma production of 268,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in last year's first quarter, excluding Libya. This improvement was driven by higher production from the Valhall Field in Norway and North Malay Basin in Malaysia. Regarding the Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% working interest, net production averaged 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. This compares to 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter when production was restarting, following the completion of the multi-year field redevelopment project. Two wells were brought online in the first quarter, and facility uptime and reliability have continued to improve. In Malaysia, net production from the North Malay Basin, where Hess is the operator with a 50% interest, averaged 40 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter. The early production system commenced in October of last year and will maintain production at current levels through 2016. Full field development is ongoing and should result in net production increasing to 165 million cubic feet per day in 2017. Net production from the Bakken averaged 63,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. The Tioga gas plant commenced start-up operations on March 23 and began residual gas sales on March 25. Production from both the field and the plants increased through April. And as I mentioned earlier, current net production from the Bakken is in excess of 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our full year 2014 production forecast remains 80,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our Bakken team continues to drive our well costs lower. In the first quarter, drilling and completion costs averaged $7.5 million, a 13% savings from the year-ago quarter. In addition, our wells continue to be more productive than the industry average. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, development of the Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess has a 57% interest and is operator, remains on schedule to achieve first oil in the third quarter. During the first quarter, the SPAR and Topsides were towed out and installed on location. Three producing wells have been predrilled with pay counts coming in above expectations. As a result, we plan to drill a fourth producer in the second half of this year. In terms of divestitures, on April 23, we announced that we completed the sale of our Exploration and Production assets in Thailand for $1 billion based upon an effective date of July 1, 2013. The divestiture processes for our retail marketing and trading businesses are well advanced. Also, we continue to make progress in our plans to monetize our Bakken midstream assets in 2015, most likely through an MLP structure, through which Hess will retain operational control while maximizing the value of our infrastructure investment. Regarding our share repurchase program, through April 29, we have repurchased 14.3 million shares for $1.1 billion in 2014. Since commencement of the program in August of 2013, we have repurchased 33.6 million shares for $2.7 billion. In sum, we are pleased with the progress we continue to make in our transformation to become a pure-play E&P company. We are confident that our initiatives have positioned the company to achieve 5% to 8% compound average annual production growth through 2017, off of our 2012 pro forma base and to generate free cash flow post 2014 based upon $100 Brent. In addition, the strength of our balance sheet provides the financial flexibility to fund this cash-generative growth that will deliver strong sustainable returns for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Greg. Gregory P. Hill: Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an operational update and a review of the progress we are making in executing our E&P strategy. Starting with unconventionals. In the first quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 63,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While the severe winter weather in the first quarter delayed the start-up of the Tioga plant by approximately 3 weeks and deferred bringing new wells online, the Bakken team has done an outstanding job of getting us back on schedule. First gas was introduced to the Tioga plant on March 23. First residue gas sales commenced on March 25 and ethane recovery on April 23. Also, we brought 24 new wells online in April compared to 30 wells in the first quarter, and current net Bakken production is in excess of 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the second quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average between 75,000 and 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our full year 2014 Bakken production guidance remains at 80,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Drilling and completion costs continue to be reduced with the first quarter averaging $7.5 million per well versus $8.6 million per well in the year-ago quarter and $7.6 million per well in the fourth quarter of 2013. And the productivity of our wells continues to be above industry average. We are continuing with our down spacing pilots of 17 well pads, having 13 wells per drilling spacing unit with 7 wells in the Middle Bakken and 6 in the Three Forks to allow us to determine optimal spacing and cross play. Early field results are encouraging. We are also conducting pilots on 2 pads with an even tighter 17 well per DSU configuration with 9 wells in the Middle Bakken and 8 in the Three Forks. By the end of this year, we expect to have sufficient data to provide updated guidance for well spacing, production, drilling locations and resource potential. Turning to the Utica. The appraisal and early development of our 43,000 core net acres in the Hess CONSOL joint venture continues, and we are encouraged by well results to date with rates averaging 1,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 59% liquids based on 24-hour tests. In 2014, Hess and CONSOL plan to drill some 30 to 35 wells across our joint venture acreage. In the first quarter we drilled 8 wells, completed 3 and tested one well in the joint venture acreage. In the offshore, progress continues at Valhall, North Malay Basin and Tubular Bells. At the BP-operated field in Norway, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. Two producers were brought online following workovers, and facilities reliability has been considerably improved. Full year 2014 net production from Valhall is forecast by the operator to be in the range of 30,000 to 35,000 barrels of oil per day. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, first quarter net production continued at 40 million cubic feet per day through the early production system and is expected to remain at this level through 2016. Contracts for the central processing platform for the full field development will be awarded in the second quarter, and we continue to advance our full field development project, which is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day in 2017. At our 57% owned and operated Tubular Bells development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the SPAR and Topsides were installed on schedule during the quarter. And we are on track for field start-up in the third quarter of 2014 with net production building to 25,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Due to the positive results from the wells drilled to date, we intend to spud a fourth producer mid-year, which is expected to be run [ph] on production in the first quarter of 2015. At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area, there's a 30-day planned shutdown commencing in early June for work associated with booster compression tie-ins. As a result, net production from this asset is expected to be curtailed by approximately 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the second quarter. Company-wide production on a pro forma basis, and excluding Libya, is forecast to average between 295,000 and 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2014. And our full year 2014 forecast on the same basis remains 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In terms of exploration, in the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block in Ghana, in late March, we successfully farmed out a 40% license interest. Hess will retain a 50% license interest in operatorship. Our new partner will pay a disproportionate share of the cost during the appraisal phase to earn their interest in the block. Appraisal drilling is expected to commence in May, beginning with a down-dip pass on discovery. In Kurdistan, where Hess has a 64% license interest and is operator of the Shakrok and Dinarta blocks, we completed drilling at the Shakrok-1 well. We plan to perform production tests over multiple intervals in Jurassic age reservoir, which was the primary target of the well. In May, we plan to spud the well the Shireen well on the Dinarta block. In closing, in this quarter, we have continued executing against our plan and delivering key milestones, including those on Tioga, Tubular Bells and North Malay Basin. We see increasing upside in our high-quality acreage position in the Bakken, where we continue to drive top quartile operational performance and leverage our infrastructure advantage. And finally, we are entering a key phase of exploration in Kurdistan and appraisals in Ghana. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly: Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2013. The corporation generated consolidated net income of $386 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $1,925,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted earnings were $446 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $319 million in the previous quarter. Turning to Exploration and Production. E&P had income of $508 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $1,029,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013. E&P adjusted earnings were $514 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $436 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The changes in after-tax components of adjusted earnings were as follows : higher realized selling prices increased earnings by $46 million, lower operating costs increased income by $56 million, lower exploration expenses improved earnings by $15 million, lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $12 million. All other items net to a decrease in earnings of $27 million, for an overall increase in first quarter adjusted earnings of $78 million. Our E&P crude oil operations were under-lifted compared with production by approximately 1.1 million barrels in the quarter, which decreased after-tax income by approximately $35 million. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was 39% for the first quarter of 2014 and 38% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Turning to Corporate and interest. Corporate and interest expenses, net of income taxes, were $89 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $115 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted Corporate and interest expenses were $81 million in the first quarter, down from $108 million in the fourth quarter. The decreased costs in the first quarter were a result of lower interest expenses and reduced employee-related costs. Turning to downstream. The downstream businesses reported losses of $33 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with income of $1,011,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted earnings were $13 million in the first quarter compared to an adjusted loss of $9 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, reflecting improved trading results. Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter, including a decrease of $248 million from changes in working capital, was $1,158,000,000. Net proceeds from asset sales were $1,237,000,000. Capital expenditures were $1,444,000,000. Common stock acquired and retired amounted to $1,043,000,000. Repayments of debt were $333 million. Common stock dividends paid were $79 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $22 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $526 million. Turning to our stock repurchase program. During the first quarter, we purchased approximately 12.6 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $1 billion or $79.33 per share, bringing cumulative purchases through March 31 to 31.9 million shares at a cost of $2.54 billion or $79.53 per share. We have continued to buyback our common stock. And through April 29, total program-to-date purchases were 33.6 million shares at a cost of $2.68 billion or $79.84 per share. We had $1,288,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2014, compared with $1,814,000,000 at the end of last year. Total debt was $5,576,000,000 at March 31, 2014, down from $5,798,000,000 at December 31, 2013. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at March 31, 2014, was 18.7%, which was improved from 19% at the end of 2013. Turning to second quarter 2014 guidance. I would like to provide estimates for certain metrics. For the second quarter, E&P cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent are estimated to be in the range of $22 to $22.50 per barrel. The expected increase in cash cost per barrel over the $21.11 in the first quarter of 2014 is primarily related to lower production volumes following the asset sale in Thailand as pro forma cash costs were $22.17 in the first quarter. E&P depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses per barrel are estimated to be in the range of $28 to $28.50 for the second quarter. The increase from the $25.19 per barrel in the first quarter of 2014 is primarily due to higher production volumes in the Bakken, lower volumes at the JDA due to a planned shutdown and the impact of selling assets in Thailand, which were not being depreciated while classified as held for sale. Full year 2014 unit cost guidance of $20.50 to $21.50 per barrel for cash costs, and $29 to $30 per barrel for depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses remains unchanged. For the full year 2014, the E&P effective tax rate is still expected to be in the range of 37% to 41%, and the second quarter rate is expected to be in the range of 37% to 39%. The estimate for Corporate expenses in 2014 remains in the range of $125 million to $135 million after taxes. And after-tax interest expenses are still estimated to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million. Second quarter Corporate expenses are expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million, and interest expenses are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Yes. Earlier in the week, there was a retail acquisition [indiscernible] 14x forward EBITDA. It was a utilization reminder of MLP structure for wholesale fuels business and ability to characterize some of that retail site value as wholesale fuel and thus MLP qualifying income. So, I mean, my question is have you examined the potential MLP value in your retail assets? And do you consider that potential value when you consider the value in a sale process? And I have a follow-up. John B. Hess: Yes, Evan. As you well know, our divestiture process for our Retail business is well advanced. We certainly are prepared to move forward with a spin, and at the same time, we're conducting a parallel process to look at all of our other options, including outright sale. And the process is well underway. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. The transaction surely highlights the value there. Can you share a tax basis in the retail? John P. Rielly: What we're going to do, Evan, is anything related to disclosures on that would come through future SEC filings. So should we pursue a spin option. So again I think, as John said, we're well advanced in the processing, and that's where we want to be right now from a disclosure standpoint. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Fair enough. Can you give me the tax basis on the electric JV interest sale or the tax implications there? John P. Rielly: Sure. The gain on sale on that transaction will be limited. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. And maybe at the risk of a similar response, on potential MLP-able assets, I'm not asking in EBITDA figures, but can you discuss any potential assets outside the Bakken, which is clear that may qualify, Gulf of Mexico, for instance, with Tubular Bells platform investment or anything that's outside of the Bakken would be helpful. John P. Rielly: So our clear focus right now is focusing on our Bakken midstream assets, and that's where our efforts are going right now. And we're still on track I think on the guidance that we've been saying. So by 2015, we look to have a monetization event relating to those Bakken midstream assets. We plan to get SEC filings in place here in the second half of the year for that. Over time, yes, we have other midstream assets in our portfolio that could ultimately be dropped into that. But that will be at a later point. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. Maybe lastly, if I could. Just on Tioga. Can you just remind us of third-party volumes we should expect there before you fully fill the plant just so I kind of can understand that? Gregory P. Hill: Yes. So I could give you a sense of current volumes right now, Evan. Right now, the plant end-up rates are about 120 million to 140 million cubic feet a day. And roughly 70% of that is Hess-operated production and third is -- and 30% is third party. So obviously as we ramp our production up, our volumes will go up. But our plan is to fill that plant to capacity of 250 million cubic feet a day as rapidly as we can. And then we're also looking at ways to de-bottleneck that facility to further increase the capacity to 300 million cubic feet or higher. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Ed Westlake from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Yes. Just a very quick follow on from Evan's conversation on retail, and again you may not give this. But you had I think $13 million in the downstream in the first quarter. Do you have a number for what was sort of retail-only EBITDA within that? John P. Rielly: [indiscernible] of the divestiture process. Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Understood. Okay. A question for Greg then on the down spacing. We've been tracking some of the other sort of down spacing tests in the industry, and some of them started a little bit earlier. So we've got a bit more data. We find that the EURs are in the sort of 400 MBOE range, i.e., slightly lower than where the sort of original wells would be. But obviously, you get a saving in terms of the costs. So I'm just getting a sense of do you see this playing out as sort of just an area where you can add inventory, but the returns will fall? Or is this an area where you think you can actually sort of sustain the current levels of returns. And if that's the case, do you see yourself throwing more rigs at the play once you've got this down spacing test, your own tests finished? Any color there would be helpful. Gregory P. Hill: Okay, great. Thanks, Ed. I think first of all, just to say it's early days for us. We've got 17 well pads planned with these 13 wells per DSU. So that's 7 and 6. 7 in the Middle Bakken and 6 in the Three Forks. Early field results, although limited, are very encouraging. We're seeing very little interference in those wells. So I think there's a good chance that if that continues, these will be very, very high return wells just like the current wells are. We're also doing 2 well pads that have 17 per DSU. So that's a 9 and 8, but those will come a little bit later in the year. Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And then maybe in terms of the geology, I mean, how much of your acreage do you think this in the sweet spot for doing the down spacing? Obviously, not all of the acreage has the Middle Bakken and Three Forks potential. Gregory P. Hill: Yes, I think that depends. That's why we're doing 17 well pads because we're going to try and spread those around the field because obviously in other areas, say, on the anticline where you have a lot of natural fracturing, you might see higher interference in that area of the field. So that's why we're putting these pads all around the field to try and really assess where could we apply this, right? Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Doug Leggate from BoA. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I've also got I guess a follow-up first on the Bakken. I guess I would probably slightly disagree with Ed's conclusions there on the down spacing, given what Continental's been doing. But my question to you guys is, you're drilling half your program this year on down spacing tests. So I would -- I guess, Greg, what I'm kind of thinking is you're managing to your inventory in terms of drilling activity. If it turns out that the 7 and 6s work but yet your current plan is 5 and 4s as I understand it, what does it do to your activity level in terms of future planning, future rig activity and ultimately, production targets out of the Bakken? Gregory P. Hill: Well, I think as we've said, Doug, our current plan, which is 5 and 4 has 150,000-barrel-a-day target or peak in 2018 with 1.1 million barrels -- or billion barrels recoverable. Obviously, if we go to 7 and 6, that number's -- all those numbers are going to go up because the number of operated drilling locations will go up as well. And so I think you can do the math and figure out that things will go higher. Now what we haven't done yet is determine what rig pace, if this is successful, what rig pace will we prosecute on that acreage. We'll make that decision at the end of this year, and that'll be part of our business planning as we go forward in 2015 plus. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. My follow-up I guess is kind of related because it relates to the strength of your cash flow. And, John Hess, I guess the philosophical question here is you've got midstream spending in Tubular Bells that kind of falls off this year. It seems that on a pre-working capital basis, your run rate is about $5.6 billion streets [ph] below that, and you haven't even have the growth in the second half of the year. So it's kind of looking like the cash flow is very, very strong. You're selling more assets, your buybacks clearly look like that's conservative. So can you prioritize for us the use of cash as you look beyond perhaps the current year, given all of those moving parts? John B. Hess: Sure. Well, the first priority will be to invest for future growth with our balanced approach among unconventionals exploitation and exploration to underpin the 5% to 8% average growth rate going through to 2017 and obviously, want to position beyond that. Obviously, as we move out and our lower risk cash-generative growth increases, there will be more money to consider then besides which we put in investing for growth to increase cash returns to shareholders. So when we get there, obviously, that'll be a priority as well. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So when would you anticipate making a decision on the buyback authorization because that looks like you're going to chew through the $4 billion in fairly short order. John B. Hess: Doug, that decision will be made when the ultimate decision is made for do we spin or sell our Retail business. And then the $4 billion share buyback authorization, that's when we would be focused on do we increase it or not. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Guy Baber from Simmons & Company. Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division : Guy Baber with Simmons. I had a question on the offshore portfolio, but you guys obviously had a very strong offshore production this quarter at both Valhall and then despite some downtime early in the quarter, it looks like Gulf of Mexico did pretty well also. So I was just hoping you could provide some incremental detail around the strong Gulf of Mexico output, specifically what drove that? How sustainable might that be as we think about the rest of the year? And has production, in fact, been better than what you expected internally? And then at Valhall, can you just talk a little bit about confidence and the sustainability of some of the improvement, the uptime and reliability of that asset, just given its importance to your overall outlook? Gregory P. Hill: Yes. Let me talk about Valhall first, and then I'll go to the Gulf of Mexico. So in Valhall, we've established regular executive level engagements with BP management all the way up to Bob Dudley. And we're actively progressing an agreed plan between our 2 companies. And we're encouraged by the progress that BP is making. In Q1, we saw 2 producers brought online following workovers, and facilities reliability has been considerably improved. So they've worked through a number of the issues. After the redevelopment start up, it was dragging the right reliability down. So we're cautiously optimistic that, that can be sustained, the higher reliability, because it's brand-new kit, it's brand-new equipment out on the platform. Regarding the Gulf of Mexico, the big increase, of course, quarter-on-quarter was at Llano followed by Conger. Now that was, if you recall, Shell had a pipeline go down for 22 days in December. That all came back in January. The Llano contributions actually from the Llano 4 well, that was brought on very late in November. So that's a sustainable volume going forward. And as we mentioned, Valhall was at 37. So that's good performance from Valhall as well. Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division : Okay, great. And then I had a follow-up just on -- I just wanted to run through the 2Q production guidance again. I think you mentioned it would be flat effectively quarter-on-quarter. But you do have a pretty significant ramp-up in the Bakken at 15,000 barrels a day. I apologize if I missed this, but did you mention any major turnaround activity for 2Q that would be offsetting? Or is there just an element of conservatism embedded in the guidance? John P. Rielly: Yes. So let me just kind of walk you through the math. Thanks for the question. So if you look at 297, which was the first quarter 2014 pro forma production, you can add about 18, which is Bakken and some minor growth in South Arne. And then you have to back off about 11,000 to 12,000 barrels a day due to the planned downtime in JDA. So we're taking that JDA facility down in June to do some tie-ins for the booster compression. So that's where you get the offset of the growth in the Bakken and the small amount in South Arne. And then there's some other very small differences. That gets you to around 300, which is the upper end of the guidance on the 2Q 2014 pro forma. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Yes. I guess could we talk a little bit more about the Utica just in terms of -- it's a reasonable increase, the number of wells. There've been a number of other players in this space taking write-downs and backing away. Could you just sort of walk us through what -- obviously, we have the details here in the presentation, but kind of walk us through what you're seeing terms of liquids production there. Are you seeing anything in the way of oil strictly condensate? And then the process of moving that out of there at this point. John B. Hess: Yes. So let me just put some context on it first. So we're continuing to delineate the play and improve our understanding of our core JD [ph] acreage position. So we're very encouraged by our findings to date, which show that the majority of our -- that 43,000 core net acres that we have in the JD [ph] is located in the play's wet gas sweet spot. Now, recall we have a very high net revenue interest here, about 95%, which really turbocharges the economics. And that acreage is largely held pipe [ph] production are owned in fee. And so then if you look at where we're at in the appraisal process though, we've drilled to date, so this is an inception-to-date, we've drilled about 42 wells. However, we've only tested about 15 so far. So we're still pretty early. But the well results are very encouraging. And if you average all those well results in that kind of wet gas area, it's about 1,800 barrel equivalents per day, and it'll be liquids rates that we quoted in our remarks in the opening. So very high liquids rates, very good rates. So we remain encouraged. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then in terms of where the I guess the liquid, the condensate side of that is moving. I mean, I know it's not huge numbers just yet, but no, is it staying local or are you having to shift it somewhere else? John B. Hess: Yes. No, I mean, it's being moved to various markets, right? Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then my last question on the exploration side or I guess now it's moved to appraisal in Ghana, got the appraisal wells. As I understood it from previous discussions, there may be some additional agreements to go with the Ghana government. Any update of where we are there or how should we think about the timeline of Ghana, assuming a reasonable success rate out of the appraisal program? Gregory P. Hill: Yes. I think as we said in our opening remarks, the rig is going to show up mid-May, and then we'll prosecute the appraisal program. So by year end, we should have a good understanding of what we have in the appraisal program in Ghana. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : And then beyond that, I mean, is it a negotiation with the Ghana government -- how should we think about the process working from that point? Gregory P. Hill: Well, after that, you have to file a development plan with the government assuming that you go forward. And yes, there will be some negotiation in that development plan, but that would be the next step. So that would be a 2015 item that we'd get our development program through the government. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Maybe, to Greg, the first one on Ghana. You're talking about farmdown your partner going to pay a disproportion on the appraisal program. Can you give us some idea that what is up to? Gregory P. Hill: We can't yet. That's confidential, commercially confidential with the partner. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I see. So you can't disclose who is the partner also I presume. Gregory P. Hill: No, we can't, not yet. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Not yet. In the -- I think that when you're talking about Valhall for the full year, talking about 30, 35. Since the first quarter, you did 37. If that means that we have some major downtime in the second or third quarter? It doesn't look like it's second. So should we assume that third quarter, they're going to have some meaningful maintenance downtime? Gregory P. Hill: Yes. There will be some seasonal downtime in the North Sea every year in that third quarter. And then you'll have some normal decline at Valhall as well. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I see. And maybe this is for John Rielly. John, when I'm looking at the first quarter exploration expense, I know that this is close to impossible item to be really precisely predict. But should we view that as somewhat of a normalized run rate going forward because that is much lower than what we typically experience or that normally expected from the company over the last several years. John P. Rielly: So in the first quarter, right, there was very limited dry hole expense in there. The only thing that was in there was the noncommercial portion of the Kurdistan well, the Triassic section. So there was only a $10 million dry hole in there. So from outside of that, you could call it typical type of run rate there, but we are drilling. There's going to be exploration drilling. It's continuing in Kurdistan. It's continuing in Ghana. So just like you said, Paul, it's very difficult to predict exactly what the expense is going to be. Clearly, our expenditures are staying around that $550 million level that we said for the full year, and it will just depend on the success of the wells. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And I think previously that the assumption is that you guys will decide on whether it's a spin or a sell sometime in the second quarter. Are we still looking at the same timeline or now that timeline may have changed a little bit? John B. Hess: No, I think what we would rather do is we're well advanced in the divestiture process, and we'll make the announcement when we're ready to make the announcement. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And for -- 2 final question for John Rielly. On the -- when you're talking about the DD&A going up in the second quarter because of higher Bakken production, we look at it and ballpark estimate, it seems to suggest that the Bakken unit DD&A may be around in the $35 pass. Is that on the ballpark correct? So that we can use it to estimate in the future what should we assume the DD&A as Bakken production go up. John P. Rielly: We haven't been specific on that, Paul, outside of saying that the Bakken DD&A is above our portfolio average, and it is a good bit above the portfolio average. So -- and just to remind you, our cash cost though on the Bakken, outside of like a quarter like this with the gas plant being down, its run rate for the cash costs are in line with our portfolio average or a little bit below. And so again, you've got to look at where we are in the process of developing the Bakken. Obviously, volumes are going to begin here to ramp up. So that volume ramp up will continue to lower our cash cost in the Bakken, as well as we continue to produce out and get more performance history in there, and our DD&A rates will come down over time as well. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. Do you have any idea when that unit DD&A in Bakken will start to trend the other way going down? John P. Rielly: It'll start just slowly each year. So starting in '15 and '16 again as we begin do that, it'll just start to slowly trend down, and you know where our Bakken D&C costs are getting to and the EURs on the wells. So ultimately, it'll track down to that with the inclusion of infrastructure costs. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, final one. On the gas plant, have you guys -- I mean, I presume you're saying that 70% of the gas is Hess operated, but that 30% is outside. So how the NGL extraction, the economic, is that based on a fee base or that you take the commodity risk by buying the gas and then you get whatever that you can sell for dry gas and NGL? Can you help us understand a little bit on the economic how that work? John P. Rielly: Sure. So, I mean, again first, we'll do it from the Hess standpoint and then third party. So on the Hess standpoint, obviously, the economics are just taking the liquids out and getting better pricing for the liquids versus the gas or the wet gas running through the system. So that increases our economics, and you'll see the flow-through of that on our NGL production and the prices that we get. So you'll see that in the press release. As far as third party, when they're coming in, all contracts are different. And so you run on percentage of proceeds-type contracts where you'll get a certain portion of the liquids that come out that come to Hess that we then sell and get that revenue, not production, but we get that revenue associated with that. There are other contracts where some is percentage of proceeds, some is fractionation fees. So we'll get it up. You'll see that actually in our revenue line not in our production lines, but just our revenue line for E&P. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And as we're preparing this for a MLP listing next year, is it a -- any particular strategy from the management standpoint that whether you want to move your contract one way or the other to become more fee-based or that you're still okay with more on sort of the take on the commodity progress given that the 2 revenue streams have a very quite different on the multiple. John P. Rielly: You are absolutely right, Paul. So the economics that I just talked about and the commodity exposure is what Hess will maintain and continue to maintain post an MLP-type transaction. The MLP revenue will be solely fee-based. So the MLP will charge. Even though the contracts will work for Hess, and Hess will maintain all the commodity exposure, the MLP will not have that commodity exposure. It will just be fee-based. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Paul Sankey from Wolfe Research. Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: There's been a tremendous number of moving parts here. Could I just ask you, and forgive me if you've already said some of these things, but could you just repeat what your full year CapEx expectation is for 2014? And to any extent that you can look forward beyond 2014 as to what you think the run rate for the company will be, could you additionally talk about where you think the optimum level of leverage is in terms of debt, debt to capital, et cetera? Whether that's changed over time or whether there's a number that we can just think of? And then could you just talk a little bit about the mechanics of the buyback, which is to say, whether it's just a rated buyback, an opportunistic buyback, anything you could add. John P. Rielly: Sure. So first with the E&P capital guidance, it is $5.8 billion. That is still the number. And obviously, we'll track it as we go throughout the year. I think the next thing you said -- asked was about our leverage or our debt cap type. Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Well, sorry to interrupt. I just wondered whether there was any sort of indication of what CapEx should be. John P. Rielly: Sorry, Paul, yes. So on a go-forward basis, I mean, the guidance that we have been saying is that post 2014 with our capital expenditure profile, we will be free cash flow positive. So we really don't go out and give long-term guidance on where that capital level is, but it's going to be in a range like that of the $5.8 billion, but we're not going to be specific on that right now. The leverage target is not a change for us. The way we think about it is we want to maintain a solid investment-grade credit rating, and so any leverage metrics that we look at are to continue to achieve that solid investment grade, which is BBB+ at least. And then I think the last question... Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Dividend. And I guess I didn't throw in dividends, but I will now, so dividend and buyback. The buyback was just whether there's -- it's a rated kind of ongoing or on opportunistic-type approach. And then any comments you can make on where the dividend might go from here in terms of the big increase you had last year, and what you aspire to do with that going forward? John P. Rielly: And so what we're going to continue as you've seen with our stock buyback, we have a disciplined approach to the buyback, and that is depending on market conditions. And we plan to continue that disciplined approach. I think as John Hess said earlier, we will update post the announcement of the retail transaction, whether it's a spin or it's a sale on where our authorization is for the stock buyback. So we're going to continue that way. And then as far as dividends go, as you know, we did increase the dividend last year. And John had mentioned that as we look at our free cash flow going forward and we have excess free cash flow as production increases, we will be looking at additional current returns to shareholders at that time. Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Great. And then another long-term one, and I'll leave it there. You've learned a lot obviously from a very aggressive process of restructuring. Are we now looking at a terminal point for Hess? Do you have an idea of what the optimal balance of the assets and overall company will be or can we see this as an ongoing under revision-type process? John B. Hess: As you know, Paul, with the completion of our Thailand sale, we've pretty much completed our portfolio restructuring that we announced a year ago on March 4. Retail and Hetco are the only 2 remaining for this year, and they're well underway. Obviously, let's not forget the Bakken infrastructure. That will be a monetization event next year above and beyond anything that we're doing this year. But with the transformation to a pure-play E&P substantially completed, our focus going forward is going to be on operations, driving our lower-risk cash-generative growth and sustainable returns from our portfolio. And any further portfolio reshaping would just be part of the normal course of business operations. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Jeffrey Campbell [ph]. Unknown Analyst : I wanted to ask you going back to the Bakken and the stack test that you're doing, do you model the Three Forks as 4 discrete zones as do some producers in the play or do you think of it in another way? And having said that, what portion of the Three Forks are you landing in the stack zone tests that are upcoming? Gregory P. Hill: Yes. So we have put wells in the second bench of the Three Forks, as well as the first bench of the Three Forks. So we do see some -- we do see some potential in the deeper benches of the Three Forks. Now as I've said before, ultimately, the decisions kind of come down to economics. So does the incremental recovery from putting a well in each bench justify the cost of doing that well? Or can a single well access the majority of the reserves anyway? So that's really going to be the question that we're doing. So we're planning our test to help us answer that question. Regarding the Three Forks in general, we estimate that 60% to 65% of our acreage, core acres will be perspective for the Three Forks. Unknown Analyst : Okay, great. That's helpful. Turning to the Utica quickly. Just I looked at the first quarter '14 well announcement from your partner, and I was just wondering bearing in mind that these wells are line constrained, do you -- would you qualify the performance of the first quarter '14 wells as on average with your other wells that you've published results on accounting of line constraint? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, again, I think we're continuing to delineate the play, and it wouldn't -- I wouldn't want to say that those wells were the same as other wells. Because again in our delineation, we're finding some variation in those well rates. And so no, I wouldn't say those are typical results. Unknown Analyst : Okay. And the last one that I'll -- well, actually, I wanted to ask one of you a quick question quickly. Can you give us any idea of what your current well costs are and what those might look like a year from now? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, so the -- we're still in the appraisal mode. Therefore, the cost of our wells are still pretty high as we're gathering extensive core log and technical data and plus, we continue to experiment with lateral lengths, stage counts and frac size to really try and figure out what is the optimum development plan here. But what I will say is over the past 12 months, we've achieved about a 50% reduction in per foot drilling costs and a 30% reduction in per stage completion costs. So on a per foot and per stage basis, we're seeing the same things happen that happened in the Bakken as we gain efficiencies in our drilling and completion cost, and we expect that trend will continue. Unknown Analyst : And those efficiencies that you're getting, are you already drilling on pads or are these still standalone wells as you're seeing these efficiencies on? Gregory P. Hill: We are. We're drilling on some pads. We've got 3 rigs operating, and some of those are on pads. Unknown Analyst : So is it fair to qualify the reductions that you just identified as being somewhat pad-related? Or is it -- should we think of it another way at this point? Gregory P. Hill: No, it's both pad related and efficiency related. Unknown Analyst : Okay, great. And the last question I want to ask was a little bit more high level. As you're preparing to examine the production and continue drilling in Kurdistan, what's your current take of the progression to be able to export Kurdistan product over the next 12 to 18 months? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, I think we're continuing to develop our commercial strategy on Kurdistan as we speak. John B. Hess: Greg and I were in Kurdistan about a month ago, and leave it to the Kurdish government to give you updates on their export plans. But the physical capacity is there to export to Turkey, and we're pretty confident that if we have a commercial discovery that can be developed, we'll be in a position to be able to export the oil. Operator : And our final question will come from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : First, back to the Utica. You've been saying over the past year that the earliest full-scale development could begin is the first half of 2015. Any changes to that timetable? Gregory P. Hill: No. I think that's our strategy now is to figure out what the full-scale development plan will be in 2015. And that's why we're still experimenting a lot with lateral lengths and frac stages and profit loading and all those things you do to try and figure out what the optimum is. Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then on exploration expense, I mean, obviously, you can't really guide to it. But in Q1, the $119 million was the lowest quarterly number in 3, 4 years minimum. That's not going to be the norm going forward, that run rate is it? John P. Rielly: No. I had mentioned it earlier. It's because we had a very limited dry hole expense in there. The only -- it was about $10 million related to the lower Triassic section of the Kurdistan well. And so that's the only dry hole expense in there. We obviously are drilling in Kurdistan, and the next well is about to spud. And then we've got drilling in Ghana. So it's very difficult to predict, but yes, it should be higher. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

My name is Stephanie, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson: Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President and COO; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess: Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will provide some key highlights on the quarter and the progress we are making executing our strategy. Greg Hill will then review our operations, and John Rielly will go over our financial results. With the sale of our Retail business, which was announced in May, we have essentially completed our transformation to a pure-play E&P company. We have built a focused, balanced portfolio of low-risk, high-margin growth assets, and we are well positioned to deliver 5% to 8% compound average annual production growth through 2017 from our 2012 pro forma base and to generate free cash flow after 2014 based upon a $100 Brent. With regard to our financial results for the second quarter of 2014, net income was $931 million or $432 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted net income per share was $1.38 compared to $1.51 in the year-ago quarter. Cash flow from operations, before changes in working capital, was $1.3 billion. Compared with the second quarter of 2013, our results were impacted by asset sales, which reduced production by 43,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the shut-in of production in Libya, which reduced production by 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Net production in the second quarter averaged 319,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a pro forma basis, excluding divestitures. This represents an increase of 17% from pro forma production of 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the year-ago quarter, excluding Libya. Our production growth is underpinned by 5 key areas : the Bakken in North Dakota, the Utica Shale play in Ohio, Tubular Bells in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Valhall Field in Norway and North Malay Basin in Malaysia. Let's look at highlights from the quarter for these growth assets. Starting onshore, net production in the Bakken averaged 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up 25% from second quarter of 2013, following the successful startup of the expanded Tioga gas plant. We project net Bakken production for the third quarter to average between 85,000 and 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we are on track to deliver our full year 2014 production forecast of 80,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. At the same time, our Bakken team continues to drive our well costs lower. In the second quarter, drilling and completion cost averaged $7.4 million, down 12% from the year-ago quarter. As we have said before, our goal is to deliver the highest value wells, and our results continue to demonstrate that we are consistently delivering wells with some of the highest returns in the Bakken. In the Utica, we and our partner, CONSOL, have a premier acreage position in the wet gas window featuring highly productive wells with high liquids content and high net revenue interests, which will enable us to generate strong financial returns. During the quarter, we continued delineating the play, and well results remain encouraging. While current production is fairly low at this stage, the Utica asset is positioned to be a material contributor to our production growth over the next 5 years. Moving to our offshore assets in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Final commissioning of the Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess has a 57% interest and is operator, is currently underway. We expect Tubular Bells to achieve first production in September and to deliver net production of approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day following the ramp-up period. Regarding the Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% working interest, net production averaged 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. This compares to 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter when production was ramping up following completion of the multiyear field redevelopment project. Our full year net production forecast remains 30,000 to 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Valhall is a long-life material resource that generates significant free cash flow and offers potential in terms of unbooked reserves and production growth. In Malaysia, net production from the North Malay Basin, where Hess is the operator with a 50% interest, averaged 42 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter. The Early Production System commenced in October 2013 and is expected to maintain production at current levels through 2016. During the quarter, we continued to progress full field development, which should result in net production increasing to 160 million cubic feet per day in 2017. Our natural gas assets in the Gulf of Thailand, which include North Malay Basin and the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area or JDA, are material, long-life assets with oil-linked pricing and exploratory upside. Combining our North Malay Basin production with that of the JDA, we anticipate that net production will reach 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day beginning in 2017 compared with 46,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2013. In terms of overall company production, we are on track to deliver our 2014 pro forma production forecast of 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This would be up between 13% and 17% from 2013 pro forma production of 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Capital and exploratory expenditures in the first half of 2014 were $2.5 billion, which was down 23% from the first half of 2013. This decline reflects both improved capital efficiency and increased activity planned for the second half of the year in the Bakken, as well as the impact of asset sales. We continue to project 2014 capital and exploratory expenditures will be $5.8 billion. In terms of divestitures, we reached a major milestone in the second quarter with the agreement to sell our Retail business for a total consideration of $2.9 billion. The transaction is scheduled to close before the end of the year. In addition, we completed asset sales totaling $1.6 billion during the second quarter, comprising the sale of our Exploration and Production assets in Thailand; the sale of our 50% interest in a joint venture power plant under construction in Newark, New Jersey; and an additional 30,000 acres, including related wells and facilities in the Utica dry gas window. The divestiture process for our Hetco Energy trading business is also ongoing. We continue to make progress in our plans to monetize our Bakken midstream infrastructure in 2015 through an MLP structure, which will allow Hess to retain operational control while realizing additional value from our infrastructure investment. As we announced today, we expect to file our initial Form S-1 with the SEC in the fourth quarter this year. Based upon the sale of our Retail business, we increased our share repurchase authorization to $6.5 billion from $4 billion. Year-to-date through July 29, we have repurchased 23.3 million shares for $2 billion. Since commencement of the program in August of 2013, we have repurchased 42.6 million shares for $3.5 billion. We will continue to implement this program in a disciplined manner and provide quarterly updates on future conference calls. In closing, we are delivering strong performance and executing well against our plan to drive cash-generative growth and sustainable returns for our shareholders through a focused, balanced portfolio of world-class E&P assets. We are excited about the future we are building, and look forward to talking more about our portfolio and growth prospects at our Investor Day, which will take place on November 10 in Houston. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory P. Hill: Thanks, John. I'd like to provide additional details on the execution of our strategy. In the second quarter, we again demonstrated continuing strong delivery against plan. Starting with unconventionals. In the second quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from 63,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of 2014. In the second quarter, approximately 30% of our operated oil was produced from the Three Forks, and some 30% of our wells were completed in the Three Forks. This demonstrates the high quality of our acreage position in the Three Forks, as well as the Middle Bakken. First gas was introduced to the Tioga gas processing plant on March 23. First residue gas sales commenced on March 25 and ethane recovery on April 23. The plant will be a major enabler for us to reduce flaring to less than 10% by 2017. Plant gross inlet capacity has increased to 250 million cubic feet per day, and natural gas liquids processing capacity has more than doubled to approximately 50,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day. Current plant gross inlet volumes are approximately 180 million cubic feet per day, and we are processing approximately 35,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day of natural gas liquids. Looking forward, we intend to debottleneck the plant to enable processing of up to 300 million cubic feet per day. In the second quarter, we operated 17 rigs and brought 53 Bakken wells online compared to 30 wells in the first quarter. Our plan is to bring a further 140 to 150 wells online over the course of the second half of this year. In the third quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average between 85,000 and 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and our full year 2014 Bakken production guidance remains at 80,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Drilling and completion cost continue to be reduced with the second quarter averaging $7.4 million per well versus $8.4 million per well in the year-ago quarter and $7.5 million per well in the first quarter of this year. We continue to make significant progress in drilling cycle time improvements. Compared to the year-ago quarter, we have seen a 19% decrease in spud-to-spud days, which leads not only to lower drilling cost, but also accelerates production. This continuing cost reduction, coupled with the above-average productivity of our wells, means we are delivering some of the highest returns in the Bakken play to our shareholders. Our 13 and 17 well per DSU down spacing pilots are progressing well and performing in line with expectations. These pilots are critical for us to determine optimal spacing across play. By the end of this year, we expect to have sufficient data to provide updated guidance for well spacing, production, forward drilling location and estimated recoverable resources. In the Utica, the divestment of our 100% owned dry gas acreage to American Energy Partners is allowing us to focus on a more profitable wet gas area of the play. The appraisal and early development of our 43,000 core net acres in the Hess-CONSOL joint venture continues to be encouraging. In the second quarter, the joint venture drilled 10 wells, completed 11 and tested 5. So in total, the joint venture has now drilled 52 wells, completed 37 and tested 20 since inception in 2012. Results on our recent Cadiz B wells in Harrison County are particularly encouraging with rates of up to 3,450 barrels of oil equivalent per day with 51% to 53% liquids based on 24-hour test. Turning to offshore. Progress continues in Tubular Bells, North Malay Basin and Valhall. At our 57% owned and operated Tubular Bells development in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we remain on time and on budget. We have completed wells A, B and D and remain on target for field startup in September 2014. We expect net production to build to approximately 25,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day within 8 weeks of first oil. Also in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stampede development project, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we continue to progress, and project sanction is expected later this year. Stampede is a Miocene development that will build on the successful execution of our Tubular Bells project. At the North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess holds a 50% working interest and is operator, second quarter net production averaged 42 million cubic feet per day through the Early Production System. Regarding the fuel field development project, we signed a gas sales agreement with the Malaysian government, awarded contracts for the construction and installation of the central processing platform and for wellhead platforms, and we progressed construction of a gas export system. Upon completion of full field development in early 2017, net production is expected to increase to 160 million cubic feet per day. At the BP-operated Valhall Field in Norway, in which Hess has a 64% interest, second quarter production was reduced by approximately 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to the first quarter. This is primarily due to a temporary reduction of south flank production due to a mechanical problem now resolved and the need to shut in the G4 producer during well G3 drilling operations. G3 has now finished drilling, and we expect G4 will be restarted in August. We expect full year production guidance for Valhall to remain unchanged at 30,000 to 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Looking ahead to the third quarter. Planned seasonal maintenance shutdowns are scheduled this summer at our Gulf of Mexico and North Sea assets, which, combined, are expected to reduce third quarter production by approximately 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Company-wide production, on a pro forma basis and excluding Libya, is forecast to average between 300,000 and 305,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter of 2014. Our full year 2014 forecast on the same basis remains unchanged at 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moving to exploration. In Kurdistan, where Hess has a 64% interest, the Shakrok-1 well encountered noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons and was plugged and abandoned. We are currently drilling the Shireen-1 well on the Dinarta block, where we expect to drill and complete testing by year-end 2014. In Ghana, in the second quarter, Hess and its partners commenced drilling a 3-well appraisal program. The first well, Pecan 2A, was completed in June, and the second well, Pecan 3A, was drilled and logged, and we are now preparing to production test the well. The third well, which will appraise the Almond discovery, is expected to be drilled on the third quarter. By year end, following completion of the appraisal program, we will provide an update on results and our forward plans. In closing, this quarter is yet another demonstration of strong execution against our plan and on-target delivery of key milestones. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly: Thanks, Greg. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2014. The corporation generated consolidated net income of $931 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared with $386 million in the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted net income was $432 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $446 million in the previous quarter. E&P had income of $1,057,000,000 in the second quarter and $508 million in the first quarter of 2014. E&P adjusted net income was $483 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $514 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted net income were as follows. Higher sales volumes for crude oil and NGLs, partially offset by lower gas volumes, increased net income by $71 million. Changes in realized selling prices increased net income by $7 million. Higher cash cost decreased net income by $54 million. Higher depreciation, depletion and amortization decreased net income by $43 million. Higher exploration expenses decreased net income by $39 million. All other items led to an increase in net income of $27 million for an overall decrease in second quarter adjusted net income of $31 million. Our E&P crude oil operations were over-lifted compared with production by approximately 550,000 barrels in the quarter, which increased after-tax income by approximately $25 million. We currently expect an under-lift of approximately 500,000 barrels in the third quarter. In the second quarter, the corporation added 10,000 barrels per day of Brent crude oil hedges for a total of 40,000 barrels per day for the remainder of 2014 at an average price of $109.17 per barrel. In addition, during the second quarter, the corporation added 20,000 barrels per day of WTI crude oil hedges for the remainder of 2014 at an average price of $100.41 per barrel. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings, was 34% for the second quarter and 39% in the first quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting the mix of earnings. Turning to corporate. Corporate and interest expenses, net of income taxes, were $91 million in the second quarter of 2014 compared with $89 million in the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted corporate and interest expenses were $82 million in the second quarter and $81 million in the first quarter. Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter, including a decrease of $368 million from changes in working capital, was $946 million. Net proceeds from asset sales were $1,610,000,000. Capital expenditures were $1,214,000,000. Common stock acquired and retired amounted to $692 million. Net borrowings amounted to $431 million. Common stock dividends paid were $77 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $52 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $952 million. Turning to our stock repurchase program. During the second quarter, we announced an increase in our existing share repurchase program to $6.5 billion from $4 billion. We also purchased in the quarter approximately 8.3 million shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $768 million or $91.85 per share, bringing cumulative purchases for the program through June 30, 2014, to 40.2 million shares at a cost of $3.3 billion or $82.09 per share. We've continued to buy back our common stock. And through July 29, total program to date purchases were 42.6 million shares at a cost of $3.5 billion or $83.03 per share. We had $2,240,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2014, compared with $1,814,000,000 at the end of last year. Total debt was $6,077,000,000 at June 30, 2014, up from $5,798,000,000 at December 31, 2013. In June, the corporation issued $600 million of notes, comprised of $300 million of 1.3% notes due in June 2017 and $300 million of 3.5% notes due in July 2024. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at June 30, 2014 was 20% and 19% at the end of 2013. Turning to the 2014 guidance. I would like to provide estimates for certain metrics. For the third quarter, E&P cash operating cost per barrel of oil equivalent are estimated to be in the range of $22.50 to $23.50. And E&P depreciation, depletion and amortization per barrel of oil equivalent are expected to be in a range of $29 to $30. Full year 2014 guidance is now expected to be $21.50 to $22.50 per barrel for cash operating cost, and $28 to $29 per barrel for depreciation, depletion and amortization. Total production unit cost for the full year of $49.50 to $51.50 per barrel remains unchanged. The third quarter E&P effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 33% to 35%, and the full year 2014 rate is now expected to be in the range of 36% to 40%, down from our previous guidance of 37% to 41%. Third quarter corporate expenses are expected to be between $30 million and $35 million after taxes. And after-tax interest expenses are expected to be in a range of $55 million to $60 million. The estimate for corporate expenses in 2014 remains in the range of $125 million to $135 million after taxes, and after-tax interest expenses are now estimated to be in the range of $215 million to $225 million, down from our previous guidance of $225 million to $235 million. Turning to midstream. As we announced earlier this morning, we are pursuing the formation of a master limited partnership for our Bakken midstream assets. We expect to file an initial registration statement with the SEC in the fourth quarter. The SEC imposes restrictions on communications when a securities offering is in process. We are, therefore, limited in the information that we can share with you at this time, and we will not be able to answer questions about future plans and expectations for the MLP on this call. As we move to the offering process towards an IPO, we will continue to be restricted in the information that we can give you other than the information provided in the registration statement. This concludes my remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : [indiscernible] and good results. My question is on the Bakken and Hess' approach to completion design and technological change. First, I mean, have you experimented or do you plan to experiment with coiled tubing completion technologies in the Bakken? I know a few others are beginning to use these completions, and Schlumberger recently highlighted at its Analyst Day the potential to significantly improve frac effectiveness via those completions. And I have a follow-up, please. Gregory P. Hill: Yes, Evan, thanks for the question. In fact, I just had a review of that yesterday. So yes, we are planning to deploy some coiled tubing completions and give it a try. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. And any -- I mean, I just hop [ph] on any other variables that you're experimenting with and in the process there in isolating whether it's completion variables, well design variables or being a kind of faster adopter to change? I mean, can you just talk about your approach there as things continue to rapidly change? Gregory P. Hill: Yes. I think first of all, our current standard design is 35 stages now. That's compared to 29 last year. So we've upped our stage count. So we've also upped our sand loading a bit to around 100,000 pounds per stage. We just continue to learn and watch and try new things to see what the best approach is, pay close attention to what competitors are doing as well and then try -- and to try some of those things on our own and see what the results show us. So... Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And slick water fracs? I mean, any kind of potential there to limit decline rates? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, we're evaluating that as well, the slick water. We haven't run one yet, but we're going to do that. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. That's great. And then maybe lastly for me, I mean, the Analyst Day is a new announcement. I know it's been a while since you had one. I know there's been significant portfolio changes. What drives your decision? What does the Street not understand about the Hess story in your view? And I'll leave it at that. John B. Hess: Well, we wanted to get the portfolio restructuring to a pure-play E&P behind us and with the announcement of the retail sale in May and God willing, Tubular Bells ramping up, and Bakken ramping up, and Utica ramping up, we thought it would be a good time to give an update on the performance of our assets in deeper detail, as well as some of the exciting investment growth opportunities we have. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Baber with Simmons & Company. Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division : I had 2 on production. One, near term and then one longer-term question. So I wanted to talk a little bit about the 3Q guidance. You mentioned 300,000 to 305,000 barrels a day pro forma, which looks a little conservative even in light of the 20,000 barrels a day of maintenance that you called out just considering that you should get back some significant JDA maintenance from last quarter and then you have Bakken ramping up. Are there any other negative offsets in the 3Q number that we need to be thinking of? And was the maintenance really kind of what keeps you leaving your full year guidance unchanged, considering you guys have outperformed 1Q and then outperformed 2Q and things seem to be ramping according to plan? And then I have a follow-up after that. Gregory P. Hill: Okay. Yes, I think the maintenance is a routine. It was part of our forecast. So if you look at kind of a walk down between second quarter and third quarter pro forma guidance, as mentioned, the Bakken, we plan an increase there, but the -- all of the offset to that is the maintenance shutdowns that we talked about in the Gulf of Mexico and in the North Sea. So there's no other thing going on other than maintenance and being partially offset by the Bakken. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. That's helpful. And then on -- my follow-up is on longer term, your E&P production guidance. You mentioned that the Bakken, Utica, Valhall and North Malay Basin are really the major assets that underpin that longer-term growth, and you've given us a pretty specific framework around how to think about the contribution from all of those assets aside from the Utica. So I was hoping you could just provide a little bit more color around how we should be thinking about that multi-year ramp in the Utica, and kind of what type of volumes you think you could deliver there? Or is that something that we'll need to wait for, for the Analyst Day? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, I think, again, we're continuing the appraisal program in the Utica, and our plans would be to, certainly by the end of the year, to give much more visibility on the forward growth plans for the Utica. But again, we're very encouraged by what we see in the Utica. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I've got 2 questions, if I may. One for Greg and one for John, if that's okay. Greg, the supplemental information you said during the call here, and it looks like the average 30-day rates of the wells you brought on in the second quarter were quite a bit up and have been trending higher over the last, I guess, 6 quarters or so. There was also a just slight change in the mix towards Three Forks well, it seems. I'm just wondering if you could help us connect the dots as to what's happening there that might be driving that improvement, and whether or not you think it's sustainable. I've got a follow-up, please. Gregory P. Hill: Yes, I think, Doug, it's related to 2 factors. One is increasing the stage count. So our standard design now is 35. In the quarter, we showed 33. That's because we had a few wells where we used lower-stage counts intentionally and some 6 40 patterns. But the average IP for the quarter was over 1,000, and that was driven by -- there were over 20 new wells in the quarter that averaged well over 1,000 barrels a day. 15 of those were Middle Bakken, and 5 were Three Forks. So it's a mix of where we're drilling but also the higher stage counts. So I think certainly, from the higher stage counts, that is sustainable, but rates will creep up relative to historic. Obviously, the mix will change as you kind of move around the field. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. I understand. John, my other question's a capital expenditure question because, this year, I seem to recall you had about $400 million on TD [ph] and a bit on midstream and now that you have obviously announced the MLP and TD goes away, I'm assuming that the CapEx same-store sales kind of thing would be lower next year unless you step up activities. So given that you're in a very strong growth trajectory in the second half of the year, have to imagine cash flow doesn't go up. So my question is, how do you think about the use of that free cash flow? Will buybacks only add through proceeds from asset sales? In other words, with operating cash flow, should we realistically think that, that goes to organic growth and perhaps a step up in the Bakken, given your positive results from your down-spacing? John P. Rielly: So thanks, Doug. And yes, I mean, so now as you begin to see the Tubular Bells comes on, Bakken continues to ramp, Utica begins to grow. So obviously, there's some nice cash margins coming in, and our cash flow will continue to grow as this production increases. And to your point on where we are with our portfolio, and we haven't laid out where capital is going to be next year. But as we said, we are looking to become free cash flow positive post 2014 with Brent prices that stay at least $100. And so where we are from a focus on our free cash flow generation is that we are focusing on executing that strategy to profitably grow those -- that production in reserves to generate that cash flow and generate hopefully enhanced shareholder value. And then we'll continue to allocate capital to growth opportunities that offer the highest risk adjust returns, but we'll be balancing those investments in the business with current returns to shareholders. So it's not just asset sale proceeds. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So to be clear, John, previously I believe you've said that sales proceeds would fund buybacks. So should we look for organic cash flow to fund buybacks or would that be more skewed towards dividend? I'm just trying to understand if you're changing your position a little bit on the use of operating cash flow. John P. Rielly: So where we are right now in the strategic transformation that we went through? Yes, it was the proceeds and basically an excess cash flow from the proceeds. We were utilizing those to buy back shares. But as we get past that, and now we're in our -- that was a nonrecurring cash flow that came in, and we used that proceeds for that. When we get to the organic cash flow, yes, that can be balanced, and we'll be looking for the high-risk returns that we have within the portfolio, and we'll balance the use of that cash flow for that with current returns to shareholders. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Unknown Analyst : This is Zack Dushane [ph] standing in for Ed right now. So couple of questions, first regarding the Bakken. We've seen some good results from Blue Buttes and Hawkeye up in McKenzie County, and I know you guys have touched on this a little bit. We're trying to understand is the uplift from new completion technology used here that isn't used elsewhere? Or do you see it more as a geology sort of focus? So you could just address that and I have a quick follow-on. Gregory P. Hill: Well, again, it's both in the quarter. So certainly, where we are drilling matters. We are drilling in some good sweet spots right now, both for the Three Forks and for the Middle Bakken. And then as I said, with the stage counts going up and proppant loadings going up a bit, that's obviously contributed to higher IP rates. So it's really a mix of both geology and completion design. Unknown Analyst : Okay. So your new techniques are being used kind of across the board? It's not... Gregory P. Hill: They are. Yes. Our standard design now is 35 stages. Unknown Analyst : Right. Right. And then just a follow-up unrelated. So, and sorry if this was addressed before. Where do you guys see the peak production from the Tubular Bells? Gregory P. Hill: Well, I think what we said in our opening remarks is that we'll bring 3 wells on at first oil. We'll ramp those over a period of about 8 weeks. Gulf of Mexico experience shows that you need to ramp them up slowly so you don't get sand influx. And we think that, that will -- once we get those 3 wells up, we'll be around 25,000 barrels a day and hopefully, there's a little bit upside to that number. But right now, we're quoting 25,000 barrels a day. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : If I could follow up on the Bakken, and maybe it's a slightly more focused way of looking at the earlier questions on use of cash, but what's the right way to think about your management of the pace of development on the Bakken? I realize you won't have down-spacing results until later this year, but a high-level -- what are the governing factors in terms of your Bakken development? Is inventory a governing factor? Is it cash flow, infrastructure and logistics, some or all of the above? And if inventory goes up via down-spacing, does that necessarily increase your long-term activity levels? Gregory P. Hill: Yes. So first of all, once we are complete with the results of all the down spacing pilots by year end, we'll update guidance on pace and recover reserves, all the things that we talked about in our opening remarks. I think the main objective that we're trying to accomplish in the Bakken is to maximize asset value, and that is a function of pace and infrastructure build-out. So we're constantly trying to manage those 2 dimensions to ensure that we maximize ultimate NPV from the Bakken development, because you can go really fast and over build infrastructure that you don't need, and so we're really trying to optimize based on those 2 dimensions to maximize value from the asset. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay. I appreciate that. And then if I could ask one quick one on the Utica as well. I mean, is it -- I'm not sure if it showed up in the supplemental data or if you said, but did you say what the current production -- or could you say what the current production in the Utica is? And maybe talk a little bit about the marketing of your gas, what you have in the way of firm transport and your kind of your medium-term expectation on pricing out of the basin? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, I think in Q2, we produced around 3,000 barrels a day from the Utica. That's our JV acreage with CONSOL. And in Q3, we expect to double that to approximately 6,000 barrels a day and then continue to build through the end of the year. And as we mentioned before, we plan to provide additional data and forecast later in the year on our outlook for the Utica. As far as the gas, we have dedicated third-party contracts in place for 2014 and negotiating new wins for expanding volumes, and we don't expect any bottlenecks or issues. Regarding NGLs and pricing and all that, revenues received by us are on realized spot market prices in the surrounding areas. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And have you signed long-term contracts on the gas side? Gregory P. Hill: No, we haven't. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wells Research. Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Back to the Bakken, I had a couple of questions. The first is fairly specific, and then the second is a high-level question. The specific question is on the Tioga plant and the impact it had on your liquids cut. You've beaten our estimates there. Can we assume that, that cut continues to rise as the plant ramps up? And how much higher can we expect that to go? Gregory P. Hill: I'd just kind of highlight what the Tioga gas plant has done to us in terms of increased capacity. So on the inlet side, the plant can currently process about 250 million cubic feet per day gross on the inlet side. It also -- the expansion increased our liquids processing capability to some 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And if you look at what we're putting through the plant today, it's about 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day gross liquids. So you can see that there's further upside beyond that as we expand to plan capacity. Importantly, we also intend to debottleneck the plant to take the inlet capacity up to 300 million cubic feet a day. So we can see our way to another 50 million coming in at the plant, and we have the liquids capacity to deal with that. Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: And would that then be another potential expansion beyond that debottlenecking? Gregory P. Hill: That'll be a question I think for the MLP in the future to decide. Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: That's what I was driving at without mentioning MLPs. The high-level question is now that you focused the company more towards the Bakken and it's become so important for the story, can you just remind us what your -- what you believe your competitive advantage is? What makes you as good as or better than the competition at the Bakken? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, I think, really, 3 things. I mean, obviously, we've got a great acreage position in both the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks. We have a privileged infrastructure position that we're reaping the benefits now and will in the future. And then thirdly, we have a distinctive operating capability through Lean Manufacturing, and that's people, basically people and culture, and that's what's allowing us to continue to drive down quarter on quarter-on-quarter our well cost and also on productivity. Yes, and we're also scaling that capability over to the Utica, and we're seeing significant reductions in Utica, as well as we leverage those Bakken Lean Manufacturing learnings over to that play also. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I would first make a request. I know you're still in early stage, but you, gentlemen, would be able to share the Utica operating data somewhat similar to the format that you gave on Bakken in the supplemental. It may not be in the next 1 or 2 quarter but, say, a couple of quarters down, that would be really helpful. John P. Rielly: That's something clearly that we're looking at. And especially -- as Greg mentioned, we're focused on getting what our ultimate field development plan will be, and we were planning to add that, but thanks for the comment. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Right. John, since I got you here, maybe let me ask that. The company today is a much stronger company, both financially and operationally, compared to say anytime in the last 5 years. So from that standpoint that, is there a need of continued hedging? Or what is your overall view on the hedging? Should we change it saying that given your position today, you really don't need to do any hedging? John P. Rielly: So what we've said, Paul, is that, looking forward, what we'll do -- you're right. We're in a much better position with our balance sheet, but we will look at our price exposure on an annual basis. We are, we think, privileged because we have our portfolio is tilted towards oil. 70-plus percent of our production reserves are oil-based. So we'll look at our price exposure on an annual basis, and we may hedge to provide some insurance, but it will only be for that 1 year at a time. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And this may be bad news [ph for both John Hess and also Greg. Outside the existing already identified asset sales program for the next, say, 1 to 2 years, should we assume that any additional meaningful asset that you guys will be considered or that you're pretty much done, and that is behind? John B. Hess: Yes, Paul. With the sale of our Retail business, our portfolio restructuring to transform to a pure-play E&P company is substantially complete. Going forward, however, portfolio optimization will be ongoing, to address your question, and be part of the normal course of business, whether it's buying assets or selling assets. Our focus now and in the future is to invest for growth of our production and reserves, deliver strong operating performance from our focus portfolio and most of all, sustain value generation for our shareholders. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : As a final one, yet not related to the quarter. Greg, I was looking at your 10-K on the PV10 table, and I was a little bit surprised that, for Norway, the future development cost is about $8 billion. I thought we already done with all the CapEx spending and it's just incremental well that we need to drill. Why the development expense on that is going to be so high? Does that mean that the CapEx related to Norway will remain high for the coming years? John P. Rielly: Paul, I'll answer that. From a capital expenditure program, there's a decent amount of capital that we are putting in here that will grow for a number of years. If Valhall is, I think Greg has said in the past, we just redeveloped that field. So it's got a 40-year-plus life, the facilities that are on there. So when you look at those PV10, you've got development cost going out for a number, 40-plus years of development cost there. And so there is a well program. And as you said, it's an asset that generates very good cash flow for us, and we'll continue to invest in in-fill in the field. So that's what those development costs are for. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Should we assume -- I'm sorry. John, should we assume that Norway, the CapEx is going to be flat from over the next several year or that is actually should be lower than this year? John P. Rielly: I would assume for now because we haven't given any guidance and we'll go as we get towards the end of the year, and we have to work obviously with the operator, BPB [ph] and the operator, but I would assume that there's some flattish-type CapEx in there because there's opportunities for drilling in the field. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : First one on Ghana. After you wrap up the 3-well appraisal program presumably by the end of the year, is that going to provide you enough data to make a full development decision either way? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, we believe it will. I mean, I think we'll been in a good position to determine what our go-forward strategy is. Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Understood. And then on Kurdistan, I think you mentioned in passing, which you wrote off, a portion of your acreage is followed by one dry hole at Shakrok. Is that right? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, that's right. So the Shakrok well -- although we discovered gas condensate in the Triassic, so there was hydrocarbons in the well, the well was deemed noncommercial. Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Got it. So in other words, is that block essentially kind of leading the scene completely? Gregory P. Hill: In the process of being relinquished, which will take several months, right, but we're drilling the Shireen well now, which is a much larger block, and it appears to be -- and it's offset. So the two are completely unrelated. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC: As you think about the Gulf of Mexico volumes with Tubular Bells coming online and maintenance downtime, just trying to familiarize myself with how you incorporate just normal seasonal hurricane downtime into your annual operating plans. Gregory P. Hill: Yes, that's essentially built into our contingency that we build in every year, and so it's just an average number based upon historic performance of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, and that's just a bottom line correction to our overall production that's built-in. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC: So like 7 days for oil fields and 10 days for -- or 10 days for oil fields something like that. Gregory P. Hill: Yes, round numbers, that's about right. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC: And then on the Tioga gas plant with the expansion and then really the de-bottlenecking just -- this is details, but how do you think about the shrink from inlet to outlet? Is there a change to shrink with the expansion of capacity or what is really, I guess, the outlet gas plus the 50,000 barrels of fluids that you're processing? John P. Rielly: Yes. With the expansion of the plant and obviously, as Greg had mentioned earlier, the boosting of the liquids output, there is a higher shrinkage factor associated with the gas. So you're probably going from a -- previously a 15% type shrinkage to over 50% factor there. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

My name is Gary, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson: Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President, Worldwide Exploration and Production and COO; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess: Thank you, Jay, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will provide some key highlights on the quarter and the progress we are making in executing our strategy. Greg Hill will then review our operations and John Rielly will go over our financial results. I thought it would be appropriate, before discussing our third quarter results, to make a few comments about recent volatility in oil prices. As most of you know, we have used $100 Brent as the basis for our plans even as Brent has averaged nearly $110 for the last 3 years. However, with Brent now at approximately $87 per barrel, we are reviewing our plans and actions that we might take in a lower-price environment. As always, we are taking a disciplined approach to : first, allocate capital to the projects with the highest risk-adjusted returns; second, maintain a strong balance sheet and a high degree of financial flexibility; and third, manage capital and exploratory spending within limits of our cash flow over the long term after continuing to return capital to our shareholders. And we look forward to sharing our plans in more detail with you at our upcoming Investor Day on November 10. Also we will release our 2015 capital and exploratory budget, as usual, in January 2015. Now turning to our financial results for the third quarter of 2014. Net income was $1,008,000,000 or $377 million on an adjusted basis. Adjusted net income per share was $1.24 compared to $1.18 in the year-ago quarter. Cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion. Compared with the third quarter of 2013, our results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and NGL sales volumes and lower exploration expense, which were offset by lower realized crude selling prices and higher depreciation expenses. Net production in the third quarter averaged 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This represents an increase of 17% from pro forma production of 269,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the year-ago quarter, excluding Libya. Now we will review highlights from the quarter. Starting onshore. Net production in the Bakken averaged 86,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, up 21% from the third quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter, we forecast net Bakken production will average between 92,000 and 97,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We continue to focus on drilling some of the lowest-cost, highest-return wells in the Bakken. In the third quarter, drilling and completion costs averaged $7.2 million, down 8% from the year-ago quarter, and our wells continue to be among the most productive in the play. The Utica is positioned to be a material contributor to our production growth over the next 5 years. We and our partner, CONSOL, have a core acreage position in the wet gas window. During the quarter, production averaged 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moving offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess has a 57% interest and is operator, is completing its final checks and is expected to achieve first production within the next week. Following a ramp-up period, Tubular Bells is expected to deliver net production of approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by year-end. Yesterday, we announced that we will proceed with the development of Stampede, a deepwater oil and gas project operated by Hess in the Green Canyon area of the Gulf of Mexico. Hess has a 25% working interest and is the operator. Chevron, Statoil and Exxon each have a 25% working interest. Total recoverable resources for Stampede are estimated in the range of 300 million to 350 million barrels of oil equivalent. First production is expected in 2018. In terms of overall company production, we are on track to average toward the upper end of our 2014 pro forma production forecast of 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. In terms of divestitures, the sale of our retail business closed during the third quarter for cash proceeds of $2.8 billion. The sale of our HETCO energy trading business was announced on Monday and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. Also we continue to negotiate with a potential buyer for the sale of the HOVENSA joint venture refinery in St. Croix, which we hope to complete in the near future. We continue to make progress in our plans to monetize our Bakken midstream infrastructure in 2015 through an MLP structure, which will allow Hess to retain operational control while realizing additional value from our infrastructure investment. During the third quarter, the corporation's wholly owned subsidiary, Hess Midstream Partners LP, filed an initial Form S-1 with the SEC in preparation for its proposed initial public offering in 2015. Based on the sale of our retail business, we increased our share repurchase authorization to $6.5 billion from $4 billion. Year-to-date, through October 28, we have repurchased 34.7 million shares for $3.1 billion. Since the commencement of the program in August of 2013, we have repurchased 54 million shares for $4.6 billion. We will continue to implement this program in a disciplined manner and provide quarterly updates on future conference calls. In summary, we are delivering strong performance and executing our plan. With our focused, balanced portfolio and strong balance sheet, we are well positioned in the current price environment to drive cash-generative growth and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory P. Hill: Thanks, John. I'd like to provide a brief review of the progress we're making in executing our E&P strategy. In the third quarter, we again demonstrated continuing delivery against plan. Starting with unconventionals. In the third quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 86,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2014. We operated 17 rigs and brought 59 Bakken wells online in the third quarter. This was up from 53 wells in the preceding quarter. In the fourth quarter, we plan to have 6 frac crews working and expect to bring more than 80 new wells online. Thus far in October, we have brought 30 new wells online, and net production has averaged 91,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the fourth quarter, we forecast net production in the Bakken to average between 92,000 and 97,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We anticipate that full year 2014 Bakken production guidance will be toward the lower end of our range of 80,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This reflects delays in bringing the Tioga gas plant online at the beginning of the year as well as permitting delays for the Hawkeye South of the River Pipeline, which has prevented additional gas volumes from being processed at the Tioga plant. Inlet volumes to the Tioga plant continue to increase, and the plant is currently processing approximately 160 million cubic feet per day and 31,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day of natural gas liquids. We expect to fill the plant to capacity in 2015 and are evaluating low-cost options to expand the current capacity from 250 million to 300 million cubic feet per day. Our 13 and 17 well per DSU downspacing pilots are progressing well and performing in line with expectations. We will provide an update of the results from these pilots at our Investor Day in November. Drilling and completion costs continue to be reduced in the Bakken with the third quarter averaging $7.2 million per well versus $7.8 million per well in the year-ago quarter and $7.4 million per well in the second quarter of this year. We continue to make steady progress in reducing costs as a result of our unique lean manufacturing approach, and we see room to continue to drive these costs lower. Based on our top quartile drilling and completion cost and the productivity of our wells, we believe we are delivering some of the highest-return wells in the play. In the Utica, the appraisal and early development of our 44,000 core net acres in the Hess-CONSOL joint venture continues to be encouraging. In the third quarter, the joint venture drilled 10 wells, completed 11 wells and brought 18 wells on production. In the third quarter, the joint venture also tested 14 new wells, 7 of which were Hess-operated. Test results from the Hess-operated wells located in Harrison and Belmont Counties averaged approximately 2,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 47% liquids based on 24-hour tests. In the third quarter, net production averaged 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the prior quarter. We intend to provide an update of our forward plans for the Utica at our Investor Day. Turning to offshore. Progress continues in Tubular Bells, Stampede, North Malay Basin and Valhall. At Tubular Bells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 57% working interest and is operator, we are in the final stages of commissioning and anticipate achieving first oil within the next week. From there, we will ramp up net production from 3 wells to approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by year-end. Also in the Gulf of Mexico, the Stampede development project, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, was recently sanctioned by all 4 partners. Building on the successful execution of our Tubular Bells project, Stampede will develop one of the largest remaining discovered Miocene fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and is expected to deliver first oil in 2018. A 2-rig drilling program is planned with the first rig commencing operations in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross topsides processing capacity for the project is approximately 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 100,000 barrels of water injection capacity per day. Gross recoverable resource is estimated to be in the range of 300 million to 350 million barrels of oil equivalent. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% working interest and is operator, third quarter net production averaged 40 million cubic feet per day through the Early Production System. Engineering work continues on the full-field development project, which will increase net production to 160 million cubic feet per day in 2017. In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, third quarter production averaged 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. This was primarily due to a seasonal planned maintenance shutdown. Full year production for Valhall is still expected to average in the range of 30,000 to 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net, supported by 3 new wells, which are planned to be brought on in the fourth quarter. Company-wide pro forma production in the fourth quarter is forecast to be between 330,000 and 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Full year production is forecast to be toward the upper end of our 2014 pro forma production of 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Moving to exploration. In Kurdistan, where Hess has a 64% interest, we resumed drilling in the Shireen-1 well on the Dinarta block earlier this month following a 2-month suspension due to the security situation. We expect to reach total depth in the first quarter of 2015. In Ghana, Hess and its partner successfully completed our appraisal drilling program in the third quarter. Results are encouraging, and once the data from the appraisal drilling and new 3D seismic have been incorporated into our models, we will provide an update as appropriate. In closing, this quarter is yet another demonstration of strong execution against our plan and delivery of key milestones. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly: Thanks, Greg. Hello, everyone. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2014 to the second quarter of 2014. The corporation generated consolidated net income of $1,008,000,000 in the third quarter of 2014 compared with $931 million in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted net income was $377 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $432 million in the previous quarter. Turning to Exploration and Production. E&P had income of $441 million in the third quarter and $1,057,000,000 in the second quarter of 2014. E&P adjusted net income was $412 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $483 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted net income were as follows. Changes in realized selling prices decreased net income by $81 million. Lower sales decreased net income by $23 million. Lower exploration expenses increased net income by $59 million. Lower cash costs increased net income by $20 million. Higher DD&A expense decreased net income by $38 million. All other items net to a decrease in net income of $8 million for an overall decrease in third quarter adjusted net income of $71 million. Our E&P crude oil sales volumes were overlifted compared with production by approximately 300,000 barrels. However, the impact to net income was immaterial in the quarter. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings, was 41% for the third quarter and 34% in the second quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting the impact of a Libyan crude oil lifting in the third quarter. Turning to corporate and interest. Corporate and interest expenses, net of income taxes, were $80 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared with $91 million in the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted corporate and interest expenses were $78 million in the third quarter and $82 million in the second quarter. Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter, including a decrease of $170 million from changes in working capital, was $1,338,000,000. Net proceeds from asset sales were $2,956,000,000. Capital expenditures were $1,362,000,000. Common stock acquired and retired amounted to $903 million. Repayments of debt amounted to $53 million. Common stock dividends paid were $76 million. All other items amounted to an increase in cash of $15 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $1,915,000,000. Turning to our stock repurchase program. During the third quarter, we purchased approximately 9.2 million shares of common stock at a cost of $903 million, bringing cumulative purchases for the program through September 30, 2014, to 49.4 million shares at a cost of $4.2 billion or $85.14 per share. We have continued to buy back our common stock. And through October 28, total program-to-date purchases were 54 million shares at a cost of $4.6 billion or $85.03 per share. Turning to our financial position. We had $4,120,000,000 of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2014, compared with $1,814,000,000 at the end of last year, primarily reflecting the collection of proceeds from the sale of the retail business. Total debt was $5,996,000,000 at September 30, 2014, compared with $5,798,000,000 at December 31, 2013. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at September 30, 2014, was 19.7% and 19% at the end of 2013. Turning to guidance. I would like to provide fourth quarter 2014 guidance for certain metrics. E&P cash operating cost per barrel of oil equivalent are estimated to be in the range of $20.50 to $21.50, and E&P DD&A per barrel is expected to be in the range of $29 to $30. In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur exploration expenses, other than dry hole costs, in the range of $180 million to $200 million. The fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 41% to 43%, excluding Libya. Fourth quarter corporate expenses are expected to be between $35 million and $40 million after income taxes, and after-tax interest expenses are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million. Given the current volatility in crude oil prices, we are providing additional guidance with respect to price sensitivities on fourth quarter results. Based on the fourth quarter guidance provided, we estimate that every $1 change in crude oil benchmark prices will result in a change in fourth quarter net income of approximately $8 million. This estimate includes the impact of the corporation's crude oil hedge contracts outstanding at September 30, 2014. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Ed Westlake of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Yes. I'm sure there's going to be lots of questions on the Bakken and also on the Stampede project. On the Bakken, you've got a $7.2 million well cost. Others are actually increasing their costs to drive the initial cums. and overall recovery is higher. Is your strategy still going to be to try and focus on these, I guess, relatively simpler completions, and they're giving you acceptable returns? Or are you going to go down the route of boosting the, I guess, the frac intensity, et cetera? Gregory P. Hill: Ed, this is Greg. Currently, our standard design is 35 stages, and there's a lot of significant amount of data that supports the sliding sleeve technology as being as effective as plug and perf in terms of IP and EUR as well as being a significant lower cost completion. Now, as always, we continue to experiment and pay very close attention to what competitors are doing, and we've trialed some of these more expensive completion designs, but thus far, none have proven to be economically superior to our methodology. Again we're focused on drilling the highest-return Bakken wells. Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then on Stampede, $6 billion for 320 million F&D cost. I mean, that works probably at a decent level of oil price, and obviously we know it's very deep. But I guess do you think those costs have room to fall, given what's going on in the offshore industry at this point? Or do you think that's a pretty good metric? Gregory P. Hill: Well, certainly Stampede, first of all, is one of the largest undeveloped fields in the GOM, and the project returns are expected to exceed our investment threshold even in this lower-priced environment, and I think it's noteworthy that all 4 partners have sanctioned the project with a final sanction coming in this week. I do think costs do have room. I mean, certainly the diamond rig contract that is tied to this project for 2 years, 7 straight years in total, I think set a new market benchmark for deepwater rig rates. Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I guess my question is, is that included in the $6 billion number? Or is that potentially an optimization around it? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, it is. It is included in the $6 billion number. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I wonder if I could take 2, please. My first one is actually in Norway. So obviously maintenance in the third quarter, but I wonder if you could just give us an update as to how you see the Norwegian production outlook for the potential for BP to really start to ramp this thing over the next couple of years relative to your current guidance. And I guess what's behind my question is : this is obviously a non-declining asset. You're not paying cash taxes on it, but the production contribution always seems to be kind of challenged. So what are your strategic thoughts around what you can do in Norway and whether you're optimistic that it gets better. I've got a follow-up, please. Gregory P. Hill: Yes, Doug. As we've said before and as you mentioned, Norway is a huge cash machine for us. Obviously, with brand-new facilities and 40-year life, we have every interest as does BP to maximize the production off of that facility. And our net production goal is still in the range of 40,000 to 50,000 barrels a day in 2017. So how is it going? Well, we've established regular multilevel executive engagements with BP management. In fact, John and I are flying to London tomorrow for our third meeting, and there's a lot of work left to be done, but we are encouraged by the progress. So the reliability of the plant's better. Recent well results leveraging our South Arne drilling and completion experience are encouraging in terms of both cost and schedule. So cautiously optimistic on Valhall. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. Do you think you can ever get the platform capacity on it? Gregory P. Hill: That's what we're going to try and drive to do. How long that takes, again, is just going to be a function of price, CapEx and delivery from BP. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, my follow-up is on the Bakken, as you would expect, I suppose, but unfortunately, I haven't been able to access the supplement this morning, so I haven't been able to see what latest 30-day rates were like. But I'm guessing that the downspacing wells that you -- I think was about half your program more or less this year, I'm guessing they've been performing pretty much in line with what you'd expected at the beginning of the year. So not to preempt November 10, but I'm just kind of curious as to how you're thinking about the activity level there, given the potential to expand the inventory but traded off against what is obviously looking like a lower oil price. And I guess what's behind my thinking is you're coming into this lower oil price at a very robust balance sheet. So would that be -- would you still look to accelerate activity? Or would you look to moderate to look for the cashable amount? I'll leave it there. Gregory P. Hill: Okay. Well, just to kind of give everyone an update on the downspacing pilots. Just recall in 2014, we have 2 well-designed pilots going on. We have 17 well pads with 13 wells per DSU, and we have 2 well pads with 17 wells per DSU. So those, respectively, represent a 700-foot between well spacing and a 500-foot well spacing. And results so far are in line with expectations. And Doug, we plan to provide a complete update on the downspacing pilots and what it means for our long-term Bakken guidance on Investor Day in November. So stay tuned. Operator : And we have our next question from the line of Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Yes. Maybe somewhat of a follow-up to Doug's comment if I missed it. Did I understand your opening comments, John, that your targeted CapEx to be within cash flow for '15? Or does it -- or is it kind of longer term mean there's some view of normal cash flow and you'd be willing to outspend if we find ourselves in a lower oil price scenario given your cash and balance sheet positions? John B. Hess: Very good question. Look, with our focused, balanced portfolio underpinned in the unconventionals with very strong positions in the Bakken and Utica as well as our offshore and international assets generating free cash flow with some growth and our strong balance sheet, we're really well positioned in the current environment to drive cash-generative growth as well as sustainable returns for our shareholders. So given current prices, we're going to be guided to invest with a disciplined approach to allocate capital to projects with the highest risk-adjusted returns. And remember that our hurdle rate is to meet at least a 15% return, and that accounts for current prices. We're going to be guided to maintain a strong balance sheet and keep our financial flexibility. So accordingly, we'll manage our capital expenditures in line with this, but it is over the long term. So depending upon market movements, we may use our balance sheet some. But I think the important thing is we are going to definitely be guided to live within our cash flow over the longer term while continuing to return capital to shareholders. So the exact details on this, we'll provide you a pretty comprehensive update on November 10. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great, I look forward to that. But maybe a follow-up on that return comment. Hess is moving against a trend offshore with Stampede FID. Well, I know it's been a long time coming. I mean, can you discuss how you compare and analyze returns or payback when making an allocation for new offshore projects versus your unconventional resource opportunity? John B. Hess: Yes, again at current prices, and Greg mentioned this before. It has to meet our hurdle rate of 15% accounting for risk and whether that's an unconventional project or an offshore project, and Stampede met the threshold and in fact, beat it. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. Maybe one last, if I could, and maybe you can't comment due to the filing. But is there -- when you FID a project like Stampede, I mean, is there any MLP-able [ph] component there whether it's topside capacity or otherwise? Or is that all leased? I'll leave it there. Gregory P. Hill: Yes, since we're in the quiet period right now, Evan, we can't make any comments on what potentially could be included in the MLP. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Is it a lease design? Is that what's envisioned? John P. Rielly: On Stampede, no, it's not a lease design. This is being built as -- Hess is the operator. We are building that facility along with our partners. Operator : And next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Great. A question on the Utica, and the Utica has an exceptionally strong quarter. Was that a result of better-than-expected well results, higher completion count? And how should we think about activity levels and production growth there in the fourth quarter and going forward? Gregory P. Hill: Yes. Thanks, Ryan. It was really a combination of both. A little bit of higher activity in terms of getting wells online. We had a real strong quarter there. I think the second thing is, is we are leading the industry in terms of lateral length, so we're drilling 8,800-foot laterals now, which is the longest ones to date at least in the Utica. So that contributed to the strong well results. Regarding future plans for the Utica, we're going to provide again a full update on the results and our forward plans for the Utica at Investor Day in November. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Great. And if I could ask one follow-up as well. In the Bakken, based on -- I guess can you talk a little bit about -- you talked about the activity levels in October. I mean, I think from a completion point of view, to hit your full year targets, you probably need to bring on close to 80 to 90 wells in the fourth quarter. How many rigs are you running right now? And -- I guess, yes, how many rigs are you running in the fourth quarter? And should we be good to be on pace for that 80 to 90 completion target? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, we're on track for that. We're running 17 rigs currently. And as we said in our opening remarks, we're going to have 6 frac crews working, and we expect to bring more than 80 wells online in the fourth quarter. And I think it's important that in -- just to give you some color on that, in October, we've already brought 30 new wells online. So we're on pace to do so. Operator : And the next question comes from the line of Guy Baber of Simmons. Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division : Strategic question for me to start off, but obviously in the Bakken you have a huge core position, very advantaged infrastructure position, operations improving there and you have a conservative balance sheet with a lot of cash. So one could view you longer term, I think, as a natural consolidator in that play. So the question is do opportunistic acquisitions have a part in your strategy fundamentally in the Bakken, particularly if this lower oil price environment were to persist and valuations came in a bit? And along those lines, do you feel the company's positioned in a way to take advantage of those opportunities? And does that think -- or is that impact the way you think about the buyback at all over the next quarters? John B. Hess: Yes. There were a number of questions there. First of all, we're always going to be disciplined in our investment to invest for returns. So we're always going to look to optimize our portfolio, but it's got to be focused on investing for returns and keeping a strong balance sheet. Now the strong balance sheet obviously gives us flexibility. So if there were opportunities out there to optimize our portfolio to strengthen our hand and it met our return threshold, we will have a open mind on that for sure. But having said that, the key is when it comes to investment, we're going to be disciplined focusing on returns, and I've talked about that earlier. In terms of the buyback, it's an ongoing program, and we're going to be disciplined in our approach there. Guy A. Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division : Okay, great. Very helpful, and then a detailed follow-up on the Bakken. Your oil production was actually down slightly quarter-on-quarter despite the overall increase from 80,000 to 86,000 barrels a day. You had a big increase in NGLs. So understanding that the mix can be volatile from one quarter to the next, I was just hoping you could maybe provide some commentary on the drivers there. And as we think about production going forward, should we still be thinking around about an 80% oil cut or so? So if you could just comment on that, that would be helpful. Gregory P. Hill: Yes. So thank you for that, Guy. If you look on a barrel equivalent basis, obviously, our production was actually higher than Q2 and continues to trend upward. What happened in the third quarter was there were some heavy rains in the quarter, and that resulted in some county-imposed road closures, which then led to a higher level of well downtime due to some transportation constraints. So -- and as you mentioned given the typical oil-gas mix of a Bakken well, this downtime preferentially hurts oil production much more than it does gas production. So that's why you've got this swing. Operator : And next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Barclays. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Several -- hopefully 3 short questions. Greg, in Valhall, can you remind us, or maybe this is for Rielly, that when the cash tax is going to resume, is it 2017 or 2018? John P. Rielly: Yes, so the guidance that we've given is that we're not paying cash taxes in Norway through 2017. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. So 2018 will resume. And then earlier when we're talking about a 15% project hurdle rate, just want to clarify that. Is it based on $100 Brent or based on $85 Brent? John B. Hess: Well, our old standard was $100 Brent, but as we allocate capital now, we're going to be disciplined in how we invest. So it would have to meet it at the $85 hurdle. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. So that actually is a change in some way, that it's become tougher or that you raised the bar from previously $100 now to $85 Brent. John B. Hess: Yes, you have to deal with the current reality of where the oil markets are. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. That's good. And John -- this is for Rielly, that fourth -- at the end of the third quarter, from an inventory standpoint, I presume that you are overlift -- any idea of how much you are overlift? John P. Rielly: So for the fourth quarter, just for guidance going forward on the fourth quarter, we don't see an -- basically an under or overlift, a pretty balanced sales volume versus production. Excluding, Paul, it's excluding Libya. So with Libya in there, we could end up, if they have lifts continuing in the fourth quarter, could end up in an overlift position with Libya. But excluding that, from the equation, there's no projected under or overlift in the fourth quarter. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. Great. And that the -- in Utica, Greg, are you running a 3-rig program right now? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, we are, Paul. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : And then how many well is actually in production to contribute the 11,000 barrel per day? Gregory P. Hill: Let's see. The online production well count for the Utica in the third quarter was 4 wells, and we've got -- sorry, I'm looking at my notes here. Sorry about that. So we've got -- in the third quarter, we have 10 -- we have 28 wells that have been drilled year-to-date in the Utica. Sorry, it took me a minute to find that number. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : 28 wells drilled, but how many of them is actually in production? Gregory P. Hill: Look, I'm just looking at my notes, Paul. I'm sorry. It's going to take me just a second. So online in this year, all of the JV wells and our wells, we've got 31 wells online. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. And then do you have a rough split between oil condensate NGL and natural gas in Utica? Gregory P. Hill: So Paul, just -- let me just give you the numbers that we have in the quarter. So of the 11,000 barrels a day, there are -- it's just under 2,000 barrels a day is condensate. Just above 2,000 barrels a day are NGLs, and the rest of it, so on a 7,000 barrels a day oil equivalent is gas. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. Great. And John, can you comment about the press release, talk about HOVENSA sales and that the $1.6 billion number signed [ph] by the government. Does that mean that when you finally decided, should we assume that you will receive any upfront payment from that sales? John B. Hess: We're in the negotiation phase now with a third party, and I wouldn't want to get ahead of ourselves, Paul. When we have something definitive to say, we'll say it. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, a final one. For 2014 exploration expense based on your fourth quarter estimate, it's about call it $460 million. Going forward, is that a reasonable proxy? Or that 2014 is just not drilling a lot of wells so that going forward, the exploration expense may be higher than this level? John P. Rielly: Yes, so -- I mean, we've been guiding basically that we've been, like, especially in the near term that our exploration program overall from a spend standpoint would be between $500 million and $600 million. And in fact, our guidance this year was $550 million, and so we're not giving guidance yet. We'll talk a little bit more about exploration on Investor Day and go forward, but that's where we've been. So we're right in line with the guidance that we have set out. Operator : The next question is from the line of Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Given your position in the Bakken, both in terms of acreage and infrastructure, first, could you clarify, John, I think you were saying that you have to take into account oil prices in terms of your activity. Equally, I think I heard you in your opening remarks say that you wanted to live within cash flow long term, which implied that you would maintain a relatively high level of activity over the next year. That was part one, and part two, could you make any observations about how you see the wider behavior of players in the Bakken, given the current price environment? Do we anticipate less activity at these prices? Do we think prices have to go lower before we see an impact? John B. Hess: I think one of the things -- I can't talk about others. Let them speak for themselves, but in our case, we have a very strong balance sheet. We're drilling some of the lowest-cost, high-productive wells so our breakeven is lower. We have some of the best acreage. We're certainly going to be focused on investing for returns as opposed to growth for growth's sake. So we're going to be capital disciplined in this price environment, but with the acreage that we have, many of our wells still generate very good returns even in the current price environment. So the exact details on what our program is going to be going forward and our planning premises, we'll give you further details on November 10. Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Sure. I think the perspective of others was to do with your infrastructure position. I mean, are you seeing lower volumes? And can I just throw in also if you saw any impact from the flaring rules in North Dakota? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, Paul. So given our infrastructure position in the Bakken, we don't anticipate any impacts due to the NDIC flaring rules. So we're well positioned to continuously reduce our flaring on a go-forward basis. Paul I. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: And then volumes from the basin given the lower oil price environment in terms of your infrastructure. John B. Hess: No, we're not seeing major volume impacts as of right now. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Just getting back to the kind of initial comments about where crude oil prices are, and I recognize some of this will be handled in 2 weeks. But looking at the North Sea, which has historically been considered a relatively high-cost area, and I recognize Valhall's pretty far along. But could you give us an idea of kind of where it falls in given, say, a sub-$90 Brent environment as opposed to a plus or minus $100 Brent environment? John P. Rielly: Sure. I mean, again where we are with the -- with both our North Sea investments, so Valhall and South Arne, the infrastructure basically is there. It's completed so all our big spend is behind it. So as you said, you've got just your general operating costs, but at $80, as you mentioned, with where our operating costs are and in Valhall where we're not paying cash taxes, it will still generate. Our North Sea assets, our offshore assets in general, too, are going to generate significant cash flow for us. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. So quite a lot of headroom on both of those then. John P. Rielly: Yes. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : And reasonable to presume it makes sense to continue to invest and not just to operate on that sort of an $80 to $90 environment? John P. Rielly: Yes. I mean, it is generalized. John Hess had mentioned earlier it's that balanced portfolio. It is our offshore assets that are funding the growth on the unconventional side. So it definitely makes sense and some of our best return projects are there. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And last question I have is just really 2 areas that have been, well, let's just say security issues both Libya and Kurdistan. Can you give us kind of an update of what you're seeing in terms of any changes in Libya from, say, the middle of the third quarter to the present? And then what was it that gave you confidence to go back into Kurdistan and restart the exploration well there after the 2-month hiatus. John B. Hess: Yes. In terms of Libya, look, there's still significant political unrest in the country and a lot of instability, but the oil's flowing. And so far from our Waha concession, we have sold 3 cargoes of Es Sider crude. So the oil business is up and running. But in terms of how the political unrest gets resolved, that's still very much an open issue. So security is still an issue there. And in terms of Kurdistan, you've read the news. I think the country's a lot more secure today after the United States and allies have stood by the Kurds, and security's the #1 concern for our company and safety of all of our employees and contractors. And once we were given the assurances we needed about security, we staged a reentry into the country. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next question is from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Most of my questions have been answered, but I would like to ask -- having completed the Almond 2, what is the current timeline for the progression of your offshore Ghana prospects? Gregory P. Hill: Yes. So in terms of obligations to the government, we have to file a declaration of commerciality first. And after that, we would have to file a development plan middle of the year next year with the government. So we're actively evaluating the results of the appraisal plan. We've also got some new 3D seismic that we're also processing. Once that's done and once that's reviewed with our partners and reviewed with the government, then we can give you much more color on Ghana. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: But at least at this time, you can say that the drilling portion of it is done pending these further developments. Gregory P. Hill: Yes. Operator : And so the next question is from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Can I go back to Kurdistan for a moment? Now that you guys are drilling with Petroceltic, as I understand, the Shireen-1 prospect is kind of the near-term catalyst. Is there a pre-drill resource estimate for that? Gregory P. Hill: No, we haven't given one, and we expect to reach TD in that well in Q1 of 2015. Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Okay. That's fair enough. And then on Libya, you mentioned the 3 cargoes so far, given that operations are, well, maybe not normal but certainly improving versus a year ago, have you had a chance with the other partners to actually assess the state of the infrastructure relative to any potential physical damage, anything like that? John B. Hess: No, we're not in a position to comment on that. Operator : And the next question is from the line of Faisel Khan of Citigroup. Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just wanted to understand the supplement that you guys put out on the Utica JV well test. I'd just like to confirm that those well tests up there from 1,500 BOE a day to almost 4,000 BOE a day are all for the third quarter. And I just want to make sure that, that sort of is coming through into the fourth quarter as well. Gregory P. Hill: Yes, those are the third quarter results from the wells actually, and those are our wells. In addition, CONSOL also tested 7 wells from their operated pads. But these are our wells drilled and completed and tested in the quarter. Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. I mean, these are pretty huge results. I mean, what's the game plan in terms of sort of moving some of those gas and liquids out? I mean, 4,000 BOE test is still pretty substantial. Are these -- what's the well sort of -- well like that doing a month later or 2 months later? Gregory P. Hill: We'll give you -- again in Investor Day in November, we'll give you a full kind of update on the Utica, how it's performing, the play and also where we're going in the future with it. Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And just on Tubular Bells, as that facility ramps up, what's the quality of crude coming out of that field? Is it sort of a Mars Blend? Or is it something that we should expect more of an LLS type of crude? John B. Hess: It'll have an LLS typing -- LLS relationship in terms of pricing. Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And then in terms of moving your crude out of the Bakken, has anything changed with regard to how you're moving your crude out or how you're thinking about moving your crude out, whether it's rail or pipeline? There've been a number of pipeline projects announced. So I just want to understand sort of what your game plan is for those volumes in the future. John B. Hess: Yes. Currently, we move approximately 50% of our crude by pipeline and 50% by rail. And as our production ramps up in the future, you can expect that, that balance will stay roughly in place. We are subscribing to more pipeline space, but we're also looking at adding some more railcars to make sure we have the infrastructure in place to move to the highest value markets. Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. Then last question for me. The sale of HETCO, how much capital or working capital does that free up from -- within the company on the balance sheet? John P. Rielly: So just so you know, we have not disclosed the terms, the proceeds associated with the sale because it is confidential. And from a general aspect, it's not going to be material to our financial statements. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day. Thank you.",

My name is Lisa and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our Web-site, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our Web-site. With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, President and Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess: Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I will provide some key highlights from 2014 and guidance for 2015. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance and John Rielly will review our financial results. Before covering the quarter and the year, I would like to provide some thoughts on the dramatic change in the oil market with the price of Brent dropping from $115 per barrel in June to approximately $49 per barrel today. While this price drop poses serious challenges for the entire industry, Hess continues to maintain a strong financial position with $2.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet at year-end and a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 21%. The current market weakness is driven by strong supply growth from U.S. unconventionals and weaker than expected global demand. In the past, during periods of oversupply, Saudi Arabia and a few other OPEC members would have reduced production to stabilize prices. This time, they decided to leave it to the market to rebalance, and consequently oil prices have plummeted. The near-term impact is that many companies including ours are announcing significant reductions to their global investment programs which will begin to decrease unconventional and conventional production growth in the latter half of 2015 and even more so in 2016. All of the steps we have taken in the last several years have positioned us well to manage in this environment. In addition to our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, our transformation to an E&P company has created a resilient portfolio of world-class assets that is balanced between unconventionals which offer lower-risk growth in a high price environment with the flexibility to moderate investment in a lower price environment, and our offshore assets which generate significant cash flows and also provide future growth opportunities. Our financial strategy which we reviewed during our Investor Day last November is, first, to invest for returns; second, to manage our business to be cash generative over the long-term; third, to use our balance sheet in a given year like 2015 to fund the shortfall in operating cash flow; and finally, to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. In keeping with this strategy, we are taking a disciplined approach to protect our financial strength in the current environment while preserving our long-term growth options. As announced on Monday, we will reduce our 2015 capital and exploratory expenditure budget to $4.7 billion, approximately 16% lower than our 2014 actual spend. We are reducing our 2015 annual spend in the Bakken to $1.8 billion compared to $2.2 billion in 2014 and plan to decrease our rig count to eight rigs by the second quarter compared to 17 rigs in 2014. In addition, we are actively pursuing cost reductions with service providers across our supply chain. As for our share repurchase program, we are significantly moderating the pace of share repurchases in 2015 to preserve liquidity in the current oil price environment. Since commencement of the program in August of 2013, we have repurchased 62.8 million shares for $5.3 billion. Now I would like to comment on some of the key highlights of our earnings release as well as our major accomplishments from 2014, which overall was a year of outstanding operating performance. First, 2014 adjusted net income was $1.3 billion and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $5.2 billion. Compared to 2013, our results were positively impacted by lower cash operating costs and exploration expenses which were more than offset by lower realized selling prices and higher depreciation expenses. Second, in 2014, production averaged 329,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a pro forma basis excluding divestitures in Libya. In 2015, we forecast production to average between 350,000 and 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. Third, in 2014, we replaced 158% of production at an FD&A cost of approximately $28.75 per barrel of oil equivalent. At year-end, our proved reserves stood at 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent and our reserve life was 11.7 years. Now I will review some of the accomplishments from 2014 starting with the Bakken where Hess continues its industry leadership. In late March, the expanded Tioga gas processing plant came online, which is key to our commitment to sustainable growth in North Dakota and is enabling us to significantly reduce flaring. The expansion increased the plant's gross inlet capacity to 250 million cubic feet per day and more than doubled its natural gas liquids processing capacity. Throughout 2014, our Bakken team has continued to drive down drilling and completion costs and the productivity of our wells is among the highest in the industry. In the fourth quarter, we achieved the important milestone of net production exceeding 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Hess has a strong acreage position in the Bakken with more DSUs in the core of the play than any other competitor. For 2015, our net production from the Bakken is expected to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 83,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2014. We are still working to monetize our Bakken midstream assets through a master limited partnership. We expect the IPO to occur in 2015 subject to market conditions and we will continue to provide you with further updates as appropriate. Turning to offshore, we continue to employ our top quartile drilling and project delivery capabilities. A major accomplishment in 2014 was the startup of the Tubular Bells Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in which Hess has a 57.1% interest in the project and is the operator. The field achieved first production approximately three years after project sanctioned. Net production is expected to average between 30,000 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. The Stampede project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in which Hess has a 25% working interest and is operator received full partner sanction for development in October 2014. Chevron, Statoil and Nexen, each have a 25% working interest. Total recoverable resources for Stampede are estimated in the range of 300 million to 350 million barrels of oil equivalent and first production is expected in 2018. In Malaysia, full field development of the North Malay Basin project continue to progress, which should result in net production increasing to 165 million cubic feet per day in 2017. Hess is the operator with a 50% interest. In terms of exploration, our strategy is to deliver long-term value by focusing on proven and emerging oil prone plays in basins we understand well and that leverage our capabilities. As we announced at our Investor Day, we secured farming opportunities in three deepwater blocks, Sicily in the Gulf of Mexico with Chevron as operator; the Stabroek block in Guyana with Esso E&P Guyana Limited as operator, and in Nova Scotia with BP as operator. In summary, 2014 was a year of outstanding execution and strong operating results with industry-leading performance in our unconventionals and offshore business. Our Company is well-positioned to manage through the current price environment with a strong balance sheet and resilient portfolio. Our 2015 budget reflects a disciplined approach to maintaining our financial strength and flexibility while preserving our long-term growth options. Just as important, we have top quartile operating capabilities and some of the best people in the industry to execute our plans and maximize shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill. Gregory P. Hill: Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an operational update on our progress in 2014 and our plans for 2015. In 2014, we demonstrated strong delivery of our plan across our unconventionals and offshore businesses and began rebuilding a top-quality exploration organization and portfolio. We exceeded the top end of our production guidance range while achieving a material reduction of approximately $200 million in our capital and exploratory spend against budget in response to the lower price environment. In our unconventionals business, we delivered on our Bakken commitments while continuing our cost reductions and successfully progressing our infill pilots, leading to a significant increase in well inventory. In the Utica, results continued to encourage our transition from appraisal to early development. Offshore, we delivered first production from Tubular Bells, achieved full partner sanction on Stampede and made steady progress at Valhall and at North Malay Basin. We drilled some excellent wells at South Arne and Equatorial Guinea, successfully conducted our appraisal of Ghana and advanced our Equus project in Australia. Starting then with production, in the fourth quarter net production averaged 352,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on a pro forma basis excluding divestures in Libya. On that same basis, for the full year 2014 we achieved net production of 318,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which exceeded our beginning of the year guidance of 305,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Looking forward, in 2015 we forecast net production to average between 350,000 and 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, an increase of between 10% and 13% respectively over a pro forma production in 2014. On the same basis, we forecast net production in the first quarter of 2015 to average between 330,000 and 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which takes into account planned maintenance in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. Turning to the Bakken, in 2014 we continued to demonstrate excellent performance. We brought 238 new operated wells online and full-year net production averaged 83,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 24% versus 2013 and well within our guidance of 80,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent net per day. In the fourth quarter, net production averaged 102,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 19% increase from the previous quarter and a 50% increase from the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2014, our 30 day initial production rates have average between 800 and 950 barrels of oil equivalent per day, well above the industry average. Our continued focus on applying lean manufacturing practices to our operations enabled us to continue to drive down our Bakken drilling and completion costs with the fourth quarter averaging $7.1 million per well versus $7.6 million per well in the year ago quarter. We expect to further reduce costs both through ongoing efficiencies and by proactively addressing our cost structure in collaboration with our suppliers. Based on our top quartile drilling and completion costs and the productivity of our wells, we continued to deliver some of the highest return wells in the play. As we mentioned on our last call and at our Investor Day last November, we have now moved to 13 wells per DSU as our standard basis of development. Also our two existing 17 well per DSU pilots are performing in line with expectations. So we plan to increase the total number of these to five in 2015. The quality of our Bakken position provides a robust forward well inventory that's substantially all held by production. Given the current pricing environment, it makes sense to diverse some drilling until oil prices have moved higher. With this in mind, in 2015 we intend to reduce our activity from 14 rigs in the first quarter to eight in the second quarter, giving an average of 9.5 rigs for the year compared to 17 rigs in 2014 and we will remain flexible to respond to prices as appropriate. Our 2015 capital budget for the Bakken is $1.8 billion, a reduction of some 18% from last year. With our reduced rig program, we nevertheless expect to drill and complete approximately 180 wells in 2015 and bring approximately 210 new wells online in total, compared to 238 new wells online in 2014. Bakken net production is expected to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the full year, an increase of 14% to 27% respectively on an annualized basis versus 2014. Looking further ahead, the quality of our acreage and our well inventory on a 13 well per DSU development plan continues to support our longer-term net production target of 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day for the Bakken. However, the timing of when this can be reached will be a function of oil price. Moving to the Utica, the appraisal and early development of our 45,000 core net acres in the Hess-CONSOL joint venture continues to be encouraging. In 2014, the joint venture drilled 38 wells, completed 36 wells and brought 39 wells on production. Our drilling and completion costs on a dollars per foot and dollars per stage basis moved steadily lower by 28% and 17% respectively in 2014 as we began to apply the same lean manufacturing techniques that we used in the Bakken. As we move into development mode and continue to work with our suppliers in the lower oil price environment, we expect drilling and completion costs will be further reduced. Net production for the year in the Utica averaged 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the fourth quarter, net production averaged 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter. The joint venture intends to execute a two rig program in the core of the wet gas window during 2015. Our budget of $290 million for 2015 is dedicated to drilling 20 to 25 joint venture wells and we expect to bring 25 to 30 new wells online. In terms of net production, we expect to average between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. Turning to our offshore business, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico we commenced production at our Tubular Bells Field in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator. Sanctioned in October 2011 and fast-tracked to first oil in approximately three years, the project underlines Hess' ability to successfully execute complex deepwater development projects. The first three producers are now online and production continues to build. A fourth producer reached target depth and encountered 290 feet of net pay. Current net production from the field is approximately 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and we plan to bring on one additional producer and continue to increase production over the course of 2015. We forecast net production to average between 30,000 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over 2015. Also in the Gulf of Mexico, on October the Stampede development project in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator was sanctioned by all four partners. Drilling is expected to commence utilizing two rigs in late 2015 with first oil targeted for 2018. In North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess holds a 50% working interest and is operator, progress continues on the first phase of field development. Engineering, procurement and construction activities are underway and commencement of development drilling is planned by Q4 of 2015. Full year net production averaged 40 million cubic feet per day through the early production system in 2014 and is expected to stay at this level through 2016. Upon completion of the full field development project in 2017, net production is planned to increase to 165 million cubic feet per day. In Norway, at the BP operated Valhall Field in which Hess has a 64% interest, fourth quarter net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 37,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter, due in part to scheduled maintenance downtime in the fourth quarter of 2014. Full year 2014 net production averaged 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the previous year. In 2015, we expect Valhall net production to average between 30,000 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Ghana, Hess and its partners are continuing to incorporate the data from the appraisal drilling in new 3D seismic into our models with a view to a sanction decision during 2016. Offshore Australia, we signed a letter of intent with the North West Shelf joint venture to process gas through LNG facilities at Karratha. Next steps will be to finalize commercial terms, complete FEED for the project and engage with LNG buyers in 2015 aiming for a sanction decision in 2017. Moving to exploration, in Kurdistan where Hess has a 64% interest, we have suspended drilling of the Shireen-1 well on the Dinarta block due to drilling difficulties and are assessing options to complete the program. In the Gulf of Mexico, Chevron has begun drilling operations on the Sicily well where Hess has a 25% interest, which is targeting a four-way closure in the outward Paleocene. The operator expects to reach target depth in the third quarter of 2015. In Guyana, we expect the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, to spud the offshore Liza-1 well in the Stabroek License in which Hess holds a 30% interest in March 2015. Liza is a large amplitude-supported Upper Cretaceous fan play. Turning to offshore Nova Scotia where we hold a 40% license interest in blocks where BP is operator, Hess has been approved as a partner by the regulatory authorities and drilling is expected to commence in 2017. In closing, 2014 was a year of exceptional execution and delivery on all fronts which is a tribute to the outstanding people of Hess. Although 2015 promises to be a challenging year for the industry, I believe Hess' portfolio and prospects have never been stronger. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly: Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2014 to the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted net income, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $377 million in the previous quarter. We estimate the fourth quarter decline in selling prices lowered net income by approximately $300 million net of hedging gains compared to the third quarter. On an unadjusted basis, the Corporation incurred a net loss of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared with net income of $1,008 million in the third quarter. Turning to exploration and production, E&P net income in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $92 million and $441 million in the third quarter. E&P adjusted earnings were $147 million in the fourth quarter and $412 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted net income for E&P between the third and fourth quarter were as follows. Lower realized selling prices decreased earnings by $303 million. Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $132 million. Higher exploration expenses decreased earnings by $56 million. Higher DD&A expense decreased earnings by $22 million. All other items net to a decrease in earnings of $16 million, for an overall decrease in fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $265 million. Our E&P operations were over-lifted compared with production by approximately 1 million barrels in the fourth quarter, resulting in an increased after-tax income of approximately $9 million. The E&P effective income tax rate excluding items affecting comparability of earnings was 58% for the fourth quarter and 41% in the third quarter of 2014. The increase in the effective tax rate reflects the impact of higher Libyan production. When the Libyan operations are also excluded, the effective tax rate was 41%. Turning to corporate and interest, corporate and interest expenses after income taxes were $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $82 million in the third quarter. The increased costs in the fourth quarter were a result of lower capitalized interest and higher professional fees and other administrative expenses. Turning to cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter including an increase of $80 million from changes in working capital was $1,057 million. Capital expenditures were $1,566 million. Common stock acquired and retired was $1,077 million. Net repayments of debt were $37 million. Common stock dividends paid were $71 million. All other items amounted to an increase in cash of $18 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $1,676 million. Turning to our stock repurchase program, during the fourth quarter we purchased approximately 13.3 million shares of common stock bringing total 2014 purchases to approximately 43.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $3.7 billion. As of January 27, total program to date purchases were 62.8 million shares at a cost of $5.27 billion or $83.91 per share. Turning to our financial position, we had $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014, up from $1.8 billion at the end of last year. Total debt was $6 billion at December 31, 2014 and $5.8 billion at December 31, 2013. The Corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio was 21.2% at December 31, 2014 and 19% at the end of 2013. Going forward, we expect to utilize our strong cash position and balance sheet to manage through this low commodity price cycle. Turning to 2015 guidance and starting with exploration and production, in addition to the production and capital expenditure guidance provided by John and Greg, I would like to provide estimates for certain 2015 metrics based on our expected production range of 350,000 to 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day which assumes no contribution from Libya. For the full year 2015, E&P cash costs are expected to be in the range of $19.50 to $20.50 per barrel, which is down approximately 5% before any realization of our cost saving initiatives. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses are expected to be in the range of $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel reflecting greater contributions from Bakken and Tubular Bells which both have higher DD&A rates than the portfolio average. Total production unit costs for 2015 are estimated to be in the range of $48 to $50 per barrel. Full year 2015 exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $400 million to $420 million. For the first quarter of 2015, excluding Libyan operations, cash costs are expected to be in the range of $20.50 to $21.50 per barrel due to maintenance downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea, and DD&A rates are expected to be in the range of $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel, for total production unit costs of $49 to $51 per barrel. Exploration expenses in the first quarter excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. Based on current Strip oil prices, we are forecasting a pre-tax loss for 2015 and as a result the E&P effective tax rate excluding items affecting comparability is expected to be a benefit in the range of 38% to 42% excluding Libyan operations. On the same basis as the full-year guidance, the effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2015 is expected to be a benefit in the range of 40% to 44%. Turning to corporate and interest, for the full year of 2015 corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $120 million to $130 million net of taxes, and interest expenses are estimated to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million net of taxes. For the first quarter of 2015, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million net of taxes and interest expenses are estimated to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million net of taxes. Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to inform you the quarterly earnings supplement posted on our Web-site has been augmented this quarter to include more detailed information regarding our Utica shale operations. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. Doug Leggate : John and Greg, I guess I haven't spoken to you guys yet, so Happy New Year. I wondered if I could take two questions please. The first one is really on the prospective cash burn for the current year. I understand the balance sheet is in terrific shape given all the moves from last year, but what are you guys assuming in terms of the commodity environment, because obviously if oil prices don't recover, this level of spending pretty much burns through your cash flow pretty quickly, so can you give some framework as to how the CapEx may change if oil prices don't recover, and I have a follow-up please? John P. Rielly: Sure, Doug. I appreciate the question and the difficulty with the environment but we're not going to speculate right now on where oil prices are going to end up through 2015. So now having said that, we are well-positioned going into this low priced commodity cycle. So first, proactively we have been reducing our CapEx, we did reduce that as you saw in 2014 and we've made further reductions in 2015. And as was mentioned by both John and Greg, we have the ability to reduce it further if needed. We are reducing our stock repurchase program, we're significantly moderating that, and then as you mentioned with our strong cash position, we have $2.4 billion of cash, and our strong balance sheet position, we can utilize this cash and the balance sheet to get through this low priced commodity cycle. So we think we're in great position from that standpoint and we're just going to see where oil prices end up throughout the year. Doug Leggate : Great. Thanks, John. My follow-up is for Greg. Greg, we've got something like last time I looked about a $20 contango and the oil price for the next three years which approximates I guess to about two-thirds, 70% of production from our Bakken well, can you help us understand the decision to go ahead and retain the completion rate at such a high level, and talk to what does the new type curve look like for the 2015 program, and I guess finally, what are your expectations for drilling and completion cost reductions as you move forward over in this cost environment, a low price environment? I'll leave it there, thank you. Gregory P. Hill: Thanks, Doug, that's really three questions, so let me try and answer all. First of all, at current prices, what you were talking about was really, what are your returns in the Bakken, why should you go forward? So just some context, as we mentioned at our Investor Day in November, recall that we have 60% more DSUs in the core of the Bakken than any other operator, and our 2015 drilling program is focused in the best areas of this core. Secondly, as you know our well costs are some of the lowest in the industry, our well IPs are well above the industry average. So that means we're delivering some of the highest returns in the industry. So given all these advantages, our current prices were delivering incremental returns that meet or exceed our hurdle rate. And finally given our large position in the core, we see a multiyear inventory of drilling at these current activity levels and pricing. I think the final thing I would say is, we really want to maintain capability. We have a world-class lean manufacturing team and capability and we have a strong desire to maintain that as much as possible. As far as service cost, we're starting to see some response and we're in very active discussions with all of our suppliers. So it's premature to kind of speculate on where those are going to go, they're going to go down but I can't tell you how much or how fast at this point in time. I think the third thing relating to type curves, we're going to be in that 800 to 950 kind of an initial IP rate in this core of the core. So we'll be probably towards the upper end of that but that's probably still a good range for us. Doug Leggate : Good, thanks very much. When you said you've got several years of drilling, you mean not type of well curve, you have a multiyear inventory that you can continue to focus on? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, at current activity levels and current pricing we have a multiyear inventory to go forward. Doug Leggate : With a positive return? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, sir. Doug Leggate : Okay, great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks very much for answering the questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Baber with Simmons & Company. Please proceed. Guy Baber : John, you made a comment in the prepared remarks about the impact that lower spending could have on production for the industry overall, especially as we move into 2016. So I was hoping you could elaborate on those comments and maybe what you might expect for the Hess portfolio specifically in 2016, and then in the Bakken especially. I'm assuming spending remains relatively constrained relative to the plans presented at the November Analyst Day, if you could just give maybe some thoughts around kind of the 2016 production trajectory? John B. Hess: Yes, in terms of the industry, a lot of the announcements of companies' plans including ours have been announced for 2015 where their significant reductions and their unconventional programs and as you all know many unconventional wells on the oil side have about a 70% decline in the first year, and as these programs through the year get feathered in with reduced rigs running, the growth year on year of unconventionals being up 1 million barrels a day or so year versus year in the U.S. because of unconventional, we see that attenuating quite a bit to where it flattens out probably the beginning of next year. So a lot of the unconventional growth both for the industry and ourselves at the rig counts being anticipated should flatten out, and our Company itself also will have that but it's great pointing out we're going to still be able even in these oil prices to drill very attractive returns in the core of the core and we're very fortunate to be in a position to do that for several years. So our whole focus here is to maintain our financial strength and flexibility while still preserving our long-term growth options, but we do believe with the decrease in investment programs for the industry and the consequent levelling out of production growth, oil prices will recover starting next year. Guy Baber : That's very helpful. And then one follow-up for me in the Bakken also, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the relationship between well count which was down 12% year-over-year and the rig count which was obviously down much more substantially, but could you just talk a little bit about the backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells the over what timeframe you might bring those online through 2015 and what impact that could have to production? And then also, if you could just comment on the implicit efficiency gains for rigs that you're assuming kind of in 2015, because it seems as if you guys were already expecting some efficiency gains that you talked about at the November Analyst Day, but your numbers seem to imply even greater efficiency gains, and just trying to get a sense of how conservative you might feel those are and what type of opportunities did you see with some of the tailwinds from a lower commodity price environment? Gregory P. Hill: Let me hit the rig question first. I think really the question you're asking is that rig count is going down about 45%, yet the capital is only going down by about 18%, so why is that. And that's all because of the continuing efficiency gains from our lean manufacturing. So we expect to drill approximately 20% more wells per rig in 2015. So that's 18 plus wells per rig in 2015 versus 15 per rig in 2014. So what that means is we expect to bring online 210 new wells in 2015 versus 238 in 2014. So you're exactly right, there is quite a bit of efficiency gains expected in our plans. And I think that broadly answers the question that you were trying to ask. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs, your line is open. Brian Singer : Sorry for the delay there. Two questions. First, can you talk to the service and development cost reduction that you are seeing versus expecting and how offshore compares to onshore? Gregory P. Hill: First of all, again as I said in my remarks on the last question, here it's early days, right. I mean the discussions are ongoing as we speak with suppliers. So it's premature to speculate how low will it go, how quickly will you see those cost reductions throughout the value chains. In respect to offshore, recall we contracted two rigs even before the price environment to next generation deepwater drilling rigs. We contracted those for 400,000 a day. That was a major reduction over what those rigs would have contracted for say even 18 months ago, alright. Now, if you think about the offshore though, this is probably the best time to be in the development phase of an offshore project because we know and we are seeing already some significant cost reductions in all those offshore services. So as you develop and then those developments come online, in Stampede's case in 2018, it's probably the best time in the cycle to be in development mode for those projects. Brian Singer : Great, thanks. And my follow-up is, going back to your November Analyst Meeting, you indicated that Hess was interested in acquisitions, but I may be paraphrasing here, but the valuations at the time were not attractive despite the drop from June highs. That valuations in oil prices have obviously changed since then, and wondered if you could give us your latest thoughts on M&A and what may or may not make sense for Hess? John B. Hess: Appreciate that. Obviously as opportunities arise, we'll be in a position to evaluate them with the strong financial position we have. It would have to still make sense both strategically and financially. So we're definitely on the lookout and we'll be in a position to move forward if something made sense, but at the same time our priority still will be to maintain our financial strength and flexibility and preserve our long-term growth options. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Ryan Todd : Maybe a follow-up on one of the earlier questions on CapEx, I realize that the near-term volatility in commodity makes it very hard, as you talked about, in 2015, but maybe if we think about the medium term view, say the next two to three years, I mean how should we think about your willingness to outspend in terms of [indiscernible] suggest on a multiyear basis there was an effort to be cash positive, is that still the view and how does that inform kind of the two or three year view from here? John P. Rielly: So it is clearly our focus that over the long-term that we want to generate free cash flow. So obviously with the significant decline, it's come on fast, and we are in a good position with our cash levels of $2.4 billion in our balance sheet to spend, to utilize some of that cash and balance sheet strength to get through this cycle. So with the current uncertainties, in the mid-term and long term, we naturally have a range of price scenarios under which we're evaluating our forward activity and production outlook. So again, the pace of spend and the growth will depend on that oil price and that's what's going to impact our longer-term growth rate as well as our free cash flow over the period. But we will continue to focus over the long-term to generate free cash flow. Ryan Todd : So I guess should we think like on a two years out, three years out, there's still a target to be cash flow positive at that point and depending on commodity you'll adjust accordingly for 2015? John P. Rielly: Yes. Ryan Todd : Okay. And then maybe a follow-up, I know we've talked to a decent amount about drilling and completion cost in the Bakken, can you say what was the implied drilling and completion cost per well in the 2015 budget, did you make any assumption, I know you made assumptions for efficiency gain, did you make any assumption for cost deflation, and if not, is that a source of potential downward pressure on the budget from here? \\ John P. Rielly: Yes, I think so, all-in \u2013 so I'm going to talk DC&F, all in cost assumptions in 2015 was 8.3 and that gives you a D&C cost of around 6.8. So that's the assumption in our current plan. Ryan Todd : Okay, and that's apples-to-apples versus the 7.1 number that you saw in 4Q? John P. Rielly: Yes, it is, and that 7.1 is D&C. Ryan Todd : Okay, great. Thanks. I'll leave it there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Evan Calio : This is maybe a follow-up question on the Bakken and the well inventory drawdown, it looks like you added something 30 wells to the uncompleted Bakken inventory in the quarter, but can you give us the number of what the current total inventory of uncompleted and completed yet not tied in wells are and as the inventory drawdown for 2015 agnostic to the commodity price or should we kind of expect that to grow into recovery, so I understand how that works? Gregory P. Hill: So we carried about 50 wells into 2015 from 2014 that were uncompleted. Obviously we're going to work that inventory down because we plan to drill about 180 wells yet bring 210 wells online. So you'll see we'll draw that inventory down. I think the carryout at the end of the year is anticipated to be around 20 wells or so, so a net gain of 30. Evan Calio : And was that something that would have occurred regardless of the commodity price, I'm just trying to understand if that's a more kind of normal number going forward? Gregory P. Hill: No, because those wells were all drilled in the core, we were already drilling in the core on those wells. Evan Calio : That makes sense. And then another question on maybe kind of a follow-up on the cost side for Stampede, I mean how much of that cost structure is locked in or is available to potentially rebid given an accelerating downturn likely in the offshore spending market? John P. Rielly: So first of all about 50% had been contracted through the end of 2014. Now we're looking at opportunities to reduce the costs in those contracts and we also expect lower contracts in the ones yet to be awarded. They are lower costs and those are yet to be awarded. And recall, production doesn't commence until 2018. So we've got three years of spend here that we can really work the cost hard on before it comes online in 2018. Evan Calio : Great. And then maybe one last one if I could, not to beat a dead horse, but I mean just trying to understand commodity price, not trying to make a forecast, what commodity price you're using to set the budget, and maybe it's something that is more fluid, do we need changes to the marketplace and do you expect to be I guess assessing that on maybe a more frequent time period? John B. Hess: Obviously we're dealing with the reality of current prices, and while we can't predict them and certainly believe they will recover, we're also going to be in a position to adapt further should they be deeper and longer. So they are very unpredictable right now and we think the prudent thing is to focus on financial strength and preserving our liquidity to ride this storm out and we think we're going to come out of this in a very strong manner and I want to make sure we take the steps to do that. So if we have to moderate CapEx more should the price decline continue for a longer period, we'll be in a position to do that. We think we've got the prudent balance now to stay financially strong yet still preserve our long-term growth options and our capability, as Greg said earlier. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Ed Westlake : Good morning and thank you, lots of helpful color. I just want to run through some math on the rig program in the Bakken. I guess if you get down to eight rigs and you're drilling say over 18 rigs per well, next year you'd probably be closer to 150 wells. Obviously you've spoken about some of the drilled but non-completed this year, 210, and obviously this year the exit rate of production is 102 and next year you're 95 to 105, so I guess does that eight rig program implies some decline in 2016, which makes sense because it's all HBP, but I'm just trying to get the math right? Gregory P. Hill: First of all, as you know we don't really give specific guidance beyond the first year on 2016. But however broadly speaking, Ed, production in the Bakken would remain flat broadly with an eight rig program. So that will give you theory in some direction, but in any case we're going to remain flexible and we'll be prepared to respond accordingly as prices improve, right. Ed Westlake : Right. And then just a clarification on the costs in the offshore, you obviously highlighted the rigs, are you seeing decline in all service cost related to rigs as well as to the cost of building fabrication topsides? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, we are. Again, this cycle is just starting. So again, how low will it go and how fast will it come, it's just too premature to talk about that, but we're certainly seeing the signs of across the board price reductions coming at us. Ed Westlake : Okay. And then final area, the $1.2 billion of production CapEx this year, and it's very detailed, helpfully detailed in the press release, $300 million in the North Sea for some wells of South Arne and Valhall, $250 million for Tubular Bells, $200 million-ish for EG and then some for Shenzi, another Gulf of Mexico work and then JDA, so you gave us all the data, how much of those wells are I guess linked to reservoir management and how much in say 2016 as you look further out could you just allow the fields to decline or do less activity? I'm trying to get a sense of how much of that $1.2 billion of production CapEx is kind of discretionary and therefore could be influenced by prices. John P. Rielly: I mean I think it's always discretionary, but I think that the important thing is we're focused on returns. So I mean these wells even at current prices generate great returns. So that's why we're continuing forward, and as long as that's the case we will continue to execute those programs. Ed Westlake : I presume in 2016, maybe EG and some of the North Sea spend, is there an inventory of those wells to continue that level of activity? John P. Rielly: Yes, there is, and in EG in particular we just started some new 4D seismic. So we're going to take a drilling pause in 2015 but we know that that new 4D is going to indicate further inventory on a go forward basis for EG. Ed Westlake : And North Sea, I mean Valhall, yes, obviously the South Arne? John P. Rielly: Yes, South Arne and Valhall, both have multiyear inventories of drilling. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Please proceed. Paul Cheng : Maybe this is for either Greg or John Rielly, if we are looking at your surface cost, any rough idea that how much of as a percentage that is under-contracted as longer than two years? John P. Rielly: Surface cost, is that relative to the Bakken? Paul Cheng : No, I'm talking about overall for the organization. So in other words, I mean that how much is your cost is subject to all that have the opportunity to get reset within the next two years, what is your cost base? John P. Rielly: Yes, I mean I can't give you a percentage, Paul, but broadly obviously your offshore fleet tends to be contracted for longer periods of time, right. But what I will say is that doesn't mean that there is no opportunity for cost reduction there. We're going to engage with all of our suppliers, are engaging as we speak expecting cost reductions across the board from everyone. So even though it's contracted, that doesn't necessarily mean that we're locked into those rates. Paul Cheng : And maybe I missed in your earlier prepared remarks, did you provide the first quarter production estimate for Bakken, Utica and Waha, I know that you gave the 2015, but how about the first quarter 2015? Gregory P. Hill: Sure. So what we're doing for production in the first quarter will be 330,000 barrels a day to 340,000 barrels a day, that's excluding Libya, for the overall portfolio. Bakken is also still \u2013 for the year it was 95 to 105, the first quarter is 95,000 to 105,000 barrels a day. Paul Cheng : How about Utica and Waha? John P. Rielly: So for Valhall we gave for the full year, it's 30,000 to 35,000 and it will be the same for the first quarter. Utica will be 15,000 to 20,000 for the full year and it will be a little bit less. So you heard, as Greg said, it's 13,000 barrels in the fourth quarter. So you'll be ramping to that 15,000 to 20,000 throughout the year. Paul Cheng : Okay. And John, since that you expect to have a tax benefit because you're going to have a few tax laws, should we assume that 100% of that is actually cash or that is more of a book benefit but the cash you still have to pay? John P. Rielly: No, you should model that essentially as a deferred tax benefit, Paul. I mean we'll have some small cash taxes in several jurisdictions offset by refunds particularly in the UKs where we have our dismantlement, but overall just model that as a deferred tax benefit. Paul Cheng : Greg, do you have a number that you can share what is the Bakken current cash operating cost and unit DD&A? John P. Rielly: Paul, as usual, we typically do not provide individual unit cost information. So just overall, Bakken is on the cash cost side, is slightly below our portfolio average, it has been getting better as the production continues to increase there and Greg drives efficiencies in the operations. The DD&A still is higher than the portfolio average, but again, as we book additional reserves with performance as we move through in the Bakken, that DD&A rate has also been coming down and will continue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please proceed. David Heikkinen : As you think about the price scenarios that you're currently running, when would you update your 2013 to 2018 outlook again? John B. Hess: I'd say as we have a little more visibility on where oil prices stabilize. They are in free fall now, we don't think they are sustainable here, but once the investment programs of not only companies but countries take effect, we think that's going to affect both unconventional and conventional production, that should start to strengthen the market and wherever those prices stably lies remains to be seen, but making a forecast on that now would be foolhardy and predicting when that time we could give new updates also would be foolhardy. We do think during the year as production growth starts to attenuate, prices will start to recover and once we have a little more visibility and confidence in the stability, that's when we would make those updates. David Heikkinen : Okay. And then just on our own sensitivity and scenarios, we have here over $1 billion of outspend that sustains, is that a reasonable number given your internal scenarios? John P. Rielly: Again, David, we're just not going to speculate on where oil prices are because as we've been saying, we are going to watch it and be flexible and see where commodity prices are moving and that will affect the pace of investment going forward. So at this point we're just not going to speculate on that number. David Heikkinen : Okay, worth a shot. And then I guess as you go through the year on drilling and completion cost, we've thought about cost being lower in the back half. Will you just update those quarterly as you actually have the effect of the cost savings that you're negotiating now or when do you think you'll be able to give us some more clarity on how those negotiations are going? Gregory P. Hill: I think we can update as we go throughout the year. I do want to clarify one thing. Those well costs that I gave in the Bakken, so the D&C of around 6.8, that excludes any significant supply chain reduction. So that was just current cost assuming some efficiencies from lean manufacturing. So there's the opportunity for those costs to go even lower than that in the Bakken in particular. David Heikkinen : Very good. And then, so the outspend then is really covered by the MLP and you're in a pretty strong position still to move that forward given the sustained production in the Williston, so no changes to that outlook as far as the MLP? John P. Rielly: No, we are progressing our S-1 filings with the SEC and our preparations remain on track for the transaction in 2015, obviously subject to market conditions, but everything is on track for it. David Heikkinen : Very good. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phillips Johnston with Capital One. Please proceed. Phillips Johnston : Sort of similar to Ed's question but more on a Company-wide basis, if you look at your overall production guidance for this year ex Libya, it implies that volume should be relatively flat versus the fourth quarter average. Two questions there. First, should we assume the $3.9 billion of CapEx that you plan to spend this year excluding exploration and infrastructure is roughly the level of spending that's required to keep production flat over the next couple of years or is it not that simple? John P. Rielly: No, it's not that simple, and as you said, as you can see, the overall production is about flat with the fourth quarter, what we do have is, as I mentioned earlier with our production in the first quarter, we have some downtime here coming in the first quarter, right, so that's going to affect the overall average. And then the production numbers, just if you're doing the math, is going to be higher than the fourth quarter numbers as you move through the year. But yes, that kind of math is just difficult to do. Phillips Johnston : Okay, sure. And then just I guess on that note, looking out into Q4, would you expect Q4 to be similar to Q4 last year or higher or slightly lower? John P. Rielly: I just hesitate, I mean I'd rather stay with our full-year guidance, because again we just don't want to speculate on what's happening with oil prices on that. If it goes up, it could be a different story and if it goes down there can obviously be a different story as well. So I think we just want to stay with that overall guidance. Phillips Johnston : Okay. And just to follow-up on the economics in the Bakken, assuming the high-graded wells this year have EURs of 800,000 to 950,000 as you mentioned, what sort of NYMEX breakeven price would you expect those wells to have? Gregory P. Hill: I think what I can guide you on is that current prices, they exceed our hurdle rate. Phillips Johnston : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Please proceed. Jeffrey Campbell : In 2014, you were expanding nine and eight well pilots to determine if Middle Bakken and Three Forks zones could support 500 foot lateral spacing. Does this expanded testing continue in 2015 or does it dial back until oil prices rise? Gregory P. Hill: No, it doesn't dial back, and in fact the results we've seen from the two existing 17 well per DSU pilots are performing in line with expectations. So therefore we're going to expand the number of pilots. We're going to add three more pilots in 2015 aiming for having enough data to make a decision on that development plan by year-end 2015. Jeffrey Campbell : Okay, great. Thank you. You've identified drilling the perfect well offshore Ghana and the players to grow the vehicle after 2020, is this timeline agnostic to oil prices or could FID accelerate if oil prices improve? John P. Rielly: I think first of all we're obligated to submit a development plan to the Ghanaian government in 2016. So, so far that timeline hasn't changed. Obviously this project like every project is going to be a function of oil price. So I think that deadline could be flexible if oil prices stay low. Jeffrey Campbell : And as the last question, could you just add a little bit of color on the 2015 exploration effort offshore Guyana, when might you expect the result from the first exploration well and when will the acquisition of additional 3D be completed? Gregory P. Hill: A lot of the 3D has been shot and it's currently being processed as we speak. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the operator, ExxonMobil affiliate, plans to spud that well in early 2017. Obviously we would have the results during 2017 of that well, and it's cretaceous fan play. Sorry 2015, sorry, not 2017. I was thinking Nova Scotia, I apologize. Guyana is 2015. Jeffrey Campbell : Right. Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Roger Read : I guess lots of dust has been hit pretty well here, but as we look at the adjustments you're making in your Bakken drilling plan, the number of rigs, and then flexibility to either cut that more if prices go down or ramp it up if prices do recover, can you kind of walk us through what is obviously a greater availability of service capacity but kind of what your flexibility is to go from say eight to six or eight to 10 rigs as we hit the latter part of the year? John P. Rielly: I think we're trying to maintain flexibility for the reasons you just described given the volatility of oil prices and certainly where it's going. So we can dial up and we can dial back and we're spending a small amount of capital to give us the flexibility to dial up if commodity prices improve, so that means getting permits and pads ready and things like that, but it's a small amount of the budget next year, but that's why we're doing it because we want that ability to dial up as well as dial down, much easier to dial down than it is to dial up, right. Roger Read : Sure. And then when do you think the M&A market would start to look more active? I mean I know we've had the downturn but everybody is sort of adjusting their plans at this point. Kind of looking back at prior downturns and not asking you to pick a particular property or even region, what's kind of the normal process we should watch here, is the key to acceleration in M&A, is it a latter part of this year, only if oil prices stay down, just kind of how you think about that? Gregory P. Hill: I wouldn't even want to fathom I guess on your question, but certainly the environment we're in, one would assume that there will be more consolidation and it's yet to unfold. Roger Read : Alright, good enough for now. Thank you. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please proceed. Pavel Molchanov : Apologize for my voice. You said, going back to a year ago, that spending would be down in 2015 and of course that was at a time when oil was in the triple digits, so off the 16% reduction in your 2015 budget, how much is specifically driven by commodity prices as opposed to what had already been telegraphed a year ago? John P. Rielly: It's the significant majority of it. So first remember we were planning on $5.8 billion in this year. We already started making reductions, brought that down to $5.6 billion. So we were going to take a reduction of the $5.8 billion, but the big move down to $4.7 billion is in reaction to the oil price. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. And then are there any FIDs that you have been planning for 2015 that are likely to be delayed or postponed because of the commodity environment? John P. Rielly: No, there's not. We just didn't have any is the point in 2015. Pavel Molchanov : No FIDs at all on deck for this year? John P. Rielly: No. Pavel Molchanov : Okay, clear enough. Appreciate it, guys. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

My name is Lisa, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess: Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will provide some key highlights from the quarter and outline the steps we are taking to protect our financial strength in the current price environment while preserving our long-term growth options. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results. While low crude oil prices significantly impacted our first quarter financial results, we delivered strong operating performance and production growth. In addition, we made considerable progress in our ongoing cost reduction efforts. In early February, we met with approximately 100 of our top service providers and suppliers to seek meaningful and sustainable cost reductions. While Greg will provide additional details, to date, we have identified cost reductions of approximately $550 million, with approximately $300 million resulting from a reduction in capital and exploratory expenditures, and approximately $250 million from a reduction in cash operating costs. As a result, we are revising down our forecast of 2015 capital and exploratory expenditures to $4.4 billion from our previous forecast of $4.7 billion, with the balance of the cost savings, approximately $250 million, reducing our 2015 cash cost by $2 per barrel. While these cost savings will be dedicated to reducing our funding deficit, we will continue to proactively take steps to further strengthen our financial position. Our Bakken rig count, which averaged 17 rigs in 2014 and 12 rigs in the first quarter of this year, currently stands at 8 rigs and is expected to remain at this level for the balance of 2015. Following the laying down of 2 offshore rigs by the end of the second quarter, 1 in Norway and 1 in Equatorial Guinea, our capital and exploratory expenditures will approach an annualized run rate of approximately $3.8 billion, which is a reduction of about 1/3 from our 2014 spend. With regard to our financial results, in the first quarter of 2015, we posted a net loss of $389 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $279 million or $0.98 per share compared to net income of $1.38 per share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2014, our financial results were impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and higher DD&A expense, which more than offset the impact of higher crude oil and natural gas sales volumes. Net production in the first quarter averaged 361,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This represents an increase of 23% from pro forma production of 294,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in last year's first quarter, excluding Libya. This improvement was driven by higher production from the Bakken and the startup of the Tubular Bells Field, which commenced production in the fourth quarter of last year. Net production from the Bakken averaged 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, slightly above our guidance range. We have an advantaged acreage position in the Bakken with more drilling spacing units in the core of the play than any other company. With an 8-rig program at current prices and incorporating the announced cost savings, we have more than a 7-year inventory of drilling locations that can generate after-tax returns of 15% or higher. Moreover, our Bakken team continues to drive our well costs lower. In the first quarter, drilling and completion costs averaged $6.8 million, down 9% from the year-ago quarter. In addition, our wells continue to be more productive than the industry average. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production from our Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess has a 57% interest and is operator, averaged 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter and is expected to be in the range of 30,000 to 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for 2015. A third well commenced production in January and first oil from a fourth producer is expected in the second quarter of 2015. We also continued to progress 2 Hess-operated developments in the quarter : the North Malay Basin project In the Gulf of Thailand, in which we have a 50% working interest; and the Stampede project in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which we have a 25% working interest. First production is on track for North Malay Basin full field development in 2017 and Stampede in 2018. During the quarter, we closed on the sale of Hess Corporation's interest in Hess Energy Trading Company, or HETCO. We are also continuing to advance the midstream master limited partnership process to maximize value of our Bakken midstream assets. In March, Hess Midstream Partners filed a third amendment to its S-1 filing in preparation for an initial public offering. We look forward to providing you further updates in the near future. In summary, we delivered strong operating results for the quarter and captured significant cost savings for the year, with additional reductions being pursued. With our robust balance sheet, resilient portfolio and top quartile operating capabilities, we are well positioned for both the current price environment as well as for our future recovery in oil prices. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory P. Hill: Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an operational update and a review of the progress we're making in further reducing our cost base, while continuing to execute our E&P strategy. Starting with production. In the first quarter, we averaged 361,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, substantially exceeding our first quarter guidance of 330,000 to 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and reflecting strong performance across our portfolio. Looking forward, our full year 2015 net production forecast remains 350,000 to 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding any production contribution from Libya. On the same basis, we forecast net production in the second quarter to average between 355,000 and 365,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As usual, we will update our full year production guidance in our second quarter conference call. As John mentioned, during the first quarter, we completed an extensive company-wide review of our cost base. As a result, we have reduced our 2015 capital and exploratory budget by $300 million to $4.4 billion and reduced our 2015 cash operating costs by $250 million or approximately $2 per barrel of oil equivalent. Of the $550 million of initial savings we have identified, about $50 million comes from a reduction in activity level, $250 million from what I'll call self-help cost reductions and $250 million from supply chain savings. The reduction in activity level is associated with the decision to reduce the Utica from a 2-rig program to a 1-rig program by June. The self-help reductions are across the board and come from more than 1,000 different opportunities identified around the company. The supply chain savings range from 10% to 30%, with tubulars and other consumables being at the low end of that range and onshore pressure pumping and land rig day rates being towards the upper end of that range. We continue to identify additional cost reduction opportunities and will keep you appraised of further progress on future calls. Turning to operations and beginning with unconventionals. In the first quarter, our net production from the Bakken averaged 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 102,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of 2014. We brought 70 new wells online in the first quarter compared to 96 wells in the fourth quarter of last year. We reduced our Bakken rig count from an average of 12 in the first quarter to a current level of 8, where we expect to remain for the balance of the year. Over 2015, despite this reduced rig count, we still expect to drill 178 wells, complete 214 wells and bring 213 new wells online due to increased drilling efficiency. This compares to last year when we drilled 261 wells, completed 230 wells and brought 238 wells online. In the second quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average between 100,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our full year 2015 net Bakken production guidance remains at 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Because of our core of the core position in the Bakken, we retain a substantial drilling inventory where economics remain attractive. By applying lean manufacturing practices to our operations, we continue to drive down our Bakken drilling and completion costs, with the first quarter averaging $6.8 million per well versus $7.1 million in the fourth quarter and $7.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The bulk of the savings to date are the result of applying our distinctive lean manufacturing capability. Going forward, including the effect of further lean efficiency gains and service cost reductions, we are now targeting drilling and completion cost to average between $6 million and $6.5 million per well for full year 2015. In line with this, we have reduced our Bakken capital budget to $1.7 billion for 2015, down from our previous guidance of $1.8 billion. Our top quartile costs, in combination with the high productivity of our wells, allows us to continue to deliver some of the highest-return wells in the play. As we mentioned on our last call and at our Investor Day last November, we have moved to 13 wells per DSU as our standard basis of development. On our 4 existing 17 well per DSU pilots, the majority of the wells are performing in line with type curves indicating minimal interference. We have therefore increased the total number of our 17 well per DSU pilots to 9 in 2015. Moving to the Utica. In the first quarter, the joint venture drilled 5 wells, completed 4 wells and brought 4 wells on production. Net production for the first quarter averaged 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter and 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter of 2014. Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica acreage is largely held by production, which allows us to reduce activity in the short term while preserving the long-term upside. Given the current pricing environment, the partnership has elected to focus activities on our Harrison County acreage, utilizing a single Hess-operated rig across the joint venture. Our revised budget for the Utica is $240 million for the year, down from $290 million. With this change, we now anticipate drilling 15 to 20 wells in 2015 versus our previous guidance of 20 to 25. Our expectation of bringing 25 to 30 new wells online in 2015 remains unchanged. In terms of net production, we still expect to average between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the year. Turning to the offshore. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we continue to increase production at our Tubular Bells Field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator. Net production averaged 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the first quarter as we experienced some temporarily constraints due to mechanical issues with the compressors, which have now been rectified. Well deliverability from existing wells is encouraging, and we expect the fourth producer to be online midyear. Our 2015 full year forecast remains between 30,000 and 35,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. Three producers were brought online and maintenance activities were successfully completed. We continue to expect full year 2015 net production to be in the range of 30,000 to 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Gulf of Thailand, at North Malay Basin, in which Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, first quarter net production averaged 38 million cubic feet per day through the Early Production System and is expected to remain around 40 million cubic feet per day through 2016. In March, construction commenced on the jacket and top sides of the central processing platform, part of the full field development project, which is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day in 2017. In the Deepwater Tano Cape Three Points Block in Ghana, in the first quarter, the Ghanan government approved the farm down of our license interest to LUKOIL. Hess will retain a 40% interest and operatorship, and with our co-owners, we continue to incorporate appraisal results into our subsurface models and progress engineering design work. Moving to exploration. In Kurdistan, where Hess has a 64% interest and is operator, we and our partner, Pedroceltic, have elected to relinquish the Dinarta license and withdraw from the region. All license obligations have been fulfilled other than the required final remediation of the well sites, which is underway. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Sicily well, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest, has reached final TD. Chevron, the operator, has completed logging and sidewall coring of the well and the results are currently under evaluation. In Guyana, in March, the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, spud the offshore Liza-1 well and the Stabroek license in which Hess holds a 30% interest. We expect to reach target depth by the end of the second quarter of this year. In closing, in this quarter, we have again demonstrated strong operational performance and made significant progress in reducing our cost base in a manner that positions us well to resume our strong growth trajectory when prices recover. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly: Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2014. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $279 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared with adjusted net income of $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. On an unadjusted basis, the corporation incurred a net loss of $389 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared with a net loss of $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Turning to Exploration and Production. The E&P net loss was $286 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to net income of $92 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The E&P adjusted loss was $193 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to adjusted earnings of $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the first quarter of 2015 and fourth quarter of 2014 were as follows : lower realized selling prices decreased results by $363 million, lower sales volumes decreased results by $31 million, lower exploration expense increased results by $63 million, lower cash operating costs increased results by $29 million, higher DD&A expense decreased results by $52 million. All other items net to an increase in results of $14 million for an overall decrease in first quarter adjusted results of $340 million. In February, we hedged 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil production from March 1 through the end of 2015 by entering into Brent crude collars with a floor price of $60 per barrel and a ceiling price of $80 per barrel. For the quarter, our E&P operations were underlifted compared with production by approximately 1 million barrels, which had the effect of increasing our first quarter after-tax loss by approximately $7 million. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 50% for the first quarter of 2015, which was favorable to our guidance of 40% to 44%, due primarily to the mix of income generated by operations during the quarter. The E&P effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 41%, excluding the effect of Libya operations. Turning to Corporate. Corporate and interest expenses after income taxes were $90 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The decreased costs in the first quarter were a result of lower professional fees and other costs. Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter, including a decrease of $108 million from changes in working capital, was $362 million. Net proceeds from asset sales were $95 million. Capital expenditures were $1,237,000,000. Common stock acquired and retired amounted to $67 million. Repayments of debt were $17 million. Common stock dividends paid were $72 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $2 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $938 million. Turning to our stock repurchase program. In the first quarter, we substantially reduced purchases of our common stock. The total program to date purchases total 62.9 million shares at a cost of approximately $5.3 billion. Turning to our financial position. We had $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2015, compared with $2.4 billion at December 31, 2014. Total debt was approximately $6 billion at both March 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at March 31, 2015, was 21.6% compared to 21.2% at the end of 2014. We have a strong balance sheet and liquidity position to manage through this low commodity price cycle. Our capital spending will continue to decrease with the reduction in rigs in North Dakota, Norway and Equatorial Guinea and as a result of our ongoing cost reduction efforts. This will allow us to achieve an annualized run rate of capital spend that is about 1/3 less than our actual 2014 capital and exploratory expenditures, and at the same time preserve our operating capabilities to position us well for a recovery in oil prices. Turning to guidance. As a result of the progress we have made in the initial phase of our cost-reduction efforts, I would like to provide updated guidance for certain second quarter and full year 2015 metrics. For the second quarter and full year of 2015, cash costs are expected to be in the range of $17.50 to $18.50 per barrel, which is $2 per barrel lower than our original full year guidance of $19.50 to $20.50 per barrel. Depreciation, depletion and amortization guidance for the second quarter and full year is unchanged and is expected to be in the range of $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel, resulting in total production unit costs of $46 to $48 per barrel. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million in the second quarter and reduced by $20 million to $380 million to $400 million for the full year 2015. The E&P effective tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 39% to 43%, excluding Libyan operations, for the second quarter and for the full year. For the second quarter of 2015, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million net of taxes and interest expenses are estimated to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million net of taxes. The full year 2015 guidance for corporate expenses of $120 million to $130 million net of taxes and interest expenses of $205 million to $215 million net of taxes remains unchanged. This concludes my remarks. We\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Guy Baber with Simmons. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division : First off, you mentioned you're continuing to pursue cost reductions. So could you just talk to us a little bit that based on your discussions with service providers and your evaluation of the operations, where you believe you are on the cost reduction front? Are there more significant cost reductions to come? And if you could just talk about it in the components that you broke it into a little bit earlier and what type of opportunities you foresee going forward and then how that could influence activity plans over the back half of the year and into next year, we'd appreciate it. And then I have a follow-up. Gregory P. Hill: Yes, I think as I said in my opening remarks, really, supply chain savings are across the board, and they range all the way from 10% to 30%. With the 10%, the lower end of the range, being the consumables like steel because steel, on a worldwide basis, is pretty still -- is still a strong market. On the upper end of that range, you have your pumping services and your onshore rig rates towards that 30% range. Discussions are ongoing with suppliers. It's hard for me to give you an estimate of where we are in the process. It's an ongoing process. We do expect additional cost reductions throughout the year, but it's too early to speculate on how much they'll be or how fast they will come. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International, Research Division : Okay, great. And then I have a follow-up on cash flow. So could you just -- I appreciate you giving us the working capital numbers. Could you just talk a little bit more about that working capital component, how you expect that to evolve through the course of the year as you reduce your activity levels? I imagine that could influence your payables to a certain degree. And then are there -- is there anything else on the cash flow front that we need to be aware of that could influence cash flow or influence cash flow during 1Q and future quarters? And I'm thinking the deferred tax element or anything else that you might point out that's not visible to us in this environment. John P. Rielly: Sure. So in the first quarter, as you saw, it was just over a $100 million decrease due to working capital. Now there's ins and outs, as you can imagine, that's going to go to the portfolio every quarter. And in general, as a -- from a guidance standpoint, we will have a pull on working capital as we go through the year, and that is due to our dismantlement efforts in the U.K. and in Norway. So if you saw on our 10-K, in our current liabilities for dismantlement, we had $440 million of dismantlement costs that were expected liabilities to be incurred this year. And so effectively, that $100 million that we have there results from that dismantlement. On an ongoing basis, I would say, with working capital, it will generally be around the same amounts, except the second quarter will be slightly higher pulls because we have tax payments internationally, and then the third and fourth quarters being a bit lower. So that's, in general, working capital. There is nothing unusual, I would tell you, to expect, then, from our cash flow numbers. As it relates to deferred taxes, the guidance that we have been giving out is that the benefit that we are providing as estimates and that you put in your models, you should assume that tax benefit is a deferred benefit. And in the first quarter, the actual benefit that we recorded was essentially all a deferred benefit. We do have some current taxes that we pay, but we also had some offsets from those dismantlement costs that I just mentioned. As we pay them in the U.K., we receive some cash refunds. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : I've got a couple also, if I may. Mr. Hess, I wonder if you could start with you. I just want to get some clarity on your comments around the midstream MLP process. Are you basically -- are you saying that the process is -- does not have a timeline because of the need for commentary from the SEC and so on? Or are you shelving the process? What are you trying to signal to us by that comment? John P. Rielly: Doug, there's no signal from that comment, just progression and where we are. As you know, we're in a quiet period in the registration process and we're limited, really, in what we can do and discuss about our midstream assets and we really can't provide any further comments on the process. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : So there's no change from our understanding as how things were or your appetite to get this done, I guess. Is that fair? John B. Hess: No, no. Not at all, Doug. We're moving forward with the process. Douglas George Blyth Leggate - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. That's what I was looking for. My follow-up is probably for Greg, or maybe for whichever one of you guys who wants to take this. I guess the way I've always thought about lower price environment is that the best returns come from investing in the base where you've already got facilities and so on. So I guess what I'm trying to understand is when I look at the Africa volumes this quarter, they're obviously pretty strong compared to the guidance you've been -- you suggested at the Analyst Day. So I'm curious, what are you doing to the base in this environment? If things stayed depressed for longer, would that get more of the incremental capital? I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about managing through this over the next year or so. And I'll leave it at that. John P. Rielly: Sure, Doug. Under these prices, and you're absolutely right, anything that we can invest around our existing hubs are the most profitable investments that we can make in the portfolio. Now we always said we have the tension because we want to maintain that strong financial position. So as you know, we did reduce rigs in North Dakota and we are dropping the rig in EG in the middle of the year and we're stacking the Valhall platform rig in the middle of the year. All of those opportunities are good return opportunities. But again, we're balancing that with maintaining a strong financial position still while preserving growth options and preserving our operating capabilities. But having said that, from an incremental capital, we're really not looking at incremental capital right now in this price environment. But the first dollars, you are right, will for the most part go to where we have existing infrastructure because that'll be our best returns. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore. Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI, Research Division : John, you've been a leader for the industry on some of these important energy policy issues, inclusive of your recent comments in the Wall Street Journal. And on this point, while it seems that full removal of the export ban may not be that likely this year, it does seem like there's some bipartisan momentum for swaps with Mexico. So I wanted to see if we could get your updated views on the potential outcomes here and timing and impacts or just any other thoughts you might have in this area. John B. Hess: Happy to do so. Obviously, it's political, Doug, as you mention. All we're trying to do is make sure our voice is heard and we keep the pressure on, on this important issue. It'll either take an act of Congress or an executive order from the President to give the green light to crude exports. It's a time where we're, as a country, considering lifting the sanctions on Iranian crude oil exports. Well, it's high time that we lift the sanctions on the self-imposed U.S. crude imports. And so we're trying to have our voice heard. Other members of the industry are. And I think we're trying to build and educate awareness with political leaders, both on the congressional side as well as the executive branch, to move this forward. So we're going to do what we can to make this more a current item as opposed to one that gets kicked down the road. Douglas Terreson - Evercore ISI, Research Division : Okay. And then also, there's been a lot of commentary on strategies for drilled but uncompleted wells in the United States. And so my question is whether or not you could provide your view as to the opportunity for the industry and for the company and just kind of help us sort this out for Hess, and whether or not it's meaningful or what have you. Gregory P. Hill: Yes, thanks, Doug. I mean, I can't speak for others. I think our philosophy is just from a return standpoint, it doesn't make a lot of sense to drill a well but not complete it. And so the decision should be to not drill the well upfront and that's why we've collapsed to our core and said things outside the core we'll save for a later day. But our philosophy is where we have the good returns in the core of the core we're going to drill and complete those wells in just the normal cycle, particularly with lean manufacturing because you want to keep that learning and continuous improvement machine going because if you stop it and then restart it, say, 1 year or 2 later, your startup costs will be more than if you just would have continued. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC: When we met earlier in the year, you talked some about just the A&D market and just a relatively wide spread, and I think your comments around incremental capital might fit into that as well. How are you thinking about that opportunity set of pain in the industry and opportunity to add to your resource potential? John B. Hess: Right. We have plenty of great investment opportunities to create value for our shareholders from our current portfolio of assets and prospects. So as a consequence, that's where our focus is going to be to deliver future value. Having said that, in the current environment, if there are opportunities out there, we're always looking to strengthen our portfolio strategically, that meet our investment thresholds and that don't sacrifice our balance sheet strength. Things that would meet that, which we certainly haven't seen yet, then we would give that strong consideration. But the key in all of this is to maintain our balance sheet strength and also, in all of this, we will be capital disciplined. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC: And then on the balance sheet, with the cash pull down through the year, have you -- any thoughts or update with the hedges in and where you'd end the year on a cash balance? John P. Rielly: So I mean, you can see, we still have $1.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And just in general, we have moderate leverage metrics and we have an undrawn $4 billion revolver, which doesn't mature until 2020. So we have ample liquidity. And as you mentioned, we've got the $550 million cost savings initiative that we've already achieved and we are continuing to work to drive further cost reductions throughout our portfolio. So that, and also there's been some firming with the oil prices, is helping to reduce our deficit. So I don't want to predict where we'll be at the end of the year, but we believe we have the financial strength to fund any near-term deficit, that's why we keep that strong financial position. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: My first question would be an operational one. In the Utica Shale, are you concentrating on Harrison County because of the well quality, or is there some other reason? Gregory P. Hill: No. The reason we're concentrating on Harrison County is that is the core of the core of the wet gas play, so that offers the best returns. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay, great. And there's been a lot of discussion about re-fracking recently, and I was just wondering, is that anything that you guys are experimenting with currently or thinking about? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, we've done a fair number of re-fracs in the past. Particularly, we experimented a lot with them in the 2010 timeframe. The results were very mixed. Having said that, I think we'll continue to watch others and see how that develops. And if it looks like it's a value-accretive thing to do, we would do that. I would say if you can get your well costs down very low, it may make more sense just to redrill a lateral than deal with the complexity of re-fracturing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Maybe one quick question on the Bakken. Production in the Bakken has pretty consistently exceeded expectation in recent quarters. I was wondering if you could give any help in terms of generally what do you think\u2019s been driving that. If you had -- is it the better-than-expected well performance? Are you seeing anything on the efficiency gains front going forward that we should consider? And then, as we look at full year guidance, you actually started the year off above the guidance range, and I realize you don't update numbers until first half, but should we think about potential for upside to full year numbers? Or how should we think about the trajectory from here over the course of the year? Gregory P. Hill: Well, I think, again, we have reduced our rig count to 8. And so there is some uncertainty as to how or if the Bakken rolls. Now we believe we can maintain production relatively flat with an 8-rig program, but obviously, there's uncertainty in that. As the year develops and as we get more production experience, we'll update our guidance accordingly. Regarding performance being a little better than expected, we are seeing some very good type curve performance in the core of the core. And so that's been a nice surprise for us. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Great. And then maybe if I could, one follow-up on infrastructure. You're spending $350 million on infrastructure this year. How should we think about the run rate from 2016 forward? Does that number come down, and over the long term, is there the potential for that to eventually be shifted to the MLPs? John P. Rielly: So just before I discuss the MLP, the infrastructure costs this year are higher. We have some significant infrastructure work that we're doing south of the river to be able to bring hydrocarbons back up north of the river, to -- either oil to our rail facility or gas to our gas plants. So we do have a higher infrastructure spend this year and it will decrease as it goes forward in '16. There always will be infrastructure spend, and then, yes, as the MLP is out in the market and is operating, they will be picking up the infrastructure spend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : You've talked a lot about lower costs, particularly as it relates to the onshore. I wondered if you could give us an update on offshore costs, including in areas like Stampede and North Malay, projects that are already on track, but whether you're seeing any cost deflationary pressures there. Gregory P. Hill: Yes, I think the current environment provides some opportunities to capture cost reductions, which will benefit Stampede before it comes on-stream in 2018. So we're about 85% contracted through the first quarter of 2015. Now I will remind you that 60% of the costs associated with drilling is associated with drilling and completions on Stampede, and that in late 2014, we contracted 7 string years with Diamond at a day rate of about $400,000, which is roughly 40% to 50% lower than what the 2013 market rates were. So we captured some of those savings already. I think as just a general statement, the cost savings in the offshore are not as deep and pronounced as the onshore, for obvious reasons, and they're coming at a slower pace than the ones in the onshore. They'll come, with time, particularly if crude prices stay low, but not at the rate or the depth that we're seeing in the onshore. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I wanted to follow-up a bit on, I think it was Douglas Leggate's earlier question with regards to how we think about activity levels relative to cost structure and prices. You've talked a lot here about strong productivity trends, great Bakken acreage position, well costs that look like they'll go sometime this year to $6 million. If you were to bring activity back on, do you think that those cost savings that you're seeing here are just going to completely reverse, or do see some of that lingering? And given these trends, how do you think about when it makes sense to stop subtracting activity and start adding activity? Gregory P. Hill: Let me kind of address the -- kind of what is an industry question, which is the ramp back up. A couple of comments. I think that the ramp-up will not be as fast as the ramp-down. Why? Because there is a significant amount of the workforce that has left the oil and gas industry. And so to restart those rigs and get crews and get all the people you need, that's going to be a much slower ramp. So I think as an industry, our ability to ramp up will not be as fast as maybe some people anticipate. So I think that's the first kind of context we'll comment. I think the other thing that we're thinking about, John can build on this, is we'll have to see a fairly strong price signal for an extended period of time before we're just going to ramp activity back up. So any of those savings will, by definition, go straight back onto the balance sheet to help reduce our deficit. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. And do you see the cost rising back to $7 million if and when activity levels start to tick back up? Gregory P. Hill: I believe some of it is sustainable. And -- but trying to predict when it will bounce back, how fast, I think, is really difficult. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Greg, when we're looking at your first half production, including the first quarter and the second quarter guidance and your full year, should we look at it as you're just being a little bit conservative or that you do expect during the summer has a significant maintenance downtime in North Sea or some of the areas and also that the cut in CapEx is really going to start taking the toll in some of the production, including Bakken, that's why you're still more comfortable sticking to the full year guidance? Gregory P. Hill: Again, Paul, I think, we only have one quarter under our belt and we will update guidance, as we always do, at the end of the second quarter. We do have the usual maintenance in the summer months in our offshore fleet. We also have to tie in the new well at Tubular Bells and tie in a nearby accumulation called Gunflint that will also be brought into the Tubular Bells Williams facility. And so there's a little more downtime with Tubular Bells. I think as I mentioned earlier, there'll be uncertainty in the Bakken as you reduce the rig rates. Production's strong, it's going well. But as you reduce those rates, I think there's still some uncertainty. So I'd like to see a little more visibility on how the Bakken is going to behave before we update our guidance, but production's been strong so far. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Can I ask in a slightly different way. If we look at your maintenance activities for this year during the summertime and/or the second half, is it going to be about average of the previous year, of the last couple of years or is it just going to be significantly higher? Gregory P. Hill: I think, just to give you some round numbers, we have about 25 days of maintenance for T-Bells, which is a little high because we have these tie-ins that we're going to do, so that would be abnormal, I would say. 17 days for all the other Gulf of Mexico fields, so that's about normal. 6 days on Valhall, again about normal. And then 17 days on JDA, which is a little higher because we're tying in booster compression and other things at JDA. So T-Bells and JDA are a little bit higher than normal. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, perfect. And then maybe looking at the CapEx. When -- earlier you said that you can bring it down, I think, to $3.8 billion of the CapEx run rate by -- towards the end of the year, is that the kind of run rate you need to sustain the production flat and oil and gas mix steady? John P. Rielly: The way we look at it, Paul, I mean, it's always a difficult question. The way we look at a run rate spend from keeping something -- keeping production flat, is we look at it really keeping our barrels, our proved reserve barrels flat. So if you're talking about -- with 360,000 barrels a day of approximate production, taking that by 365, you're saying you need to produce -- or you need to replace about 140-ish type million barrels. And then take an F&D cost, $20 to $25, that's how we look at kind of a capital spend just to keep reserves flat, which we do and imply over time that you can keep production flat. So that $3.8 billion would be in that range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : A lot covered here. A follow-up on the Bakken inventory. I know you provided the inventory and return calculations for your core of the core in the Bakken, the 15% return at 40 with 7 years of depth. But are those wells closer to 800,000 BOEs EUR, or your base type curve at 660, or any other performance color on the expected type curves? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, I think, Evan, as we've said, we've guided the 550 to 650 range on EUR. Obviously, as we collapse to the core, that number is going to increase over time, as will the IP rates as you begin to collapse to the core of the core. So yes, they will be a little bit stronger than what our average has been in the past. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : And you can see some of that in the state data today. But does that have other implications on the balance of the inventory? The balance of the inventory is still towards the average of type curve? Is that fair? Gregory P. Hill: You mean outside the core? Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Correct. Gregory P. Hill: Obviously, within that range, it'd be at the lower end of that range for outside the core. So we're going to concentrate on the upper end of that range in our drilling program. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Great. And then I have a follow-up. I know during the Investor Day, you talked about stage density being the greatest lever you can pull to improve IPs and EURs. Could you discuss your program with 50 stages per lateral and timing? And any update on your 9-8 per DSU pilots, downsizing pilots? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, you bet. So let me start with the 9-8. The results that we've seen from the 4 pilots are encouraging and so we're increasing the number of pilots on the 9 and 8 to 9 this year. So again, some encouragement there. The 50 stage, we've got a few under our belt. So operationally, they've gone extremely well. And now we're just watching the production curves, and it's too early to kind of say it's a victory or not. But so far, operationally, we've proven that it's a -- we can get those in the ground without any trouble. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So sticking with the Bakken. So outside of the core, maybe any color on whether either through getting more stages per well and therefore basically getting capital efficiency on the cost side, or new technology, are you seeing any of the sort of noncore acreage move up in terms of the breakeven, so maybe a bit of a color about the breakevens that you see as you move outside of the core. Gregory P. Hill: Yes. I think, obviously, as we get our well costs down and also get our productivity up, potentially through a higher stage count, more of the inventory will kind of come into that breakeven, right? As I said before, though, I think increasing activity, we're going to want pretty good price signals before we just go increase activity. So any savings is going to be swept to the balance sheet to help reduce our deficit in the near term. Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And then in terms of the 50 stage wells that you have under your belt, I don't know if we've seen production performance from them so far. Well, I mean, any idea where they are so that we can track them ourselves, would be one question. But where did the well costs come in, in terms of relative to the average cost? Because I know you've been able to increase the stages and maintain relatively low well costs at the same time. Gregory P. Hill: Yes, we're confident that we can stay well within our well cost even at 50 stages because of the improvements we're making, not only through lean, but through supply chain. Early days on the type curves. Encouraging, but we want to see good type curve history before we make a final decision on whether we move to 50 stage. Our standard design still remains 35 for now. Edward Westlake - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Right. And then a very small question on the gassy NGL mix in the Bakken. It seems to be increasing a little, but that's just flaring rules, presumably, rather than any change in the geology? John P. Rielly: Yes, no change in the geology. It's actually even just more hookups getting to our gas plant, which was being expanded, so just getting infrastructure and getting more of the gas into the plant. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe. Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: If I could just triangulate what I've heard. You said that the current run rate to CapEx is around $3.8 billion. And you separately said that you thought that, that would be able to sustain a flat reserves or 100% reserves replacement, which would imply flat volumes going forward over time. At the same time, separately again, I see that you've hedged at about $60 a barrel as a floor. And then finally, what you said is you wouldn't simply reraise your CapEx when operators recover, you know that it would be a lag effect. So if I could pull -- I hope I've got all that right, if I could just ask a couple of follow-up questions. Are you now basically planning the company at $60 a barrel, with an aim to keep the volumes flat, first, until prices recover? And second, within the plan, you've also mentioned, again separately, that Bakken efficiency continues to improve. Would that $60 a barrel level imply that you would have rising Bakken volumes offsetting falling international volumes? John P. Rielly: Thanks, Paul. Just on an overall basis, I just want to remind that we remain committed to managing our business to be cash generative over the long term. So you have summarized kind of all of our comments today correctly. It's not per se that we are absolutely planning at $60, but we're looking at the reality of where the current price environment is. And we want to make sure that we can be cash generative over the long term. So first, we're serious about addressing the funding deficit because we want to maintain our strong financial position, and that's why we started with the $550 million of cost savings. Just to get to that $3.8 billion, so the first quarter was the peak of our capital spending, and spending will reduce each quarter throughout the year, and so that's why by the second half of the year, we have this $3.8 billion run rate, which is about 1/3 lower. Now general comments of being able to hold reserves. Again, you're talking about a $25 F&D. Obviously, if you just hold your reserves flat and you do increase production, you do reduce your reserve life. So we have to balance and we want to maintain the longevity of the portfolio as well. But we're focused right now on cost reduction efforts and reducing that funding deficit. And because we have a strong financial position, we can invest in this low commodity price cycle. So again, we're very focused on investing in the good returns in our portfolio. We want to maintain our growth options and it's key that we preserve this top quartile operating capability that we've developed. And so that's why being able to keep the strong financial position to fund, in any given year, a deficit. But over the long term, I just want to reemphasize that we will do what it takes to be cash generative over the long term. So again, not focused on any individual price at one point in time, but that's how we're running the business. Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Yes. I totally understand that. It just seems that $60 is sort of the implicit number, let's say, for now, given what you see. Could you comment on the Bakken growth? Do you anticipate you can grow at $60? Gregory P. Hill: Well, I think, again, as I said earlier, Paul, I think at 8 rigs, we believe we can hold the Bakken broadly flat within the range that we've guided. Now we'll see. There's some uncertainty in that number, but believe -- we believe we can hold it broadly flat with 8 rigs. John B. Hess: And 8 corresponds to the current price environment that we're in right now, Paul. So that sort of gives you a feel for, at this price environment, with an 8 rig complement, we think we can keep the Bakken flattish for the next several years. Paul B. Sankey - Wolfe Research, LLC: Got it. And just finally, I've seen that within that, you would be -- first of all, could I just confirm about what cap -- cash flow you would expect, let's say, at $60 a barrel given the noise that we had in Q1? And secondly, that I've seen you continue to plan to raise the dividend over time? And I'll leave it there. John P. Rielly: Paul, we can't -- I mean, just to estimate what's going to happen with prices. And -- so first of all, even at $60, we've got to focus then on the cost reduction efforts. And as Greg said, things will be coming over time. So trying to forecast exactly what our cash flow would be with $60, long term, it would be difficult to do. So I think I just want to come back to that we are committed, over the long term, to be cash generative over a cycle time, so that's how we are focusing the business. John B. Hess: Yes, and in terms of the cash dividend, right now, our priority is the funding deficit and getting ourselves to a cash generative position. So those are the priorities right now -- and investing for returns. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : You alluded to the fact that you would be potentially open to acreage acquisitions if something useful came along. Would you be equally open to some additional asset monetizations above and beyond all you've done in the past 2 years? John P. Rielly: We've done, obviously, $13 billion worth of asset sales for the past couple of years. And to get our portfolio to a position that we really think it's competitive at low prices and it's going to be very competitive at high prices. So right now, obviously, where prices are, it's not a seller's market. We're focused absolutely on, day in and day out, on cost reduction efforts and reducing our deficit. So that's our focus right now, Pavel. John B. Hess: And as always, and we've said this before, but just to give clarity, portfolio optimization is ongoing and part of the normal course of business as we move forward. And that includes the monetization of our Bakken midstream. Pavel Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay. Can I also ask about hedging? Right now, as we're talking, the spread between the front month WTI contract and one year out is $6, $7. Are you taking advantage of the Contango to layer in hedges for '16 or even '17? John P. Rielly: No, the hedges we have on are what I mentioned in my earlier results, so we have 50,000 barrels a day of collars and they're Brent collars, between $60 and $80. And again, we will continue to look at our price exposure on an annual basis and we may hedge to provide some insurance. So in the first quarter, we saw an opportunity to hedge against a pretty softening market right there and potential declines in '15, and so we entered into those collars. But again, it's an ongoing thing that we may do, but at this point in time, it's the program that I mentioned. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Greg Hill will discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will then review our financial results. Regarding our financial position, on July 1, we closed on the sale of a 50% interest in our Bakken Midstream assets for a cash consideration of $2.675 billion and formed a joint venture with Global Infrastructure Partners. This transaction delivers significant and immediate value to our shareholders, and bolsters our financial flexibility in the current low oil price environment. At closing, the joint venture incurred $600 million of debt through a five-year Term Loan A facility, with proceeds distributed equally to both partners, resulting in total after tax proceeds net to Hess of $3 billion. Importantly, this joint venture has independent access to capital, including a fully committed $400 million, five-year senior revolving credit facility to help grow our Midstream business. As previously announced, the joint venture plans to proceed with an initial public offering of Hess Midstream Partners LP common units pending SEC review and market conditions. With the proceeds from the Midstream asset transaction plus cash on hand and an untapped $4 billion revolving credit facility, Hess has one of the strongest liquidity positions among our peers. Consistent with our financial strategy, the proceeds from this transaction will enable us to preserve the strength of our balance sheet in the current low oil price environment, provide additional financial flexibility for future growth opportunities, and continue to repurchase stock on a disciplined basis. With regard to our financial results, in the second quarter of 2015, we posted a net loss of $567 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $147 million or $0.52 per share compared to net income of $1.38 per share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the second quarter of 2014, our financial results were impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and higher DD&A expense, which more than offset the impact of higher crude oil and natural gas sales volumes and lower cash costs and exploration expense. During the second quarter, we delivered strong operating results. Net production averaged 391,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 23% from pro forma production in the year-ago quarter, excluding Libya. This improvement was driven by higher production from the Bakken and Utica shale plays, the joint development area of Malaysia/Thailand, and Tubular Bells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In light of our strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our overall company production forecast for 2015 by 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to a range of 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Turning to the Bakken. Net production averaged 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, above our guidance range. As a result of our strong year-to-date performance, we are increasing our full year 2015 production forecast to a range of 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from our previous guidance of 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Hess is one of the strongest acreage positions in the Bakken, with more drilling spacing units or DSUs in the core of the play than any other operator. Through the application of Lean manufacturing techniques and supply chain cost savings, our Bakken team continues to drill some of the lowest cost wells in the play. In the second quarter, drilling and completion costs averaged $5.6 million, down 24% from the year-ago quarter. In addition, our wells continue to rank among the most productive. As a result, we are able to deliver financial returns that are attractive even at current prices, and are competitive with those in the best shale oil plays in the United States. In addition, we are leveraging this expertise in Lean manufacturing techniques from the Bakken to drive improvements in our joint venture operations in the Utica where net production for the second quarter average 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Given the adverse pricing environment for natural gas and natural gas liquids, Hess, along with our joint venture partner CONSOL, elected earlier this year to reduce drilling activity in the Utica to a single Hess-operated rig for the second half of 2015. Even with this reduction in activity, we are increasing our full year 2015 production forecast by 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to a range of 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as a result of strong well performance and efficiency gains. Turning to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production from our Tubular Bells field in which Hess has a 57% interest and is operator, averaged 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, as we continue to ramp up production. As a result of some short-term production issues which Greg will discuss in his remarks, we are lowering our full year guidance for Tubular Bells by 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to a range of 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Malaysia/Thailand joint development area, in the Gulf of Thailand, net production for the second quarter averaged 47,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from the year-ago quarter when we had planned downtime to complete booster compression and wellhead tie-ins. Regarding our developments, we continued to progress two Hess-operated offshore projects during the quarter. Full field development of the North Malay Basin project in this Gulf of Thailand in which Hess has a 50% working interest is on track for first production in 2017 which should increase net production from approximately 40 million cubic feet per day currently to 165 million cubic feet per day. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Stampede project in which Hess has a 25% working interest is on track for first production in 2018. Gross recoverable resources for Stampede are estimated in the range of 300 million barrels of oil equivalent to 350 million barrels of oil equivalent. In terms of exploration, our strategy is to create future growth options that deliver long-term value by focusing on proven and emerging oil-prone plays in the Atlantic Basin, areas we understand well and that leverage our offshore drilling and development capabilities. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are encouraged by the Chevron-operated Sicily discovery in the Keathley Canyon area in which Hess has a 25% working interest. Well data is being analyzed and an appraisal well to further evaluate the discovery is expected to spud late this year or in early 2016. On the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana, where Hess has a 30% working interest, the operator, Exxon Mobil, announced a significant oil discovery in late May at the Liza prospect. We are now in the process of evaluating the resource potential on the block and recently commenced the acquisition of 17,000 square kilometers of 3D seismic. Capital and exploratory expenditures in the second quarter of 2015 were $1.07 billion, down 15% from the second quarter of 2014. We continue to project that full year 2015 capital and exploratory expenditures will be $4.4 billion, more than 20% lower than our 2014 spend. In summary, we delivered another quarter of strong operating results. We remain confident that our financial strength, resilient portfolio and proven operating capabilities position us well in the current low oil price environment as well as for competitive growth when prices recover. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an operational update and review our overall progress in executing our E&P strategy. Starting with production, in the second quarter, we averaged 390,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, substantially exceeding our second quarter guidance of 355,000 to 365,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and reflecting strong performance across our portfolio; notably in the Bakken and the Gulf of Mexico. As a result of continuing strong performance we are increasing our full year 2015 net production forecast by 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to a range of 360,000 to 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. On this same basis, we forecast net production in the third quarter to average between 355,000 and 365,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our third quarter forecast reflects planned downtime at the JDA, lower activity levels in the Bakken, and hurricane contingency in the Gulf of Mexico. During the second quarter, we continued to actively drive down our cost structure. We now project a further reduction in our cash operating costs of $60 million to $70 million, bringing cash operating cost savings for the year to over $300 million, and our total cost reduction savings including capital to over $600 million. We continue to identify opportunities to reduce costs further and we'll keep you appraised as appropriate. Turning to operations and beginning with unconventionals, in the second quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter and 80,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. Higher-than-expected production availability and improved well performance allowed us to substantially exceed our second quarter net production guidance of 100,000 to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In line with our plan and as previously communicated, we reduced our Bakken rig count from an average of 12 in the first quarter to an average of 8 in the second quarter, which is where we expect to remain for the balance of the year. Over 2015, we expect to drill 187 wells, complete 217, and bring 225 wells online, compared to last year where we drilled 261 wells, completed 230 and brought 238 online. In the first half of 2015, we brought 137 new wells online and we expect to bring 88 wells online in the second half of the year as the lower rig count takes effect. As a result of strong performance, we are increasing our full year 2015 net production forecast for the Bakken by 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to average between 105,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We do expect Bakken production to turn modestly lower in the second half of the year, reflecting the lower rig count and the resulting lower number of completions. In the third quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average between 105,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Through the application of our distinctive Lean manufacturing capability combined with our supply chain cost reductions we continue to drive Bakken drilling and completion costs lower with the second quarter averaging $5.6 million per well versus $6.8 million in the first quarter and $7.4 million in the year-ago quarter. For full year 2015, we now expect drilling and completion costs to average between $5.8 million and $6 million per well, below our previous guidance of $6 million to $6.5 million per well. We know from benchmarking that we are delivering some of the lowest cost and highest productivity wells in the Bakken, which in combination means that we are generating some of the highest returns in the play. With an eight rig program at current strip prices and costs, we have about a 10-year inventory of drilling locations that can generate after-tax returns of 15% or higher. Moving to the Utica. In the second quarter the joint venture drilled 10 wells, completed 15, and brought 9 on production. Net production for the second quarter averaged 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter and 17,000 barrels of oil in the first quarter of 2015. Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica acreage is largely held by production, which allows us to reduce activity in the short term while preserving the long-term upside. As previously mentioned, due to the current pricing environment the joint venture elected to focus activities on the liquids-rich Harrison County acreage utilizing a single Hess-operated rig across the JV. We continue to drive down our well costs in the Utica. Through application of our distinctively manufacturing capability and supply chain reductions, we now project our 2015 full-year drilling and completion costs in the Utica to average between $9.2 million and $9.5 million per well as compared to $13.7 million in 2014. As a result of improving efficiency, we now forecast that the JV will drill 20 to 25 wells and bring 25 to 30 new wells online in 2015. Well productivity continues to be encouraging and as a result, we're increasing our 2015 net production guidance by 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to a range of 20,000 to 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now, turning to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter at our Tubular Bells field in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator. Due to a delay in bringing on the fourth well, coupled with the now-resolved compressor mechanical issues we experienced in the fourth quarter, we are lowering our 2015 full year forecast to between 25,000 and 30,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. The fourth well is now in production and is being ramped up to full capacity. In Equatorial Guinea, net production averaged 43,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter at our Okume and Ceiba fields in which Hess holds an 85% working interest and is operator. During the quarter, we brought online the OF-15 (18:39) well, the final well in the current drilling campaign at a rate of 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The mobilization of the rig has commenced and will be completed in the third quarter. 4D Seismic processing is underway to support future exploitation drilling. In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall field in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. One new producer was brought online and planned maintenance activities were successfully completed. We continue to expect full year 2015 net production to be in the range of 30,000 to 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Gulf of Thailand at North Malay Basin, in which Hess as a 50% working interest and is operator, second quarter net production averaged 39 million cubic feet per day through the early production system and is expected to remain at around 40 million cubic feet per day through 2016. In June, we installed two wellhead platform jackets and commenced construction on wellhead platform topsides as part of the full field development project which is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day in 2017. Moving to exploration. The first two wells from our new program delivered encouraging results. In the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to evaluate the results of the Chevron-operated Sicily discovery in which Hess holds a 25% working interest. Sicily penetrated a four-way lower tertiary structure located in approximately 6,400 feet of water. As John mentioned, an appraisal well to further evaluate the discovery is planned to spud late 2015 or early 2016. In May, ExxonMobil announced a significant oil discovery at the Liza prospect on Stabroek Block of offshore Guyana in which Hess holds a 30% earned interest. The operator recently commenced an extensive 3D seismic survey to further delineate both the discovered resource and the potential of the block. In closing, I am very pleased with the performance of our team who once again achieved strong operational results. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2015. As previously announced, we have reported Bakken Midstream results beginning with the second quarter of 2015. As a result, we have recast prior quarters to reflect the breakout of the Bakken Midstream from E&P. In our second quarter supplemental presentation located on the Hess website, we have included recast quarterly information of E&P and Midstream for 2014 and the first two quarters of 2015. Now turning to results. Our adjusted net loss which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods was $147 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $279 million in the first quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, the corporation incurred a net loss of $567 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared with a net loss of $389 million in the first quarter of 2015. Turning to Exploration and production on an adjusted basis, E&P incurred losses of $96 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $221 million in the first quarter of 2015. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the second quarter of 2015 and first quarter of 2015 were as follows. Higher realized selling prices improved the results by $118 million. Higher sales volumes improved results by $71 million. Higher cash operating costs in Bakken Midstream tariffs reduced results by $20 million. Higher DD&A expense reduced results by $46 million. All other items net to an improvement in results of $2 million for an overall improvement in the second quarter adjusted results of $125 million. In May, we expanded our crude oil hedging program by entering into WTI crude collars covering 20,000 barrels per day through the end of 2015. As a reminder, we previously hedged 50,000 barrels per day for 2015 using Brent crude collars. Both the Brent and WTI crude collars have a floor price of $60 per barrel and a ceiling price of $80 per barrel. For the quarter, our E&P operations were overlifted compared with production by approximately 400,000 barrels which had the effect of decreasing our second quarter after tax loss by approximately $8 million. The E&P effective income tax rate excluding items affecting comparability was a benefit of 56% for the second quarter of 2015. This outcome was favorable to guidance and primarily resulted from the mix of income generated by operations during the quarter. The E&P effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2015 was a benefit of 48%. In the press release, we announced a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $385 million related to our onshore reporting unit. This charge was triggered under the accounting standards that require goodwill be reallocated and a review for impairment be performed when an operating segment is split, as was the case of breaking out Bakken Midstream from E&P in the quarter. The goodwill impairment for the onshore reporting unit reflects the impact of the reallocation of goodwill and the low commodity price environment. Turning to Midstream activities, the Bakken Midstream segment had net income of $32 million in the second quarter of 2015, compared to $27 million in the first quarter of 2015, while EBITDA amounted to $74 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $65 million in the previous quarter. In the earnings supplement, we have provided quarterly consolidated income statements of the company to facilitate an understanding of the movement in reported numbers caused by separating the Bakken Midstream segment from E&P. Using the second quarter of 2015 as an example, E&P metrics changed as follows. Cash operating costs improved by $1.15 per barrel to $15.65 per barrel as $42 million of costs are now included in Bakken Midstream. DD&A improved by $0.62 per barrel to $28.22 with $22 million of DD&A transferred to Bakken Midstream. As a result, overall E&P unit operating costs improved by $1.77 per barrel and were $43.87 per barrel in the second quarter. Bakken Midstream tariff expense was $116 million or $3.26 per barrel which, combined with the improved unit costs, decreased E&P's pre-tax earnings by $52 million or $1.49 per barrel. This reduction in E&P earnings has been transferred to the Bakken Midstream segment as shown in the press release on page 19. Turning to corporate and interest. Corporate and interest expenses excluding items affecting comparability and after income taxes, were $83 million in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $85 million in the first quarter of 2015. Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter including a decrease of $170 million from changes in working capital was $541 million. Excluding working capital changes, cash flow from operations was $711 million, a 51% increase from the first quarter. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $1.013 billion. Common stock acquired and retired amounted to $11 million. Repayments of debt were $17 million. Common stock dividends paid were $72 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $3 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $575 million. We had $931 million of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2015. Total debt was approximately $6 billion at both June 30, 2015 and March 31, 2015. The corporation's debt-to-capitalization ratio at June 30, 2015 was 22% compared to 21.6% at March 31, 2015. On July 1, 2015, we closed the Bakken Midstream joint venture with Global Infrastructure Partners for after-tax proceeds of approximately $3 billion which includes the corporation's share of debt proceeds issued by the joint venture at formation. I would like to provide updated guidance for the remainder of 2015. Starting with E&P, for the full year of 2015, cash costs for E&P operations are reduced $1.50 per barrel of oil equivalent to $16, to $17 per barrel of oil equivalent. The separation of the Bakken Midstream segment is responsible for $1 of this reduction and the additional $0.50 reduction is due to our ongoing cost efficiency initiatives. For the third quarter of 2015, cash costs are expected to be in the range of $16.50 to $17.50 per barrel of oil equivalent. DD&A per barrel guidance remains at $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for both the third quarter and full year 2015, resulting in total E&P unit operating costs of $45 to $47 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $44.50 to $46.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2015. The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $3.55 to $3.65 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter of 2015 and $3.40 to $3.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2015. Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million in the third quarter and our full year guidance of $380 million to $400 million is unchanged. The E&P effective tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability and Libyan operations is expected to be a benefit in the range of 41% to 45% for the third quarter and 44% to 48% for the full year. Turning to Midstream. For the third and fourth quarter of 2015, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, will be in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Now, for corporate and interest. For the third quarter of 2015, corporate expenses are estimated to be in a range of $30 million to $35 million net of taxes and interest expenses are estimated to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million net of taxes. The full-year 2015 guidance for corporate expenses of $120 million to $130 million net of taxes and interest expenses of $205 million to $215 million net of taxes remains unchanged. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : And your first question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Please proceed. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Good morning, guys, and good quarter. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : One of the things that people have been focusing on is the trajectory of the Bakken and kind of your pace. Greg, you've kind of outlined that. As you think about glide planing down in third quarter and fourth quarter at this pace, how does that flatten versus your second quarter peak volumes? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: It's a good question. I think with an eight rig program we expect to be able to hold kind of long-term production flat at or near this 100,000 barrels a day which I think we've said on the previous calls. And I think as John mentioned in his remarks, with this eight rig program at current strip prices and well costs we've got about a 10-year inventory of drilling locations that generate after-tax returns in excess of 15% or higher. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Yeah. And then, that's helpful, and then as you think about Tubular Bells ramp with the fourth well coming online, how does that roll forward? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: I think again in our guidance, we did lower our guidance because of the operating problems that we discussed and the deferral of the fourth well. And so, I mean the glide path, we'll stay within our guidance as we gave on the call, right? David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Okay. That's fair. And thinking about Guyana and the significant discovery, haven't known you guys as long some other exploration companies, can you put significant in a ballpark for me? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, we can't. It's just again, it's too early. I think, recall we did encounter more than 295 feet of high quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs in this block, and again, the entire block is about 6.6 million acres. So, as John and I both said in our opening remarks, really the next step is we've started shooting 3D seismic on the block and we continue to evaluate the results of the well but obviously it's very encouraging. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson with Evercore. Please proceed. Douglas Todd Terreson - Evercore ISI : Good morning, everybody. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Good morning, Doug. Douglas Todd Terreson - Evercore ISI : One of the key themes today and also in the industry has been that lower service costs relating to expense in capital productivity. And on this point, I wanted to see if you'd elaborate a little bit more on your experience thus far; namely, whether the changes that have unfolded have been similar to your expectations and also previous cycles, for John? And also any insight into the pace of change that you're seeing in the market? I mean we talked about, you guys talked about a $600 million figure on the call I think, and so the question is how does that compare to what your expectations were for savings earlier in the year? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, I think, I think compares very well. So, just to give you an example. So, the $1.2 million per well that we reduced in the quarter in the Bakken, if you look at where those savings came from, supply chain savings amounted to about 60% of those savings. And then the Lean manufacturing efficiency gains made up the balance of the 40% reduction. So again, fairly significant results from the supply chain. Douglas Todd Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay. And then also just another quick question on Guyana. First, will you guys be able to book reserves in the country? Do we know that and also how significant do you think that this interaction is with the opposition from the Venezuelan government? Is that something that we should be concerned about or focused on; how do you think about that? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: On the political side, I'm going to leave that to the politicians. But we don't think it's going to have any impact on our financial position there or our reserve position there. Douglas Todd Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay. And John, can you guys book reserves there if in fact there are any in the future? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes. Yes, we can. Douglas Todd Terreson - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thanks a lot guys. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Please proceed. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I also have a couple, if I may and guys I'm afraid I'm going stick with Guyana for a second. I think in your Analyst Day last year you suggested that the block, the whole area had a risk resource net to have somewhere in the order of 500 million barrels. Now I realize that was a theoretical probability of geological success and so on, but, I'm guessing when you announce this \u2013 the operator announces a significant discovery, you've de-risked a number of the parameters such as proving a hydrocarbon system trap, fuel migration, all that good stuff. So I'm just wondering if you could help qualify how you came up with a 500 million number on how this declared success changes the risk profile of that estimate. And I've got a follow up, please. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, well, Doug, obviously that 500 million barrels was a risk resource estimate at the time. Clearly, this well has helped derisk that. I can't really give you any more guidance than that but it was a very positive result from the well. The big risk there that we were trying to understand was there a working petroleum system and clearly there is on the block. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I guess I'll \u2013 I won't pursue it for now but suffice it to say, that 500 million, is that kind of worst case, if you like? A worst case would've been zero I guess, but in terms of \u2013 I guess I'm just trying to understand the scale of the prospect backlog of the area is there \u2013 have you and your partner kind of figured out what next steps are at this point outside of shooting seismic? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: It's a fair question. The seismic is the next step, Doug, to high grade the block further and then we will then consider further evaluation activities and really you need to look to the operator for further color on this subject. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I appreciate that, John. My follow up is really more of kind of, I guess it's really more of a challenge question because you've clearly done a tremendous job releasing or securing at least market visibility on the value of the Midstream; by my calculation is about a quarter of your current enterprise value. Your share price along with the sector has basically gone straight down pretty much since you made that announcement. So this $17 a share thereabouts that, the associated value of that appears to have been somewhat ignored. So my question is now you've got $4 billion more or less of cash on the balance sheet. How does this share buyback program compete for capital against other drilling opportunities in a $50 oil price environment? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Doug, obviously, use of proceeds very fair question. And obviously, with the very strong liquidity position the company has it's key to remind everyone as we said on our last call after the Midstream joint venture was announced, that our first, second and third priority in use of proceeds will be to preserve the strength of our balance sheet in the current low oil price environment. We need to maintain our financial strength, it's vital in this low-price environment; we don't know how low it will go and how long it will go. So that's going to be the first, second and third priority to make sure that we can fund the projects that we have including our projects that are investing in longer-term growth, be it North Malay Basin or Stampede or some the exploration activities that we have that are very disciplined. Our second effort or priority then would be to provide additional financial flexibility for future growth opportunities should they meet our strategic, economic and liquidity priorities. And we're going to be very disciplined in that regard given the first priority being to preserve the strength of our balance sheet. And last but not least, we will continue to repurchase stock on a disciplined basis. So I think it's very important for people to understand the key priority in this environment is for us to preserve the strength of our balance sheet. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : John, could I push that a little bit? What is the cash balance that you see to meet those objectives before the buyback? Like I say, $4 billion now, is that enough? Is that too much? What's your order of magnitude as to what you need to meet the first two criteria? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Hey, I guess, Doug, the way we look at it and I'd like to answer it is \u2013 so as you know, we remain committed to managing our business to be cash generative over the long term. So, with this low price oil environment, what have we done? What's the self-help? So, first, we've reduced our capital spend from $5.6 billion in 2014 to $4.4 billion in 2015 and we will further reduce capital in 2016. And as Greg mentioned earlier, during 2015, our cost reduction efforts have yielded over $600 million of savings and we continue to be focused on reducing costs further. So, there's the self-help that we are doing. Now, kind of getting to your point, we do have near-term cash flow deficits at these low prices and it is being driven by our spend of approximately $1.4 billion on projects where we're investing for longer-term growth. So these projects that John mentioned, it's the North Malay Basin, Stampede, it's Tubular Bells on the development side, and in exploration we have capital spending now for the significant discovery at Liza in Guyana and in the Gulf of Mexico at the Sicily prospect. So as John mentioned now, our advantaged liquidity position with nearly $4 billion of cash post the completion of our Bakken Midstream JV that allows us to fund these growth projects and preserve our top quartile operating capabilities and we're really using that then to position us to capitalize as prices recover when we can then generate free cash flow. So, that's kind of a combination with what John said and how we are looking at our balance sheet right now. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. I'll leave it there, guys. Thank you. Operator : You're next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. I guess kind of following along the lines of the uses of capital here. You clearly have one of the best balance sheets in the sector. What does the acquisition front look like? I mean it's been relatively quiet for the industry but historically, this is \u2013 double dip in oil prices would tend to accelerate the process. So I'm just sort of curious, seeing anything more interesting, how does that need to compare versus your growth opportunities and so forth? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Well you all follow the stock market as do we in terms of some of these prospective opportunities that could potentially fit our strategic needs in our portfolio. The prices of some of those type of opportunities has come down more than the companies with a strong balance sheet as ours, we're looking. But again, I said before, our first, second and third priority is to keep our financial strength in the current environment that we think will be with us for some time and to come out of this environment strong. If there is an opportunity that makes financial sense, strategic sense and doesn't impair our balance sheet strength we will be very disciplined in evaluating it. Obviously, we have not found anything to date. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And any help you can give us on how you would think about the returns of an acquisition versus the returns of drilling? Do they need to be equivalent, one better than the other? Just any further clarity there. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: We will always invest for returns, and it will have to be competitive with our alternatives. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's it for me. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes. Good morning. I'm just trying to reconcile your improvements in operational performance and then the CapEx that's unchanged. I mean obviously, the Bakken wells seem to have come in a little bit below your guidance. I mean, you're still drilling an 8 rig program and I noticed that the Utica wells are also \u2013 I mean, well done for getting the costs down dramatically in the Utica. So maybe talk through why that perhaps isn't showing up in a sort of a CapEx reduction for this year? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, Ed, if you think about it, we're basically maintaining an 8 rig program. So as we continue to gain efficiencies in our spud-to-spud, days between spud now is about 18 days. So what that means is that you drill more wells in the year than what you planned. So effectively that CapEx is consumed by continuing that 8 rig program. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Right. But the implication might be next year there would be some lower CapEx from these savings, as well as the timing of other projects? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I think that's a reasonable assumption. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And then, you know, there was a bit of a debate on I think the full FY call about continuing to drill in South Arne and Valhall where perhaps as long as the reservoirs aren't damaged in terms of pressure management, maybe there's a little bit more flexibility say, oil prices were low and you came back and said, well look the economics still works so we're going to carry on doing them. I'm just wondering as the prices have wallowed around at this current level whether anything has changed there in terms of CapEx planning for next year? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: I think again, we haven't given our 2015 guidance. But certainly for this year, we're contracted four rig in South Arne and we'll continue to execute that program. It's generating very good returns in South Arne well above our cost of capital. Similarly in Valhall, recall though that we did shut down the IP drilling rig in Valhall this year. So we've got one rig out and then we have the remaining drilling is with a jackup there. Again, a contracted jackup rig and we're continuing that program. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks very much. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Uh huh. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Firstly on cash flow for the quarter, can you just help me get as close as I can to what you think the ongoing cash generation, what the business will be at $60 oil and how representative this quarter was of the ongoing cash flow that you think you'll make at that kind of price level? Thanks. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: I mean, if you get $60 oil, obviously you're going to have higher cash flows for our business because we've got a significant amount of oil production, so I mean it's difficult. I would tell you overall when you look at Hess because of our oily portfolio a $1 change in oil prices does increase our cash flows by a little over $70 million. So, that's the kind of sensitivity you can look at from our portfolio and flex on different oil prices. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. And what should I consider to be the clean operating cash flow for this quarter, Q2, I think there's some \u2013 likely some disproportions in the working capital. Thanks. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. Yeah, so there was $170 million reduction in the cash flow from working capital. So, if you add that back in you get $711 million of cash flow from operations and that's up 51% from the first quarter reflecting the improved oil prices in the second quarter. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Yes and John you guided that essentially next year's CapEx will be lower, I guess assuming that we're at this kind of oil price level? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : So you're not obviously going to say more about the kind of level we should think about? I'm just wondering how long a cash deficit can be run given what you've also said about the importance of the balance sheet? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes. So I mean, again it will be lower. I mean, we'll have to work with our partners and we'll see what prices are as we get into 2016. But as I mentioned, we will be funding these growth projects that we have, so North Malay Basin and Stampede will continue. We will be working with Exxon with spending in Guyana and Chevron on Sicily. So we have these growth projects to fund. Now, we've got nearly $4 billion with the post the completion of the Bakken Midstream JV, so we're in a great position to be able to fund these growth projects and position us to generate free cash flow as oil prices recover. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Understood. Thank you. One area of potential cost savings would be to merge with another company. Have you considered that particularly in the Bakken? Thank you. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Obviously, we don't comment on such matters. And you know that, Paul. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Just checking, John. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche. Please proceed. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Maybe if I could follow up on \u2013 one more question on CapEx. You've talked in the past about kind of a run rate from the fourth quarter on of $950 million, I think. Is that still a good number or is the cost savings that you're seeing potentially driving that a little bit lower? Any updates on kind of the pro forma run rate as you're stabilized in the eight rig program? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Again, it's still early for us. We'll be looking obviously at oil prices. We have to work with partners on what we're doing in the partnerships that we have for the fields. So it's just at this point right now we don't want to be more specific than what I said that we do have $4.4 billion this year, 2016's capital will be lower than that $4.4 billion and we will be looking at everything from the CapEx side as well as on the OpEx side because we're going to be continued to be focused on costs in this low price environment. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, and then maybe one follow-up on the Bakken. I guess could you talk, and I dropped off the call unfortunately for a little bit so I'm not sure if you addressed it, but can you talk a little bit of the production which continues to exceed expectations, can you talk \u2013 is that more of a function of a quicker pace of drilling than you had expected previously? Is it well performance? Maybe a little bit on what you're seeing on well performance and then finally in terms of the production mix between oil, NGL and gas, what's kind of a right place do you think for us to kind of stabilize that going forward? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. So, if you look at the difference between Q1 and Q2 in the Bakken, we did have an increase of about 11,000 barrels a day. There were really three factors associated with that. The first was we had a high number of new wells online in the second quarter. So, we had 67 wells online. The second factor was we had a 2% increase in the production availability. So, the operations guys have been doing a great job getting the reliability and availability up. And the third factor was we had increased gas capture at Tioga. Obviously, both our own volumes as our own volumes went up, but also third-party volumes as well. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: And then just from a product mix standpoint for the 119,000 barrels a day in the quarter, about 85,000 barrels a day were oil or 71% of it. 22,000 barrels a day were NGLs so 19%, and then gas was 71 million SCFs per day or about 10% of the BOE. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And is that a good kind of mix to think about going forward or, we've seen.... John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yeah, I think... Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: I think that is a reasonable mix. I mean you're getting now the ramp up of the Tioga gas plant so we've had some changes as that's moved on. So if you looked at the average for 2014 we were up at \u2013 we only had 12% of NGLs and 8% gas so now you're beginning to see some of the uplift from the Tioga gas plant. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: You've spoken a lot here on the sharp reduction that you've seen in your Bakken well costs. Can you also talk to what you're doing on the technology front if the type of well you're drilling has changed at all? And can you talk to any changes you are seeing in well productivity? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: I think our well design has not changed. So again, it's a typical 35-stage sliding sleeve completion in the Bakken, that hasn't changed. Proppant loading of 70,000 to 100,000 pounds per stage depending upon the area. In terms of technology, we've got some 50-stage trials under our belt, so 50-stage sliding sleeve, those trials have gone well. So once we get a few more in the ground and are convinced of the reliability of the completion system we'll be evaluating whether or not we switch to that as a value-accretive improvement to the Bakken completions. We've tried some slickwater fracs. We do not see that those add enough incremental to value to justify the additional costs. We've tried some higher proppant loadings and really kind of the same conclusion. It doesn't generate enough incremental value. And I guess the final thing is we are, as you know, experimenting with a tighter infills, nine and eight spacing pilots. We've got about 38 wells online now in that configuration. Now, only 13 of these wells have been online for more than 90 days. I will say the initial results are encouraging but it's still early days. I'd like to get more wells in the ground and on production before we draw any final conclusions for that. And so we expect to be in a position by year-end or early first quarter to provide some color on some results on that nine and eight infill. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. And then your backlog in the Bakken has been coming down based on the number of completed versus drilled wells. Do you anticipate building backlog in the second half, drawing backlog or holding flat? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, we don't. We're pretty much at our rhythm bin size now, which is about 25 to 30 wells at any given moment that are uncompleted and we would expect to carry that level of wells into next year. But that's about as low as it can go. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Please proceed. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys. Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: A number of quick questions. This is for John Rielly. John, when I'm looking at your international operation, if I strip out the special item and also then strip out the estimate on the FX, the hedging impact, you will report somewhere around the pre-tax profit of $34 million and you have a tax credit of $38 million. I'm trying to reconcile that, why that you have a profit then, then you will have a tax credit in your international operation? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Sure, Paul. It's \u2013 there's \u2013 once you get into this law of small numbers, you get into these strange tax rates. There's really nothing unusual. We have some small credits and I'll walk you through an example. We have small credits sitting on in the international side and some small, kind of call it debits on the other side, for an overall rate that came in, as you know, at the above guidance on that benefit side. So what happens is this is just a simple example, if you have a loss in Norway of $10 and you have an income in JDA of $10, you put those two together and you have $0 income. But Norway has gotten 80% tax rate, so you're booking an $8 benefit on Norway and JDA has a 10% rate, so you're only booking $1. So you get a benefit of $7 on $0 income. It's that mix of income that's causing the strange numbers in international. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I see. Okay. On the cash flow, if your DD&A is about $1 billion, your net loss excluding the special items is about $147 million, it seems to suggest that your cash flow from operations should be higher than even after you adjust for the working capital. Is there any other items that \u2013 it seems like there's another $100 million, $150 million that is more than your cash flow, are those item, is going to be repeatable in the future? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Your math is very good, Paul, as usual. What it is, is because where we're in the losses right now, and I think we've given guidance on that, is that the majority of the tax benefit is deferred. So, you've got a benefit sitting against that loss and that was the one number I didn't hear you say. That was reducing it then down to the $711 million. Now, it's obviously going to depend on prices and what happens here going forward. I mean, it's the same guidance that I've been giving. In the U.S. and in Norway, we're not paying cash taxes and won't be for five years and potentially longer if these prices stay lower. So, it all depends on where the profit is but if we stay in a loss position, we will continue to have that deferred tax benefit. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I see. And maybe this is for John Hess. I assume that you will complete the IPO for the Bakken MLP? If that decision has been made that the cash proceeds \u2013 who is going to keep it? Is it going to be split between the joint venture partner or it would be kept inside the MLP? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: So, when the IPO is done, and the proceeds, the proceeds will go to the partners of the JV, that's basically the way that we're looking at. Nothing's been finally decided but that's how it would be \u2013 it would be split between the two partners, the 50/50 partners. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: John, I think there are a lot of people who ask about the CapEx, maybe if I could, maybe looking at it slightly different. If I look at to maintain your current asset mix, and that the production is flat and taking into consideration of your commitment in the major growth project that you already commit. What is the minimum CapEx that we need for next year? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So, what we've been, I guess, talk about with the growth projects that we have. So, we've got a $4.4 billion of budget this year. It includes, so I'm going to add a little bit more because we had some other growth capital in 2015, so we have about a $1.6 billion of investment in offshore development say, an exploration. So, when you subtract it from the total, we've got about $3 billion, under $3 billion, to maintain kind of current production levels. So, you do have this North Malay Basin and Stampede going into next year and the thing that I can't talk about right now is what happens in Guyana, what happens in Sicily. So, again, I think the best I can do right now is to say the guidance will be below $4.4 billion but we just can't tell you what that number... John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. And I think another perspective obviously, Paul, as the entire industry is running deficits, all the oil producers of the world are running deficits. And depending upon how low oil prices go and how long they go for, obviously that will figure in our calculus as well about how far we reduce our CapEx program next year. We have further flexibility to reduce in the Bakken and Utica and we also have flexibility to reduce in our offshore if it's appropriate. We are going to invest for returns, but we also intend to be cash generative over the medium term. So, it's a balance. Good returns, but if the money is not there, we will reduce our CapEx even further and that's going to be an iterative process between now and the end of the year. And when we finalize our program, obviously, we'll communicate that to the investors out there. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Great. Final question is for Greg. Greg, is there any data you can share about the two discoveries in Guyana and in the Gulf of Mexico, Sicily, in terms of the pay zone whether that those is primary black oil, condensate gas, any kind of information you could provide on those two discoveries? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: They're both black oil based on what we know right now. On the Sicily discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, it's lower tertiary. And in Guyana, it's a crustaceous play that we're currently looking at right now. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Do you have the \u2013 how thick is the pay zone or that kind of information? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. In Guyana, we can't give that information yet. On Sicily, you'll have to ask the operator about that. But consistent with Exxon's press release in May in Guyana, the well encountered more than 295 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. So, you do have a net pay zone that. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Please proceed. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. First, I'd like to return to the subject of the pilot tests. First question is how widespread are the tests across your acreage? And then following up, if they prove successful what sort of uplift to drilling locations might be possible? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. So, they're spread out, but because we're concentrating in the core of the core, they're primarily in the core of the Bakken. So, it's spread out over 14 DSUs, and in those 14 DSUs this year we plan to get 82 pilot wells in the ground. Now as I mentioned, 38 of those are currently online and, but only 13 have been online more than 90 days. And as I said, the initial results are very encouraging but it's still early days. I want to get a lot more wells in the ground before I make a final decision on that hopefully by year-end, early in the first quarter we'll be in a position to make that decision. Obviously, if you do go to a nine and eight configuration, it won't apply across the entire field but it will obviously increase your well locations for the Bakken. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Right. And importantly it increases your best well locations. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yes. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: My second question was if commodity prices remained depressed in 2016, will you continue to concentrate Utica drilling in Harrison County or do you have any requirements to hold acreage elsewhere that would require you to drill in another county in 2016? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: It's on the margins. There isn't any significant HBP requirement so obviously if prices do continue where they are, we're going to continue in Harrison County and why do we do that because that's truly the sweet spot of the play. It's the wettest part of the play and it also has a 95% net revenue interest as well on that acreage. So obviously that helps the economics. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay great. And my last question is, I haven't heard too much about Ghana and the discussion of the portfolio. Is there any update on the Ghana timeline particularly now that you've got a partner there? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, there's not. I mean we're just continuing all of the technical studies on Ghana. We're also going through FEED processes, et cetera. And we're in discussions with the Ghanaian government to understand how the border dispute and the ongoing international law, the Sea Treaty proceedings are going on the block, and how that might affect progress on the block. But we're committed to advancing the work to the extent feasible, including all those technical studies and pursuing appropriate commercial agreements. One thing we can't do is we can't get a drilling rig or a seismic vessel out there in the disputed area. So, it's pretty much technical studies. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please proceed. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have two quick ones in relation to Bakken Midstream, if I may? You were talking about at the beginning of the year an IPO sometime in 2015. Is that still the targeted timetable for taking this public? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Unfortunately, Pavel, we're in a quiet period right now, so I can't give you anything specific. So it's going to depend just on the SEC review and market conditions for the timing of the IPO. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right, all right, fair enough. And for Hess to remain the operator of the joint venture is there a minimum economic interest that you have to maintain? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes, there is a minimum economic interest. Yeah, so we would have to drop down though considerably before that would happen. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: To be clear, our intent is to control and operate the venture. So, let's be clear on that. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. What is that percentage? Just to clarify. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: I think as I said before, our intent is to control and operate the venture. I wouldn't want to speculate otherwise. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Appreciate it. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Guy Baber with Simmons. Please proceed. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Thanks for fitting me in here and congratulations on another strong quarter. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Thanks for hanging in there on the phone call. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Just one strategic question for me. But understanding maintaining financial strength is priority is number one, I was just hoping to press for a bit more color on the potential to add a resource and flexibility via bottom of the cycle acquisition. You've mentioned that meeting strategic objectives, it would be key for you in doing that. Could you just elaborate on what those strategic objectives are and I'm not sure if you can be specific or not, but any updated thoughts around long-term portfolio mix? Whether you have a desire for more onshore versus offshore or U.S. versus international or whether you're agnostic on those fronts? Any strategic color on that front would be very helpful. Thanks. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Obviously, we're always looking to upgrade our portfolio. So anything would have to strengthen our portfolio strategically, economically, in terms of providing profitable and visible resource growth. As we look out there, we see our mix thing roughly half unconventionals, half conventional, half onshore, half offshore, half-U.S., half international. Obviously, it's a dynamic market and we'll be very disciplined about any opportunities that we consider; but commenting further than that would be pure speculation and we don't want to do that. The key is we're going to be disciplined. And again, our top priority is to maintain our financial strength in a low-price environment because it may be with us for some time. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2015 Hess Corporation Conference Call. My name is Mallory and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Mallory. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Offer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will view progress in executing our strategy in the current low oil price environment and provide some highlights from the quarter. Greg Hill will discuss our operating performance and John Rielly will then review our financial results. The three key principles that guide us are to preserve the strength of our balance sheet, preserve our capabilities, and preserve our growth options. We have moved aggressively over the course of 2015 to reduce our costs, capturing about $600 million in reductions so far, split evenly between capital expenditures and cash operating costs. For 2016, we intend to significantly reduce our level of spending in order to preserve our balance sheet and liquidity. While our 2016 budgeting process will not be finalized until the end of the year, we currently expect next year's E&P capital and exploratory expenditures to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion compared to $4.1 billion in 2015, excluding expenditures associated with a 50% interest in our Bakken Midstream joint venture. This reduction of more than $1 billion represents approximately a 27% decrease from 2015. In the Bakken, we are currently planning to operate four rigs in 2016. We dropped one rig in the third quarter and plan to operate seven rigs for the balance of this year. We also plan to curtail investment in our offshore assets in 2016. We intend to defer further development drilling in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, and in Equatorial Guinea. In addition, we will complete a major booster compression project at the JDA in the first half of 2016, which will reduce our spend there next year. In terms of our financial position, we have one of the strongest balance sheets and liquidity positions within our peer group. At September 30, our net debt-to-capitalization ratio, excluding the Bakken Midstream joint venture, was 13% and we had nearly $8 billion of available liquidity including $3 billion of cash. In 2016, we expect to fund our base business expenditures and dividends through cash flow from operations and use cash on the balance sheet to fund our growth investments, which include two development projects and exploration and appraisal activities. While it is prudent to plan for continued low oil prices in 2016, we also believe that Hess is well positioned to benefit when oil prices recover. We are more leveraged to liquids than our peers, with industry-leading cash margins. Also, our advantaged tax positions in the United States and Norway will accelerate cash flow growth as oil prices improve. Our portfolio has significant growth opportunities; in the near-term, from the Bakken and Utica; in the intermediate term, from new field start-ups at North Malay Basin in 2017 and Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in 2018; and in the longer term, recent material exploration discoveries at Liza in Guyana and Sicily in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico provide significant upside potential for our shareholders. Both of these discoveries are planned to be appraised in early 2016. Now turning to our financial results. In the third quarter of 2015, we posted a net loss of $279 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $291 million, or $1.03 per share, compared to net income of $1.24 per share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2014, our financial results were primarily impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices, which more than offset the impact of higher crude oil and natural gas sales volumes, and lower cash costs and exploration expense. During the third quarter, we again delivered strong operating performance. Net production averaged 380,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 21% from the year-ago quarter, excluding Libya. This improvement was driven by higher production from the Bakken and Utica shale plays and the Tubular Bells Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In light of our continued strong performance, we are increasing our forecast for 2015 full-year production to a range of 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from our previous guidance of 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This increase represents a 16% to 18% improvement over 2014, excluding Libya. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we forecast production to average approximately 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Based on 2016 capital and exploratory expenditures in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion, our preliminary forecast is, for 2016 production, to be in the range of 330,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Turning to the Bakken. Production averaged 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, above our guidance range. For the full year 2015, we now expect production to average approximately 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our previous guidance of a range of 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we forecast production to average approximately 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Based on our current plans for a four-rig program next year, our preliminary forecast for Bakken production is to average in the range of 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In summary, we delivered strong operating performance while maintaining a robust financial and liquidity position. With further significant spending reductions underway, we are well positioned in the current low oil price environment and are taking a disciplined approach to preserve our financial strength, competitively advantaged capabilities, and long-term growth options. I will now turn the call over to Greg. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thank you, John. I'd like to provide an operational update and review overall progress in executing our strategy. We believe strongly that it's prudent to plan for continued low oil prices next year and prioritize preserving the strength of our balance sheet. In this light, we are planning further significant reductions in our capital and exploratory expenditures in 2016. In the Bakken, we plan to operate a four-rig program next year compared to 8.5 rigs in 2015 and 17 rigs in 2014. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we plan to defer further development drilling at the Tubular Bells and Llano Fields. In the North Sea, we will complete the current drilling program at the Hess-operated South Arne Field in Denmark in the first quarter of 2016, and will then release the rig and defer further drilling. In Equatorial Guinea, where demobilization of the rig was completed during the third quarter of this year, we will defer drilling in 2016 to allow time for processing and interpretation of new 4D seismic. At the Valhall Field in Norway, the operator plans to leave the platform rig stacked over the majority of 2016. And at the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand, we will complete a major booster compression project in the first half of 2016, after which capital for the rest of the year will be significantly reduced. As John mentioned, when oil prices recover, we are competitively well positioned and have both the capabilities and the opportunities to drive future profitable growth. Now, turning to the third quarter of 2015. We delivered strong operating performance across our portfolio, further improved our onshore drilling costs, and progressed our offshore developments and exploration activities. Starting with production. In the third quarter, we averaged 380,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, exceeding our previous guidance of 355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 365,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, reflecting strong performance from our producing assets. As a result, we have raised our full-year 2015 production guidance to between 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. On this same basis, we forecast production in the fourth quarter to average approximately 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our fourth quarter forecast reflects the impact of lower activity levels across our portfolio. Turning to unconventionals. In the third quarter, production from the Bakken averaged 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, and 86,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. High production availability and strong well performance allowed us to exceed our previous guidance of 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter. In the third quarter, we operated an average of seven rigs in the Bakken and brought 48 wells online. In 2015, we expect to drill 183 wells, complete 212, and bring 219 online, with an average of 8.5 rigs for the year. This compares to last year, when we drilled 261 wells, completed 230, and brought 238 wells online, with an average of 17 rigs. For the drilling rigs alone, this represents a 40% efficiency improvement year-on-year as result of the application of our distinctive lean manufacturing capability. In the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken production to continue to move modestly lower and average between 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting fewer new wells being brought online. For the full year 2015, we expect Bakken production to average approximately 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is at the upper-end of the guidance range announced on our second quarter call. Through lean manufacturing, we continue to drive Bakken drilling and completion costs lower. In the third quarter, our D&C costs averaged $5.3 million per well, versus $5.6 million in the second quarter, and $7.2 million in the year-ago quarter. With these low costs and by drilling some of the highest productivity wells in the play, we continue to generate some of the highest returns in the Bakken. Despite moving to four rigs, we expect to hold production in 2016 relatively flat with fourth quarter 2015 guidance through a combination of efficiency gains, including lower spud-to-spud days, higher well and facility availability and by capturing more NGLs and natural gas at the gas plant. Our preliminary 2016 forecast is to bring approximately 100 new wells online with production averaging between 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As a reminder, substantially, all of our Bakken acreage is held by production and assuming a four-rig program at current strip prices and well costs, we retain a greater than 10-year inventory of drilling locations that can generate after-tax returns of 15% or higher. In total, we have more than 3,000 future drilling locations in the Bakken. And, as prices recover, we will increase our rig count and activity level as appropriate. Moving to the Utica. In the third quarter, the joint venture drilled five wells, completed five, and brought 11 on production. Net production for the third quarter averaged 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter and 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2015. For the full year 2015, we expect Utica production to be at the upper-end of our guidance range of 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Turning to offshore. At the Tubular Bells Field in the Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. During the quarter, we experienced a mechanical issue related to a sub-surface safety valve that is stuck in the closed position as well as wellbore skin effects at two producing wells. While these issues are not unusual in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, it will require sub-surface well intervention work in the coming months. As a result, we have now lowered our full year 2015 forecast to approximately 20,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. However, we expect production to be higher in 2016 as a result of this remediation work. At the Stampede development project in the Gulf of Mexico in which Hess holds a 25% working interest in as operator, fabrication work continues on both the TLP hull and topsides. Drilling is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2016 with first oil targeted for 2018. At North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest in as operator, third quarter net production averaged 39 million cubic feet per day through the early production system and is expected to remain at around 40 million cubic feet per day through 2016. In the third quarter, we progressed fabrication of the central processing platform, which is part of the full field development project. The project is on schedule to be completed in 2017, and is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day. In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. Planned maintenance activities have been successfully completed, and we continue to expect full year 2015 net production to be in the range of 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moving to exploration. On the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana, where Hess holds a 30% working interest, we believe Liza, which logged 295 feet of high-quality oil-bearing reservoir, is a significant oil discovery. The operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, plans to drill an appraisal well in the first quarter of 2016, and is currently completing preparatory technical work and developing drilling plans. We're encouraged by the potential of the Stabroek Block, which is approximately the size of 1,150 Gulf of Mexico blocks. Over 50% of a new 17,000 square kilometer 3D seismic shoot has now been completed, and we're evaluating both potential development options for Liza, as well as the additional resource potential on the block. In the Gulf of Mexico, we continue to evaluate the results of the Chevron-operated Sicily discovery, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest. An appraisal well to further evaluate the discovery is planned to spud later this year. In closing, I'm very pleased with our team, who once again achieved strong operational performance in the current low oil price environment amid significant changes in activity. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $291 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared to $147 million in the second quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, the corporation incurred a net loss of $279 million in the third quarter of 2015, compared with a net loss of $567 million in the second quarter of 2015. Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred losses of $221 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $96 million in the second quarter of 2015. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the third quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2015 were as follows. Lower realized selling prices reduced results by $143 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $33 million. Lower cash operating costs improved results by $15 million. Lower exploration expenses improved results by $9 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $9 million. All other items net to an improvement in results of $18 million for an overall reduction in third quarter adjusted results of $125 million. In the third quarter, our E&P operations were over-lifted compared with production by approximately 100,000 barrels, which had no significant impact on our financial results. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 47% for the third quarter of 2015. This effective rate was favorable to the top end of our guidance range by 2% and primarily resulted from the mix of income generated by operations during the quarter. The E&P effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2015 was a benefit of 56%. Turning to Midstream. On July 1, we formed the Bakken Midstream joint venture with Global Infrastructure Partners by selling a 50% interest that generated after-tax proceeds of approximately $3 billion, including the corporation's share of debt proceeds issued by the joint venture at formation. Following the completion of this sale, the corporation will fully consolidate the operating results, assets and liabilities of the Bakken Midstream segment in its consolidated financial statements with our partner's share being reflected as a non-controlling interest. The Bakken Midstream segment had net income of $16 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared with $32 million in the second quarter of 2015, primarily reflecting the impact of the 50% non-controlling interest. Bakken Midstream EBITDA, excluding non-controlling interest, amounted to $79 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $74 million in the previous quarter. Turning to Corporate and Interest. After-tax corporate and interest expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were $86 million in the third quarter of 2015 compared to $83 million in the second quarter of 2015. Turning to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter including a decrease of $207 million from changes in working capital was $282 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $963 million. Proceeds from dispositions amounted to $2.667 billion. Borrowings were $600 million. Distribution of loan proceeds to our joint venture partner were $300 million. Repayments of debt were $17 million. Common stock dividends paid were $71 million. Common stock acquired and retired amounted to $64 million. All other items amounted to a decrease in cash of $52 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $2.082 billion. Turning to our financial position. Excluding amounts held in our Bakken Midstream joint venture, we had approximately $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2015, compared to $1 billion at June 30, 2015. Total debt, excluding Bakken Midstream, was $6 billion at September 30, 2015, and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 22.7%. Now let me update you on changes to our 2015 guidance. We now project cash costs for E&P operations to be in a range of $16 per barrel of oil equivalent to $17 per barrel of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter, and $15.50 per barrel to $16 per barrel for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $16.50 per barrel to $17.50 per barrel. DD&A per barrel for the fourth quarter of 2015 is forecast to be $29 per barrel to $30 per barrel and $28.50 per barrel to $29 per barrel for the full year of 2015, versus previous guidance of $28.50 per barrel to $29.50 per barrel. This results in updated projected total E&P unit costs of $45 per barrel to $47 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $44 per barrel to $45 per barrel for the full year of 2015. The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $3.80 per barrel of oil equivalent to $3.90 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter of 2015, and $3.35 per barrel of oil equivalent to $3.45 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2015. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs and items affecting comparability, are expected to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million in the fourth quarter, and $340 million to $350 million for the full year, which is down from previous full-year guidance of $380 million to $400 million. Turning to Midstream. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, will be in the range of $15 million to $20 million. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Edward Westlake with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes. First question really around the cash cycle. I mean, I like what you're doing with the capital discipline. Obviously, you've got Stampede and North Malay that you have to complete. But as you look to the other side of it when you get to sort of 2017, where do you sort of see cash neutrality for where cash flow covering CapEx and dividend heads out, given cost deflation and activity choices? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Thanks, Ed. So, I mean, as we look at it, first of all, let me just discuss I guess 2016. Our budget has not been finalized yet. So as you look at 2016, and I think it's exactly as you said, we do expect to cover our base business expenditures and dividends through our cash flow from operations, and even at this low commodity price environment. And then, we'll use the cash on the balance sheet as needed to fund our growth projects in 2016, which include North Malay Basin and Stampede and our exploration and appraisal activities, which Greg mentioned. So then, as you move on to 2017, North Malay Basin comes online. So North Malay Basin becomes a cash flow generator and increases our production in 2017. And then, Stampede comes on in 2018, becomes a cash flow generator in 2018. So as we look at this, and I think in going through the cycle, we're just balancing everything that we've talking about, preserving that financial strength, keeping these operating capabilities and preserving these growth options so that as we move through 2017 and 2018, we're in a good position to begin to start generating cash flow at that point in time. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And then, one of the big exciting areas obviously is Liza. You've got to do appraisal. I don't know how many prospects you've actually managed to map on the block at this stage, but maybe talk a little bit about how aggressive you're going to get after the exploration phase, and then maybe even early production on the field. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, so I guess a little context first. The Liza, a very significant discovery, again, it's 295 feet of very high quality sandstone. And importantly, the well also proved that there's a working petroleum system on this very large block, which is about 1,150 Gulf of Mexico blocks. Now, Ed, we're about 50% complete with a seismic shoot that covers over 70% of that block; it's about a 17,000 square kilometer shoot. So we're about half done. So the next step, obviously, is to complete that seismic. We're also planning appraisal and exploration drilling next year with the operator. We haven't finalized all that yet, so I can't really be specific. But there's two objectives : appraise Liza and then get started on other exploration prospects on the block. There's numerous lookalikes to Liza, for example. And then the third thing we're going to do is we're starting to evaluate potential Liza development options. So how would we develop this significant development called Liza. So those are kind of the three things that are going on. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks very much. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yep. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Morning. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I've got a couple of questions on the capital budget also. John, how much of this $3 billion midpoint guidance is what you'd characterize as non-producing capital, exploration and those large projects at this point? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So, first off, as you know, right, just in light of this low oil price environment, we wanted to get this preliminary 2016's guidance out on our capital and exploratory program. It is difficult at this point, because we haven't completed our budget process, to be really specific on our numbers, just in general across our portfolio. And we will do that in January. At a high level, though, we're going to be continuing to spend on North Malay Basin and Stampede, and you can think about it in the general same area as it was in 2015. But we will provide specifics on that in 2016. And then exploration, we'll have to provide \u2013 as Greg said, there's still \u2013 we still have work to do on Guyana \u2013 we'll provide more information on that in January of 2016. But I guess, if you put it altogether, it shouldn't be that much different than the growth capital that we were spending this year. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, just to be clear, North Malay and Stampede have got about $900 million this year. And exploration, I guess, is about $400 million to $500 million. So is it reasonable to think about it as roughly about half your spending next year is not contributing to production? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes, that is reasonable. Again \u2013 so the way I would call it, Doug, it's not contributing to production next year, but obviously we're building this portfolio, and we're: one, adding resources to the portfolio with North Malay Basin and Stampede, which will become cash flow generators in 2017 and 2018. And then, as Greg has mentioned, we're excited about the potential of adding future resources for Guyana, so we've got that long-term resources being added to our portfolio. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. So I guess swinging to the Bakken then. What I'm really trying to understand is what four rigs means for the Bakken. So I guess I'm not even quite sure how to ask this question. If these four rigs stabilize the production on an exit-to-exit basis once you get to the end of 2016, and if I'm thinking about this right, when you get done with those major capital projects, leaving aside what happens in Guyana, does that non-productive capital, if you like, then swing back to what are still probably some of the highest return assets in your portfolio? In other words, do you go back to a 14-rig, 15-rig program in the Bakken towards the end of the decade as our capital frees up? Is that how we should think about it? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, so first of all, Doug, what happens to the Bakken, as we kind of said in our opening remarks, with a four-rig program in 2016, we expect the Bakken to stay roughly flat with Q4 2015. So that would add \u2013 we've guided 95,000 barrels a day to 105,000 barrels a day for 2016. Now, the obvious question is, well, how can we hold production flat with four rigs? And it's really three ways. Increase drilling efficiencies and higher availability on existing production because there's less SIMOPS going on. And then increased gas and NGL capture in plant. Now, if you project out further and ask, how long can we hold production flat in a four-rig case? We could do that for several years. So we could hold Bakken at about 100,000 barrels a day for several years just with the four-rig program. And obviously, as cash flow becomes free, as we swing off these growth projects, where we divert that capital will be a function of return obviously. But clearly, the Bakken is one of the best projects we have in our portfolio, so it'll be very high in the queue for a future call on capital. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Last quick one, Greg, if I may. Just there's been some talk of Exxon moving to an early production system in Liza. Can you offer any comments on scale and timing? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Can't really, Doug. The one thing I will say is that we're in preliminary studies to evaluate what might be development options for Liza B, and there's a variety of possibilities there. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks a lot, everybody. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber with Simmons. Your line is now open. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Good morning, everybody, and thanks for providing the initial 2016 guidance for us. We appreciate it. First one, just I apologize if I missed this, but what commodity price framework are you assuming in the $3 billion preliminary capital guidance? Would that be something close to the strip? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes. Yes. We're looking at current prices, right. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Okay. Great. And then you mentioned curtailing the offshore spend, deferring further development drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, North Sea EG. Can you just discuss that thought process? We typically would think of infill wells as some of the higher-return opportunities for you, out of Tubular Bells, for example, where you've already invested some of the infrastructure. So just want to understand how you're thinking about that, how you came to that decision? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I think, again, you have to go back to the opening remarks of both John and I, and John Rielly. Given the continued low oil prices next year, we have said we're going to prioritize preserving the strength of our balance sheet above all else. And so, what that means is, we're going to flex our investment down in those areas where we can. And we have a lot of flexibility offshore, we have a lot of flexibility onshore, so we're actually bringing the whole portfolio down in order to keep our balance sheet strong. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Okay. Great. And then I had a follow up, just on the thought process when it comes to exploration and the strategic importance in a commodity environment like this. But obviously, you all have had and participated in some significant discoveries. But just wanted to talk through strategically how you see exploration at this point in time? What type of flexibility you might have in the budget? And also how you think about the potential of, between seeing discoveries, such as with Exxon in Guyana and Sicily in the Gulf of Mexico, through to ultimate production? Versus the alternate possibility of attempting to perhaps monetize that resource early in the lifecycle to accelerate some cash flow and value recognition? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Well, I think that \u2013 just I'll take your last question first \u2013 I think the first order of business is understand what we have there, right? So particularly in Guyana, we've got a lot of work to do to understand the full potential of the block, so way too early to talk about monetization options or anything like that. But how do we think about exploration right now? Well, first of all, we believe that conventional exploration is still the best way to add long-term value to grow the business with attractive returns, provided you can do it successfully, obviously. And I think importantly right now, it can be executed at a much lower cost in the current price environment. So indeed, Guyana is a case in point, where we were able to access that block at a relatively low entry cost, and are now executing this work program at historically low costs, on a cost curve. So it's a good time to be doing this kind of work. And obviously, as John and I both said in our opening remarks, we're really encouraged by the Liza discovery. It's not only a great well in itself, but it has also proven a working petroleum system on a very large block with lots of prospectivity. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Okay. Great. Thanks for the comments and again for all the disclosure. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks and good morning. Maybe if I could try a couple more \u2013 and maybe a follow-up on an earlier question. Can you talk about maybe put a few more numbers around the type of swing in cash flow that you'd see in 2017 from the start-up in North Malay in terms of how much capital rolls off versus what would the potential cash flow generation be at the current strip? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. So, I mean, this is just general guidance there. We're spending in North Malay Basin, like this year, between $500 million and $600 million. We haven't been specific, but let's just say it's carrying that type of level into 2016. And what happens in 2017, instead of spending $500 million to $600 million and having that negative cash flow, it'll actually turn cash flow positive in there. So you're at a minimum getting a $500 million to $600 million, now you're generating free cash flow. So you're potentially $700 million, $800 million swing in cash flow as it relates just to that North Malay Basin asset. And then, Stampede does continue your spending in 2016 and 2017 on the development. And then, we were spending approximately $300 million this year. But as you move, it will be somewhere in the $300 million to $400 million as we go forward. You'll have that negative cash flow turning into positive cash flow in 2018. So on top of North Malay Basin, at that point in time, you're swinging $400-million-ish at a minimum to $500 million to $600 million to cash flow at that point in time. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe, one more in terms of portfolio construction. I mean, should we \u2013 it has been a seller's market, I think we could probably say recently out there in the market. And when you look at your portfolio right now, I mean, how do you think about the potential for \u2013 how do you think about M&A in terms of potentially monetizing non-core assets? Should Utica be considered core or non-core at this point? And maybe on the flipside in terms of acquisitions (40:00), like, what are your current thoughts? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Sure. We're always looking to upgrade or optimize our portfolio. Obviously, we never comment on M&A. But I think the important thing here is our first, second, and third priority is to keep the strong balance sheet we have strong during this period of low prices. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Hey guys. Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Hey. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: John, there's I think some Bloomberg News talking about you guys maybe looking at to sell Utica. Don't know whether you can confirm it? And if you do have that possibility of thinking, what's the rationale behind? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Paul, obviously we're always looking to optimize our portfolio, but we do not comment on M&A. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And maybe for John Rielly then. Do you have 2016 \u2013 I know it's early \u2013 preliminary cost guide for cash and DD&A? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: No. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: ... 2015, or at least directionally that we're going to see any meaningful drop further from the 2015 level, or that it's really going to be somewhat similar or modest? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: I mean, I understand to try to get as much guidance out, and that's why we put this preliminary guidance in this low price environment, so everybody can get a feel of what we're doing with capital, and also where we think production is going to. However, we're still fairly early in the budget process, even working with our partners. So at this point, Paul, I can't give specific cost guidance and I'll do that in January on our call, as usual. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And, John, I actually just curious or then for Greg, at today's defense or I presume it's not really economic to well any oil out from Bakken. Is that correct? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Right now, it's more economic, Paul, with the differentials to clear book having narrowed to where they're only about $1 off of WTI to prioritize moving as much oil as you can through pipeline, and we're doing that. But we still flex some of our production to rail. So where in the past maybe the mix was 50-50, like three months ago, rail versus pipeline, right now, pipeline is about 60% of what we move and rail is about 40%. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: John, can you remind me what is the minimum commitment that you have to the JV that you have to rail through? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So from our minimum \u2013 let's just call it our minimum volume commitments that we have with the Midstream. So first of all, we don't see any issue meeting our minimum volume commitments because there's a couple of things that allow us to meet that. One is additional volumes coming from our build-out of, what we call, our Hawkeye project, which is south of the river. It allows us to get volumes that we couldn't get into our infrastructure from south of the river to the infrastructure north of the river and also just up in North Dakota continued flaring and trucking reductions. And then as well we have the third-party volumes, additional third-party volumes that will come our way. So again from our minimum volume commitments from the third quarter numbers that you actually see in the press release, our minimum volume commitments for 2016 are already essentially below all those numbers that are there. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: But you won't be able to tell me what's that number? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Oh, sure. I'm sorry. So if you want the actual number, so it's actually in the S-1, but crude oil loading is 38,000 and so in the third quarter you saw it was 47,000 and the crude oil transportation going through it as 43,000 versus 45,000 that we had in the third quarter. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: A final one, John and Greg, when you're looking at your Gulf of Mexico deep-water or overall your deep-water portfolio from a supply cost standpoint, are they in the middle of the pack of your overall portfolio or it's at the that high-end of your portfolio? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So from a cost standpoint on the Gulf of Mexico it is at the (44:35). Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Overall return that \u2013 the rate that you put it, I'm trying to understand that, I mean one of your largest competitors that they take a pretty radical approach and totally get out and the argument they make is that in the deep-water portfolio is at the high-end of their portfolio in supply costs, so they believe that they will be better off without even though they actually have some decent success, so just curious that in your portfolio, does it have a similar pattern or you view it differently? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Okay. No, we would view it differently. But let me just \u2013 because I don't know what the other competitor was exactly referring to, so let's just talk our Gulf of Mexico assets that are producing, they are \u2013 when you bring the Gulf of Mexico assets in general together, they are at the low cost end of our portfolio average, quite low actually. And opportunities there to drill further, kind of, exploitation opportunities and bring it into that infrastructure are some of the best returns that we have in the portfolio, so then it just becomes \u2013 I don't know if they're thinking about further development, future developments, I don't know. But again, from \u2013 as Greg said, as we look at the offshore right now and where the costs are going in the industry, we see that it's a good opportunity, like Greg had mentioned with Guyana, to be able to be investing in offshore projects right now. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, everybody. Thanks for all the disclosure. Just a brief one from me, you've been very clear about your strategy in terms of cutting CapEx and maintaining a strong balance sheet. I just wondered if that leaves you any room for buybacks or any other \u2013 or whether you're going to sit at this level of financial leverage? Thanks. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Our priority here is to keep our strong balance sheet strong and that comes first before anything else. So, at the end of the day, we're cutting our CapEx and we don't think it makes sense to accelerate production in this environment and, obviously, share buybacks are taking a backseat as well. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. So we'll just sort of model forward around this level of leverage through 2016, assuming whatever oil price we are? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Obviously, it depends on your oil price. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Would you be looking to spend more in a higher oil price environment or restart buyback? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: I wouldn't want to speculate on that. We want to keep our options open. Paul Benedict Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Understood. Okay. Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: The Bakken's been a critical source of growth and outperformance versus your own expectations. Can you just update us on down spacing in the Three Forks program as well as any new completion or drilling techniques that may or may not be having an impact here? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, you bet. First of all, the Three Forks reservoir is great. We're really drilling in the sweet spot of the sweet spot of the Three Forks right now, so it's actually outperforming the Middle Bakken marginally. So that's very good resources there in the Three Forks. Regarding down spacing, we've got 51 wells that are on a nine and eight (48:09) spacing pilot. We plan to do 82 wells this year. 51 wells are currently online in the nine and eight (48:17) configuration, now only 20 of these wells have been online for greater than 90 days. So the initial results are encouraging and we expect to provide pilot results early next year after we get a few more wells with longer production history under our belt. Regarding different completion techniques, we're running 50-stage pilots. So these are 50-stage sliding sleeve wells. We've got 18 wells out of the 36 wells that we planned this year online. Again, only 13 of those wells have been online for more than 30 days, so it's a little early. But initial production uplifts are in line with expectations and similar to the nine and eight (49:01). We plan to be in a position to provide the results early next year. Now, on the 50-stage, and the nine and eight (49:09) frankly, the final decision is going to be an economic one. So does the 50-stage well generate a higher return given the higher cost? And if it does, then we would expect to move our standard to the 50-stage design from the current 35-stage design. Again, it will be an economic return question, not a higher production question. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thanks. As a follow up to that, how long can you keep drilling in the sweet spot of the sweet spot, as you said it, of the Three Forks before you have to move to just the sweet spot or somewhere less sweet? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Multi-years, multi-years. Not a concern right now. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And lastly, you talked to maintaining and prioritizing your balance sheet strength. Is there a \u2013 can you define that? Is it based on a certain net debt-to-EBITDA target? Are you looking to just retain flat debt levels overall? What is the flexibility you have in that balance sheet when we think about the potential for M&A without it getting too high for your own interest? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yeah. So, as we look at it right now, and again, in this low price environment, as you can imagine, the flexibility we have is that we do have $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet. And so that is allowing us to invest through this cycle, bring these longer-term projects on in 2017 and 2018, as well as invest in exploration such as Guyana. So what we are looking, and I'm going to say more short-term now because we are very focused on where the commodity price environment is, is maintaining that balance sheet and not increasing our debt levels. So that's where we have the ability to be able to use that balance sheet to fund that capital program. Longer-term, we'll see what happens as projects come on. Brian A. Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. So absolute debt, flat. Thank you. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yep. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. As you look at Hess Infrastructure Partners, you had a $425 million expansion of planned to go on service in 2017. Is that still in the plans for capital in 2016, net to your 50% interest, obviously? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So what is \u2013 and we will give more guidance in January on that \u2013 the big component of the capital for the Midstream is going to be the completion of what I referred to as the Hawkeye project. Again, it's infrastructure, it's pipelines, it's compression to be able to bring volumes south of the river in North Dakota to our infrastructure north of the river, such as our gas plant and our rail facility. So there will still be significant spend there on that project, but in January, we'll give more specifics on the levels. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Yeah. And that project was the Hawkeye project. So that makes sense. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : The \u2013 on the other, just details of \u2013 how much does a Guyana well cost to drill, either appraisal or exploration? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Still don't know the answer to that, because we're just getting bids in now, the operator, not us, but the operator is still getting bids in. Many of the... David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : So is the Liza well was the first discovery well \u2013 what did it cost? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: I don't want to give you a number because I just can't remember off the top of my head right now. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Okay. And then just thinking through the kind of path forward, and really, I guess you're getting into that, but just fourth quarter, you talked about gas plants coming online and NGLs growing, also less downtime. Can you just give some numbers of what's the SIMOPS downtime, like amount of volumes that you had shut in maybe in the first quarter that won't be with four rigs running, or \u2013 and also, kind of what is your incremental NGLs and gas as you bring on the additional plant capacity? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Let me answer the operational question first, and then I'll turn it over to John for that. The way to think about this is this year, our availability has averaged about 87%, and that's a combination of SIMOPS and maintenance and things you have to do. What we're projecting next year is that will go up 2%. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : Okay. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Fewer SIMOPS. So that will give you kind of a round number that you can model. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : That's perfect. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: And again, I can't be exactly specific for you, David, as we move into \u2013 onto 2016, but so right now, our production by product in the Bakken was about 73% oil, 18% NGLs, and 9% gas. You will see, per Greg's comments, as we get up to the full capacity of the gas plant that we will be increasing on a percentage basis our NGLs and gas. Just can't be specific to you right now until we get further into the budget process. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors : That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, I just want to come back quickly on the Guyana and just remind folks on the call, remember, these wells are quite shallow. They're only 18,000 feet and they're in 5,700 feet of water. Liza well cost us about $80 million Hess net. So future wells, as you get down the learning curve, will be cheaper than that, obviously, once you get in development mode. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is now open. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Yeah, close enough. Most things have been asked. I've just got a question regarding the potential for impairments. We're seeing a lot of your peers clean house, they're wiping out goodwill, capitalized costs, whatever it may be. What's the likelihood given the reduced CapEx that some costs you're carrying ultimately opt to impair? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So I mean, in the third quarter, obviously, with the lower cost environment, we did not have any impairments in our portfolio. But, John, all I can tell you right now is, as it continues and as we finalize our budget, we will assess that and we will report it on our fourth quarter. But I can't give you any more guidance than that. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : All right, that's fine. Thanks, John. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. You've given very granular guidance on Bakken decline for 2016. What other geographies are seeing the declines that are factored into your company-wide production target? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So I mean if you go across the portfolio, I mean, obviously, when you have less drilling activity, as Greg said, we're not drilling in EG (56:21), the Norway, there's a drilling break and things like that, you're just getting the natural decline of the portfolio. So as you could see, as you mentioned what the Bakken numbers are, we can't be specific at this point until we finalize our budget. But you can kind of say that the reduction is kind of half due to less drilling activities and half due to natural decline to our portfolio. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Understood. And I guess on a percentage basis, if Bakken is seeing the steepest decline across your portfolio in 2016, maybe what's the second biggest contributor to the overall decline? I mean would it be North Sea? Or would it be some of your more mature stuff? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: What it is, and it really has to do with the way the net entitlement works. As Greg had mentioned, in JDA, we're finishing up the booster compression project there. So, one, you probably noticed in our numbers, we've had some net entitlement changes this year that's dropped in the third quarter for JDA. So, on an overall basis, the next biggest component beyond Bakken would be JDA because well there's less cost recovery barrels that we'll have in 2016 as well as with the booster compression, there'll be some downtime at JDS. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right, very helpful. Appreciate it, guys. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: You bet. And I want to give all of the callers one more clarifying comment. The $80 million Liza cost was a gross cost not a net cost. I wanted to clear that up on the call. Operator : And we do have a follow up question from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. John, I know that you don't have a detailed budget, but curious since you know you're going to do a forward program in Bakken, do you have a number what's the CapEx on Bakken for next year? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: No, no, we don't have that yet. Again, we'll get that in January. Again, so we're just fine-tuning how much is near field infrastructure, things like that. So we'll provide that number in January. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

My name is Candace and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and those most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I\u2019ll provide an update on the steps we are taking in response to the low oil price environment and review highlights from 2015. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance and John Rielly will review our financial results. Three principles are guiding us through this lower-for-longer oil price environment. Preserve the strength of our balance sheet, preserve our operating capabilities and preserve our long-term growth options. By adhering to this disciplined approach, we finished the year with one of the strongest balance sheets and liquidity positions among our E&P peers, with $2.7 billion of cash, an undrawn $4 billion revolving credit facility that goes out to January 2020, and a net debt-to-capitalization ratio, excluding the Bakken Midstream joint venture of approximately 15%. Our top priority in this challenging environment is to continue to keep our balance sheet strong. Yesterday, we announced a 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, 40% below our 2015 spend, and approximately 20% below the preliminary guidance we provided in late October of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion. Our focus is on value not volume and we do not think it makes sense to accelerate production in the current price environment, particularly given the recent further deterioration in the oil markets. For this reason we will reduce activity levels across our producing portfolio in 2016, both onshore and offshore, and will continue to pursue further cost reductions to preserve the strength of our balance sheet. Our 2016 production forecast remains the same as our previous guidance of 330,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, even with roughly $600 million of additional cuts in capital spend from our previous guidance and the recent sale of our assets in Algeria in December, which contributed net production of 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of 2015. In terms of our year-end reserves as a result of significant price driven negative revision and a corresponding reduction in activity levels, our proved reserves decreased year-over-year to 1.086 billion barrels of oil equivalent at year-end 2015. It is important to note that all of the decrease was in proved undeveloped category and that our proved developed producing reserves increased by approximately 4% versus 2014. Now turning to our 2015 financial results, our adjusted net loss was $1.1 billion and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $1.9 billion. Compared to 2014, our results were positively impacted by higher crude oil and natural gas sales volumes, which were more than offset by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and higher DD&A expense. From an operational standpoint, 2015 was a year of outstanding performance with strong execution across the portfolio and we are very proud of the work our team has done in a difficult oil price environment. Actual production was 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus our October guidance of 370,000 to 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On a pro forma basis excluding Libya and asset sales, 2015 production increased by 18% compared to 2014 averaging 368,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus 311,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day the prior year on the same basis. Also during 2015, we delivered significant reductions in both capital expenditures and cash operating costs and achieved early success with our focused exploration program. Turning to the Bakken, Hess has an industry-leading acreage position that is competitive with the best shale oil plays in the United States. Through the application of lean manufacturing techniques, our Bakken team has continued to drill some of the lowest cost and most productive wells in the play. Our 2016 focus is on the core of the core, where Hess has significantly more drilling spacing units or DSUs than any other competitor. Maintaining a two rig program will help preserve our top quartile operating capabilities; so that we are positioned to efficiently increase activity when oil prices recover. Bakken production in 2015 averaged 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up approximately 35% from 2014. Despite dropping to two rigs, we continue to forecast Bakken production to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. On July 1, 2015 we closed on the Bakken Midstream joint venture, which resulted in total cash proceeds to Hess of $3 billion. Hess maintains operational control of these strategic assets giving us access to the best markets for our products through the flexibility that it offers. As previously announced, the joint venture plans to proceed with an initial public offering of Hess Midstream Partners LP common units when market conditions improve. In terms of developments, while we are significantly reducing investment across our base portfolio. We plan to continue to invest for future growth with two offshore developments. The first, North Malay Basin, is a long-life, low-risk natural gas resource with oil linked pricing. Hess is operator with a 50% interest. Full field development is on track for startup in 2017 after which the project is expected to add an incremental 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production and become a long-term cash generator. Our second offshore development Stampede is one of the largest undeveloped fields in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with estimated gross recoverable resources between 300 million and 350 million barrels of oil equivalent. Hess is the operator of Stampede and we have a 25% interest. Following startup in 2018, the project will add an incremental 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production and become a material cash generator. Turning to exploration, we are very pleased with the early results from our focused expiration program. Namely, the Exxon-operated Liza discovery, offshore Guyana, in which Hess has a 30% working interest. And the Chevron-operated Sicily discovery in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in which Hess has a 25% working interest. In particular, we believe that the Stabroek Block in Guyana has the potential to be very material to Hess and create significant long-term value for our shareholders even in a lower price environment. About 90% of a 17,000 square kilometers 3D seismic acquisition program has been completed. In 2016, we plan to drill up the four wells to evaluate the Liza discovery, perform a drill stem test and explore additional prospects on the block. In summary we are well-positioned to navigate this lower-for-longer price environment and are taking a disciplined approach to preserve our financial strength competitively advantage capabilities and long-term growth options. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory Hill : Thanks John. I would like to provide an operational update on our progress in 2015 and our plans for 2016. As John mentioned 2015 was a year of strong execution across our portfolio. Production averaged 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the top end of our October guidance of 370,000 to 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Furthermore, in the fourth quarter, production averaged 368,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day exceeding our October guidance of 360,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the same quarter. In 2015, we also reduce capital and exploratory expenditures by $400 million during the year and cash operating cost by more than $300 million. We continued to drive down our drilling and completion costs and successfully conducted tighter spacing and increased stage count pilots in the Bakken. We also achieve material exploration success in Guyana and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico were the Liza and Sicily wells were ranked as the two largest oil discoveries of 2015 by both Wood Mackenzie and IHS. Clearly 2015 was a challenging year in terms of oil prices and we believe it is prudent to manage the business assuming that prices remain lower for longer. On that basis we announced yesterday a 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, which is 40% below 2015 levels and will result in significant reductions in activity levels across our unconventionals and offshore business. Year-end 2015 proved reserves were significantly impacted by the price environment with the addition of 84 million barrels of oil equivalent offset by price related downward revisions of 282 million barrels of oil equivalent. Year-end proved reserves accounting for the sale of our Algeria asset, were 1.086 billion barrels of oil equivalent of which 73% proved developed. Nonetheless, the notable early success of our exploration program and continued technical advances in our unconventionals business have allowed us to materially grow our total resource base. In 2016, we forecast companywide production to average between 330,000 and 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This forecast is unchanged from preliminary guidance provided on our last quarterly conference call despite the further 20% reduction in our capital and exploratory expenditures. In the first quarter of 2016, we forecast companywide production to average between 340,000 and 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Turning to operations, the Bakken continued to deliver outstanding performance as well as higher upside. We exceeded our production targets continued to substantially reduce our well cost through the continued application of lean manufacturing techniques, significantly improved our well IP rates through the successful testing of 50-stage sliding sleeve fracs, an industry first in the Bakken, and increased our well inventory and estimated ultimate recovery through infilling to tighter spacing, using a nine and eight configuration. Full year production in the Bakken averaged 112,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 35% above 2014 and above our guidance from the beginning of the year of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the fourth quarter as a result of lower drilling activity net production average 109,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day up 7% from the year ago quarter. Lean manufacturing practices enabled us to once again significantly drive down our Bakken drilling and completion costs with the fourth quarter averaging $5.1 million per well versus $7.1 million per well in the year ago quarter, a reduction of 28%. Looking forward, we expect drilling and completion costs in 2016 to remain near this level, even though we will increase stage counts by approximately 40% as we move from our standard 35-stage design to a 50-stage design. The 50-stage trials conducted in 2015 have been very successful delivering more than a 20% average increase in IP30, 60 and 90. Our tighter well spacing pilots in 2015 have also been successful. Results to date confirm that moving from 13 wells to 17 wells per DSU is value accretive in the core of the play enabling us to add 200 new drilling locations to our inventory. Additional pilots will be required in the future to fully understand applicability across all of our acreage which to some degree will be a function of price. The combination of our successful infill pilot and overall stronger type curve performance has allowed us to increase our estimated ultimate recovery from the Bakken to 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent from our previous estimate of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Our industry-leading Bakken position continues to provide a forward well inventory that has one of the lowest breakevens in the play. However, in the current pricing environment, we believe it is prudent to reduce drilling until oil prices recover. With this in mind, in 2016, we intend to reduce our activity to two rigs at the end of February compared to an average of 8.5 rigs in 2015 and 17 rigs in 2014. Our 2016 capital budget for the Bakken is $425 million approximately a 70% reduction from 2015. We plan to drill approximately 50 wells and bring approximately 80 new wells online in 2016 compared to 219 new wells online in 2015. Despite this significant reduction in well activity, we forecast Bakken net production to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 and also in the first quarter of 2016. Moving to the Utica. In 2015 the joint venture drilled 24 wells and brought 32 new wells on production. In the fourth quarter, net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter. Net production for the year in the Utica averaged 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2014. In 2015 by applying the same lean manufacturing techniques that we use in the Bakken. We reduced drilling and completion costs by 30%, down to $9.6 million per well from $13.7 million per well in 2014. Despite the high quality of our acreage position and low 5% average royalty, the joint venture intends to lay down the one rig we have operating at the end of the first quarter of 2016 given low natural gas and NGL prices and wide basin differentials. In 2016, we plan to drill five wells and bring 14 new wells online. Production is forecast to average between 20,000 and 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. Turning to our offshore operations, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we commenced remediation work at our Tubular Bells field in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator. This work includes acid jobs at two wells and opening a stuck subsurface safety valve at another well. The field produced approximately 20,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015 and we forecast that the remediation work will allow production to increase to approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over 2016. In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, production average 33,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. In response to low prices, the operator plans a very minimal amount of activity in 2016. Full-year net production is expected to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. At the South Arne Field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest we expect to complete the current phase of development drilling and release the rig at the end of the first quarter. Net production averaged 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015 and is expected to average approximately 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016. In Equatorial Guinea, where we are operator with an 85% interest we recently completed the acquisition of new 40 seismic. Processing of this seismic is underway and the early data indicates additional infill production and water injection well opportunities that can be pursued when oil prices recover. Net production averaged 43,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. Looking forward production is expected to decline over 2016 reflecting a continuation of the drilling pause that has been in place since mid-2015. At the Malaysia Thailand joint development area and the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess has a 50% interest. Work continues on the booster compression project, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter. Further drilling activity will not be required to meet contracted volumes for the next couple of years as a result of the compression project. Net production average 43,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015 and is expected to be approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 reflecting planned downtime associated with the booster compression project and lower PFC entitlements due to lower capital expenditure. We continue to progress our North Malay Basin and Stampede developments, which remain on target to come on-stream in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Net North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator. The first two wells of the development drilling campaign have reached total depth and are fully in line with pre-drill expectations. Net production averaged approximately 40 million cubic feet per day through the early production system in 2015 and is expected to stay at this level through 2016. Following completion of the full field development project in 2017 net production is planned increased to 165 million cubic feet per day. At the Stampede development in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator we successfully completed installation of piles, started setting equipment on the top side and made good progress on the whole in 2015. Looking forward in 2016 we aim to complete the top sides main deck begin offshore installation of the whole block and install the subsea systems. Development drilling will commence in 2016 and first oil remains targeted for 2018. Moving to exploration. In the Gulf of Mexico following the success of the Sicily-1 discovery well, in which Hess holds a 25% interest. The operator Chevron has commenced drilling the Sicily-2 appraisal well to delineate a large four-way closure in the outboard Paleogene. The operator expects to reach target depth during the second quarter of 2016. Also in the Gulf of Mexico we are participating in a ConocoPhillips operated prospect called Melmar, in which Hess has a 35% interest. The lower price environment has enabled access to high-quality longer-term offshore prospects at attractive entry costs. Melmar is a good example of this and fits well with our strategy. It is one of the last large Paleogene four-way prospects in the prolific Perdido trend. Drilling operations began in December and the operator expects to reach total depth in the second quarter of 2016. In Guyana for the Liza-1 well accounted 295 feet of high-quality oil bearing reservoir. The operator Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited is planning to evaluate the Liza discovery and test the further potential of the Stabroek Block, in which Hess has a 30% interest. The next well, Liza-2 is planned to spud later in the first quarter. In closing, despite the challenging price environment 2015 was a year of excellent execution and delivery across our business which is a tribute to the outstanding people of Hess. Our strategy is to continue protecting our balance sheet, while maintaining our core capabilities and growth options. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2015. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $396 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $291 million in the third quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, the corporation incurred a net loss of $1.821 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with a net loss of $279 million in the previous quarter. The fourth quarter results contained non-cash charges of $1.359 billion resulting from the low commodity price environment including the write-off of our E&P segment goodwill of $1.98 billion. The non-taxable goodwill charge was allocated in our financial results to U.S. and international operations. In addition, fourth quarter exploration expenses include $178 million after-tax for the write-off of previously capitalized gas wells in Guyana, three previously capitalized wells in Australia that are not included in the most recent development concept and the impairment of certain leasehold costs in the Gulf of Mexico. In the United States we also recognized an impairment charge of $83 million after-tax associated with our legacy conventional North Dakota assets. In connection with the sale of Hovensa\u2019s assets and completion of its bankruptcy has agreed to assume obligations under the Hovensa pension plan and relinquish our rights to receive any proceeds from financing provided to Hovensa during bankruptcy in exchange for the release of all claims from the Virgin Islands government that were asserted against us. Our fourth quarter results include charges of $41 million after-tax for the cost of the pension obligations amounts funded in the quarter and legal fees. Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred losses of $328 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to a loss of $221 million in the third quarter of 2015. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the fourth quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2015 were as follows. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $46 million. Lower realized selling prices reduced results by $33 million. Higher exploration expenses reduced results by $21 million. All other items net to a reduction in results of $7 million for an overall reduction in fourth quarter adjusted results of $107 million. In the fourth quarter, our E&P operations were under-lifted compared with production by approximately 1 million barrels, which did not have a material impact on fourth quarter results. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 38% for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared with the benefit of 47% in the third quarter. On an unadjusted basis the fourth quarter effective tax rate reflects the fact the goodwill impairment charge did not have an associated tax benefit. Turning to Midstream. Fourth quarter net income of $11 million was down versus third quarter net income of $16 million, primarily due to lower volume throughput at the Tioga gas plant as a result of unplanned downtime and increase crude export via pipeline in response to market differentials. Bakken midstream EBITDA excluding the non-controlling interest amounted to $67 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $79 million in the previous quarter. Turning to corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses excluding items affecting comparability were $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared to $86 million in the third quarter of 2015. Turning to cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter including an increase of $401 million from changes in working capital was $623 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $935 million. Net borrowings were $93 million, common stock dividends paid were $72 million, other net amounted to a use of cash of $6 million resulting in a net decrease in and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $297 million. Excluding amounts held in our Bakken Midstream joint venture we had approximately $2.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015, compared to $3 billion at September 30, 2015. Total debt excluding Bakken Midstream was $5.9 billion at December 31, 2015 and our debt to capitalization ratio was 24.4%. In addition we have a committed $4 billion revolving credit facility that is undrawn. Turning to 2016 guidance, we project cash cost for E&P operations to be in a range of $15 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2016 and $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel for the full-year 2016 down from 2015 cash cost of $15.69 per barrel. The first quarter cash cost include well workover cost at the Tubular Bells Field. DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2016 is forecast to be $29 to $30 per barrel and $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel for the full-year of 2016, up from 2015 DD&A of $28.14 per barrel. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs of $44 to $46 per barrel in the first quarter of 2016 and $43 to $45 per barrel for the full-year of 2016 compared with 2015 E&P unit operating costs of $43.83 per barrel. The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $3.55 to $3.65 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2016 and $3.55 to $3.95 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full-year of 2016, up from 2015 Midstream tariffs of $3.28 per barrel. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs and items affecting comparability, are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $260 million to $280 million for the full-year 2016 down from $338 million in 2015. The E&P effective tax rate excluding Libya is expected to be a differed tax benefit in the range of 41% to 45% for the first quarter and full-year of 2016 versus a benefit of 45% in 2015. Turning to Midstream, in 2016 we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter and in the range of $40 million to $50 million for the full-year. Turning to Corporate and Interest, in 2016 we estimate corporate expenses net of taxes to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million in the first quarter and in the range of $110 million to $120 million for the full-year. We estimate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the first quarter of 2016 and in the range of $205 million to $215 million for the full-year 2016. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate : Hi, good morning everybody. John Hess : Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate : First, I've got a couple, if I may. First question is to John Rielly. John, the cash flow number you gave was net of working capital, but can you X the working capital gain, cash flow looked a bit light. Can you walk us through what has gone on with particularly deferred tax and any other unusual items that explained that number? And then I have got a couple of exploration follow-ups, please. John Rielly : Sure. In the fourth quarter we did have some special charges in the fourth quarter and some of them do have a cash flow impact. So they are impacting what a normal run rate would be in the fourth quarter. So the first part of that in the E&P charges are for surplus materials and supplies just due to reduced drilling plans so that was approximately $25 million in the quarter that was reducing cash flow, that $221 million. And then also we had lower cost of market in the fourth quarter of approximately $40 million. So those two right there, from a special charges aspect, gets you about $65 million kind of a nonrecurring impact in the quarter. And then there's a couple of other things, one from the specials outside of E&P is for Hovensa. So part of the charge relates to the relinquishment of proceeds that we provided during bankruptcy plus we get legal fees in there. So that was approximately $20 million in the quarter again reducing cash flow from operations. And then on an operating standpoint, you probably saw you noticed our exploration costs were up in the quarter just from a run rate standpoint it was in line with our full-year guidance, but in the fourth quarter we had higher seismic approximately $20 million to $25 million in the quarter. So again from a recurring type standpoint it's just impacting at lower cash flow in the fourth quarter. And then the last thing you heard, I did mention there was a 1 million barrel under lift. So even though that had from a results standpoint not much of an impact, it does have a cash flow impact in the quarter. And so you are ranging that $10 million to $15 million for that under lift. So all told, it is about $125 million when you add those numbers up kind of reducing the cash flow from operations in the quarter. Doug Leggate : That makes a ton of sense, makes - reconciles the number. Thanks, John. My follow-up, to the extent you can answer on two non-operated exploration wells, I mean clearly exploration is getting no quarter with the market right now. But these looked like to John comments, look like they could be pretty material. So Greg, first of all on Melmar, could you walk us through the genesis of how you got that in this market, spending additional capital on exploration might seem surprising to some. So what is the genesis of your entry there to the extent you can talk about the prospect? My understanding is this is a $2 billion to $4 billion oil-in-place target. I mean are those numbers right? And how would you risk it? I've got a follow-up on Liza, please. Gregory Hill : Yes, so on Melmar. Let me just open Doug. Of course we are in a long-term business and we need to both think about today and tomorrow, so and one of the things we\u2019re seeing is this low price environment has created a lot of opportunities to access very high-quality longer-term growth options at very competitive entry cost. So Melmar is a great example of that. Melmar, if you look at it it\u2019s a very large four-way on the proven prolific Perdido trend. So we farmed into a 35% working interest position at all eight blocks covered by the structure. I think importantly, it\u2019s one of the last undrilled large Paleogene four ways in the Perdido trend and therefore has a very high chance of geologic success. The second thing about it, it's got a water depth of about 5,200 feet now that's compared to 7,900 feet at Great White. And so that what that means is it has higher projected reservoir pressures compared to Great White. The development costs could be significantly lower, given the shallower depth, and importantly the rock properties across the impermeability and deliverability are also going to be likely be the best in the Perdido trend. So when you look at the prospect, it was one of these really quality prospects that you could get in at very low entry cost. So that's why we get it. Doug Leggate : Okay. My final one, if I may, is also on exploration, Greg. And again, I realize Exxon is the operator. So the constraints that puts around you. But you did put $70 million in your budget for predevelopment. I'm just wondering what that means. Again, you hit rock quality with Melmar, but we\u2019re hearing that the rock quality in Liza could be kind of off the charts. So if you could give some color there and maybe some idea as to what an early production system might look like, acknowledging that it is only one well and perhaps we are getting a little bit over our skis, but any color you can provide, it would be helpful. Thanks. Gregory Hill : Yes, I think, so first of all the rock property is fantastic. Very good porosity, very good permeability for deepwater at this depth, it is truly almost an outlier in that respect. Regarding the early production system we have money in our budget to begin looking at the development options, obviously the development options will be depended upon what you figure out in the appraisal program. So other than that we can't really be specific because it depends on what we find in the appraisal program, so but very good, very exciting Guyana province here. Doug Leggate : Are you prepared to give us a scale on the discovery yet, Greg? Gregory Hill : I can\u2019t yet, you\u2019ll have to ask the operator about that. Doug Leggate : I think that would be the answer. All right, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Edward Westlake : Good morning gentlemen. Just the market obviously, with the low strip prices, is very focused on outspend. Obviously you\u2019re spending 820 on the two developments and when they come on-stream, you will get the cash flow from that. That\u2019s pretty obvious. But in terms of the next wave of spending around Guyana or the lower treasury. I am just trying to get a sense of are there any sort of lease terms which might force you into spending money, even if the oil price stays low? I am trying to get a sense of a way of asking 2017 exploration spend and development spend and maybe a trajectory into 2018.? John Rielly : Sure, Ed. The way we look at it in and obviously as Greg said, Guyana is an exciting opportunity for us and you kind of laid it out with North Malay Basin coming on-stream in 2017 turning into a cash generator and then Stampede following in 2018. We don't really see any significant developments spend coming our way from Guyana in 2017 and 2018. We see further exploration spending coming in. So the bigger development spend will be coming in fitting nicely into our portfolio as North Malay Basin and Stampede come up. So I can\u2019t really give you any specific guidance, but that's how we think about the spending going over the next couple of years. Edward Westlake : Okay. And then just on the Bakken, obviously with two rigs, it feels like you\u2019re going to be drawing down some undeveloped - sorry, drilled but uncompleted inventory. Maybe just an update as you roll - if you rolled a two-rig program out into 2017, what the impact would be on Bakken production. John Rielly : Yes, I think Ed, with the two-rig program we feel pretty confident we can hold production in that range of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels a day through 2016. If you think about how that trajectories going to unfold those throughout 2016, it\u2019s going to start the year at the high-end of the range and it\u2019s going to be end the year at the lower end of the range. So if you fast-forward to 2017 and set I held two rigs through 2017 obviously you would see some decline year-on-year, you can't hold it flat for more than a year with two rigs. Edward Westlake : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Hey gentlemen, good morning. John Hess : Good morning. Paul Cheng : Greg, just curious then I mean just three months ago when you were talking about the guidance of the budget was a four rig program for Bakken, we talking about 95,000 to 105,000 and now with the two-rigs. Over the last three months, then, what may have changed that to make you increase the confidence that only two-rig and you actually also drop the number of well going to be on-stream next year from 100 to 80, but you keep the guidance to be the same. You said just that three months ago the guidance, you actually feel like you could be able to reach the high end. And now it is more like in the middle or in the lower end. Just trying to understand. Gregory Hill : Okay, thanks Paul. Really there is four factors. So first of all the two-rig program is really focused in the core of the core with the higher EURs and IP rate. I think the second factor is we\u2019ve increased the stage count from 35 being our standard design to 50-stage fracs as our standard. And if you look at the impact of the 50 stage design we are seeing about a 20% increase in IP 30, 60 and 90. So obviously that's going to carry through. I think the third thing is we are going to have increased gas and NGL capture in the plant as the Hawkeye south of the river system comes on in the third quarter of the year. And then the last is just increased drilling efficiencies. So further reductions in the spud-to-spud base. So it\u2019s really all four of those factors add up to you can still hold the range even with the two-rig program. Paul Cheng : And Greg, looked like the $600 million cut from the previous guidance, $300 million appears to be from the major projects. Because I thought previously you are talking about $1.5 billion in the major projects and now it is about $1.2 billion. Are you including the exploration or appraisal during Guyana and northern? Where is that $300 million has been reduced from? John Rielly : Paul, I can answer this even - I guess maybe just a little bit more broadly. But of that $600 million about half of it is due to cost-saving. So we are seeing further cost savings from the numbers that that we had provided in October. So we\u2019re getting about $300 million there across and some of it is in the development project, some of it is in our existing assets. And then the other half, like reducing to the two rigs in the Bakken is due to deferral of activity. Paul Cheng : I see. And then, John, since that you are here, Algeria that the offset sales, have you already closed before the end of the year? In other words, is the money already in your balance sheet or that we should expect that in the first quarter? And if it is, how much is that? John Rielly : So the actual transaction did close right before year-end. However, we have not received the cash yet. That will be coming in the first quarter. The contract though is confidential I can't give you the number on that. But it is not a significant amount. Paul Cheng : So when you say not a significant, you say it means less than 100? John Rielly : You can estimate that Paul. Yes. Paul Cheng : Okay, that's fine. And I just want to clarify. I have to apologize that when you speak, I - John, you can correct me maybe. You're saying that the cash at the end of the year, excluding the Bakken, John mentioned is $2.3 billion or did I get that number wrong? John Rielly : Right. No, you did. It is $2.7 billion sorry Paul. Paul Cheng : $2.7 billion. John Rielly : Yes, $2.7 billion. Paul Cheng : Perfect. Thank you. John Rielly : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Asit Sen of CLSA. Your line is now open. Asit Sen : Thanks, good morning. A couple of questions, if I may, on the cost structure. Historically, when looking at the Bakken, Greg, I think you have mentioned OpEx per barrel a split of 40% variable, 60% fixed, but the variable costs should benefit from the lower energy component. But there could be several moving parts in the fixed component, particularly as relates to lower field personnel costs. Could you update us on that? So that's number one. Number two : on DD&A per barrel, that number should also trend lower over the medium term. Could you discuss sort of the potential trajectory? And third, on the cost structure, Stampede first oil expected in 2018. I know the rigs have been contracted. What percent of the project cost is yet to be committed? Gregory Hill : Okay I will try to answer all three of you. So the first one, you are focusing on the Bakken but it does apply across the portfolio that we do have high you know I mean there is a good amount of the costs that are fixed and so obviously we are trying to attack the fixed cost in this low-price environment as well as the variable costs and making sure we get all the variable costs out as we reduce activity. So we have been seen from let\u2019s just pick the Bakken on our cash cost per barrel we\u2019ve been seen significant reductions like if you go back from the first quarter of 2014 through the fourth quarter of 2015. We've been seen significant cost reductions on our cash cost per barrel. And you probably heard when I gave the 2016 guidance we are giving guidance that our cash cost per barrel are going down in 2016 and that\u2019s with a reduction from 368,000 barrels a day pro forma production down to our 3.30 to 3.50. So we are trying to stay up with especially in this low oil price environment reducing fixed costs and variable costs and so we are attacking both of them. As far as DD&A from a trajectory standpoint, you heard from our guidance actually our DD&A was going up in 2016 and that it's directly related to the reserves. So you heard the reserves are going down from the price revisions so with those lower reserve amounts that's going to increase our DD&A up as prices recover, then those reserves will come right back on the book. And so in a normal environment what would be happening say in the Bakken as we continue to add reserves through our performance in additional drilling and now that we\u2019ve got all the infrastructure spend kind of behind us our DD&A would be going down over time. As far as Stampede, and I\u2019m going to hand it back to Greg for that. Gregory Hill : Yes, so thanks for that. Stampede, if you look at it most of the costs have already been committed, but we have taken advantage of the lower price and service environment and actually got some savings from Stampede. As we put in our capital press release yesterday, we will spend about $325 million in 2016 in Stampede. Asit Sen : Great, that is very helpful. And then just a follow-up on Guyana, could you talk about well costs? I know Liza was probably less than $80 million, I think you mentioned. And could you remind us of the environment, water depth, et cetera if you could? Gregory Hill : Yes, so you're right Liza was less than $80 million net to us. Regarding future well costs, you are going to have to refer to the operator. What I will say is obviously the appraisal wells will be higher cost, because we\u2019re doing lots of testing and coring and the normal things that you would do in the appraisal part of the program. Asit Sen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open. David Heikkinen : Good morning guys. I have one high level question and one kind of lower level, what do you expect your year-end 2016 cash to be? John Rielly : Okay, David that\u2019s - let me go through, I\u2019ll tell you how I think you should be looking at 2016. So we finished the year as you know with $2.7 billion of cash and obviously we\u2019re going to have cash flow from operations in 2016. So as we just released yesterday, you saw our capital spend program is estimated to be $2.4 billion in 2016. In that $2.4 billion is approximately $200 million of exploration cash spend, like seismic and G&A that\u2019s part of cash flow. So we have to fund capital expenditures of $2.2 billion and we have our dividend of approximately $285 million, let me just round that to $300 million. So our capital and our dividend is going to be $2.5 billion in 2016. We have a cash balance at the end of 2015 of $2.7 billion. So effectively we can fund our capital program and our dividend out of our cash balance and still have $200 million left over at the end of 2016 and obviously we still have the revolver undrawn. So then with that $200 million left from the cash account, David I am going to give you some work to do here. Because now you have to estimate what the cash flow from operations are going to be in 2016 and that depends on your commodity price assumption. So we\u2019ve given you the production guidance, the cash cost guidance and whatever cash flow from operations that you then come to you can add to that $200 million and that\u2019s where we will sit. So we are in a good liquidity position coming into this year and I think that's how you have to look at 2016. David Heikkinen : Yes, you did not want to fill in the blank that I was looking for. That is fair enough. On the other side, Greg, the new stage count is pretty impressive. And then you are coming up. So just trying to get an idea of 2016 Bakken development. Do you have any idea of what 30, 60, and 90-day rates would be? Just round numbers would be helpful on a BOE basis. Gregory Hill : I think we have given guidance before and we\u2019ll be at the upper end of that range obviously because we are in the core of the core of the Bakken. So our previous guidance will be in the high-end of the range. David Heikkinen : Yes, it just seemed like you are double dipping with the new wells and core of the core that it would have been even above that range, potentially. Gregory Hill : It will be. Once you had the 50-stage fracs, so we need to update our guidance once we get over entirely. David Heikkinen : Okay, perfect. Overall that through, too and then just net-net of everything, what is your Bakken net back expected to be in the first quarter? John Rielly : So we never really try to forecast because it\u2019s so difficult quarter-to-quarter, so in the fourth quarter we were - the Bakken was getting between $6 and $7 under TI and again the economics are right now favoring more to pipe then rail. Gregory Hill : Yes, about 75% of our volume now is on pipe and the clear book differential that goes into that $6 number that John was just talking as a discount to WTI just maybe 250 refineries and turnarounds so that number was about 150 before. So there's a lot of dollar weakness now, but refineries come back on we expect that to recover. David Heikkinen : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Guy Baber : Good morning everybody. Gregory Hill : Good morning. Guy Baber : You all have consistently mentioned that preserving your operating capability is a key objective for the Company. And that is the strategic question for me, particularly in the Bakken. But can you talk about striking that balance between cutting CapEx and rigs to protect the balance sheet versus preserving your capability so that you can respond in a timely manner when you get the appropriate oil price signal. Is that a concern for you guys with two rigs running? And is it a concern for you all for the industry at large in the Bakken from what you can see? Gregory Hill : Thanks for that question. It is striking the balance and I think with our budget and operating two-rigs in the Bakken, we think we've achieved the right balance. So we\u2019re doing creative things with doubling up people and moving them over to special assignments and all at, making sure that they're ready for the inevitable ramp-up that will come in the Bakken. Guy Baber : Okay, thanks. And then my follow-up is on the committed CapEx going forward, thinking through 2017 and 2018, we know that major project spending, long lead time, obligations are falling off over the next few years. But can you give us any specific indications as to how much decline in 2017 - is the majority of the North Malay Basin CapEx in 2016, you're not going to have that spending commitment in 2017? Or is that more of a 2018 event? Just trying to get a better sense there as I think it would help us better appreciate and understand the evolution of the free cash flow profile in a flat oil price environment, which is an important consideration. John Rielly : Sure, so from a commitment standpoint what we\u2019d be looking at over the next couple of years is to complete North Malay Basin, to complete Stampede and obviously continue the exploration that we have going on in particular in Guyana. So in 2017, the North Malay Basin will be coming online so we have $375 million in the budget this year that is essentially reducing our free cash flow by that $375 million. Now, we don't have exactly what the budget will be for North Malay Basin next year as far as pure capital, but it will be considerably lower than the $375 million, but again no matter what that number is it will be generating free cash flow. So as you look to 2017 you will get an improvement of free cash flow just related to North Malay Basin of $375 million. And then again you follow-on that with Stampede so you have $325 million this year not generating free cash flow. Again we don't have the budget set for 2017. I don't expect it to be that different in 2017 as you move forward with Stampede and so it won't be until 2018 that you\u2019ll turnaround that $325 million of free cash flow. Guy Baber : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Evan Calio : Hey guys, good morning guys. Just to start off with a follow-up to a prior cash question. What do you guys consider the minimum operating cash limits on the balance sheet? And I realize on most of the math that you supplied before on the call, you can currently support the dividend, given your balance sheet strength. How do you consider the dividend strategy in the context of the constrained cash flow environment? And the amount or the breadth of longer-term investment opportunities that you have as you navigate 2016? John Rielly : Sure Evan. So again, as we go through that, I mean we are just on a good position probably relative to our competition with this $2.7 billion of cash. We don't need any cash flow from operations to fund our capital program, as I mentioned of $2.2 billion, plus the dividend if I round up to $300 million. So we can fund that completely out of our cash account and have $200 million left over in there. And there will be, if you want to sit at a minimum level you are somewhere around that, say at the $200 million that you want to at least keep in our system between the U.S. and internationally. But again we don't even need any cash flow from operations just to repeat that to fund the capital or dividend. So anything again as your estimate for cash flow from operations will just get added to that cash balance. We won't be near this any minimum levels as it relates to cash. Evan Calio : Yes, that makes sense. And I have a couple smaller follow-up items. Can you give a cost or EUR uplift from the 50-stage Bakken completions versus the 35-stage design? Gregory Hill : Yes, so if you look at 2015 particularly at the back half of year when we had a lot of 50-stages coming online. We were at the top end of our guidance range so the 550 to 650 we were at the very top end of that. We average 650 for the whole year in 2015. And as we drill on the core of the core you know next year and do the 50-stage fracs we expect to be in the high-600 to the mid-700 range. So you're seeing that uplift, also on the IP rates you could see a similar sort of effect I mean the range we've given on the IP rate is 800 to 950 and obviously with 50-stage fracs on the IP rate you're going to be up there. One another point I want to make about you know the well costs on the Bakken. The well costs for the fourth quarter averaged $5.1 million per well, which is about a 28% reduction from the year ago and 4% reduction from Q3 again that lean manufacturing machine just continuing to work. We said that we expect cost next year to be broadly flat at that $5 million to $5.1 million per well level. But of course that math, the significant amount of ongoing improvement because embedded in that number of the $5.1 million is the 40% increase in stage count. So we expect to fully offset that increased cost due to the higher stage count with continued lean manufacturing gain. So again, a 20% uplift in production for basically the same cost is what you have this year. So obviously that's going to be good for returns. Evan Calio : And then I guess a similar spud to spud - I think it was an 18 day, or is that what that number is? We should assume? Gregory Hill : Yes, it will improve again next year I mean this year we averaged about 22 wells per rig during the year that's going to increase to say, 24 or so next year. Evan Calio : Great. And then lastly for me, a small one. If you can share what you booked on North Malay expansion 2016, just so I know how much of that project value is potentially reflected in your reserve numbers? John Rielly : Oh no, that was not - there was no addition to our reserves in 2015 for the North Malay Basin expansion. Evan Calio : Can you give us a number of what that - what is in there - what is in your - what you've booked or what you have as PUDs there? John Rielly : Okay, so what we have for North Malay Basin and this is kind of you get to this unique reserve accounting of rules because we don't - during 2015 we did not have a significant amount of wells in the ground that we could book proved reserves on and as Greg mentioned we started the drilling program more - now ticking it off in 2016 to drill up the reservoirs. We didn't have that significant of reserves say initially. And then when you run it through the reserve accounting requirements because those proved reserves are low compared to the gas sale contract we can't book the reserves here in 2015. So what will happen is as Greg\u2019s team just drills out in 2016, we\u2019ll actually begin booking the reserves at North Malay Basin. Evan Calio : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I will follow-up offline. John Rielly : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Singer : Thank you and good morning. John Hess : Good morning. Brian Singer : I wanted to follow up on some of the Guyana questions. You mentioned that the early production system depends on the appraisal program. Can you talk more specifically about what you expect to learn with the Liza-2? And then the same kind of question for how the next three wells that you are drilling and planning this year differ and what the learnings could be from those wells as well. Gregory Hill : Yes, I think so let's talk about Liza appraisal first. I mean we want to get a dynamic test that will tell us about potential compartmentalization in Liza. We also want to find where the contact is so that will be the primary two objectives of the appraisal wells in Liza. The exploration wells are basically the objective there is to figure out what we are seeing on seismic, is that replicable in other areas of the block, because we have a lot of look-alikes on seismic. So we want to get a well or two in a couple of the other things and see what running room we have on the block. We think there's a lot, but obviously you'll need some more wells to figure that out. Brian Singer : Great, thanks. And then my follow-up is with regards to M&A. You mentioned really going back a year valuations never really looked attractive from a consolidation perspective. And I wondered, A, if you could kind of comment on how those look now. And then B, recognizing that preserving balance sheet is one of your key objectives, is the opportunity set that you now see at Guyana and at Sicily so meaningful that it reduces your interest level and even considering shale consolidation? John Hess : Look, a fair question on M&A. We always look at the outside to see if there are opportunities that will make our portfolios stronger, improve our economic opportunities for investment and also not sacrifice our balance sheet strength and while values have come down just to reiterate while our priority is first and foremost the strength of our balance sheet and obviously the companies really well positioned with our $2.7 billion of cash at the end of the year, one of the strongest balance sheets and liquidity positions among our peers. We further strengthen that balance sheet by the further reduction in our spending for 2016 to the $2.4 billion number. We\u2019re talking about; it's about value not volume. So the whole focus is the balance sheet and yet at the same time it's very important that the company, we are in a long-term business. Everybody is thinking short-term that we invest for future growth on a disciplined and focused basis and we feel we\u2019re extremely well positioned with the growth options that we have both in North Malay Basin and Stampede, but also obviously Guyana that the company is going to benefit quite a bit and our shareholders as well as oil prices recover ultimately with these growth options that we\u2019ve already assembled. So we feel pretty good about what we\u2019ve already captured and therefore M&A is very low on the priority list. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger Read : Good morning. John Hess : Good morning. Roger Read : I guess two questions, one on the Bakken in terms of the efficiencies. Do you continue to do testing in this environment or with the two-well program strictly we should think about it as development and maybe putting further efficiencies on a hold for now? Or it's a drive for further efficiencies? Gregory Hill : No, I think part of lean manufacturing is every day you look for the next improvement. So in terms of piloting though I think we've done the infills nine and eight and very successful, 50-stage fracs been very successful. So those now will become our standard design obviously in the core of the core. But every day, we are looking for the next improvement right. So that that drive will continue, that will go on, and we are constantly trying to improve everything across our business there. And that\u2019s all part of the lean manufacturing philosophy. Roger Read : Okay, thanks. And then as you think about and you mentioned earlier in the beginning of the call, opportunities in the deepwater you have been able to get in; others are struggling on the cash flow side. As you look at some of those partners and you think about taking these projects forward, either on an appraisal well or ultimately full development, if it works out that way, what sort of I guess roadblocks may we run into, where partners simply don't want to fund those next steps? And how do we - it has been a long time since we've had a downturn like this. How should we think about the workout of that process over time? Gregory Hill : Well, certainly if you think about what we are in currently so Sicily, clearly Chevron wants to move forward or aligned to that on the appraisal. ConocoPhillips obviously moved forward with Melmar, Guyana moving forward with Exxon; Nova Scotia BP moving forward. So we don't really see any partner risk of people not wanting to move forward. Regarding your question, in the opportunity space. There is a lot of opportunity out there, very good prospects, very low entry cost, but we are going to be extremely disciplined and it's going to have to be really good in order for us to even consider adding it to the mix. And Melmar was one example of something that was very good and we made the decision to get in, but we are going to be extremely disciplined and very selective on how we do that. Roger Read : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Campbell : Thank you. The first question I wanted to ask was did I understand correctly that the reduced spending at North Malay and Stampede was largely on cost saving? And if so, can you indicate where, what sort of savings we are talking about? And also was I correct that the timelines to first oil are intact? John Rielly : I\u2019ll start with the timelines to first oil are intact. When I was talking about cost savings, it was across the portfolio, we had a mix of that $600 million worth kind of a half of it was cost savings and a half of it was deferment of activity. So there is a mix on North Malay Basin and Stampede, it's not like that was all cost savings. Jeffrey Campbell : Okay. And then thinking about - and staying on the theme of cost savings and the offshore, I was just wondering can you comment broadly about your current view of industry efforts to reduce offshore development costs? And specifically I am thinking of back when you said that Guyana looked great at $80 a barrel, but not as much at lower oil prices. Other than waiting for a higher future oil price, do you see developments unfolding that can make a play like Guyana better able to attract capital in a better, but still moderate oil price environment? Gregory Hill : Yes, I think so I mean if you look at cost reductions if you look at the onshore I would say the progression of cost reductions in the onshore has been much more rapid than the offshore. For very practical reason the offshore fleet - there's still a lot of rigs on contract at relatively high prices. The yards are full, still full as you kind of look around the globe so we see that really opening up though as rigs come off contract in the offshore as the yards become not at capacity those costs are going to come down as well. It\u2019s just taking longer than the offshore because they are very busy. So I think if you are developing something in that timeframe of 2017 or so I think you really get the full benefit of that. We are already seeing those benefits in Guyana with the rig rates that Exxon was able to get Guyana also the seismic boat rates that they were able to get Guyana. So you are starting to see some of that come through the value chain, but more they come on the offshore. Jeffrey Campbell : And if I could just follow up on that a little bit further. I was also wondering, because I'm sure you are watching, do you see anything with regard to trends, like trying to standardize subsidy approaches, things on the engineering side that might suggest that you can drive costs down on that basis as well? Gregory Hill : Yes, I think so. I think there is nothing like a low price for companies to get innovative and I know a lot of my service company colleagues in the major oil companies are all getting together talking about how can we better standardizes an industry to lower the overall cost structure of the industry. We are doing that in our developments, for example we are using a lot of the same things that came out of Tubular Bells and Stampede making sure there's not as much bespoke equipment that really tends to drive your cost up. Jeffrey Campbell : Okay, that was very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Pavel Molchanov : Hey guys. You addressed the M&A question from the buy side. I guess maybe I\u2019ll try it from the sell side. You have been a net seller of assets for more than three years now. Has that pretty much run its course with the Algeria deal? Or are you still looking to monetize additional assets other than of course the Bakken MLP? John Hess : A fair question. We will always look to optimize our portfolio you know in the normal course of business. So we will continue to take that approach. Pavel Molchanov : Any particular geographies that come to mind? John Hess : No. Pavel Molchanov : Okay, all right. I will leave it there. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Phillips Johnston of Capital One. Your line is now open. Phillips Johnston : Hi, guys thanks. Just a follow-up on Ed's question earlier. On the declines on the Bakken, if we assume you continue to run two-rigs throughout this year and next. Can you give us an update on what sort of cushion you have on your MBCs if we just assume your operator production continues to decline and if we assume production from other operators also declines in the basin? You've got some incremental volumes I think coming in through the Hawkeye system, which should sort of help offset that. But can you just give us an update on your latest thinking there, and whether or not that is something that we should be concerned about? John Rielly : First of all, no I guess is the answer on an overall basis, I just wanted to let you know in our supplement that is being posted we actually have the 2016 minimum volume commitments there, maybe I can just walk you through that from a processing standpoint this 2016 commitment is a 186 million scuffs a day. In the fourth quarter we\u2019re right at that 186 and as I mentioned earlier we had unplanned downtime in the third quarter we\u2019re up at 210 in the second quarter 202, don't see any issues with that with the two-rig program. From the pipeline standpoint we gathered 50,000 barrels of oil per day and the commitment is 45 in 2016 and gas gathering was 198 in the fourth quarter and the minimal vol is 189 do not see an issue there. So the one small thing that we may see and we think it\u2019s under $10 million save to us, is going to be on our logistics on the rail. Because as we mentioned earlier the economics now are favoring more to the pipeline but obviously that can change. So just from in the fourth quarter our terminal throughput was 62,000 barrels of oil per day the minimum volume commitment is 73,000 back in the second quarter we had 82 going through that terminal. But as far as the rail terminal crude loading, we were at 42,000 barrels a day the minimum volume coming is 38 and for rail services is 43,000 barrels a day for the minimum volume commitment and the fourth quarter was at 43,000. So bottom line we do not expect any real issues from the minimum volume standpoint and the build-out for the Hawkeye south of the river will begin to add throughput back into the system for us. Phillips Johnston : And just on that Hawkeye system, have you quantified what sort of incremental volumes you are expecting from that? John Rielly : Yes, if you hold on one second I can give you we had not quantified per se what are the additional volumes that absolutely will be coming through, but I can give you capacity from the south of the river infrastructures so we are adding approximately 75,000 barrels a day from the oil standpoint and 50 million cubic feet per day from the gas compression. Now the project itself is also going to add interconnection points for the capture of third-party oil volumes into the midstream system as well. Phillips Johnston : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Your line is now open. John Herrlin : Yes, hi. Just some quick ones for me. With Melmar, did COP approach you or did you approach COP in terms of the farming? Gregory Hill : It\u2019s been a joint thing; we\u2019ve been talking to each other for the last year and a half about Melmar. John Herrlin : Okay, that's fine. With your PUD reductions, was it all price, or just some of it reduced activity? Gregory Hill : Actually, it was both so if you look at the reductions as we mentioned in our opening remarks there were 282 million barrels of price related revision, 50 million of that was related to the Bakken five-year rule, so that\u2019s just purely reduced rig counts that push wells out of the five-year window so that was about 50 million barrels. The remaining 234 of that 282 is really across the portfolio, but it split about 60% Bakken and 40% offshore. So that kind of gives you a relative sense of where those movements were. John Herrlin : Okay, great. Last one for me regarding the Bakken, you are increasing the number of stages. Are you changing the sand loadings at all? For your fracs? Gregory Hill : Not really, although it does vary depending on where you are in the field. Typical sand loadings are anywhere from 75,000 to 100,000 pounds per stage, and just depending on where you are in the field we modify that based on the data. John Herrlin : Okay. And what drove all decline rates? Still high 20s? Gregory Hill : For the portfolio or what? John Herrlin : For the Bakken portfolio, yes. Gregory Hill : Well, I mean if you think about the - we averaged 112,000 barrels a day this year, the range is 95 to 105 so if you pick the middle that gives you a sense of how much the Bakken is going to decline year-on-year, right. John Herrlin : Okay, all right. Thanks. Gregory Hill : Okay. You bet. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2016 Hess Corporation Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Offer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will provide an update on the steps we are taking to manage in the low oil price environment and review some of the highlights from the quarter. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance and John Rielly will review our financial results. Our strategy in this lower for longer price environment is guided by three principles : preserve our balance sheet, preserve our operating capabilities and preserve our growth options. To preserve our balance sheet, on February 4, we successfully executed a capital raise of $1.6 billion through common and mandatory convertible preferred stock offerings. These proceeds will keep our strong balance sheet strong in the low oil price environment and provide the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our growth projects, North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and exploration offshore Guyana. Further to preserving the strength of our balance sheet, in January, we announced our 2016 capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, 40% below 2015 levels. Our focus remains on value, not volume, and we do not believe that accelerating production in the current oil price environment makes sense. Rather, we have reduced activity levels across our producing portfolio, both onshore and offshore. Our Bakken rig count will be reduced from three rigs currently to two rigs during the third quarter and is expected to remain at this level until the WTI price is closer to $60 per barrel. In the Utica, our one drilling rig was released in March and no further drilling is planned this year. Offshore, we continued the drilling break in Norway and Equatorial Guinea and the rig at South Arne in Denmark is set to be released in the second quarter. In terms of our operating capabilities, we are delivering industry-leading performance as confirmed by third-party benchmarks, both in unconventionals and offshore drilling and development. Our resilient portfolio is linked to our top quartile operating capabilities and is balanced between unconventionals and offshore providing an attractive mix of short cycle and long cycle investment opportunities. This balanced portfolio also casts a wider net for future long-term growth options. Our portfolio is leveraged to oil and liquids, with industry-leading cash margins and advantaged tax positions in the U.S. and Norway that will accelerate cash flow growth as oil prices improve. In terms of our growth opportunities, we have leading positions in the Bakken and Utica shale plays; new field startups in North Malay Basin and Stampede, which combined are expected to add 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of new production over the next two years and by 2018 will become material cash generators; and recent exploration success in Guyana that has the potential to provide significant long-term value creation and growth. Turning to our financial results, in the first quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $509 million, or $1.72 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $0.98 per share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and higher exploration expense which more than offset the positive impacts of lower cash costs and DD&A. While low crude oil prices significantly impacted our first quarter financial results, we delivered strong operational performance. Net production was at the high end of our guidance range, averaging 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to net production of 355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter, pro forma for last year's sale of our assets in Algeria. Net production from the Bakken averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of 2016, above our guidance range. Our Bakken team reduced drilling and completion costs 25% from the year ago quarter to an average of $5.1 million per well. In summary, with our strong balance sheet, oil leveraged portfolio and attractive growth opportunities, we believe the company is well positioned to deliver strong cash flow growth and long term value as oil prices recover. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. Starting with production, in the first quarter, we averaged 350,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the top end of our guidance range of 340,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and, once again, reflecting strong operating performance across our portfolio. In the second quarter, we expect net production to average between 320,000 barrels and 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance down time at Valhall and several of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico fields. As usual, we will provide an update to our full year production guidance on our mid-year call in July. Turning to operations, and beginning with the Bakken, our Lean Manufacturing approach has once again enabled us to deliver outstanding performance from one of the best core of the core positions in the play where we retain a substantial drilling inventory with attractive economics even at current prices. Despite reducing our Bakken rig count to an average of four rigs in the first quarter 2016 from 12 rigs in the year-ago quarter, net production from the Bakken averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter compared to 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. During the first quarter, we drilled 19 wells and brought 31 new wells online. This compares to the year-ago quarter when we drilled 60 wells and brought 70 wells online. We currently plan to maintain a three rig program through the second quarter, to release one rig during the third quarter and then operate two rigs for the remainder of the year. In 2016, we now expect to drill 62 wells and bring 87 new wells online. This compares to last year when we drilled 182 wells and brought 219 wells online. In the first quarter, our average drilling and completion cost was $5.1 million per well. We expect to be able to maintain this cost level over 2016 even as we transition from our previous 35-stage completion design to our new standard 50-stage completion design. This higher stage count is expected to deliver a 15% to 20% increase in initial production rates, and with our rigs focused in the core of the play, we expect our estimated ultimate recovery per well to move toward 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day \u2013 oil equivalent in the latter part of 2016. We also continued to successfully execute our 17-well per DSU spacing pilots and still see the majority of the wells performing in line with type curves and with minimal interference. The combination of both higher overall type curve performance and higher density well spacing has allowed us to increase our estimated ultimate recovery from the Bakken from our previous estimate of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. For the second quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average between 100,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moving to the Utica, in the first quarter, the joint venture drilled six wells and brought nine wells on production. Net production for the first quarter averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica acreage is largely held by production, which allows us to reduce activity in the short term while preserving optionality and longer-term upside. While we benefit from our acreage being in the core of the play and a low 5% royalty, we released the one rig we had operating in the play in early March. As a result of applying our distinctive Lean Manufacturing approach, over the past several years, we have been able to reduce our drilling cost per foot by approximately 75% and our completion cost per stage by approximately 50% while at the same time drilling some of the longest laterals in the play. We plan to run the asset for cash in 2016 and to resume drilling following a sustained recovery in commodity prices and further third-party infrastructure build-out which will reduce the currently wide basin differentials. Now, turning to the offshore, at the Tubular Bells field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, net production averaged 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. During the quarter, we conducted the remediation work highlighted in our fourth quarter call, completing asset jobs at two wells. We are now moving the rig to replace a defective sub-surface valve that failed to open. This is the second failure of this type in the field, and we are working with the supplier to understand the root causes of the manufacturing defect. In the second quarter, we have an extended shutdown scheduled to tie back Noble's Gunflint field to the Williams owned host facility and we plan to spud a fifth producing well in the field. In early April, we also completed our first water injection well and we expect to commence injection in the third quarter. In Norway, at the BP operated Valhall field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. The operator plans to commence an extended shutdown in the second quarter due to required maintenance work at the ConocoPhillips operated Ekofisk field. At the South Arne field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, we have completed the current phase of development drilling and do not plan to drill any additional wells in 2016. Net production averaged 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter. At the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess has a 50% interest, work continues on the Booster Compression project which remains on schedule for completion in the third quarter. Net production averaged 230 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter. Moving to developments, at North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, progress continues on full field development, 6 out of 11 development wells have now been drilled and drilling results to-date are better than expected. Net production from the early production system averaged 30 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter. Following completion of full field development in 2017, net production is planned to increase to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day. At the Stampede development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully floated the top-side's main deck onto the production deck, set the whole structure into the offshore floating dock and installed the oil export line. Drilling operations are underway on the first production well and first oil remains on schedule for 2018. Moving to exploration, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Chevron operated Sicily-2 well in which Hess holds a 25% working interest, reached its target depth and results are currently being evaluated. Also in the Gulf of Mexico, the ConocoPhillips operated Melmar well in which Hess has a 35% working interest reached target depth in early April and logging operations are now complete. The well results are still being evaluated, but as non-commercial quantities of oil were encountered at the current location, the well was expensed in the quarter. In Guyana, in the Stabroek Block in which Hess holds a 30% interest, the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, spud the Liza-2 well in February. This well is designed to further evaluate the significant Liza oil discovery and will include an extended drill stem test. We expect the operator to complete operations on the Liza-2 well late in the second quarter. Following the Liza-2 well, the operator intends to move the rig to test a separate prospect located approximately 25 miles northwest of Liza. We remain excited about the opportunity set on this block, which we believe could be material to our company. In closing, we have maintained excellent execution and delivery across our portfolio. We believe that our focus on preserving the strength of our balance sheet while also preserving our top quartile capabilities and growth options is the right strategy. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, we reported a net loss of $509 million compared with an adjusted net loss of $396 million in the previous quarter. That excludes a net charge of $1.425 billion. Turning to Exploration and Production, E&P incurred a net loss of $451 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to an adjusted net loss of $328 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. That excludes net charges totaling $1.385 billion. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015 were as follows. Lower realized selling prices reduced results by $187 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $4 million. Lower cash operating costs improved results by $28 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $71 million. Higher exploration expenses reduced results by $18 million. All other items net to a decrease in results of $13 million for an overall increase in the first quarter net loss of $123 million. In the first quarter, our E&P operations were over-lifted compared with production by approximately 500,000 barrels which did not have a material impact on first quarter results. The E&P effective income tax rate was a benefit of 41% for the first quarter of 2016 compared with the benefit of 38% in the fourth quarter, excluding items affecting comparability. Turning to Midstream, first quarter net income of $14 million increased from $11 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to lower operating costs. Bakken Midstream EBITDA excluding the non-controlling interest amounted to $70 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $67 million in the previous quarter. Turning to corporate and interest, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $72 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 which excludes net charges totaling $32 million. The reduction resulted from lower professional fees and general and administrative costs. Turning to cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $148 million. A net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $208 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $620 million. Net debt repayments were $12 million. Net proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred stock were $1.644 billion. Common stock dividends paid were $80 million. Other net amounted to a use of cash of $31 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $841 million. Turning to our financial position, we had approximately $3.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2016 and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $8.3 billion. Excluding Bakken Midstream, total debt was $5.9 billion at March 31, 2016 and our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 23.1%. Now, turning to second quarter guidance; for E&P, we project cash costs for E&P operations to be in the range of $16.50 to $17.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, reflecting lower production and higher maintenance costs from the planned offshore facility shutdowns. DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent is forecast to be $26.50 per barrel to $27.50 per barrel, resulting in projected total E&P unit operating costs of $43 per barrel to $45 per barrel in the second quarter of 2016. The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected $3.75 to $3.85 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter of 2016, while exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million. The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 42% to 46% for the second quarter. For Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the second quarter. For corporate and interest, we expect corporate expenses net of taxes to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million and interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the second quarter of 2016. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : . Your first question comes from the line of Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse. You may begin. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Two operational questions, if I may. The first one, obviously, the move to 50-stage fracs and the raise to EURs, obviously, you gave good guidance in the supplementals about IPs and obviously we can see some of the state data, but when do you think the completions at the 50-stage frac will actually start to show up in the data? I appreciate there is some time lags, maybe some color about that? And then I have a follow-on about Guyana. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Okay. Thanks, Ed. If you look at the majority of the wells that we brought on in the first quarter of this year, the majority were 35-stage fracs, so we'll move into that 50-stage frac as we move through the year. And recall, we expect a 15% to 20% uplift from those 50-stage completions. So if you look at IP rates, Q1, it was just under 800 boe/d, we expect that to move towards 1,000 boe/d as we move into the second half of the year. So we really see the benefit of those kicking in in the second half of the year as we complete those new wells. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then a follow-on just on Guyana, I appreciate the seismic, I guess, is now complete, some processing. Maybe any update in terms of perhaps not the well you're drilling today, but the confidence integral from the data that you've seen on, I guess, the other channels as you move further to the northwest of Liza-1? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Thanks, Ed. I think as Exxon has said, and we've said, we see a fair amount of press activity on the block and that continues to be confirmed with the 3D seismic that we are processing. Again, we just got to drill more wells. We plan to drill one or two additional exploration wells this year and that will give us some additional color on prospectivity, but looks good on seismic. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. You may begin. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Morning. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Can I start with a couple of housekeeping points, I guess, just on the numbers for the quarter? The differentials internationally looked a little wide, and I'm wondering if there's anything \u2013 any nuance there? And I guess a similar thing with the oil mix in the Bakken. So I've got a follow-up on exploration, please. John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Okay, Doug, I'll start with the differentials. There was something unusual just from \u2013 in the first quarter and it had to do just with our timing of lifts. So there's two aspects of why our differentials widened. So with the timing, actually we produce about approximately 75,000 barrels a day of oil internationally, but our liftings were heavily in January and February. We actually lifted about 89,000 barrels a day in January, and 130,000 barrels a day in February, and March liftings were only 19,000 barrels a day. So obviously we lifted more just timing-wise when oil prices were lower in the quarter, and so that had an impact on our differentials. The other thing that did a true weakening was on the West African crudes, not just ours but, in general, West African crudes where kind of the differential widened about $1, and that did happen with our EG liftings as well in the quarter. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And on the oil mix in the Bakken, it looked like it swung a little bit toward NGLs, John. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, Doug. That was \u2013 this is Greg -- that was primarily just a weather-related operational issue in January. It had to do with complying with Reid vapor pressure requirements in the field. That caused it to shut in some oil production. So if you look at kind of oil in January, it was actually down around 69,000 barrels a day, but that completely reversed itself in February/March, and it was at 75,000 barrels a day for the months of February and March. So that came back up. So it was just a temporary transient issue in January. John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : And then, Doug, the only other thing I'll add to that with the wells is we are \u2013 and it is our focus this year with our Midstream infrastructure, we are out gathering more gas. So from the wells, as Greg said, the wells were impacted by the vapor pressure and we will be adding additional gas into our gas plant and therefore NGLs throughout the year. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : But the \u2013 just to be clear, the oil should come back or did come back, Greg, towards the end of the quarter? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : It did. John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : As Greg said, it did, and so it's 69,000 barrels a day, 75,000 barrels a day, 75,000 barrels a day. So that 5,000 barrel a day increase was \u2013 decrease was just impacted by those vapor pressure issues in January. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Just to be clear from our wells themselves, there's no change in the oil/gas mix. It's steady as she goes. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's what I was getting at. Thanks, John. My follow-up, fellows, is \u2013 I'm not going to ask about Guyana, but I would like to ask about Melmar and Sicily. Has Melmar now been condemned by this well? And on Sicily are you really just holding out waiting on the operator commenting or is there some nuance in your commentary that you're still evaluating the results? I mean, could Sicily end up being a field appraisal as well, I guess is what I'm getting at? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : No, Doug, on both wells it's really too early to comment. They're both under evaluation. As we said in the script, Melmar at the current location didn't have economic quantities of oil. But that doesn't mean that the block is done, right? So we're under evaluation of all the data that came out of the well right now. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And on Sicily, Greg? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Same thing, Doug. Under evaluation with the operator. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks, guys. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: First question on the Bakken. I believe you said to think about ramping up there, you would want to wait until you saw $60 a barrel at WTI, and I wondered if you could add some color on why $60 a barrel versus lower or higher price? How much of that decision is driven by your view of what the break-even oil price is at the well level to meet your return thresholds versus your corporate needs to improve your balance sheet versus the competition for capital elsewhere such as potential Guyana development? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So all those factors play into that decision, and you did round it off pretty well. So let's just start with returns. We have an excellent acreage position in the Bakken. And as you know, we've got good returns that we could drill wells here at $40 a barrel and we could drill at $50 a barrel and get good return wells. But obviously at $60 a barrel the returns are going to be better. And more of our acreage then meets our return threshold as you move towards $60 a barrel. So obviously we want to improve returns for our shareholders. The next aspect of it is we are spending money on growth right now. You know North Malay Basin and Stampede, so we will have 35,000 barrels a day coming in 2018 from those two projects. And like you said, we've already added some valuable resources here in Guyana. And we're going to continue exploration there and see if we can add more valuable resources there. Then it comes to the last part of your point was we do look at overall corporate cash flow. And we want to deliver growth with free cash flow. And at $60 a barrel, Bakken, we can add rigs and Bakken will grow and generate free cash flow. So that is something that we're looking to do from the portfolio aspect. And then with our balance sheet, with this low point in the cycle, we want to come out of that low point in the cycle with this strong balance sheet. So our plan is because our portfolio is so levered to oil, $1.00 for us gives us $75 million of annual cash flow. So we want to bank that cash flow as you move up to $60 a barrel again to improve the balance sheet. So all those factors play a role. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. And then shifting to the international assets, there were a couple of comments that you made that I wanted to see if you could add some additional color. The first was in North Malay Basin where I believe you said of the development wells was drilled, they were coming in better than expected. How that may impact, if at all, the total production which I think you seem to say was not changed and any kind of returns or well costs. And then in Guyana I believe you mentioned that there was an extended drill stem test being drilled, if it's at all possible to add any color around what precipitated that? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Thanks for the question. On North Malay Basin, the wells are coming in with thicker pay overall. Now, that will likely not affect the initial volumes coming out of North Malay Basin. It could have a positive reserve effect, but we're \u2013 all that's under evaluation right now, so it's too early to say one way or the other. Regarding Guyana, again, the operations that we're conducting in Guyana with the operator ExxonMobil, two major objectives; one is appraise the Liza discovery. So that will be additional wells to find the edges of the reservoir, let's call it. Also an extended drill stem test as well. That's key dynamic data that we will need in terms of designing a development of Liza. The second objective is to drill those one or two exploration wells that I talked about, which are going after some Liza lookalikes on the block. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. You may begin. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just an immediate... John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : ...follow-up. You mentioned Guyana was \u2013 I think you said potentially material or maybe just material to Hess. When is the best hope for actual first production? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Well, I think again, Paul, I think we've got to get these appraisal wells down. So it's too early to say when an early production system might come on. So let us get through the appraisal, which will be in the third quarter and then we can hopefully give some more color after that. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Understood. And I guess given that you said it's material, we can hope to see press releases as to what's going on there from here. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, we would hope after the appraisal drilling and drill stem tests, the operator will be in a position to provide more color on resource estimate or range of resource estimate. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thanks, John. Just the outlook for CapEx for the year, you came in low relative to our expectations for Q1. I think the Q2 numbers may be a little bit higher than we thought. Can you talk a little bit about the sensitivities of the CapEx outlook to the oil price? And I'd heard, and I have to say this is second hand that you talked about $60 a barrel being the point at which you would resume growth, I think, in the Bakken. Was that an accurate second hand story that I got? Or am I thinking of the wrong price? Thanks. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. On the $60 a barrel, I can answer that because it was in my remarks. Our first priority is the balance sheet. So to be clear, first and foremost we just want to strengthen the cash flow generation of the company and the balance sheet to fund our growth projects and also come out of this low price environment on our front feet. The second is, we have plenty of locations that John talked about, we have in our investor pack, where we generate in excess of a 15% after-tax return at $50 a barrel probably over 600 locations and $60 a barrel over 1,000 locations. So our locations compete not only with the best acreage in the Bakken, but the best acreage of any shale play in the United States including the Permian. So our focus, even though we have those locations, is on value not volume. And we're going to be guided by capital discipline and financial returns and that's why we've said that $60 a barrel is our price that we will focus on where we start ramping up Bakken activity. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : And I guess what you're saying there, John, is in the interim between $50 a barrel and $60 a barrel it would be a balance sheet prioritization strategy. And then could you guys just follow on with the CapEx sensitivity for the year? Thanks. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's correct. John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So as usual, we will update middle of the year. You're right; our capital was running a bit lower than the run rate in the first quarter. Obviously we are focused on being tight on spending on capital, on operating. So we're looking at all possibilities to reduce. But I don't want to get ahead of it. We'll get through the second quarter. We'll get through the shutdowns that Greg mentioned, and we'll update capital middle of the year. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. Thank you. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. You may begin. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Maybe if I could follow up with one on the Bakken, and then shift somewhere else. On the Bakken, can you provide any color on the expected trajectory of, you mentioned you're going from four rigs, or you went from three rigs and then to two rigs in the third quarter. Any shift? I think earlier the view was to go from four to two by late February. Was there a shift in the plan of rigs? Is there a reason in terms of any thoughts behind the shift there? And then should we expect the completion to be effectively ratable over the remainder of this year? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. So the reason in going from three rigs, extending that third rig just a little bit longer. That was purely just an efficient way to ramp down the Bakken, it really completes some existing pads. While the rig is there, you just soon complete those pads rather than get them partially done and then come back later. So that was purely an efficiency thing as we lined out the work for the year. If you look at the Bakken production character, what we've said is that our range for the year is 105,000 boe/d to 95,000 boe/d. And certainly directionally that mimics what is going to happen to the production curve. So it's going to start out high and then end the year probably close to the end of that, or the bottom end of that range. That will give you a sense for how Bakken production is going to look over the year. Obviously, we're starting a little bit higher. But you can assume about a 10% decline over the year in the Bakken. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Very helpful. And then maybe one more. Obviously, very, very strong results on the EUR uplift from the Bakken. The million barrel EUR number that you were talking about, how much of your 3,200 well inventory should we assume that's applicable to? Is that a small \u2013 is that a portion of it? Is that all of it? And is it a ratable EUR increase across \u2013 or an equal EUR percentage increase across all of your inventory? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : No. It's not ratable. So it's again, this is a result of drilling in the core of the core. So we're really drilling in the best part of the Bakken right now. I don't have the exact numbers, but it's a couple hundred wells that are probably in this thousand EUR. We did not increased EUR for the 50-stage fracs yet. There may be an EUR increase in the wells associated with that, but we wanted to get more production history under our belt before we increase the EUR associated with 50-stage fracs. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Greg. I'll leave it there. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning, guys. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Let me follow up on the Bakken to Ryan's [audio skip] (38:57). What were your thoughts on to increasing the full year guidance with increased completions today? I think you're 87 versus 80 in the first quarter and that your ops report just came out with this improved spud to spud time which would potentially give you a tailwind there. Any thoughts there? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, I think, Evan, as we always do, we'll update all of our guidance on the July call after our second quarter. We'll be updating production capital, all of our guidance. Now what I will say from a company standpoint, we do have some extended shutdowns in this quarter that were longer than we had in our original planning assumptions, both associated with third-party shutdowns. So how all that kind of offsets higher production to Bakken, that's what we'll guide the market on in our July call. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Fair enough. And to follow up also on Guyana, I mean, should we expect a resource estimate this summer specifically for Liza? Or potentially a broader delineation of the potential or other prospects on the block? And is that \u2013 is a resource estimate something that's in conjunction with additional pre-feed work being done? Or how does that relate to the timing on ultimate development? John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Fair question, Evan, and we're going to leave that to the operator, but it's obviously subject to the appraisal drilling and well tests that we're going to do. And then out of that we would hope we could get some granularity on what the resource estimate on Liza might be, and I wouldn't want to get ahead of ourselves beyond that. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, maybe I'll ask someone Friday as well, but if I could squeeze in one last one, in the ops report, any color on the 30 day IPs? Kind of the relative performance from the 50-stage completions year-over-year down \u2013 did I miss that explanation earlier? Any color there would be helpful. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. So Evan, if you look at our first quarter, the IPs were just under 800 barrels a day. That also had some down time. Remember I talked about the down time in January, so that pulled the IP rates down a bit. We guided 800 barrels a day to 950 barrels a day for the year, so basically, the IPs will increase from here and will move towards 1,000 barrels a day in the latter half of the year. So this first quarter got pulled down by some operational issues, but also we were putting on wells online that were more like 35-stage fracs, carryover from last year. As we move into the year that'll move towards 1,000 barrels a day. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Barclays. You may begin. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Couple quick \u2013 several quick questions. First one with John Rielly. John, you gave a guidance for the second quarter unit DD&A and the cash costs. Based on that and first quarter results, it looked like the full year DD&A, the previous guidance, $28.5 per barrel to $29.5 per barrel, seems way high. Is there any reason that we should not assume the second half of the year your unit DD&A will be somewhat similar to the first half? And in terms of the cash costs on the other hand, it seems like your previous full year guidance say $14.5 per barrel to $15.5 per barrel, if we assume the second quarter in $17.5 per barrel or so, $16.5 per barrel to $17.5 per barrel, should we assume there is more to it into the high end of the range? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Paul. Let's go through. I'll start with the cash costs. So the first thing in \u2013 our cash costs in the first quarter were down to $14.62 so there was over a 5% decline from Q4. And again, like we said, we're very focused on where we're spending money on operating costs as well as capital. And some of the operating costs in the first quarter, as Greg had mentioned, we did have higher workovers as well. So we've been pretty good at being able to reduce the costs. Now on the flip side, Greg just mentioned that we had some extended shutdowns that were not part of our original plan. So that is, from that second quarter guidance, is driving up so we have lower production and additional maintenance costs coming in the second quarter is driving up our second quarter costs. What we'd like to do kind of like with all our guidance, we'd like to get through that. Then we'll have six months of data, we'll come in July and we'll give the update for the cash costs at that point and we'll see where we're moving for the rest of the year. DD&A is a mix issue. So again, basically offshore had to do again what Greg was talking about from fields that we had a mixed force. (44:07) Some fields were producing more at a lower DD&A rate and some of the fields that were producing less at a higher DD&A rate. So it was purely a mix issue. So, again, I'd like to get through these shutdowns, get through the six months of data before I do update the numbers. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Greg, just curious that is the turnaround downtime primary focus in the second quarter? Or it's going to have equal amount (44:30) in the third quarter? Or the third quarter will be significantly lower? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. No, the majority, Paul, is going to be in the second quarter. That's at T Bells and Conger in the Gulf of Mexico, and in Valhall in the North Sea. There's a smaller amount in the third quarter, and that will be at JDA and South Arne. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : That's how the shutdowns kind of break out throughout the year. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And as you move to 50 stage, do you intended to keep the well cost to be flat on the ground level? How about the cash operating cost? Is that going to trick (45:07) a higher cash operating cost? Or you will be able to more than offset it with the efficiency gain? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : No, I think we'll be more than able to offset that with the efficiency gain as well. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And Greg, just curious that in the first quarter if I looking at it sequentially, the U.S. oil price realization dropped $10, $11. Benchmark seems to be dropping $8 to $9. Is there any mix issue that we should be realized that that's causing that and then it will get reverse in the second or third quarter? Or that this is really going to be a new defense (45:47) of looking \u2013 this is a good base now going forward? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So you are correct. The onshore differential has really widened between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So it's driven obviously up in the Bakken with our production. Clearbrook was approximately $1 under WTI in the fourth quarter and it moved to $1.80 under TI (sic) [WTI] (46:11) in the first quarter. So that $0.80 was driving some of our differential. The overall differential though moved about $1.55 in our production, and that is because the rail market was weaker in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter, again due to the narrowing of the Brent TI (sic) [WTI] (46:29) spread. Clearbrook has been getting a little better in April and May, not a big change. But it's been a little better that we are seeing on the sales volume, so that could come back. And then the rail market, that will move and we'll try to optimize between [audio disruption] (46:44) pipe depending on where the best economics are. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And just a little more color. You know, in the last year our oil (46:52) have gone from 50/50 pipeline/train to 70%, 30% pipeline/train. And we're maxing out our pipeline deliveries as we speak to make sure we get the most for our oil that we sell. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Final question if I could. Greg, if you're looking at your current manpower and organization capability, if you are not adding any head count, what is the maximum number of rig that you can handle? And how quickly that you can ramp it to that level if you want to? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, Paul. Good question. I mean, as John mentioned, our second priority is to preserve the capability. So what we have done -- one of the reasons that we didn't cut the Bakken rigs to zero was we wanted to leave a couple rigs so that we could maintain the capability and ability to ramp up. As we look at it, we think with the manpower that we have, because we have gone down substantially in manpower, but we think because of the manpower that we do have, we think that we can efficiently ramp up from two to six rigs over a 9- to 12-month period. So we can go from two to six rigs relatively painlessly without losing a lot of the efficiencies that we've worked so hard to maintain with the Lean Manufacturing capabilities. So... Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. You may begin. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Regarding the two Bakken rigs in 2016, my memory was that the company once said that four rigs were required to maintain efficiencies and skilled labor. I was just wondering : has this efficiency just proved too expensive to afford? Or have you taken efficiency to new levels that allow for core competency preservation with two rigs? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sorry, my mic was off. It's more of the latter. So we've taken our efficiency to new levels, and we believe that we can preserve enough capability with two rigs versus the four to be able to efficiently ramp up when prices approach the $60 a barrel that John has mentioned. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. We're hearing a lot about cost reduction efforts from other offshore operators. I was just wondering if you have any line of sight for cost reductions that could support a resumption of drilling in places like Equatorial Guinea, South Arne and Ghana at lower oil prices that might have been the case earlier in the downturn. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. So I think, again, if you think about when we would restart drilling, as John Reilly mentioned in his comments, it's really going to be a function of corporate cash flow. So we're really going to be watching corporate cash flow before we restart drilling either offshore or onshore in the Bakken. So that's going to be the primary driver. But broadly, the pace of the cost reductions has been slower offshore than onshore due to the need to work off the backlog of those higher cost rig contracts and also the work in the yards associated with previously-sanctioned projects. So now rigs, boats and associated equipment are already starting to come down substantially. And we know that because we're seeing a lot of those benefits in Guinea, for example, on the rig rates and the seismic boat rates. And then we expect that to continue as offshore projects are completed, so we think further rate cost capitulation will occur. And then importantly the yard rates will start to come down as well as capacity becomes available. And in fact in some of our pre-feed work that we're doing around the globe we're already seeing significantly lower indicative bids in the offshore yard and rig space, so more to come in the offshore. But again, restart, I think, is going to be back to what John Rielly said : it's going to be a function of corporate cash flow. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. You may begin. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question, guys. Very similar to the previous one with a small tweak; for Ghana, what Brent price would you need to see to sanction a full scale development? So above and beyond corporate cash flows? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Well, I think first of all, Ghana is right now is a sanction because of the border dispute. So we're working with the government to try and get the deadlines extended there. So until the border dispute is clear, which the earliest would be mid-2017, we wouldn't be in a position to say what sanction price Ghana would need because it would depend upon the cost curve at that point in time. We do see cost coming down. So way too early to speculate what price it would take. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then same question about the Utica; what Henry Hub threshold do you have in mind to put at least one rig back to work in the Utica? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So it's not just the \u2013 obviously, it's the low commodity prices. And as Greg mentioned earlier, the wide basin differentials that are causing us the issue right now. The rock is very good. We like the asset. So it really is depending on additional infrastructure being built out to get the product out of that basin. So we do see that happening. So as that infrastructure is built out we see \u2013 and the basin differentials narrow along with improving commodity prices is when we'd go back to work in the Utica. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. You may begin. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more color around the magnitude of the Q2 downtime at Valhall, Conger and Tubular Bells? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Let me give you directionally how many days of downtime are planned. So again this is all third-party shutdowns. So Valhall expected to be around a 25-day shutdown. That's associated with Ekofisk, so it's coincident with the Ekofisk shutdown. Tubular Bells, about 31 days down, again, that's a third-party tie in of Gunflint to the Williams' owned host facility at Tubular Bells. And then finally there's an anticipated 22-day shutdown in Conger associated with Shell's turnaround of Enchilada/Salsa during the second quarter. So that gives you an idea of how much. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And these wouldn't have been in your original guide, right? These were outside of that? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : No, they were. But the way the forecast works is you get an estimate from the operator when you're putting your business plan together, and then the operator updates that as it gets closer to forecast. So what happened is there were more days now as the operators have come forward and given us the final day to \u2013 they've extended those shutdowns longer than we thought, so that's why there's a difference... Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : ...in the assumption there. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Just one on the Bakken. Understanding you're capturing more gas, do you have a \u2013 give us a sense of what you think as things normalize, your oil/gas/NGL mix could look like, ballpark? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think through 2016, this percentage of oil, at mid-60%s say, is where we see the crude being as it goes through 2016. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Mid-60%s? Okay. Okay. And last question is the G&A expenses were down pretty significantly on a sequential basis. Is that \u2013 do you think you could hold that level of G&A that you saw in the first quarter, $98 million? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So... Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : It was down almost $40 million sequentially. John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Right. So now some of that, if you're just looking sequentially on the G&A line itself and we do have in the first \u2013 I mean, sorry, in the fourth quarter there were some specials that were there. But we did have a good sequential decline in G&A, like I said. Across the company we're looking at costs all over, operating, G&A. So some of it is timing. We did have lower professional fees in the quarter, but we are trying and looking to reduce the costs. And the corporate guidance that we gave is a bit down now even for the second quarter. So we are beginning to see some savings throughout the company, but I'd like to wait until the mid-year before I update all the rest of the guidance. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Phillip Jungwirth with BMO. You may begin. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning. $60 a barrel is a price required to increase activity in the Bakken would that threshold be similar for some of your conventional offshore development areas such as the North Sea and Africa? Can you provide any color on what you're doing in these areas to maintain operator capabilities? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I'll just first talk about like when we're going to put capital back to work. And again, I just want to remind you we have some great opportunities and great return locations even at these lower prices, but due to corporate cash flow and maintaining the strength of our balance sheet is why we're going to move towards $60 a barrel before we put rigs back to work in the Bakken. The way we are thinking about it with we have our development projects, Stampede and North Malay Basin. That's going to generate 35,000 barrels a day of production, in 2018 we have Guyana. But the next call on our capital will be Bakken, and that's why as we look as we get to $60 a barrel, there's plenty of running room there, we'll start putting more rigs to work. What it means now on offshore is \u2013 and I think Greg might have mentioned, it's not that we don't have very good return opportunities of tie-backs on our offshore assets, we do. Some is good or even better than the Bakken. The issue that we now have is you have to then commit to a rig. So you'll have to get a rig to location and what it's going to mean is you're going to have to commit to multi-wells or maybe more than one year. So at that point we're going to want even stronger prices than $60 a barrel and feel that it's sustainable before we go commit to that. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : In terms of preserving capability, the second part of your question, we've done just like we've done in the Bakken, we've moved people over, put them on special projects, special assignments, which really don't want to lose the drilling and completions capabilities, so we think we've adequately covered that in Reid point people's (58:31) other opportunities. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. And on Tubular Bells, what's your expectation for second half production there and is there anything you've experienced to-date that would cause you to believe peak production or EUR is different from initial expectations? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : No. I think, again, as we mentioned in our opening remarks, we've had a failure of a second down hole valve which was unfortunately one of our largest producers and so we've got to move the rig over to do that. It's not a rig-less intervention, it requires the rig. So the second half of the year, Tubular Bells will hopefully be in that 25,000 barrel a day range that we thought it would be at this point, and would be had it not been for the valve failure. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will provide an update on the progress we continue to make in managing in the low oil price environment while preserving our long-term growth options. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance from the quarter, and John Rielly will review our financial results. Our company is well-positioned for the current price environment and for the eventual recovery in oil prices. We have one of the strongest balance sheet and liquidity positions among our peers, a resilient portfolio, and an exceptional long-term growth outlook. In terms of our balance sheet, we started 2016 by reducing our E&P capital and exploratory budget to $2.4 billion, 40% below our 2015 spend and cut activity across our producing portfolio, both onshore and offshore. Since then we have continued to pursue further capital reductions. In the second quarter of 2016, we reduced E&P capital and exploratory expenditures by 52% from the second quarter of last year to $485 million. We now project our full-year 2016 capital and exploratory expenditures to be $2.1 billion, about 48% below 2015 levels and $300 million lower than our previous forecast. Efforts are under way to make further reductions as well. We have the balance sheet and liquidity necessary to invest in our future growth. Our three growth projects will make us a much stronger company in the next few years in terms of visible production and cash flow growth as well as improving returns. As you know, we are investing about $700 million in 2016 in two offshore developments, North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand and Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These two projects, which will come online in 2017 and 2018 respectively, will add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and go from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company. In terms of our third major growth project, offshore Guyana, on June 30, Hess and co-venture partner and operator ExxonMobil announced positive results from the Liza-2 well in the Stabroek block. The results confirmed a world-class oil discovery, one of the largest in the last 10 years, with estimated recoverable resource for the Liza discovery of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We believe the Stabroek block has the potential to materially contribute to our resource base and future production growth and create significant value for our shareholders. On July 17, the operators spud the Skipjack well, which is a separate but similar prospect located approximately 25 miles to the northwest of the Liza-1 well. We expect to have the results from this well by our next conference call. Following the Skipjack well, the operator intends to drill a third well at Liza to further appraise the discovery. In addition, predevelopment activities are under way, and we look forward to working with our partners and the government of Guyana to move this exciting discovery towards a commercialization decision. We believe Liza will offer very attractive economics and expect the call on capital next year to be manageable, given our strong cash position. As plans progress, we will continue to keep you informed. Turning to our financial results, in the second quarter of 2016 we posted a net loss of $392 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $335 million or $1.10 per common share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $147 million or $0.52 per common share in the second quarter of last year. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas selling prices and sales volumes, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower cash costs and DD&A. Net production averaged 313,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to net production of 386,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter, pro forma for last year's sale of our Algeria asset. While we continue to have strong performance from the Bakken, overall company production during the quarter was primarily affected by unplanned downtime due to subsurface safety valve failures in related remediation work at the Tubular Bells field and a mechanical issue at one well in the Conger field both in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, planned shutdowns at several offshore fields, including Tubular Bells and Valhall field in Norway, and reduced capital investment as compared with last year. Due to the unplanned downtime at the Tubular Bells and Conger fields, which Greg will address in more detail, we are revising our overall company production forecast for 2016 to a range of 315,000 to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, from our previous guidance of 330,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Turning to the Bakken, net production in the second quarter of 2016 averaged 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 119,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second quarter of 2015, reflecting our reduced drilling program. Through the use of lean manufacturing techniques, our Bakken team continues to drill some of the lowest-cost and most productive wells in the play. Notably, during the second quarter, we reduced drilling and completion costs 14% from the year-ago quarter to an average of $4.8 million per well, even as we shifted from 35-stage to 50-stage wells, which is delivering a 15% to 20% uplift in initial production rates. For full-year 2016, we are narrowing our Bakken production forecast to a range of 100,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, representing the upper end of our previous guidance of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our focus remains on value, not volume, and we do not believe that accelerating production or drilling up our best locations in the current low price environment is in the best interest of our shareholders. While our Bakken acreage can generate attractive returns at current low prices, we will remain disciplined and begin to increase activity there when oil prices approach $60 per barrel. As we see that a price recovery is sustained, we will also then resume drilling activities in the Utica and offshore, where we have numerous high return investment opportunities. In summary, we have one of the strongest balance sheets and most attractive long-term growth profiles among our peers. We remain confident in our ability to manage through the current environment and deliver strong production and cash flow growth as oil prices recover. Our resilient portfolio provides an attractive mix of short-cycle and long-cycle growth options, including an unparalleled position in the Bakken, two significant offshore developments that will become cash generators starting in 2017 and 2018, and the recent world-class oil discovery in Guyana that has the potential to create material value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2016 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. As John said, we are focused on maximizing value, not volume, and have reduced our drilling program to levels that allow us to manage near-term cash flow, while maintaining our operating capabilities in the current low price environment. When oil prices approach $60 per barrel, we will begin to ramp up activity, starting with the Bakken. As the price recovery is sustained, we will then resume drilling activities in the Utica and offshore. However, given that oil prices have remained below $50 per barrel, we have further reduced our 2016 E&P capital and exploratory budget to $2.1 billion from our previous guidance of $2.4 billion, which represents a 48% reduction from 2015. This decrease reflects our continuing focus on reducing costs across our portfolio. Now moving to production, in the second quarter, we averaged 313,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of 320,000 to 325,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter. As discussed on our last call, we had a series of extended planned shutdowns at the Valhall field in Norway and at the Tubular Bells and Conger fields in the Gulf of Mexico during the second quarter. In addition, we experienced a mechanical issue that affected one well at the Conger field and had further downtime at the Tubular Bells field to replace a second defective subsurface safety valve. In July, we have experienced a third subsurface safety valve failure. We are actively pursuing legal claims against the vendor who provided the defective valve at Tubular Bells. The third valve failure at Tubular Bells and the mechanical issue with the Conger well will be remediated in the fourth quarter. These issues, along with decreased investment levels, led us to reduce our full-year 2016 production guidance to 315,000 to 325,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. We forecast companywide production in the third quarter to average between 310,000 and 315,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Our third quarter forecast reflects planned downtime at the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand, the South Arne field in Denmark, and the mechanical issues at Tubular Bells and Conger, as well as hurricane contingency in the Gulf of Mexico and reduced investment levels. While preserving the strength of our balance sheet in the current environment is crucial, it is equally important for us to be well-positioned for a price recovery by maintaining both our operating capabilities and the opportunities to drive future profitable growth. It is therefore significant to Hess that at the end of June ExxonMobil announced the drilling results from the Liza-2 well, the second well in the Stabroek block, offshore Guyana, in which Hess holds a 30% interest. The Liza-2 well encountered more than 190 feet of oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs in upper Cretaceous formations. After successfully concluding an extensive well evaluation program and extended production test, ExxonMobil confirmed Liza as a world-class discovery with a recoverable resource of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The Stabroek block extends to 6.6 million acres, and on July 17, we spud an exploration well on a second prospect, Skipjack, located approximately 25 miles northwest of Liza. We remain excited not only about the Liza discovery but the wider opportunity set on this block, which has the potential to be transformational to our company. Turning now to unconventionals, net production from the Bakken averaged 106,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, in line with the guidance of 100,000 to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day given on our first quarter call. We maintained an average of three Bakken rigs in the second quarter. We plan to drop to two rigs in August and will begin to increase activity when oil prices approach $60 per barrel. Over 2016, we now expect to drill 65 wells and bring 90 new wells online. In the first half of 2016, we drilled 39 new wells and brought 57 new wells online, and we plan to drill 26 new wells and bring 33 online in the second half of the year as the lower rig count takes effect. In the second quarter, our average drilling and completion cost was $4.8 million per well. I'm very proud of our Bakken team, who has driven down D&C costs by 14% versus the year-ago quarter, even as we transition from our previous 35-stage completion design to our new 50-stage completion design. With the higher stage count, we expect to see 30-day IP rates of over 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second half of 2016 and expect that these wells in the core of the play will show a 7% uplift in EUR per well. As a result of the increased productivity and EUR, and lower drilling and completion costs, we have significantly increased the number of well locations that are economic at lower prices. Because of our continued strong performance, we are narrowing our full-year 2016 net production guidance for the Bakken to 100,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the upper end of the 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day range that we provided in January. Moving to the Utica, the joint venture has drilled no new wells since we released the rig we had operating in the play in early March. Net production for the second quarter averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. Similar to our Bakken position, our Utica activity is focused in the core of the play. Because the acreage in the core is held by production, we can reduce activity in the short term and preserve optionality and longer term upside. We plan to run the asset for cash in 2016 and to resume drilling following a sustained recovery in commodity prices. As a result of applying our distinctive lean manufacturing approach, over the past few years we've been able to reduce our Utica drilling cost per foot by approximately 75% and our completion costs per stage by approximately 50%. Using competitor benchmarking, we know that we are achieving some of the lowest D&C costs and drilling some of the longest laterals in the play. These advances position us well to restart activity when prices improve. Now turning to the offshore and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. At the Conger field, a mechanical failure on one well resulted in the loss of 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of production during the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this well will be worked over in the fourth quarter. At our Tubular Bells field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, net production averaged 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, due to the remediation work on the second well with a defective valve and a 35-day shutdown to allow for the tieback of Noble's Gunflint to the Williams-owned facility. As mentioned previously, in July we experienced another valve failure on a third well. This well will remain shut in until completion of remediation work in the fourth quarter. As a result of the cumulative downtime in 2016 from the three valve failures, we have reduced our full-year 2016 net production guidance for Tubular Bells to 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. A fifth production well at Tubular Bells was spud mid-June, which is scheduled to be brought online in early 2017, and we anticipate starting water injection in the third quarter. In Norway, at the BP-operated Valhall field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. The planned annual turnaround was completed on schedule in early July. In June, BP and Aker announced the creation of a new operating entity, Aker BP ASA. We look forward to working with the new partner to deliver further operational efficiencies and value from future development. At the South Arne field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, net production averaged 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter. Looking forward, a 20-day planned maintenance shutdown is scheduled in the third quarter. At the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has as a 50% interest, net production averaged 236 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter. There is a scheduled 15-day shutdown in the third quarter to commission the new booster compressor. Moving to developments, at North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, second quarter net production averaged 33 million cubic feet per day through the early production system and is expected to remain at about this level through 2016. In the second quarter, we installed three wellhead platforms and a jacket for the central processing platform. We also successfully drilled the first eight of 11 wells for Phase I of the full field development project, which is expected to increase net production to 165 million cubic feet per day following startup in 2017. At the Stampede development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, the hull left the manufacturing yard in South Korea on schedule. Fabrication and precommissioning of the topsides continue according to plan, and drilling operations continue to progress. First oil remains on schedule for 2018. In closing, while the second quarter has been challenging as a result of continued low oil prices and short-term production issues, we remain confident in our resilient portfolio and strong long-term growth outlook, which includes our offshore development projects at North Malay Basin and Stampede, our premier positions in the Bakken and Utica, our high margin chalk reservoir positions at Valhall and South Arne, and our position in Guyana, which represents a world-class opportunity. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2016. The corporation incurred a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared with a net loss of $509 million in the first quarter. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $335 million in the second quarter of 2016. Turning to exploration and production, on an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $271 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $451 million in the first quarter of 2016. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the second quarter and the first quarter of 2016 were as follows. Higher realized selling prices improved results by $155 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $31 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $36 million. Lower production expenses improved results by $9 million. Lower exploration expenses improved results by $8 million. All other items improved results by $3 million for an overall decrease in the second quarter net loss of $180 million. In the second quarter, our E&P operations were over lifted compared with production by approximately 1.7 million barrels, which had the effect of decreasing our second quarter net loss by approximately $5 million. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 47% in the second quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 41% in the first quarter. Turning to Bakken Midstream, second quarter net income of $11 million decreased from $14 million in the first quarter, primarily due to higher DD&A and interest expense. EBITDA for the Bakken Midstream, excluding the non-controlling interest, amounted to $68 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $70 million in the first quarter. Turning to corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $75 million in the second quarter of 2016 compared to $72 million in the first quarter. The increase resulted from higher professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses. Turning to cash flow for the second quarter, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $257 million. The net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $60 million. Additions to property, plant, and equipment were $615 million. Proceeds from asset sales were $80 million. Net debt repayments were $43 million. Common and preferred dividends paid were $89 million. All other items resulted in an increase in cash of $8 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $462 million. Excluding the Bakken Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.1 billion, total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities of $7.7 billion, and total debt of $5.9 billion at June 30, 2016. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio excluding the Bakken Midstream was 23.5%. Now to provide additional third-quarter and full-year 2016 guidance, first for exploration and production. We project cash costs for E&P operations to be in the range of $16 to $17 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $16 to $17 per barrel for the full year of 2016, which is up from previous guidance of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel. The increase in full-year guidance is due to workovers required at Tubular Bells and Conger and the impact of fixed costs spread over lower production volumes. DD&A per barrel is forecast to be $28 to $29 per barrel in the third quarter and $27 to $28 per barrel for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel. The decrease in full-year guidance is due to the change in the mix of production. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $44 to $46 per barrel in the third quarter of 2016 and $43 to $45 per barrel for the full year. The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $4.10 to $4.20 per barrel for the third quarter of 2016 and $3.80 to $4 per barrel for the full year of 2016 versus prior guidance of $3.55 to $3.95 per barrel, reflecting lower total production volumes. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million in the third quarter and $260 million to $280 million for the full year, consistent with previous guidance. The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 42% to 46% for the third quarter and 41% to 45% for the full year of 2016, consistent with previous guidance. For Bakken Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the third quarter and $40 million to $50 million for the full year of 2016, consistent with previous guidance. Turning to corporate, we expect corporate expenses net of taxes to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the third quarter of 2016 and $100 million to $110 million for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $110 million to $120 million. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million for the third quarter of 2016, and $195 million to $205 million for the full year of 2016, which is down from previous guidance of $205 million to $215 million. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning everybody. Greg, I wonder if I could touch on the issues in the Gulf of Mexico? Obviously, when you gave guidance at the end of the first quarter, some of these issues were already known, so I'm just trying to understand how much of the incremental problems occurred post the first quarter. And if possible, can you speak to the production capacity in the Gulf going into next year? Is that impacted in any way or is the capacity basically \u2013 what would you expect the (30:44) capacity to recover to, I guess is what I'm trying to find out? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Okay. Thanks, Doug. Yeah. As we kind of said in our opening remarks now, we've had three subsurface safety valve failures in Tubular Bells. The second valve affected us in the second quarter and the third valve is going to affect us in the third quarter. And in addition to that, we had a mechanical failure at Conger that was unanticipated as well. So the net effect of that, if we look at kind of guidance for those assets, is about 15,000 barrels a day difference lowering of our guidance, and about 10,000 of that is at Tubular Bells and about 5,000 of that is at Conger. So, if we look at capacity going into the end of the year, we should be back up to that 70,000 to 75,000 barrels a day range in the Gulf of Mexico. So if you look \u2013 so again, going back to the guidance, it was actually about 15,000 on T-Bells and 5,000 on Conger. I said 10 and 5. It's actually 15,000 and 5,000. So that gives you a sense for how big the magnitude was of those two issues in the Gulf. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So the capacity really isn't \u2013 all things beyond the mechanical issues, the capacity shouldn't be impacted, got it. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : No. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Greg, just a quick follow-on to that, can you speak to the nature of any \u2013 what you would expect by way of compensation there? I mean is this a \u2013 do you have insurance losses or how does it work exactly? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Well, we're going \u2013 we've got our legal claims as we speak, and we're going to be going for the cost of the replacement valve. We're going to go for the cost of the remediation work and also lost profits due to downtime and finally attorney's fees. So we are going after it all. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. My follow-up, if I may, as you can imagine, is in Guyana. Realizing you're not the operator, to the extent you can, can you outline what your expectations are for Skipjack as it relates to the risk profile post-Liza? Is Skipjack a ranked wildcat? Has it been de-risked in some way? And any color you can offer in terms of your expectations now that you're there? Thanks. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, thanks, Doug. I mean clearly, we are extremely excited about the results at Liza again confirming a recoverable resource of between 800 million and 1.4 billion barrels. The well test at Liza was high quality, very good, confirmed the presence of high quality oil that we saw in Liza-1. We saw about 190 feet of oil-bearing sandstone in the Upper Cretaceous. And remember that the Liza-2 well was only 2 miles from the Liza-1 well. So all that taken in context means that the POSG of Skipjack has gone up substantially. So we're excited about it, and certainly the seismic signature looks very similar to the one on Liza, so but until we get a well in the ground we can't be 100% positive as to the outcome, but very encouraging, very excited. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Timing Greg, early September? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, we should have the result. I think we said in our remarks we should have the results of the well by our next quarterly conference call. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. All right. I'll leave it there. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: You mentioned in your comments that the call on capital for Guyana for 2017 is expected to be manageable. Can you talk more on how you expect to finance that, whether it would just be reflected in offsetting decreases in CapEx as other projects come online? Whether it would be debt to near liquidity, asset sales, or whether you would consider additional equity and if you have any sense of what you think that capital commitment might be next year? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure, Brian. And I mean, as John mentioned, we do see this as being manageable at this point. Our current judgment is that the future spend will fit nicely in our portfolio as our major project spending and obligations on North Malay Basin and Stampede will be falling off over the next couple of years. And so by 2018 North Malay Basin and Stampede will have flipped from material cash users, as John said earlier, approximately $700 million this year, to cash generators. So just with the normal phasing with any development we see, this fits nicely in 2017 and then with more of the spending happening 2018 and beyond. And as we look at our portfolio at the capital for Guyana, and like you said, there are other capital that will be falling off in 2017, such as like in the Gulf of Mexico and some of the capital we had spent in Denmark this year. So it does fit nicely into 2017 and we project from our strong cash position that we can fund our capital, including our growth projects, through 2017, even in this low price environment with the current cash on hand. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Thank you. And then on the revisions to your guidance, can you talk about the impact in more \u2013 and be more specific \u2013 in some greater specificity on the deferred activity? How much of that was responsible for the decrease in the capital budget versus cost savings? And where is that all \u2013 where is that all coming from? The same question as it relates to the production drop, although I may have pieced together it's 5,000 BOE a day based on earlier comments. John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So from just the $300 million that we've reduced our 2016 capital program, the majority of that reduction is due to cost reductions. Obviously, in this low price environment, we're day-in and day-out looking at cost reductions on the capital side and the operating side as well. So it really is across the whole portfolio. It's not like there's a big chunk in any individual area, so it's in exploration, it's in production, and it's in development. We have some deferred activity that we're just looking at from the price environment slipping out to 2017 as prices improve, but the majority is cost reductions. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks. And was there an impact on the production guidance from that as well or was it all coming from the Gulf of Mexico issues? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : It's minor on the production from the capital reductions. Obviously, we could put capital to work because we have great locations here in the Bakken to put capital to work at these prices, but it's not what we're going to do. We're emphasizing value over volumes, and we won't ramp up until prices really get close to $60, because we think that's a better economic decision. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And that's despite the number \u2013 despite the increase in stages in the Bakken, despite the enhanced stage count there? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Correct. We just don't think it makes sense to accelerate that production right now, because you know, in the wells, in the first year of the well, it declines 70% in these unconventional reservoirs. So, again, we'd like to see higher prices before we bring on this good core of the core Bakken acreage. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : I think those 50 stages really bode well though for the resumption of activity because, again, IP rates have gone up 15% to 20% and EURs are up 7%. So that will bode extremely well for ramp-up in activity. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Two unrelated questions, the Upstream magazine I think has reported that Skipjack has an even larger aerial extent than Liza. Maybe if you can sort of comment a little bit about Skipjack relative to Liza on a predrilled basis? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Ed, you'll have to talk to the operator about that. I will tell you that, on seismic, it looks very similar. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then on the Bakken, Schlumberger were talking last week about how much the industry is going to have to give back as a share of their cash flow to the service companies, as well as obviously put rigs back to work to get U.S. production to grow. Obviously that's a bit of a pitch from them. But how much risk do you think there is over time to your $4.8 million well costs in the Bakken as you go forward? Have you done any sensitivities to inflation levels? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I think Ed \u2013 I think, as we've said before, obviously there could be some minor friction costs associated with a startup, but we've done a lot to try and preserve our lean manufacturing capability, particularly on the rig crews, by doubling up and tripling up so that we can really manage a smooth transition in a ramp-up. And then our belief is that, with our lean manufacturing gains continuing, that any friction costs we'll be able to cover just as we have in the past with using our lean manufacturing techniques. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And then on the pressure pumping side with the attrition you're seeing in the fleet over time, say, not an issue for next year or the year after, but as you get into maybe 2018, I mean, how much would that add do you think, if you went back to normal margins? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. I think it's just too early to tell. I think there's going to be a lot of factors that drive those numbers, how much equipment is no longer available for service, how rapid is the ramp-up in the industry? There's a lot of moving pieces there that will determine how much that will ultimately be. But again, I think with lean manufacturing our aim and our goal is to cover as much of that as possible by using those techniques. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): And finally \u2013 this may go back to the operator again, but what's the constraint on perhaps adding a rig in Guyana, because obviously exploration takes time, and rightfully so. But from an equity perspective, there's a lot of shale activity going on at the same time in other basins, so speed is something that investors sometimes want. So maybe just talk through the constraints. Is it geological or cash flow or other things in terms of adding a rig? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : No, I think we're in active conversations with the operator on the rig levels, both for next year for appraisal and development and all those things that we want to do and additional exploration. We're actively in conversations with the operator about that as we speak. And while next year's program still needs to be finalized, the focus definitely will be on exploration activities on the block as well as the predevelopment work, working with the partners and the government to move forward expeditiously on a commercialization decision on Liza. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Thanks, guys. Actually E got my question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Asit Sen of CLSA. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Good morning. So two questions, first on cost deflation and second a quick one on Bakken. On cost deflation, Greg or John, given your involvement in both short-cycle shale and the new upcoming long-cycle deepwater projects, I just wanted to get your sense of what you are seeing in terms of cost deflation or your visibility, given recent comments by the oil service majors. So that's number one. And what percent of your CapEx \u2013 I would imagine most of it over the next 12 months to 18 months is committed? And second on Bakken, Greg, could you remind us, how many rigs do you need to keep production flat? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sure. So to hold production flat at broadly 100,000 barrels a day, we've said that we need four rigs to do that. Now, with the 15% to 20% uplift, the 50-stage fracks, it's probably somewhere between 300,000 and 400,000, as a result of that uplift. Regarding the cost reductions, I think obviously in the onshore, I think that's largely flattened out, so I think further cost reductions there will be minimal. The ones that we are accomplishing are due to lean manufacturing, which is continuing to chop out waste and inefficiency and all those things. And I want to really comment on that because if you think about our performance of delivering a $4.8 million well, a substantial reduction from the prior year and the prior quarter, that was while also increasing the stage count from 35 to 50. So that's a major performance improvement, and all of that was lean manufacturing. So I think that we'll continue in our operation to drive those costs down, because we know that there's even more efficiencies in spud-to-spud. And so we're going after those in earnest. In the offshore, I think there have definitely been some major price reductions, so rigs, boats, and all the associated equipment is down substantially. We're already seeing some of those benefits in Guyana, for example, on the rig rates and seismic boat rates and all that. And then the last kind of penny to drop I think is really the yards in Southeast Asia. So if you look at their capacity loading, it's going to drop substantially over the next 12 months. And I think that will open up another cost reduction opportunity. So for us, Guyana is coming almost at just the right time because you'll have low costs not only in drilling, but also in development if we sanction a project there for the development project as well. Asit Sen - CLSA Americas LLC : Very helpful. Thanks Greg. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. good morning. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Good morning. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Greg, just curious that, have you guys got the process talking to your vendor and trying to extend the contract period and lock in some of the very cheap service cost today, or do you think you have time to wait? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : No. I think, Paul, we're beginning those conversations. As John mentioned, as prices approach $60, we all wonder when that will be, but as prices approach $60, we want to be ready for that ramp-up. So we're starting the conversations now with certainly our vendors in the onshore. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Are you going to, say, wait until that you see $55 plus before you sign those contracts or do you think you're going to sign those contracts relatively soon? John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: As we make those decisions Paul, we'll keep you informed. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. On the Tubular Bells, can you tell us that who is the vendor? And also that have you already gone through a detailed inventory track on everything that they have provided you to see if there's additional issues? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yes, we have, and the vendor is Schlumberger. Obviously it's extremely disappointing. It relates to some quality control and some of the components in the valves. And as I mentioned from the previous question, we are going to go after the cost of the replacement belts, the cost of the remediation work, lost profits due to downtime and all the attorney's fees. It's very disappointing. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And is Schlumberger also providing those safety valves for Stampede? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yes, but they've been upgraded. We've gone through those valves and they've been upgraded and the quality control problems have been fixed as far as we can tell. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And the next one is for John Rielly. John, the second quarter your cash flow from operations annual run rate is about $1 billion, and that's about $46 oil price. Is that a reasonable normal run rate given the pricing environment, or this is some positive or negative one-off adjustment that we need to make related to that run rate? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So for the run rate at that price from cash flow from operations only, the only adjustments that you would make, and that is we've had the additional remediation costs at Tubular Bells, so for that production, obviously affected by the shutdowns in the quarter, and then the additional cost for Tubular Bells remediation in the quarter, so you're in that $30 million to $40 million type range on that adjustment. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And either for Greg or John, talking about Liza, I know it's early stage, any kind of rough preliminary estimate what oil prices you need in order to generate a 15% internal rate of return for that project? And how is that comparing to the Conger discovery that you made? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : So it's early and I think this is the type of information that the operator will be giving out. So what are the benefits of Liza, let's just say, because we always want to make sure we talk about the difference of Guyana, and Liza in general, versus let's say offshore Gulf of Mexico Paleogene. So in offshore Guyana these wells are only 13,000 feet below the mud line, so 18,000 total depth. So the depth is much \u2013 is shorter than obviously the Gulf of Mexico so drilling wells will be cheaper. The reservoir is quite good, so we should get good flow rates out of Guyana for that. There is no salt cover, which one helps with imaging, as we were talking about the Skipjack prospect, but again takes casing strings out while we're drilling wells. So, again, that makes it better. And then the other thing from a \u2013 I can't talk about the particulars, but it is a PSC. So you get benefit obviously at lower prices with higher cost recovery. So putting all those together makes Guyana \u2013 I'm going to say completely different than the Gulf of Mexico and therefore in lower price environments Guyana competes. So I think beyond that you'll have to talk to the operator, and as we get to FID and Exxon puts out that costs and numbers like that, as when FID happens, you can get a better feel for those economics. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Can you give us a rough idea that what's the timeline when you decide whether you go for the early production system, or that \u2013 I mean, is there any timeline we should be watching? John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Obviously, Paul, as we mentioned before, predevelopment work is under way, so obviously it's underway because we and our partners and the government are encouraged that we have the type of information that we could move forward on a commercialization decision on Liza. And when we do, we will keep you informed. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. A final one, Greg, you haven't mentioned anything about Ghana and in terms of the discovery and that negotiation with the government. Any update there? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sorry, my mic was off. As we've said before, we're really unable to proceed with the development of this license until there's a resolution of the border dispute. So we're continuing feed. We're continuing all the project work, and we're also in discussions with the government to modify the license deadlines with respect to the border dispute. And then once that situation is resolved, we'll be in the position to make an informed decision on where we go next. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And in Liza, that broad \u2013 when the exploration period will expire? John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's mid-2018 for the exploration period. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: 2018? Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. Maybe a question on asset sales at this point. I mean, do you see a role for asset sales in helping to manage capital requirements over the next couple of years? Anything in the portfolio that you would see as potentially non-core at this point? And maybe part of that are you happy with your existing working interest at Guyana, or would you consider farming that down at some point? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah. Our first priority is to preserve the strength of our balance sheet and to fund the growth opportunities that we talked about. In that respect, we are really well-positioned with $3.1 billion of cash at the end of the second quarter. In the normal course of business, we're always looking to optimize our portfolio, be it selling assets, buying assets, but any of those opportunities would need to compete for capital against our existing attractive growth options, including the Bakken, Utica, North Malay Basin, Stampede, and obviously Guyana. So from an M&A perspective, buying or selling, it's lower on the priority list because of the cash position we have and the growth we've already captured. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then maybe slightly related to that, your decision to \u2013 your decision on Sicily, I mean, is that just a reflection of allocation of scarce capital? Is it in line with your previous comments that you were talking about Guyana versus Gulf of Mexico development, or is there something about the asset that wasn't particularly attractive? And did you \u2013 was there an effort made to sell the position or are you just withdrawing from the position? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : So first of all, I think it was \u2013 it's a combination of factors, so it's the current price environment, the limited time remaining on the leases, and as you have intimated, we've got some great growth prospects in our portfolio. So as we kind of looked at Sicily in the context of our existing portfolio, we said, you know, it's going to struggle to compete for capital against all the great opportunities we have. So that's when we made the decision, even though we found hydrocarbons there and there's a lot of oil in place there, we made the decision to say, no, it's not going to compete in our portfolio, so we are not going to elect to do any more work on the block. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And did you try to sell that position or was it just an exit? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : No, it'll just be an exit. Yeah. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, guys. Thank you. You've covered a lot of ground here. One thing that intrigues me about Hess is the way your tax rate will essentially benefit you if prices rise. Can you talk a little bit about that? I think it's an important part of the bull case for Hess. Thank you. John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : You are absolutely right, Paul. So in the U.S. and in Norway, we've said we will not be paying cash taxes for the next five years because of the investments we've made in both of those countries. And quite frankly, with the way prices have been here recently, it's going to extend beyond five years. So we will benefit from that from a cash flow standpoint ,and we'll get that uplift. And it's part of the thing that we talk about, that like $1 right now is approximately $70 million of cash flow for us, or $10 obviously being $700 million. If you were looking at that from a results standpoint that would only be in the $45, $50 type range, the difference being the tax benefit and essentially that cash benefit that we have. So we will get that uplift when prices improve and we go back to drilling. And so from additional volumes and the cash flow that comes in, we'll get, if you want to say, increase because of the cash tax position that we're in. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Understood. And I know you've totally changed the subject to one you've talked a lot about already, but the Guyana situation is I think the press release especially coming from ExxonMobil is one of the most \u2013 biggest I've ever seen in terms of the use of the word world-class and the range of the prospect. Can you just talk a bit more about really how you see yourselves in terms of whether this is to let's say to throw up yet another potential development of a similar scale to Liza or another? Would you be looking to reduce your position or do you really want to run this one through and stay with the fact that you've got a world-class operator in such a material stake? I'm just struggling sort of to get my arms around the scale and how the scale relates to Hess and whether you can help us with \u2013 whether if it was within its current range, you would want to stay fully invested at the current level or if there's some sort of trigger point, just to help us out. Thank you. John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We're very comfortable staying at the current level, Paul. Obviously, this will take time to unfold as evaluation work and predevelopment work is done. We think the block has extraordinary potential, and that will be very good for our shareholders. And the work that we're doing we see it phased over time, so we see our ability to fund it to be manageable. We talked about next year and then John talked about the years after that. So with the visibility that we see so far, we should be fine from a funding perspective, as well as the fact that this is probably one of the best uses of our capital, so we will want to stay in. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. I understand that. Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. You touched on this briefly, but can you add any color regarding Aker BP operating Valhall once the merger is complete? I mean, is there some anticipation that this might prove superior to BP's operatorship in some way? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yeah, I think it's \u2013 I think it's early to say actually. John and I met with the senior leadership of Aker BP and I will say that we left very encouraged. They have a culture similar to ours, meaning an independent, and they like to get after stuff and they're innovative. And in particular, they're practitioners of lean. And as you know, supplying lean on Valhall through BP has led to a substantial reduction in abandonment costs, well abandonment costs, by up to 50% as a result of applying lean, and then drilling costs for new wells on the order of 30% with much more to come. So we're excited about having another partner in this venture that also is a lean practitioner. We think there will be a lot of power in that in really driving down the cost and delivering value from Valhall. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. As you move towards commercialization of Liza, do you anticipate any special issues, bearing in mind that oil infrastructure development at Guyana is essentially going to be starting from scratch? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : No. None that you wouldn't have anywhere else. I mean, the oil will most likely be tankered so I don't foresee any issues there. And certainly things will be built probably in other parts of the world to get started. And so I don't think there's any particular concerns about Guyana. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. And my last question is you've touched on it broadly. Your JV partner identified two completions and five timelines in Utica in the second quarter. And since your remarks even today suggest that the Bakken should generally attract capital before the Utica, can you add a little color as to how Utica attracted activity in the quarter? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yes. I think we had some wells that we completed in the quarter, so we brought \u2013 we completed two, and we bought five wells online in the second quarter. And that essentially completes the activity that we plan to do in the Utica this year. I always like to remind people, our Utica position is unique because it is in the core of the core, it is held by production, and it only has 5% royalty. So because of that, that really delivers superior economics even at low prices relative to the people around us. So just like the Bakken, as prices approach $60 and we see some margin improvement unique to the liquids in kind of the environment in the Utica, we would expect to get back to work in the Utica as well as the Bakken as we approach those numbers. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Guy Baber of Simmons. Your line is now open. Guy A. Baber IV - Simmons & Company: Thanks for taking my question. Just as a follow-up to the last question, you mentioned the resumption of drilling at the Utica and offshore at a sustained higher price. Can you talk a little bit more about what price you need to see? I think you mentioned $60 sustainably before, but how you would look to deploy capital and where you would go first and what the order looks like? But it sounds as if Utica would be ahead of Gulf of Mexico infill drilling or other offshore infill drilling opportunities. Is that a fair comment? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : No, I think it \u2013 we'll evaluate it as the situation unfolds. I think the point is we've got an awful lot of profitable development opportunities in our portfolio, and how those shake out as prices improve, we'll answer that at that moment in time. It's going to be a function of rig rates and supply costs and all those things that go into economic decisions. But I think the point is that outside of the Bakken, we have exceptional opportunities to grow this business, not only in the Utica but also in our offshore assets, be it the Gulf of Mexico or the chalk assets in the North Sea. So as John said in his opening remarks, I do think we have an exceptional growth portfolio that can deliver outstanding growth as a function of price. Guy A. Baber IV - Simmons & Company: Okay, great. And then I had two follow-ups on capital spending. You mentioned there were efforts underway to make further reductions to the $2.1 billion budget. Is there anything specific that you would call out, or is it just the continued application of lean manufacturing? And then secondly, as we think about the capital spending profile over the next couple of years, is it a fair characterization that you all are comfortable with CapEx above and beyond your cash inflows to a certain extent, just given the strength of the balance sheet and the strength of your growth projects? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So from the further capital reductions it is just continuing lean across our whole portfolio and organization just to drive out costs. So it's an ongoing kind of culture that we have to continue to drive down the cost. So that's really what that would be from a cost standpoint. As far as capital goes, it's early right now, so what we are talking about here is what we've been doing in 2016. And it's still early for us. And we'll give further updates here as we get into early 2017, especially on Guyana, because that will be a part of the growth capital that now gets added in. So what we'll be doing, we will be spending in Guyana, for all those reasons that we've talked about today on the returns that we believe we see in Guyana, so we'll be spending there. We'll be finishing North Malay Basin, and we'll be finishing Stampede to bring on that 35,000 barrels a day in 2018. So along with that, depending on where we see price moving to, if we don't see it moving more to $55, $60, you'll see more of the same of what we're doing in our portfolio right now. As prices move up, then we're going to start going back to those opportunities that Greg just talked about that we see across the portfolio. Guy A. Baber IV - Simmons & Company: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Your line is now open. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Yes. Thank you. Most things have been asked, so I'll be brief. With the Bakken, with these 50-stage frack wells, how much sand and floats (65:29) are you putting down, Greg? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Sorry, my mic was off again. Per-stage proppant loadings, it ranges to where you are in the field. We really do it DSU by DSU, but on the order of 80,000 to 100,000 depending on where you are in the field. So that's kind of the proppant loading per stage. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And not to beat Liza into the ground, for your predevelopment activities, could you better characterize what they are, because I don't think people fully understand it? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : In Guyana you mean? Well, I think it's just the usual... John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Yes right. Exactly. Are you arranging marine transportation? Are you looking at yards? What's the predevelopment activity right now? Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Well, I think it's the usual pre-project, concept select, trying to figure out which concept you're going to have, potentially how many wells you're going to drill, how many producers, how many injectors, et cetera, et cetera. So that's all the predevelopment work that's going on. John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. Gregory P. Hill - President & Chief Operating Officer : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Two questions, the first one back to the approaching $60 number you mentioned. About a month ago, the 12-month strip for WTI was actually in the mid-50s. When you saw that, did you think maybe not take the extra rig off, going from three to two in August as you're currently planning? Was that ever under consideration? John B. Hess - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Look, we always look at different options to maximize value for our shareholders. But having said that, no, our commitment was to go down to two rigs to preserve cash, but also we think it's about value not volumes. And we really, at the end of the day, while you always think about making midcourse adjustments to maximize value, the decision was and it still is to go to two rigs. And then as prices start to improve, as the market rebalances, and I think the market is in the process of rebalancing because non-OPEC production is down, offset by OPEC production, but you're still growing demand in the world over 1 million to 1.5 million barrels a day, somewhere in that range, inventory draws are going to happen, probably accelerate in the fourth quarter. And with that we see that positive to prices starting to recover and going up. So as we get closer to $60, that's when we'll start putting plans in place to start to go up in our rig count in the Bakken. And we're sticking to that. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then second question about the Bakken MLP. So this year \u2013 or this month marks the one-year anniversary of your deal with Global Infrastructure Partners. Is it safe to say that you're going to want to stabilize your Bakken volumes before you move forward with the IPO? Is that part of the prerequisite to getting that done? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So the way that we are looking at it right now, we are committed to doing the IPO. And so it is part of our plans to do that, us and our partner GIP, but it is when market conditions warrant. And so one is the MLP market itself, which has improved, but we will continue to watch that. And then it's exactly as you just said, Pavel. As from the oil price standpoint, to get the prices up, for us to put more rigs back to work and in this great position that we have in the Bakken, that's when we start to see that. And that growth combined with any improvements in the MLP market is when we would be looking at timing of that. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Appreciate, it guys. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram, of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Good morning. Arun Jayaram from JPM. Just a quick question on Tubular Bells. You guided to 10 for the year. Could you give us a sense of what you expect the exit rate to be at Tubular Bells once the remediation activities are completed, plus what the fifth well will do in terms of deliverability as we think about 2017? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Okay. So we'll give guidance here as we get into early 2017 on Tubular Bells and say where this next well is. But let me just give you general of where we are right now. So with the current wells and wells fee off, we're approximately around 15,000 barrels a day here producing at Tubular Bells. There will be a shutdown in the third quarter at T-Bells, and then we are not going to remediate this well C, which is approximately 5,000 barrels a day net to us in the fourth quarter. So just with that well you're getting to the 20,000 or a little above when we have the wells together. Then with this next producer we'll come on and we'll give you information, because we're not \u2013 I'm not sure exactly when that's going to come on at this point right now. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's fair enough. And just a quick follow-up, is the $300 million or so of capital that you took out of this year's budget where did that come from? John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I was saying this earlier. So we did \u2013 it's basically the majority is cost reductions and it is literally across our portfolio. So there's not one significant item. It's in exploration, it's in production, and it's in development. So, again, the majority from that with some deferral of activity as well, so there's really no big names or big assets that I could point you to from that. It's just continuing to drive down costs across the portfolio. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. John P. Rielly - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Sure. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International Operator : Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2016 Hess Corporation Conference Call. My name is Nicole and I'll I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. On this morning's call, John Hess will make some high-level comments on the quarter and the progress we are making in executing our strategy. Greg Hill will then review our operations and John Rielly will discuss our financial results. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Our company has made important progress in maintaining a strong balance sheet and keeping a tight control on our spending, while continuing to invest in future growth, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders. Over the course of 2016, we have materially reduced our spending in response to this lower for longer oil price environment. We now project our full year 2016 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures to be approximately $2 billion, down $100 million from our previous forecast and more than 50% below 2015. In addition, this month, we will complete a $1.5 billion refinancing of higher coupon debt, extending our average maturities and lowering our average coupon rate. This transaction further strengthens our balance sheet and liquidity position and defers any significant debt maturities until 2027. While we have reduced investment across our producing portfolio, we believe it is very important to continue to fund our growth projects in the Gulf of Thailand, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Guyana. With regard to Guyana, we are very encouraged about the significant resource potential on the 6.6 million acres Stabroek block. The Liza-3 well was successful, encountering approximately 200 feet of net oil pay and the same high-quality reservoir encountered in the Liza-1 and Liza-2 wells. This result further confirms that Liza is a world-class resource and one of the industry's largest oil discoveries in the last 10 years. With this information, we now expect estimated recoverable resources for Liza to be at the upper end of the previously announced range of 800 million barrels of oil equivalent and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Pre-development planning is underway and we expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017. We believe Liza will offer very attractive economics at current oil prices. In addition, we are in the early stages of evaluating the exploration potential on the Stabroek block. The drilling rig will next move to the Payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northeast from Liza, with results from this exploration well expected by the time of our next conference call. With regard to our two other offshore developments, North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand and Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, are on track to come online in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Together, they will add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and transition from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company. Turning to our financial results. In the third quarter of 2016, we posted a net loss of $339 million. On an adjusted basis, the net loss was $340 million or $1.12 per common share compared to an adjusted net loss of $291 million or $1.03 per common share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas sales volumes and selling prices, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower operating costs and DD&A. Net production was 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the upper end of our guidance range for the quarter, while net production from the Bakken exceeded our guidance, averaging 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. Our Bakken team continues to deliver excellent operating results and returns in the core of the play, that are competitive with the Permian and Eagle Ford. In the third quarter, drilling and completion costs averaged $4.7 million per well, 11% below the year-ago quarter, even as we transitioned from a 35-stage to a 50-stage completion design. Our high-quality Bakken acreage, industry-leading drilling and completion costs and advantaged infrastructure position our Bakken asset to be a major contributor to the company's future production and cash flow growth. With the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making initial preparations to increase our drilling activity in the play next year. We will provide 2017 guidance. including capital and exploratory expenditures, as usual in January. In summary, our company remains well positioned for the current low oil price environment and for a recovery in oil prices. We have one of the strongest balance sheets and long-term growth outlooks among our peers, which we believe will deliver profitable growth and improving returns for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Greg. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an operational update and review our progress in executing our strategy. In the third quarter of 2016, we delivered strong operating performance and advanced our offshore developments and exploration activities. Starting with production, in the third quarter, we averaged 314,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the upper end of our guidance range of 310,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong performance across our producing assets. As a result, we reconfirm our full-year 2016 production guidance of 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. Turning to the Bakken, in the third quarter, production averaged 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter and 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. We drilled 21 wells and brought 22 wells online in the third quarter. For 2016, we now expect to drill approximately 70 wells and bring 100 wells online. This compares to last year, when we drilled 182 wells and brought 219 wells online. We currently have two rigs operating in the play. But as John mentioned, given the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making preparations to ramp up activity levels next year as prices recover. In the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken production to average between 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting fewer new wells being brought online. For the full year 2016, we expect Bakken production to be approximately 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Over the third quarter, we continued to optimize our completions from our current 50-stage design by successfully completing 53-stage and 57-stage wells and we are trialing a 60-stage well this quarter. Even with these higher stage count trials, we still reduced our average drilling and completion costs in the third quarter to $4.7 million per well. We expect the 50-stage completion design to yield a 7% uplift in EUR per well in the core of the play. Wells bought online in the third quarter are expected to deliver gross EUR per well of approximately 830,000 barrels of oil equivalent and we anticipate this will approach 1 million barrels of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, average 30-day IP rates from our Middle Bakken wells increased to 899 barrels of oil per day from 811 barrels of oil per day in the second quarter and we expect to see a further increase in the fourth quarter. Moving to the Utica, net production for the third quarter held at 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter and 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016. Now, turning to offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 61,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter compared to 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016. At the Conger field, in which Hess has a 37.5% working interest and is operator, we started a work-over to remediate a mechanical failure as announced in our second quarter call and anticipate the well returning to production in the first quarter of 2017. At our Tubular Bells field, in which Hess holds a 57.1% working interest and is operator, we will commence water injection this quarter and are currently completing a fifth producer that we anticipate bringing online in the first quarter of 2017. We will also replace a third defective sub-surface valve in the fourth quarter and expect to have the well back online in the first quarter of 2017. As with other fields in the Mississippi Canyon area, Tubular Bells was also shut in for five days as a precaution for hurricane activity. In Norway, the Aker BP-operated Valhall field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, continues to perform strongly with net production of 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on average in the third quarter compared to 19,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter of 2016 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year-ago quarter. At the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% interest, the booster compression compressor tie-in was successfully completed during a planned shutdown. Net production averaged 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the last year's third quarter, reflecting downtime associated with the compression tie-in and reduced entitlement. In the fourth quarter, we expect net production to be back above 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moving to developments, at the North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess has a 50% working interest and is operator, we completed the installation of the topsides at three remote wellhead platforms which are part of the full field development project. We also completed the drilling of three development wells. The project is on schedule for completion in the third quarter of 2017, after which net production is expected to ramp up steadily to 165 million cubic feet per day. At the Stampede development project in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully lifted and set the topsides deck on the haul. All major lifts are now complete, drilling operations continue to progress and first oil remains on schedule for 2018. I'd now like to move to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the 6.6 million acre Stabroek block. On September 5, the operator ExxonMobil spud the Liza 3 well, located approximately 2.7 miles from the Liza-1 discovery well. Liza-3 was drilled in 600,000 feet of water and reached a TD of approximately 18,100 feet. The well encountered approximately 200 feet of net oil pay in the same high-quality reservoir encountered during other Liza wells. This reservoir sequence is also confirmed to have a common pressure regime with that of the equivalent reservoir interval found in both Liza-1 and Liza-2. Based on the positive Liza-3 results, we now expect estimated recoverable resources for Liza alone via the upper end of ExxonMobil's previously announced range of 0.8 billion barrels and 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The operator then plans to drill an exploration well at the Payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northeast from Liza with results expected by late January. In parallel, we continue to progress predevelopment activities at Liza and expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017. We remain excited not only by Liza, which is world-class in its own right, but also by the significant further exploration potential of the very large Stabroek block, which as a reminder, is the equivalent of approximately 1,150 Gulf of Mexico blocks. In closing, I'm very pleased with our team who once again have delivered strong operational performance, relentless continuous improvement and some key milestones and results which we believe in combination will deliver one of the most exciting growth profiles among our large cap E&P peers over the next decade and beyond. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2016. The Corporation incurred a net loss of $339 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $392 million in the second quarter. Excluding items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods, our adjusted net loss was $340 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared with an adjusted net loss of $335 million in the second quarter. Turning to E&P, on an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $285 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $271 million in the second quarter of 2016. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the third quarter and the second quarter of 2016 were as follows : Higher realized selling prices improved results by $3 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $33 million. Lower exploration expenses improved results by $26 million. All other items reduced results by $10 million for an overall increase in third quarter net loss of $14 million. In the third quarter, our E&P sales volumes were the same as production volumes, and therefore the timing of lifting had no impact on our financial results. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 41% in the third quarter of 2016 compared with a benefit of 47% in the second quarter. Turning to Bakken Midstream, third quarter net income of $13 million increased from $11 million in the second quarter, primarily due to lower operating cost and interest expense. EBITDA for the Bakken Midstream, before the non-controlling interest, amounted to $73 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $68 million in the second quarter. Turning to corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $118 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $75 million in the second quarter. The third quarter results include an after-tax charge of $50 million for the premium paid to purchase 65% of our notes due in 2019. Turning to cash flow for the third quarter, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $309 million. The net increase in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $23 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $529 million. Net borrowings were $731 million. Common and preferred dividends paid were $91 million. All other items resulted in a decrease in cash of $9 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $434 million. Turning to cash and liquidity. Excluding the Bakken Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 billion, total liquidity of $8.2 billion including available committed credit facilities and total debt of $6.7 billion at September 30, 2016. The increase in debt during the quarter was attributable to the partial completion of a refinancing transaction launched in September to improve the company's liquidity position by purchasing higher coupon bonds, redeeming near-term maturities and lowering go-forward interest expense. To accomplish the refinancing, the Corporation issued in September $1 billion of 4.3% notes due in 2027 and $500 million of 5.8% notes due in 2047. The company used $750 million during the third quarter to retire 8.125% notes with a carrying value of $670 million due in 2019. In October, the company will use $625 million to redeem $300 million of notes due in 2017 and to retire notes with a carrying value of $259 million due in 2029 and 2031. As a result of this refinancing, we have no significant debt maturities until 2027. Pro forma for the notes purchased are redeemed in October and excluding the Bakken Midstream, our cash and cash equivalents were $2.9 billion and total debt was $6.1 billion at September 30, 2016. Our pro forma debt to capitalization ratio was 24.5%. Now turning to guidance. Starting with E&P. Cash cost per E&P operations are projected to be in the range of $17.50 to $18.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter, which includes approximately $2 per barrel for planned work-over activity to replace defective subsurface valves at the Conger and Tubular Bells fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Full year cash costs are projected to be in the range of $16 per barrel to $16.50 per barrel which compares to previous full-year guidance of $16 per barrel to $17 per barrel. DD&A per barrel is forecast to be $26 per barrel to $27 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $26.50 per barrel to $27 per barrel for the full year which is down from previous full-year guidance of $27 per barrel to $28 per barrel. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $43.50 per barrel to $45.50 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $42.50 per barrel to $43.50 per barrel for the full year, which is down from previous full-year guidance of $43 per barrel to $45 per barrel. The Bakken Midstream tariff expense is expected to be $4.20 per barrel to $4.30 per barrel for the fourth quarter and $3.85 per barrel to $3.95 per barrel for the full year, consistent with previous guidance of $3.80 per barrel to $4 per barrel. Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million in the fourth quarter and $250 million to $260 million for the full year, which is down from previous full year guidance of $260 million to $280 million. The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be a deferred tax benefit in the range of 36% to 40% for the fourth quarter and 40% to 44% for the full year of 2016, which compares to previous full year guidance of 41% to 45%. Turning to Bakken Midstream, we estimate net income attributable to Hess from the Bakken Midstream segment, which reflects our 50% ownership, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter and $48 million to $53 million for the full year of 2016, which is up from previous full year guidance of $40 million to $50 million. Turning to corporate, we expect corporate expenses, net of taxes, to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the fourth quarter and $90 million to $95 million for the full year of 2016, which compares to previous full year guidance of $100 million to $110 million. We anticipate interest expense to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million for the fourth quarter and $200 million to $205 million for the full year of 2016. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning, everybody. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Morning. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : John, you've indicated in the past, I think, that sustained Brent prices near $60 would probably be needed for the company to consider a more assertive spending profile. And within this context, some of your peers and semi-peers have taken a little bit of a different tact recently and they've indicated that even if the oil price does increase that their spending is not going to rise through 2020 with capital return to shareholders instead and to reduce debt, et cetera. So, my question is how you guys are thinking about capital management over the medium term, if we have a scenario whereby the oil price does recover, and whether you feel that the balance between returns on capital and production growth and financial flexibility requires adjustment in relation to the past decade and if so, how should it change? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Well, Doug, thank you. As you know, our strategy in this lower for longer oil price environment has been to preserve our balance sheet, preserve our capability and preserve our growth options, so it's a balance, and we're about value, not volume. But with the recent improvement in oil prices, we are making initial preparations to increase activity levels once again in the Bakken next year. We'll provide detailed 2017 guidance, including capital and exploratory expenditures as usual in January. But we're going to stay fiscally disciplined. It's the balance sheet that's premier here to fund through the cycle, the excellent growth opportunities we have, both short cycle in the Bakken and longer cycle in Guyana. And as long as those opportunities offer superior financial returns to our shareholders, that will obviously command our capital going forward, with an eye to keeping the balance sheet in check as well as looking at over time offering competitive growth and increasing cash returns to shareholders as well. So, it's going to be a balance and it's going to be a function of oil price. Doug Terreson - Evercore Group LLC : Okay, John. Thanks a lot. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. John, I wonder if I could kick off with the Liza news this morning. With the step-out, the 2.7 mile step-out similar thickness, it looks like, it looks like you've got a really shallow incline on this discovery, I guess. My question is, have you hit lowest known oil yet, did you find the oil-water contact, and if I may, my understanding is you're staying on the well to deepen the well. Can you talk a little bit about what you're looking for and what the next steps might be? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, Doug, this is Greg. The well is still under evaluation. I mean, what we can say is that we found 200 feet of very nice quality oil sands consistent with the sands at Liza 1 and Liza 2. So we're going to have to wait until the well is fully evaluated. Regarding next steps on the well, you're right. We're deepening the well, sidetracking and deepening the well, going through some separate, but distinct deeper sand packages. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: I think the real takeaway there, Doug, to your point, Liza has gotten bigger. It's in excess of 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent and we believe offers very attractive financial returns at current prices, and that's the key point. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, just to be clear, you didn't find the oil-water contact or you did? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: We'll refer that question to the operator when you \u2013 ExxonMobil has their call on Friday, but obviously... Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: ...we're encouraged that we have a bigger resource here than before, so you can draw your own conclusions from that. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Quick follow-up if I may, so you're talking about Payara by the next quarter's results, but that's three months away and these are apparently taking 45 days to drill. What's the \u2013 what should I read into the timing? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, I think, Doug, first of all, we've got to finish the current deepening that we're on with the current well. So, we're in operations right now on that well. We've got to finish that out and depending on obviously what we find, could dictate how long the well takes to complete. And then we'll move the rig over to Payara and begin drilling at Payara there, again, depending on what we find, will dictate how long it actually takes to finish the well. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Last one from me, very quickly. A follow-on to Doug's question actually about the Bakken. I understand you're going to give guidance, John, early next year. But just curious what your objective is because you're still seeing declines in the field. Are you looking for stability or are you looking to grow the Bakken next year? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yes. Doug, it's going to be a function of financial returns. We said that until oil prices approached $60, it didn't make sense to accelerate volume for its own sake, but we see with the current improvement in oil prices for next year, that now we're making our plans to increase the rig count some. The exact definition of that, we'll give guidance as we finalize our plans at the end of the year. But the core of the core that we have with the low drilling and completion costs offer us returns that are competitive with the Permian and the Eagle Ford. So as oil prices have improved, we think it's going to make sense to really take a hard look at increasing our rig count for next year. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thanks for taking my questions, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Morning. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Back to Guyana, could you just add a little bit more color on the Payara prospect, how that compares versus at Liza and Skipjack and if there's any look on whether you would continue to go with one rig in Guyana next year or whether there would be something greater than that? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I think regarding the rig count, we're still finalizing all of our plans and budget with the operators. So it's too early to be specific on that. Again, with the Payara prospect, it's 10 miles northeast of the Liza-1 well. It's in a similar reservoir package that we've seen in Liza, but getting definitive beyond that, let's just wait and see the results of the well. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. And then shifting over to the Bakken, just a couple of follow-up questions on some of the capital allocations there. Is the decision to move forward or to consider and prepare for accelerating activity there just simply in line with the approaching $60 commentary or has there been a more material improvement in returns or a reduction in cost that is more secular that's lowering that breakeven? And then very broadly, how do you think about (32:31) the out spending of cash flow next year? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. On the Bakken, it's more a function of price and value, but obviously with the improving cost performance that we have as well as the expansion of our stages to 50 stages from 35 stages, all of which we think has prices improve off of very attractive returns on a short cycle basis to our shareholders. And so that's why it's being given serious consideration and a finalization of the drilling rig program will give you and when we announce our budget for next year in January. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Hey, Brian, if I could just add \u2013 Brian, if I could just add a little more color on what John said. If you look at the well inventory that we have in the Bakken, that generates a 15% after-tax or a higher return at $50, that is now over 900 wells. And to put that in context, that's increased by some 40% for that same $50 number last year. So, as John said, as well costs have come down and our IT rates have gone up as a result of going to higher stage counts, we're sitting on a very high-quality inventory of wells. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And you may have said both these points, but did you say or could you say what the well cost and EURs will be associated with the 50 stage, 50 stage Bakken well? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. So, I think as we said in our opening remarks, the EURs in the fourth quarter will approach a million barrels. The EURs in the Middle Bakken in the third quarter were just shy of 900,000 barrels and well costs continued to drop this quarter. They dropped from $4.8 million to $4.7 million in spite of the fact that we had a couple higher stage count trials, the 53 stage and the 57 stage count. So, we continue to make those lean manufacturing continuous improvement gains on the wells in spite of increasing \u2013 marginally increasing stage count. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good. Thanks. Maybe one quick one on the Bakken and then a follow-up somewhere else. In the past, you've talked about, I guess, trying to understand the trajectory for 2017 as well. In the past, you've talked about three rigs to four rigs to maintain production flat in the Bakken. Is that still the case or have the improvements you've talked about in terms of lowering costs and productivity improvements changed that at all? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. I think the \u2013 I think the three rigs to four rigs is appropriate. I think the only thing we can say is that number has moved closer to three than four, but it's still in between three and four to hold production flat. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then if we think about activity, you mentioned in your comments the likelihood of reaching FID earlier than 2017. What are the steps that need to be met between now and then in terms of \u2013 I know it's tough to say at this point, in terms of additional appraisal wells and activity that needed to be done that we can watch for in terms of hitting FID next year? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. I think that the biggest thing that needs to be done is really the completion of the FEED work and getting bids back from contractors, all those things, and then obviously finalizing your final well designs and locations and all those. So it's just normal project progression to reach the FID point. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: And I think the key point there is obviously Liza is a world-class resource, in excess of a billion barrels of oil equivalent. So we think we're at beyond the commercial threshold already at current prices. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. I'll leave it there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning, guys. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Morning. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: My first question on Greg's opening comments, it sounded like the Bakken wells are showing progression in average 30-day IPs as you move to the 50-stage completions. You mentioned the Middle Bakken 30-day IPs yet, what do you see on the lower Three Forks? And I note that in the context of your ops report you just filed that had 843 barrels a day in the quarter for all ops wells. So I'm just trying to square the circle from what we're seeing in the third quarter and what we should see or expect in 4Q for that average 30-day IP? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Evan. Really the difference in the numbers I quoted in the third quarter results is the mix of Three Forks wells. So this quarter had a higher proportion of Three Forks wells in it. Those IPs in the Three Forks this quarter were around about 800 barrels a day or so. And we also had an operational issue where we had some production curtailment due to some road restrictions that adversely impacted some of those Three Forks wells. So it brought the average down on the Three Forks, but that's why we gave you the Middle Bakken numbers. Middle Bakken numbers were very strong, less impacted by the production curtailment. So, it was that mix that really caused the quarter-on-quarter reduction. But as we said in the fourth quarter, we're going to see particularly Middle Bakken EURs approaching that 1 million barrel number in the fourth quarter, so we should have a very strong fourth quarter in terms of EUR in the Bakken. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. And do you have an IP estimate for the 4Q kind of total operated as others were guiding for 900 barrels a day to 1,000 barrels a day, is that what we should expect? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah we just said that \u2013 again, that should approach that 1 million barrels in the fourth quarter IP rates. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Sorry, 1,000 barrels a day, 1 million barrel EURs, yeah. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And my second question is there appears to be success with higher proppant loading in the Bakken amongst your peers. I know you mentioned higher proppant loadings were less effective in your acreage before. Yet what is your current proppant load on that standard 50-stage completion and are you planning to test any higher loads or kind of test that thesis in line with some other operators in the basin? Thanks. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, so Evan, we think that the Bakken is really two different areas, right. So in the core of the core, we believe that sticking with sliding fleet completions and increasing that stage count as high as you can practically go, delivers the highest return. Now the proppant loading we're using in those areas, again, the core of the core is anywhere from 80,000 pounds to 110,000 pounds per stage and that just really depends on where we are because we have the data to kind of say, it's better to optimize that between 80,000 pounds and 110,000 pounds. Now, as you move outside the core, we continue to evaluate other designs, which includes slickwater, plug and perf, high proppant volume completions. And what we ultimately decide there, and we'll begin testing some of those techniques, whatever technique gives us the highest return per BSU, that is the one we're going to select. And so, the reason for the differences are simply because in the core of the core, you're on the flexure of the structure, so you have an awful high amount of natural fracturing. So you just need less of a proppant load. As you get outside the core, there's less of that effect, so that's what drives these different completion designs outside the core. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Maybe one more if I could, I know the Hawkeye started up in the 3Q that affected the mix in the quarter, but any color on when that started and ramped up within the quarter, just to get a better view of what the forward run rate might look like on a mix \u2013 production mix in the Bakken? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah, if you look at the mix, again, the individual well GORs are unchanged. And so, nothing is going on in the field from a GOR level. What has changed though is just the overall mix of production as we bring more wells, gas and NGLs as we bring more of that into the plant. So previously flared volumes \u2013 we're gathering additional previously flared volumes and putting those into the plant. So that's what's really going on with our mix. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Was that \u2013 when in the quarter was the startup? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So now, Hawkeye is coming in on \u2013 in phases, right, so it will be completed in 2017. And really, I wouldn't say anything in particular with Hawkeye itself, it is, as Greg said, we are just continuing to hook up more and more of our pads where either they were previously flared, it's just hooking up to our own infrastructure and we even have small amounts that we hook up to other infrastructure as well, other third-party infrastructure. And that additional gathering is what is causing the gas rate and the NGL volumes to go up and just causing pure math on the percentages of crude. But as Greg said, there is no change of the mix at the wellhead. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Appreciate it guys. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes. Congrats again on Liza, looks like a large aerial extent and lack of compartmentalization, I guess, a couple of quick questions on Liza. I mean, what recovery factor have you assumed to come up with the sort of range? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Evan (sic) [Ed], we're evaluating a whole number of different scenarios on development, so it's too early to talk about that, Ed. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Right. I mean it just seems that from the aerial extent, it seems larger potentially than even the range that has been given. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. As John said, it's in the upper range \u2013 upper end of the range that was quoted previously. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Gas content thus far? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Again, let's wait until the development gets sanctioned to be specific on exactly what the mix is. But it's got a very healthy GOR, which means it's going to have a good response from a recovery standpoint. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then switching topic and maybe this is more broadly strategic. I mean you're clearly creating value in Guyana at the pace which offshore exploration takes. You're seeing peers get rewarded from making acquisitions down in the Permian. Maybe just sort of from a strategic standpoint, talk a little bit about how you see the changing landscape and Hess's role in it given the mix of onshore shale that you have, the excitement that people have about the Permian and then you also have this offshore element? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. No, thank you. I think the way we look at it is obviously we're always looking to optimize the value of our portfolio in the normal course of our business. However, with the robust portfolio of captured growth opportunities that we have, balanced between, I'd say the shorter cycle, Bakken, which is low risk and high return, with returns competitive with the Permian that you just talked about, as well as the longer cycle Guyana that we think will have world-class financial returns as well, acquisitions are low on our priority list. Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks. Very clear. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. John, I think in the past, you guys have told about sustaining CapEx above $1.5 billion. Is that still the number or that number has changed? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: So, we look at it, if you're asking like a sustainable CapEx level that we talk about for maintaining flat production, like if you look at right now, we're around, as John mentioned earlier, $2 billion of capital this year. With that, we have North Malay Basin and Stampede coming online and that 35,000 barrels a day comes online in 2018. So, when that comes online, you could \u2013 from our production levels that we have, we'll basically be able to keep our production levels flat, maybe some slight growth with when you're putting in and spending that $2 billion. So, I would say it's a range, right. You can do this like $1.75 billion to $2.4 billion type range of capital, all depending on your F&D cost that you have in a portfolio for us at our current production levels. So, we're producing 120 million, 130 million barrels a year. So, just using F&D and cost from that range can get you that general type of CapEx level. Now, we can certainly lower that CapEx level and maintain like kind of cash flow neutrality if we wanted to do that, but that would affect your long-term production growth. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure. Understand. I guess, for next year, what is the remaining spending for Stampede and North Malay going to be? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Sure, so we went into the year basically with about $700 million on both of these projects as a budget, $375 million on North Malay Basin, $325 million on Stampede. The North Malay Basin number will come down. So, we'll update you and give you the more specific number in January, but it's going to come down because as we said, it's going to start production in the third quarter. Now the Stampede number will go up because we have a second drilling rig coming into the field in January. And then once again, as we put our capital budget together in January, we'll update you on the specific numbers. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: But, that combined is probably still pretty close to about $700 million then, right. Because what you go down in North Malay probably offset by the increase in Stampede, I presume? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. You don't want to be specific, but it would be \u2013 it's going to be in that range again just because there will be an increase in Stampede and a reduction in North Malay Basin. But obviously once the third quarter starts, we're beginning to get cash flow out of North Malay Basin. And that's really the key again for us, is this 35,000 barrels a day comes in in 2018 and they go from using $700 million of cash to generating cash, so we're getting that big cash flow inflection point for us coming in 2018 on. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. And just curious, I mean, that in the $1.75 billion to $2.4 billion, whatever is that number there, is on the 2017 budget. That in the past, given \u2013 particularly given now that you have no sizeable debt maturity until 2027, on a going forward basis, that if oil price rise and cash flow from operations start to be in excess of that level, should we assume you will eventually run a cash flow-neutral model, so whatever is the increase in the cash flow exceeding that level will get put back into the exploration or that into the CapEx, or that is not a totally good assumption? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: It goes back to what John Hess had said earlier, right. There is a balance of how we would use the additional cash flow. So, with our portfolio, you know we're oil-weighted, so a $1 move in oil prices gives us on an annual basis approximately $70 million of additional cash flow. So, we are in a position to really, with the recovery in oil prices, to benefit from it. So what we'll then do is go look at our short-term, our medium-term, and our long-term growth options that we know we have some very good return opportunities there, but we'll balance that with our balance sheet and making sure that stays strong and providing returns to shareholders. So, it will be a mix and we'll continually look at that mix to optimize it as we move forward. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And two final questions for me. One, Utica, I'm surprised that you actually would be slightly up sequentially, given you are no longer drilling any more wells. Just, Greg, are you start seeing the decline over there and what kind of recovery should we assume? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Paul, so on the \u2013 you know, if we look at how we've able to hold production flat, although we had a drilling break, we brought 14 new wells online in the second quarter and nine wells in the first quarter, so you're seeing that really carry-over of those wells that we completed in the second quarter, those five wells, sorry. So, just to be clear again, we brought 14 new wells online in 2016, nine wells in the first quarter and five wells in the second quarter, so, you're seeing some carryover there. We anticipate the decline will come and it will probably come in the fourth quarter and first quarter next year is when we'll start to see that decline. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: If you continue not going to have any rig over there, what kind of decline rate should we assume? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Just take a typical type curve in the Utica and you can predict pretty easily what that decline is going to be, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's fine. All right, thank you. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy. Your line is now open. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Good morning, guys. And that was helpful. I don't think you're going to get into these details yet, but the first phase of sanctioning at Liza, how would you describe Phase I, or is it just too early in your FEED studies to even get into, like how \u2013 the scope and size of the development of upwards of 1.4 billion barrels? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I think at this point, it's just too early. Obviously, as John said, the reservoir is in the upper end of the range and we're doing all kinds of development studies to try and figure out the most optimum way to begin development of the reservoir, so stay tuned, more to come. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : And then with North Malay coming online next year, can you talk about the annual impact of amount of capital that you invested and then the flip of amount of cash flow, I know it's a half-year basis most likely, but like what that does to operating costs or just an absolute cash generation for the company, as that 50% comes online? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Sure. So when it comes online in the third quarter, the North Malay Basin field itself will carry very low cash cost. So from a cash cost standpoint, it's going to have a positive impact on our overall portfolio. Now the price is linked to high sulfur fuel oil there and it is only on a month lag, so is going to react to oil prices. And depending on where oil prices are \u2013 the amount of cash flow we get will increase or decrease depending on what's happening with oil prices. However, we do expect then as that's the third quarter coming in and then with Stampede coming on in 2018, I mean, I think the broader picture is, we're utilizing $700 million of cash right now and not getting any cash flow back. In 2018, that flips so; we're getting a \u2013 at least a pickup of $700 million of cash flow from those two projects. And again depending on prices, how much excess cash flow we get we'll see once we get to 2018. But again, that's why we're always looking and focus on keeping our balance sheet strong through 2017 whereas in 2018, we get this additional cash flow coming into our portfolio. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : And then just on a very detailed question, your fourth quarter capitalized interest in G&A, do you have an expectation for that? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: It should be \u2013 it will be the same because our capitalized interest right now is related to the Stampede project, so that will actually continue along until Stampede starts up. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. Perfect. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. Firstly, just a hopeful one on Guyana, when could we expect first production based on an FID next year? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: I think the best thing to do is refer that to the operator. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : That's what I'm \u2013 what I might end up with, I understand. Could you talk a little bit about firstly your hedging positioning, if there's anything to add there. Secondly, as far as I understand that you're planning to accelerate activity next year, but also maintain a strong balance sheet and I assume that would mean spending within cash flows. Are you therefore assuming higher oil prices next year or how do I square that circle? Thanks. Unknown Speaker : Yeah. The prices we're assuming and we'd give further definition on that when we announce our budget next year in January, is prices in the current range, priority is going to keep the balance sheet strong and our activity levels will reflect keeping that balance sheet strong. So further guidance and specifics, we'll give you in January. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Anything on hedging, John? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yes. So right now, we do not have any hedges outstanding and we continue to look at hedges on a regular basis and we'll assess whether to add them as we've done in the past. Basically it's insurance to ensure funding of our capital projects. So then as John mentioned, as we look in 2017 and seeing where prices are, if we begin to put more capital back to work or add more drilling rigs in the Bakken, we will be considering adding hedging at that point as insurance. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Clear. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Campbell of the Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. My first question was with regard to the Bakken and the increase to 50 stages in the standard completion design. I was just wondering, do you anticipate any alteration of your current well spacing assumptions on pads as a result of the more intensive completions? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, we don't. Based on the \u2013 on our current reservoir studies, with this completion design, we think that's the optimum. Now having said that, we've done a few very close, even closer space pilots and we're waiting on the results of those. So it's too early to speculate one way or the other. But right now, we believe that nine in eight configuration, with the 500 foot well spacing, with 50-stage fracs appears to be the optimum. As we said though, we're going to continue to push that stage count higher if we can and we've just got a successful 60-stage trial in the ground. So we're excited about the possibilities there. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. And just \u2013 to follow that up to make sure I understood that clearly. You have some spacing pilots that are tighter than 500 feet, with 50 stages being tested, we just don't have the results yet. Is that correct? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: No. Those are actually lower stage count, but we're monitoring those wells closely to see, can we see breakthrough. So far we haven't, but we need a lot more data before we can be definitive. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. That was helpful. I was just wondering can you update on the Gulf of Mexico production outlook over the next several quarters. Specifically are the valve problems behind you and what's the production recovery arc? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. So if we \u2013 as we mentioned in our remarks, there is two kind of two events that are going to happen, the first thing is on Conger. We'll get that defective valve replaced, and it will come, that well will come back online in the first quarter of 2017. As we move to Tubular Bells, there is two events that are going on there, well, actually three. First of all, we're going to commence water injection this quarter. Secondly, we have a fifth producer that will come online in the first quarter of 2017 and then finally, we'll get that third defective valve replaced in the fourth quarter and the well will come online in the first quarter. And so, that's how it kind of lays out on Conger and the T-Bells. The rest are pretty much just in run-and-maintain mode, run for cash. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. And if I could ask a last one real quick. I just wondered if you could add a little bit of color on Skipjack. Just was it simply a non-commercial well or did it fail to find any kind of hydrocarbons (58:07) in the system there? And just how the Skipjack result has an effect, if any, on any other potential exploration targets in the area? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Okay. So, I think, as the operator said, the Skipjack well didn't find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons, but did find the same excellent quality reservoir that was seen in the Liza well. So, how we think about this in the context of the whole block is, again, this is a giant block, it's 1,150 Gulf of Mexico blocks. We're in the very early stages of the exploration program and we continue to see numerous additional prospects and play types on the block. And we haven't even processed all the seismic yet. So, we still remain very excited about the potential of the block and try to get that (58:56). Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Great. Well, that was helpful. Thanks very much for answering my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is now open. John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale : Yeah. Thanks. Most things have been asked. In the third quarter, you had a $16 million dry hole cost, was that all Skipjack? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes. It was, John. John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale : Okay. Thanks, John. Regarding Payara or however you want to pronounce, your next exploration well in Guyana, is it a similar structure, Greg, morphologically or is there anything you can talk about for that? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: No, very similar stratigraphic trap and same kind of reservoir sequence as the other Liza wells. John P. Herrlin - Societe Generale : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question, guys. No one's asked yet about the MLP. The last time you updated the S-1 was, I believe, last December, but you're obviously talking about accelerating Bakken activity next year. As that materializes, will you also kind of accelerate perhaps the process towards taking the MLP public? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Right. So just as \u2013 at a high level, the Midstream business itself, it's executing well as you can see from our numbers, the Hawkeye project will kind of \u2013 we're working to completion and that will come online in 2017. Market conditions obviously are getting better. And as you mentioned and John has mentioned earlier that we are making our initial preparations on increasing our drilling activity in the Bakken. And I think when you put all those together and we start increasing our drilling there in the Bakken, it does fit nicely into a timeline then for the MLP IPO. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just kind of conceptually, if and when Hess Midstream ends up becoming a public company, will you limit it to Bakken assets exclusively? Or would you consider adding or broadening its asset base towards other aspects of your domestic Midstream portfolio outside the Bakken? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yes. I mean, we'll obviously talk about this as it gets further in the process. But there is no restriction for the Midstream to just be in our North Dakota business. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, Arun Jayaram, JPM. Just a couple real quick ones. Assuming the upper end of the resource range at Liza, guys, how many phases would that potentially include? You talked about potentially sanctioning Phase I in 2017, but how many potential phases could that include? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: I would direct those questions to ExxonMobil, the operator. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Fair enough, fair enough. And my only other question, Malay comes online in the third quarter. Could you give us a sense of how the ramp could like in terms of getting to a full production there? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, so I think again it will reach plateau at 165 million cubic feet a day and the fact that we're pre-drilling most of the producers, that should be a pretty steady ramp. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And what quarter would you anticipate, I guess, getting to full production, is it fourth quarter, first quarter of 2018? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: We'll begin ramping in the third quarter, so probably fourth quarter. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Fourth quarter, okay. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber of Simmons. Your line is now open. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Good morning, everybody. Thanks for fitting me in here, at the end of the call. The E&P CapEx has been consistently coming in below guidance, pretty much every quarter. Can you guys just discuss the drivers there? To what extent is that activity-driven, perhaps offshore versus efficiency capture, deflation capture, just curious what you're seeing with those savings. And then I had one follow-up. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Sure, Guy, day in and day out, right now, we are focused on reducing costs, both on an operating basis as well as capital. So the biggest driver of the reduction in capital because we'd already had the activity reductions basically budgeted in or especially when we updated the forecast guidance, so it really has been efficiencies here and just continuing to look at better ways of doing things and reducing costs from that standpoint. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Okay, great. And then the international offshore CapEx, it looks like you've basically cut off spending to a good portion of your base international offshore assets. Is that something you are comfortable continuing to do through 2017 or do those base assets need to attract a bit more capital and is there anything new to share at Valhall, South Arne, for example? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Right. So, as we talked about, we, across our portfolio, have very good return opportunities, both onshore and offshore. But the way we are thinking about allocating capital here as the prices come back and we've mentioned it is we are now initially preparing for increasing capital to the Bakken. So, that's going to have our first call on capital will be going to the Bakken. Then again now as prices continue to move and as you know, $1 move for us is $70 million of annual cash flow, we'll begin to look across the portfolio and there are opportunities across our offshore portfolio that we could increase capital to. So, it will be something that we'll be looking at and balancing it with where our balance sheet is and commodity prices are and returns to shareholders, but there's very good returns across our portfolio. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: And I think the only thing I'd add there is, there were logical drilling breaks both in EG and South Arne associated with processing additional 4D seismic and ocean bottom seismic. So, those were logical, technical drilling breaks and we're in the process of evaluating all that data. Guy Allen Baber - Simmons & Company International : Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Sorry for lining up again, but I wanted to dig into the fourth quarter production guidance because when I was asking my question, the slides were not yet posted. Can you just walk us through what is driving the drop sequentially, oil versus gas, planned versus unplanned versus declines because the Bakken seems to be relatively stable and I appreciate that? Thanks. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. So if you're starting with our third quarter, the 314,000 barrels per day, we're going to get an increase, about 11,000 barrels a day combined from JDA and South Arne. As Greg had mentioned in his comments earlier, JDA will get back above 30,000 barrels a day because the booster compression tie-in work that we had in the second quarter and South Arne did have a turnaround as well. So we're getting a pickup there. That increase though is being offset and slightly even more, there is going to be a reduction of about 12,000 barrels a day, as it relates to, as we talked about Utica. Utica is going to be start declining, we're not bringing, we're not drilling and bringing any wells online there. The Bakken, as you mentioned, is still going to \u2013 it's going to come off the 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the decline with the two rigs. And in EG, we do have a bit of our normal entitlement change that we have in the fourth quarter as you get through the year of your cost recovery. So combined Utica, EG and Bakken will be down about 12,000 barrels a day. Then you have the 1s and 2s, across the portfolio again, where we're not drilling and that comes to approximately 8,000 barrels a day there, just things in the Gulf of Mexico, as Greg mentioned. So that's where we get to this approximate of about 305,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So John, just to be clear, the Utica is obviously mainly gas. So what is the Utica contribution for that \u2013 that makes difference in your cash margins obviously? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: About \u2013 I'd say about 5,000 barrels a day will be in the Utica to \u2013 it will start declining here significantly with no activity happening in the Utica. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Helpful. Thanks, guys. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Sure. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions today. Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

My name is Nicole and I'll I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. With me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I\u2019ll review highlights from 2016 and plans for 2017. Greg Hill, will then discuss our operating performance and John Rielly, will review our financial results. First, I would like to share our view of the oil market, particularly in light of the recent OPEC agreement. We are entering a new chapter in oil prices. After two years of a lower for longer price environment global investment in exploration and production has been severely curtailed, nearly in half from approximately $700 billion in 2014 to $380 billion last year. While 2017 should see modestly higher investment than 2016, we believe this level of spend will not be enough to bring forward the necessary production over the next several years to meet future oil demand growth and offset production declines globally. We see continued strong demand coupled with the anticipated reduced supply resulting from OPEC and non-OPEC supply cuts and natural field declines, more than offsetting increased U.S. shale oil production, leading to higher oil prices this year and into 2018. Our company is extremely well positioned for this improving price environment. We have a decade or more of visible reserve and production growth and our continued focus on operational excellence and financial discipline is driving improving returns and lower costs across our portfolio. Our visible growth trajectory is underpinned by four key areas; the Bakken, where we have a leadership position and we\u2019ll go from two rigs to six rigs over the course of 2017. Two offshore developments North Malay Basin and Stampede, which are expected to contribute significant production and cash flow when they come online in 2017 and 2018 respectively. And the world-class Liza and recent Payara oil discoveries in Guyana. With sanction of the first phase of the Liza development expected mid-year and continuing appraisal and development activities underway. In 2017, we will continue to be disciplined in investing in our growth projects, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. On January 12, we announced 2017 capital and exploratory budget of $2.25 billion. About 70% of our 2017 budget is allocated to our four major growth areas. With activity increasing in 2017, our focus will be on execution. In terms of safety, cost control, project delivery and working with our partners to advance our discoveries in Guyana to development. Now turning to our 2016 financial results, our adjusted net loss was $1.5 billion and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $840 million. Compared to 2015, our financial results were negatively impacted by lower crude oil and natural gas sales volumes and selling prices, which more than offset the positive impacts of lower operating costs and DD&A expense. From an operational standpoint, while we reduced activity across our producing portfolio in 2016, our team has much to be proud of. Driving operational efficiencies across our portfolio, delivering reductions in capital expenditures and cash operating cost, progressing our offshore developments and achieving major success with our focused exploration program. In 2016, full year net production was 321,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. In 2017, our production is forecast to average between 300,000 and 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. It is important to note that first quarter 2017 production is expected to increase in excess of 10% from first quarter levels. Driven by the startup of North Malay Basin in the third quarter, increased activity levels in the Bakken and the restart of drilling at the Valhall Field in Norway, all of which builds momentum and positions the company for strong production growth in 2018. At year-end 2016, our proved reserves stood at 1.1billion barrels of oil equivalent and our reserve life was 9.2 years. We were placed 119% of production in 2016 and an SG&A cost of approximately $13 per barrel of oil equivalent. Now turning to the Bakken, Hess has one of the highest quality acreage positions in the play, with more future drilling locations in the quarter than any other operator and an advantage infrastructure position. Through our application of lean manufacturing techniques, our Bakken team has achieved among the lowest drilling and completion costs and most productive wells in the basin, offering very attractive financial returns. Bakken production in 2016 averaged 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting our reduced drilling program. Bakken production in 2017 is forecast to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With the increased activity in the Bakken and the improvement in the MLP market, Hess infrastructure partners is preparing for an initial public offering LP common units in 2017. Turning to our offshore developments, Full-field development of North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand is on track to achieve first production in the third quarter of 2017. The Stampede development in the deep water Gulf of Mexico is progressing and remains on schedule for first oil in 2018. Together they\u2019re expected to add a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in transition from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company. With regard to Guyana, we are excited about the significant resource potential on the 6.6 million acres Stabroek Block. The Liza-3 well result last October, confirmed Liza as one of the industry\u2019s largest oil discoveries in the last 10 years, with estimated recoverable resources of more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of development in 2017, with production expected in 2020. This month Payara-1 well confirmed a second significant oil discovery with the same high quality reservoir. Payara and an additional deeper reservoir identified directly below the Liza field are accretive to the estimated recoverable resources already confirmed at Liza and further demonstrate the prospectivity of the Stabroek Block. The Stabroek Block offers very attractive economics and will be very material for our company. The Liza and Payara oil discoveries underpin a large discovered resource on the block that has significant upside in terms of appraisal and future exploration potential. The reservoir quality is world-class with high-porosity and permeability. The wells can be drilled in a third to a half of the time and cost of those in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and we are entering the development phase at what will likely be the bottom of the offshore cost cycle. In summary, we are well positioned to deliver visible and sustainable growth and value to our shareholders. We are increasing activity in the Bakken, which will bring growth back into our onshore portfolio and support a potential IPO of the midstream business to unlock additional value. Offshore, our developments in the Gulf of Thailand and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico are poised to add significant volumes and become long-term cash generators. And in Guyana, the Liza field is one of the industry\u2019s largest oil discoveries of the last ten years, which we and our partners will continue to appraise and progress toward development. Overall, we see 2017 as the start of an exciting new chapter of value driven growth and increasing production momentum for our company and our shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory Hill : Thanks John. I\u2019d like to provide an operational update for 2016 and review our plans for 2017. Clearly the past year was challenging in terms of oil prices and we responded by reducing our capital spend and operating cost. Last year was also marked by strong execution on many fronts including the continued advancement of our North Malay Basin and Stampede developments and exceptional exploration results in Guyana, firmly establishing a new world-class oil province. With regard to production, in 2016 we averaged 321,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. In the fourth quarter, production averaged 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, which was above our guidance of 305,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. During the quarter, production from Libya resumed and on a net basis averaged 4,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter. Production from Libya remains highly uncertain therefore we\u2019ll continue to exclude it from our guidance. As John mentioned, in 2016 we achieved a reserve replacement ratio of 119% and SG&A cost of $13 per barrel of oil equivalent. Net proved reserve additions totaled 143 million barrels of oil equivalent. About half of the additions were in the Bakken, reflecting higher EURs associated with their shift to 50-stage completions and lower cost. Other areas with additions include North Malay Basin, South Arne and the Utica. In 2017, we forecast companywide production to average between 300,000 to 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our production has been decreasing over the last several quarters as a result of reducing our capital expenditures to manage in the lower price environment. Our production will continue to decline in the first half of 2017 as a result of this reduced spend and a high level of planned maintenance at four of our offshore assets in the second quarter. We forecast production to average between 290,000 and 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter and between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. Production is in forecast to increase in the third quarter with the start-up of North Malay Basin to between 305,000 and 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Production will continue to grow in the fourth quarter as Bakken production increases as a result of the rig ramp up and the first new Valhall well comes online. Fourth quarter production is forecast to average between 330,000 to 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, resulting in production growth in excess of 10% or some 40,000 barrels per day from the first to the fourth quarter of 2017. Turning to operations, the Bakken continues to deliver outstanding results. We continue to improve our drilling and completion performance with fourth quarter D&C cost dropping 10% versus the year ago quarter to $4.6 million. We now have enough production history to conclude that we will get an average 13% uplift in EUR per well from our 50-stage completions compared to our previous estimate of 7%.As a result, we\u2019ve increased our estimate of ultimate recovery from our Bakken acreage to 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent from our previous estimate of 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In the fourth quarter, initial production rates for wells that reached IP30 during the quarter averaged a record 1,091barrels of oil per day versus 843 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter. This result reflects all wells during the quarter being 50-stage completions and in the core of the core of our acreage. Going forward we will shift our guidance to IP90 rates which we feel are more reflective of a well\u2019s actual performance. In 2017, we forecast IP90s to average between 700 and 750 barrels of oil per day compared to 620 barrels of oil per day in 2016. Net production from the Bakken averaged 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016, which was at the top end of our beginning of the year guidance range of 95,000 to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the fourth quarter, net production averaged 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below guidance due to extreme winter weather which resulted in road closures and an unusually high number of shutting facilities and wells. The net negative impact of weather in the fourth quarter on the Bakken was about 7000 barrels of oil per day. With the recovery in oil prices to the mid-50s, we plan to increase our rig count from the two rigs we currently have operating to six rigs by the end of this year and expect our rig count to average approximately 3.5 for the year. In 2017, we plan to drill approximately 80 wells and bring approximately 75 new wells online over the year. We will continue to focus our drilling in the core of our Bakken acreage where our sliding sleeve completions, site spacing and higher stage counts deliver optimal value. Of the 75 wells we plan to bring on line this year, approximately 50 wells will be our new standard 50-stage design and we expect the D&C cost for these wells to be in line with the 4.8 million that we averaged in 2016. We will also be conducting two new completion design pilots this year in our drive to continually optimize the value of our industry-leading acreage position. The first pilot will be increasing the stage count to 60 from the standard 50-stage design. We plan to test this in 10 wells to ensure the reliability of the system and our forecasting well costs in these 10 wells to range between $5 million and $5.5 million. The second pilot will involve higher proppant loading. The 60-stage sliding sleeve may be approaching the technical limit and mechanical design. Therefore, we now want to test the technical limit on proppant loading in a sliding sleeve well. We plan to increase proppant loading in 15, 50-stage wells and forecast these wells to cost in the range of $5.5 million to $6 million dollars. For both of these trials, reservoir stimulation indicates a potential IP180 uplift of 10% to 15%. If successful, our future development plans and production outlook for the Bakken will be modified accordingly in 2018. The extreme winter weather conditions have persisted throughout the month of January and as a result we forecast production in the first quarter of 2017 to average between 90,000 and 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full-year of 2017, we forecast our Bakken production to average between 95,000 and 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With the building rig count, we expect our Bakken production to average between 105,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the fourth quarter of 2017, which would represent a growth rate of approximately 15% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of 2017. Moving to the Utica, in 2016 net production averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015. In the fourth quarter, net production averaged 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As a result of continued wide basin differentials, we intend to maintain our drilling pause in the Utica. In 2017, production is forecast to average between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. However, given the high quality of our Utica acreage position, our high average net revenue interest of 95%, as well as the first quarter well performance that we delivered in 2016, the asset will be an excellent resource to develop as natural gas and NGL price realizations improve. Now turning to the offshore, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 61,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in both the fourth quarter and for the full-year 2016. We forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017 and to reach approximately 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter of 2017. This production growth reflects the addition of a new well and the restart of an existing well following a work over at the Tubular Bells field in the first quarter. A restart of a well at the Conger field also following a work over and a planned new well at the Penn State field, which will come online in the second half of this year. In Norway, at the Aker BP-operated Valhall field in which Hess has 64% interest, production averaged 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 and 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. The transition from BP to Aker BP-operatorship was completed in the fourth quarter and we're looking forward to working together with the new operator to maximize the value of the Valhall asset. Drilling from existing platform rig is planned to resume in March. In 2017, net production is expected to average between 25,000 and 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. At the South Arne field in Denmark, which Hess operates with a 61.5% interest, net production averaged 13,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 and 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. The field is expected to average approximately 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017. In the fourth quarter, the Danish government awarded an extension of the South Arne license through to 2047. This secures the long-term future of this asset and provides for future phases of development. In Equatorial Guinea where Hess is operator with an 85% interest, net production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016, reflecting the drilling pause in place since mid-2015. Net production in 2017 is forecast to average approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Interpretation of the latest 40 survey has been completed and has identified multiple new targets. However, the production outlook for 2017 reflects continuation of the drilling pause over the year. At the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess has a 50% interest, net production averaged 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. Net production averaged 34,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016 and is expected to average approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017. No further drilling activity will be required to meet contracted volumes for the year as a result of the booster compression project that was completed in the third quarter of 2016. Moving now to our development projects, at North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, three remote wellhead platforms were hooked up and commissioned in the fourth quarter. The drilling campaign is on schedule with two wells being drilled in the fourth quarter bringing the total number of wells drilled so far to 13. All wells have either met or exceeded pre-drill expectations. The last heavy lift for the central processing platform topsides is completed and sail away is scheduled for the first quarter of 2017. Net production through the early production system averaged approximately 26 million cubic feet per day over 2016. Once full field development is completed in the third quarter of this year, we forecast net production to increase to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day and to remain at this rate for many years, becoming a significant cash generator for the company. At the Stampede development in the Gulf of Mexico in which Hess as a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully completed installation of subsea equipment at both drill centers and completed all topsides heavy lift on to the hall. Looking forward, in 2017 we will install the TLP and topsides on location, complete the subsea installation, and continue our drilling program. First oil remains on target for 2018. Turning to Guyana, exploration and appraisal drilling activity continues at the 6.6 million acres Stabroek block in which Hess holds a 30% interest. As announced earlier this month, the Payara-1 well located approximately 10 miles northwest of Liza discovery, was drilled by the operator Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited to a depth of 18,080 feet and encountered more than 95 feet of high quality multi-Darcy permeability, oil bearing sandstone reservoirs. Two sidetracks were subsequently drilled to take core and further evaluate the reservoir. Both sidetracks found high quality oil bearing sands. The original well and the two sidetracks were drilled, logged and cored in 56 days. A production test is now planned to further evaluate the reservoir. Appraisal drilling is planned later this year to help define the full resource potential of the Payara discovery. After completing the well test on Payara-1, the rig will move to drill the Snoek exploration prospect, which is located approximately six miles south of the Liza-1 discovery well. The next well in queue is Liza-4 appraisal well, which will pass the eastern part at Liza field. This will be followed by a Payara-2 appraisal well. Earlier this month, we announced that the Liza-3 appraisal well, which reached target depth in the fourth quarter, identified an additional high quality deeper reservoir directly below the Liza field, which is estimated to contain recoverable reserves between 100 million and 150 million barrels of oil equivalent. This additional resource is expected to be developed in conjunction with the Liza discovery. The operator plans to continue to appraise the Liza and Payara discoveries are in parallel continuing to evaluate the wider resource potential of the Stabroek block for additional exploration drilling and seismic analysis over 2017. In closing, in 2016 we once again demonstrated strong execution performance and took proactive steps to manage through the weak oil price environment by significantly reducing our capital span and operating costs while continuing to progress our future growth options. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2016. The corporation incurred a net loss of $4.892 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with a net loss of $339 million in the third quarter. The largest driver for the loss in the fourth quarter was a non-cash accounting charge of $3.75 billion on net deferred tax assets in the U.S. Denmark and Malaysia. This non-cash adjustment is required under accounting standards following a three-year cumulative loss. The deferred tax charge has no cash flow or economic impact. The company's underlying tax position remains unchanged. Beginning in 2017, our financial results will not recognize a deferred tax benefit or expense in these three countries until the deferred tax assets are reestablished. Our guidance for 2017 includes the anticipated impact of this charge, which will result in a lower effective tax rate going forward. Fourth quarter results also included an after-tax charge of $693 million to fully impair the carrying value of our natural gas project offshore the North West Shelf of Australia as a result of our decision to defer further development, so we can allocate capital to other projects that generate higher returns including the Bakken and Guyana. Other after-tax charges totaling $145 million were recognized for exit costs for an offshore drilling rig, loss on debt extinguishment, impairment of older specification rail cars, severance and surplus materials and supplies inventory. Excluding items affecting the comparability of earnings between periods, our adjusted net loss was $305 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with an adjusted net loss of $340 million in the third quarter. Turning E&P on an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $257 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to a net loss of $285 million in the third quarter of 2016. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted results for E&P between the fourth quarter and the third quarter of 2016 were as follows. Higher realized selling prices improved results by $37 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $23 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $29 million. All other items reduced results by $15 million for an overall decrease in fourth quarter net loss of $28 million. In the fourth quarter, our E&P operations were over lifted compared with production by approximately 300,000 barrels, which did not have a material impact on fourth quarter results. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, was a benefit of 43% in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared with a benefit of 41% in the third quarter. Turning to midstream, the Bakken midstream segment had net income of $3 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $13 million in the third quarter. Higher revenues in the fourth quarter reflect a recognition of deferred minimum volume deficiency payments that were partly offset by lower throughput volumes caused by severe weather in North Dakota. Fourth quarter results also include a pre-tax charge of $67 million or $21 million after taxes and the 50% non-controlling interest to impair older specification railcars. EBITDA for the Bakken midstream before the non-controlling interest, amounted to $99 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $73 million in the third quarter. Starting January 1st, 2017, our midstream segment now includes the company's interest in the Permian gas plant in West Texas and related CO2 assets and our North Dakota water handling assets, which principally consists of gathering infrastructure. These assets are wholly-owned by the company and are not included in our Hess Infrastructure Partners joint venture. Turning to corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, were $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $68 million in the third quarter. Turning to cash flow for the fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $128 million. The net increase in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $198 million. Additions to property, plant, and equipment were $487 million. Net repayments of debt were $592 million. Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $90 million. All other items resulted in an increasing cash of $46 million resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $797 million. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations before changes in working capital of $128 million reflects a reduction of approximately $200 million associated with the charges for rig exit costs, severance, and surplus inventory and higher well work over costs in the quarter. Turning to cash and liquidity, excluding the Bakken midstream, we ended 2016 with cash and cash equivalent of $2.7 billion, total liquidity of $7.3 billion, including available committed credit facilities and total debt of $6.73 billion. Turning to guidance, first with E&P, we project cash costs for E&P operations to be in the range of $16 to $17 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2017, and $15 to $16 per barrel for the full year of 2017 as compared to 2016 cash costs of $15.87 per barrel. Full-year cash costs per barrel are lower than the first quarter, reflecting the startup of North Malay Basin project in the third quarter and increasing production from the Bakken in the second half of 2017. DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2017 is forecast to be $25.50 to $26.50 and $24 to $25 for the full year of 2017, down from 2016 DD&A of $26.57 per barrel. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs of $41.50 to $43.50 per barrel in the first quarter of 2017, and $39 to $41 per barrel for the full year of 2017, down from 2016 E&P unit operating costs of $42.44 per barrel. Exploration expenses, excluding dry holes, are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million in the first quarter of 2017, and 250 million to 270 million for the full year of 2017, similar to 2016 exploration expenses of $261 million, excluding dry hole expense. The Midstream tariff, which now includes tariffs associated with our Permian gas plant and related CO2 assets and additional North Dakota water handling assets, is expected to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $520 million to $550 million for the full year of 2017. The EMP effective tax rate excluding Libya is expected to be a benefit in the range of 11% to 15% for the first quarter and 17% to 21% for the full year 2017 versus a benefit of 42% in 2016. As mentioned we will not be recognizing deferred taxes in the U.S., Denmark and Malaysia which causes the lower effective tax rate. This lower effective tax rate will have no effect on cash flow. Turning to Midstream, in 2017, we anticipate net income attributable to HESS from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million in the first quarter and in the range of $70 million to $90 million for the full year. Turning to corporate, in 2017 our corporate and interest expenses will not receive deferred tax benefits as discussed and therefore our guidance reflects pre-tax numbers due to the absence of a tax provision. In 2017, we estimate corporate expenses to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million in the first quarter and in the range of $140 million to $150 million for the full year. We estimate interest expense to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million in the first quarter of 2017 and in the range of $295 million to $305 million for the full year of 2017. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Yeah, good morning. First question just relates to better understanding, the CapEx and the completion activity in the Bakken and just trying to think about 2018. I know you spent 429 million in the Bakken and did 100 wells [ph] and I know you had some ducts that helped you little bit. In 2017, you are guiding to $700 million in CapEx, at the completion count is going down like 25, just wondering if you could maybe help me reconcile that and could reflect some higher infrastructure spending but just thinking about the completion versus the CapEx in 2017 and tops around completion activities as we think about 18. John Hess : Yeah, so let me just kind of breakdown the - there is a total of about $660 million being spent in the Bakken next year. About $50 million of that is for non-operative participations in some wells that we are expecting this year. So that leaves about $610 million for I will call it Bakken operated and if you look at that $610 million and break it down, the bulk is drilling in completion. So about $465 million is for drilling and completion at all the related facilities associated with that. There is about $95 million also in that category but that is money spend in 2017 for future years, so that\u2019s the ducts that get carried into 2018 and also the pads that we'll construct in 2017 or early 2018. And then there is about $50 million left for major maintenance and some field upgrades more statistical that we put in the budget. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful. Arun Jayaram : That\u2019s very helpful. And just my follow up question is, if you could just maybe better help us understand some of the first half \u201817 maintenance related shutdowns that you forecast. I think you all added [ph] four projects that will experience some down time, can you give us some more color on that, pretty much appreciated. John Hess : Yeah you bet, I mean most of that - almost all had downtimes in the second quarter and about 13,000 barrels a day down first quarter versus second quarter or second quarter versus first quarter associated with those major shutdowns offshore. About 5,000 of asset Llano [ph] in the Gulf, about 6000 is Equatorial Guinea and couple of thousand barrels a day at Conger also in the Gulf of Mexico. So that\u2019s a majority of it. Arun Jayaram : Okay thanks a lot, appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Greg the update in the Gulf of Mexico, I am just wondering if we could take a little bit in moving part this year, you mentioned but what is the current status and expectations for Tubular Bells trajectory in the full year? Gregory Hill : Doug, it is just too early to say on Tubular Bells and that\u2019s because we are basically increasing the chokes and not only that the well that was worked over and they came on in December 31, but also the new well they came on late December as well, so we are just in the early stages of ramping Tubular Bells back up I want to get it stable, we are also getting wider injection stables, I really want to see kind of the well results from that before I be specific on that, so potentially maybe we could provide an update once we get stable. Doug Leggate : So what are you assuming in your full year guidance for Tubular Bells. Gregory Hill : We aren\u2019t going to give that and again Doug, I am not trying to be evasive, I just really want to see these wells ramp up and see what they are at. Doug Leggate : My second one, hopefully a quick one is and I have got one more on Guinea, if I may, just assuming oil prices coming trajectory through the year gives a little higher, what is the first call in cash for HESS in 2017? Gregory Hill : So if oil prices come in higher you know what we are doing with the rig ramp in Bakken, we have always said that first call in cash will be the Bakken. So we will continue to look and accelerate how we will bring the rigs in and so that\u2019s what we would be thinking about at this point. So the first call would go to the Bakken. Doug Leggate : Okay, thank my final one - I am going to try this, I am not sure I am going to get a lot of mileage out of you guys on Guinea, but I will give it a go. So on the last call, John Hess, you suggested we would know the upper end of Liza, I realize that the Exxon guidance is above a billion but upper end would be 1.4 plus the 100 to 150 I guess gets you to 1.5. But my question is Greg suggested that you are going to drill eastern flank of the field. So can you tell us what proportion of Liza structure is derisked to get the 1.5 to get some ideas to what proportion the overall field capacity will ultimately look like? I'll leave it there thank you. John Hess : Very fair question Doug, as we pointed out after the Liza 3 well, we confirmed and partners did as well that we were in excess of a billion barrels of oil I think it is very important to note when asked Liza deep will be accretive to the number, Payara will be accretive to the number. [indiscernible] and potentially Liza 4 will be accretive to the number, so to give specificity at this point in time would just be too early. We got to finish the appraisal that we are underway but there is upside to the numbers that we gave guidance on last quarter. Doug Leggate : So and just a quick follow on, are we going to get a second rig down here given the potential move to FID? Gregory Hill : That\u2019s under discussion with the operator Doug, obviously after we take out FID, we want third drilling development wells at some point. Doug Leggate : All right, thanks everybody. Gregory Hill : Okay thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. John Hess : Good Morning. Brian Singer : Can you talk to your cost inflation assumptions that are built into your capital budget guidance and what if anything you are seeing now, I thought I heard you mention that you are going to be able to keep Bakken cost, Bakken well cost flat in 2017 and if I have heard that right, but can you talk to what risks that you could see as the year progresses and mitigation on that. John Hess : Yeah, I think in 2017, we anticipate seeing some pressure in the onshore, commodity based chemicals and potentially as well. But we are pretty confident, you are exactly right, we are pretty confident that we can hold our well cost flat in the Bakken on 50 stage completion in the core at kind of that at $4.8 million average number that we had in 2016. The way we are going to offset increases I mean in sand, commodity base, chemicals, those kind of things is basically by continuing to apply our lean manufacturing capability which we have consistently as you know have been able to pull a $100,000 to $200,000 a quarter out of the well cost. And there is still a bit more room left for that improvement as well. Brian Singer : Got it, thanks. And then separately as your completions in the Bakken are evolving, can you talk to how significant you see further technological improvement in the Bakken or whether you think we\u2019re in the latter innings and does the success in improving EUR solidifies the Bakken as your key shale horse for the company or rather give you more confidence to look at other areas. Gregory Hill : Well, let me talk about the completions in the Bakken first, as we said in our opening remark, we are doing a couple of pilots this year. And so in the core of the core which is where we have been focused, where we have that very tight, nine in eight spacing we demonstrated that the best way to optimize value in that core of the core is by using Sliding Sleeve Technology and then steadily increasing the stage counts, which effectively kind of increases the pro-well proppant loading that gives you a nice uniform frac all the way down the well bore and as you know we have worked with our supplier to continue to engineer more and more sliding sleeves in the 10,000 foot lateral. Now we believe that we could be approaching a technical limit on the number of sleeves somewhere between 60 and 70. That\u2019s just given the tight tolerance as between all the ball sizes. So given that we may be approaching that maximum stage count with a sliding sleeve system, we now want to push the technical limits on the per stage proppant loading. So given our tight nine in eight spacing which is only about 500 feet between the wells, we are going to pilot those higher loading to find out where the optimum point might be to further increase value while not causing significant well to well interference. So when we know what is with the proppant loading that we have, we haven\u2019t seen any significant well to well interference so that says you can probably get more proppant in the well and still be okay. So we are going to test the limits of that this year and see exactly how much that is. And so certainly on the sliding sleeve system, in terms of your question on where we are on technology, I think again as we approach 70 stages and got a lot number I think we are start to reach the technical limit there and next things will be proppant loading for us in the core of the core. But again that sliding sleeve system because it is so inexpensive and so efficient to install it is the highest optimum completion technique in the core of the core. As you move outside the core which we will being testing that an in the later years 2018, 2019, data seems to indicate that maybe slickwater completions or even higher proppant loadings with plug and perf maybe the answer out there and that\u2019s purely because there is a lot natural fracturing when you get out of core of the cores. So you are going to need more sand and more energy in the reservoir to connect all those fracture to that. So that\u2019s kind of where I see it going. John Hess : And Brian your question about our position in the Bakken and how we feel about it and potentially, expanding our shale footprint in the US. In terms of the Bakken obviously improvements Greg and his team have made in the lean manufacturing, improving productivity, advancing application and technology, obviously everything governed my lean. We are very pleased with the investment opportunity; we have there, the increasing ultimate resource count that we have that reflects the increasing IPs. In terms of expanding our shale footprint, we are always looking to optimize the value of our portfolio in the normal course of business, however given our robust portfolio of captured growth opportunities with excellent return, starting with the Bakken, but also the low-risk high return inflow opportunities that we have in our offshore hubs and now Guinea outright acquisitions are low on our priority business. Brian Singer : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Ed Westlake : Hey, good morning. And I am sure we are not going to up in this year all the results, but as you told F&D cost analyze I mean are you able to share like total development cost for the field? John Hess : No Ed, we'll share that when we take FID and so we'll give - during sanction [ph] you'll get a lot more color on cost and volume and production rates and all that. That will most likely be around midyear as when we take FID on Liza Phase 1. Ed Westlake : Could we get recovery per well or that will be at the same time, just as we try and model ahead of the announcement. John Hess : Yeah, we will give you as much disclosure as we can at sanction. Ed Westlake : Okay and then on Payara, I mean obviously sort of a narrow net pay I mean is if that does perhaps suggest a small recovery and perhaps more expensive development and I mean anything in that well to suggest that\u2019s the wrong approach EG, like pressure regime, did you test deeper zones there as well, maybe some color on how Payara stacks up against Liza on a per unit basis? John Hess : No, I think a couple points. You bet, yeah it is early days I think let me be clear. Payara is separate and distinct from Liza. So it is ten miles away and having said that the reservoir quality was outstanding, [indiscernible] permeability and same kind of porosity that we saw in Liza. So we are very pleased with the initial results on Payara but we are going to have to do further appraisal to determine the ultimate size of the Payara discovery, the area will extend. Ed Westlake : And then maybe switching gears, I mean you signaled acceleration production growth into 2018. I appreciate there is a lot of variables but I don\u2019t know if this point you can share a range particularly I see Bakken will move up, but if well does recover this in a room to perhaps even increase recoveries of Valhall, [indiscernible] all of these decisions just to get - give us a sense as to what the past into \u201818 looks like. John Hess : Yeah, so I think the only thing we can say with certainty at this point is you know the Bakken will - we are investing a lot in 2017 in the Bakken. You begin to really see production increase in 2018 in the Bakken. Obviously the second major catalyst in 2018 is Stampede. Beyond that we really can't be specific on an activities there because as we said it is going to depend upon oil price, I think the other thing it will happen in 2018 is as you'll have a four year North Malay Basin because of course you\u2019re only getting a partial year this year. So there is a lot of production catalyst upsides in 2018 and you begin to see that in the back half of this year. Our low point as we said is the second quarter but then by in the third and the fourth quarter you really start to ramp and as I said in my opening remark, if you look at the first quarter versus the last quarter, the delta on production if you just take the midpoint, the range is above 40,000 barrels a day. So we really start to surge in the last half of the year. Ed Westlake : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Guy Baber of Simmons. Your line is now open. Guy Baber : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your reserve report which I thought was pretty impressive but reserves in F&D obviously can be lumpy but the $13 barrel F&D you highlight was a pretty solid result. So the question is do you think that is the type of F&D cost that's representative for your company through cycle. Or where there is some reserve lumpiness that may have contributed to that and then more broadly just wanted to get thoughts about how you are thinking of the evolution of your F&D for the total company over the next few years and what do you think as sustainable level? John Rielly : Sure, I mean like you said, this will be qualitative because you know the reserve at F&D can be lumpy. For the most part let me just tell you what drove our reserve and the very good FD&A that we reported. So half of it is as Greg mentioned earlier it is really driven in the Bakken and it is moving up to those 50 stage fracs. We are getting higher EURs and there and over time as we continue to move up to potentially 60 stages and things like that. F&D in the Bakken is going to be an increasingly accretive if you want to say to our past F&D numbers. So that investment we'll be investing in lower cost reserves. So that\u2019s one, let me go longer terms, so we don\u2019t have the numbers yet right as Greg just mentioned and we get the FID in Guinea. But we clearly see for all the reasons that John Hess mentioned and Greg mentioned in the opening scripts that the positive attributes that you see in Guinea, low well cost, their recoverabilities, the high quality reservoirs that we see the F&D is definitely going to be accretive again post our past F&D cost. So our continued investment in Guinea and now that\u2019s going to be lumpy when you get the reserves in, but that's going to be very positive to our F&D reporting going forward. Then within the year itself that you would see North Malay Basin, we picked up some additional reserves, but that's just increased drilling and as we spend money there, the only one that you could see that was kind of, if you want to call lumpy or not tied to CapEx as much with South Arne, we did have a license extension in South Arne, so that was extended out to 2047 and we picked up about 20 million barrels there in South Arne. The rest of it was just from our normal portfolio adds in the positive things that we're doing in E&P. Guy Baber : That\u2019s very helpful. And then my follow-up is, I just want to better understand the flexibility embedded in your plans to ramp from two to six rigs in the Bakken. So, can you talk about the variables that might have you ramping up faster than that or slower than once you've indicated? Are there price-related trigger points you can share with us or any other issues you're monitoring around people, equipment? And if you could just help us with a framework for how you're thinking about managing that pace I think would be helpful. John Hess : Yeah, so I think for the first half of the year we'll be adding kind of a rig a quarter and then for the back half of the year, the rigs will probably come in the fourth quarter and that just has to do with the scheduling of the wells, getting the pads ready, all of that sort of thing. Now, there is potential to accelerate those rigs. Maybe another rig comes in the third quarter rather than two in the fourth quarter. We're looking at all of that. But for us, the limiting factor for us is we want to bring these wells on safely. And the cadence for us seems to be that we can bring a rig on about one a quarter and confidently say that we can do that safely and efficiently. So, those are our two drivers, safety and efficiency in terms of how fast we can ramp those rigs. Guy Baber : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Doug Terreson : Good morning, everybody. John Hess : Good morning. Doug Terreson : First, let's hope that John, the oil price or outlook ends up proving correct, because I think it will all be better off in that scenario. So, just to clarify, first of all, on the Bakken comments, what was the point that despite all the commentary that's in the market about personnel, equipment availability, et cetera, you believe that your drilling time and cost per well are going to be pretty close to flat year-over-year in \u201817 that as long as you're drilling in the core, was that pretty much the message on that? John Hess : Yeah, it was, Doug. And as we've spoken about before, during the downturn we tried to preserve a lot of capability in the Bakken, particularly on the contracting side, so that we can enable a smoother transition as you ramp back up. So, we're reasonably confident that in 2017 we can manage that very efficiently, which is why we set our 50-stage fracs in the core. We believe we can hold the costs at that kind of $4.8 million number that we achieved in 2016. Doug Terreson : Okay, perfect. And then strategically, in the United States and also overseas in E&P business, when you consider reversion to the mean that we've seen on returns for the big oils and declining [indiscernible] returns on E&P, it seems like competitive conditions are pretty intense out there and then we've also had a fairly staggering rise in energy private equity funding over the past couple of years, which doesn't help that much either. So, while you guys were early in refocusing the company on advantaged areas, done a really good job there. My question is that when you think about the future, what are the strategic imperatives for companies like Hess such that you can continue to navigate this competitive condition successfully in the future? I mean, what would you have to do to ensure the shareholders are rewarded, given this changed condition? Or do you think that the threats not so significant that it requires a response? John Hess : No, I think you're absolutely right. It's a competitive world out there for oil resources and obviously the two years of a \u2018lower for longer\u2019 price environment has challenged for everyone. Having said that, we think our company is extremely well positioned. And what's going to guide us, Doug, is value, allocating capital, the highest returns and we continue to look at shale opportunities in the United States. You're right to point out that that's a very crowded market and big question mark on returns going forward because of some of the prices being paid. Where we're actually seeing better opportunities to invest our capital is in the offshore that is much less competitive and we're getting very, very attractive opportunities that will fit our cash flow profile but also give us opportunities to make significant value for our shareholders going forward. So, obviously led by Guyana but the opportunities we have in the Guyana\u2019s basin, I think, has legs. There are some other offshore opportunities we see there. So, we're going to be driven by value and in the long run we believe that strategy is the one that will reward our shareholders the most. Doug Terreson : Okay. Good answer, John. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Hey, guys, good morning. The first one is for John Rielly. John, you mentioned that you're not going to have any recognize, any deferred tax in U.S., Denmark, and Norway. Is that purely just a function of price? And at what point that you - those areas that you have the price is high enough and you start making money? So, we assume that you start recognizing the deferred tax benefit in the cash flow or that is going to be a while? John Rielly : Okay. I just want to clarify. So, it's U.S., Denmark, and Malaysia. Paul Cheng : Malaysia. John Rielly : Yes, those are the three areas. And so, as a result, again this is just a bookkeeping requirement that is in the accounting rules because of this three-year cumulative loss that we have or any company would have, you would have to take down your net deferred tax assets. When we try to or have losses going forward, we can't book deferred tax benefits in those three countries until we reestablish the deferred tax assets. So, your question is when is that going to happen and that is not exactly also in the rules. So, it's going to kind of be a facts and circumstances analysis at a time. So, first of all, we will be emerging and starting to show profits, but then you have to see just like your point, what are the market conditions at that time and any other relevant evidence at that point. So, usually putting a deferred tax asset back on your books is going to require a little bit more positive evidence including now that you're out of this three-year cumulative loss position. So, again I just want to make sure everybody does understand there is no effect on cash flow. There is no economic impact to this at all, so from this charge or the lower effective tax rate going forward. Paul Cheng : The second question is for Greg. Greg, just when I\u2019m looking back, when North Malay, the early production systems there, I think the expectation is that [indiscernible] 40 million cubic feet per day until the full development on it and your ramp to 165. Obviously, last year that declined below 40. So, the lower production, is it - what then really is causing you? Is it equipment issue? Is it a reservoir issue or is it contract issue, demand issue, can you just - in other words, I mean, what confident that we have once the full production that you really indeed will be able to [indiscernible] in 165? Gregory Hill : Yeah, so, Paul, the early production system, the reason the production is down slightly this year is because of well. So, we lost the well and that early production system is going to go, remember that, that goes away. So, it doesn't make any sense to re-drill a well for a very short lifespan. So, I have all the confidence in the world that the 165 is a good number. We've got a great well stock. We've drilled 13 wells already. All of those wells have come in at or better than pre-drill expectations. So, the wells are healthy. We've got a great wealth stock. We've got a large number of wells in North Malay Basin or will have, so I have a lot of confidence in the 165 number. Paul Cheng : Greg, the 165 is based on how many well producing at the same time and what is the average well production? Gregory Hill : I can give you more color on that as we get closer to actually bringing it on, Paul. Paul Cheng : Okay. Gregory Hill : If you ask me that in mid-year and I can give you some more color. Paul Cheng : Okay. For the Stampede we've been talking for some time, the 2018 start up and that we're now getting closer. Is there any maybe an EBIT more granularity in terms of is it going to be first quarter, second quarter, mid-year, second half, any kind of addition of data? Gregory Hill : No, we'll give you guidance on that later in the year as we get closer. So, we still have - remember what we're trying to do this year, we're going to float out the TLP and topsides, get those landed on location. We got to get all the subsea umbilicals and flow lines done and then we'll also continue drilling. So, 2018 is a big year of installation. So, we'll give you more color as those activities progress throughout the year. Paul Cheng : And in Valhall under the new operator, how many wells that they are going to drill this year? John Hess : Yeah, there will be three wells that actually get drilled. Only one will come on this year. So, the other two will come on next year. Paul Cheng : So, we should not expect that Valhall production will be up until fourth quarter? John Hess : Yeah, I think that's a good - I think that's a good estimate, so kind of flattish. In the meantime, we do have a shutdown in Valhall associated with that Ekofisk in the third quarter, but that's fairly minor in the big scheme of things. So, again, we guided 25 to 30 for Valhall this year, which is relatively flat where it was last year. Paul Cheng : Oh, I see. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Paul Sankey : Hi, good morning everyone. Just a high level question, John, you started out with the [indiscernible]. Greg, you talked about more efficiency. I was wondering, what was the balance between the decisions to accelerate the Bakken in terms of an expectation of higher oil prices or whether it's all about the fact that you can do more for less? Thanks. John Hess : It's actually both at the end of the day. We said as prices approach 60 and really have a firm five in the price and we feel pretty good about that. We would be comfortable starting to accelerate our Bakken program and obviously with a great work that Greg and his team have done about lowering costs, increasing stage counts, increasing productivity. When you add it all up, it's about allocating capital the highest returns and we saw some very good returns there. Paul Sankey : Yeah I think that you\u2019ve led into the second thoughts on which was, I think previously you talked about free cash flow generation of 60 in the Bakken if I'm not wrong and that being the number at which you would accelerate, are you effectively saying that that number is now lower? John Hess : Well, actually, so our plans, our capital plans - fair question. Our capital plans for the Bakken anticipate that asset generating free cash and growing as well and obviously that free cash is going to be a function of what the oil prices, but our plans aren't just to invest all the cash to grow production. It's also to make sure that we start getting some cash back from that asset and that's an integral part of how we thought about allocating the capital. Paul Sankey : Okay. Thank you. And then one to add to the Guyana question, just wondering you said Payara very similar to Liza, but one can thus note explicitly net pay seems a lot less. Is there anything to say about that? Thank you. John Hess : I think the key thing there is we just have more appraisal to do, but we think it will be a significant resource in and of itself, how big it is, more appraisals necessary. Paul Sankey : I guess the question was I think you had 95 feet of net pay at Payara, which is less than half of the Liza? John Hess : Absolutely, but more appraisals necessary to find out what the resource size is going to be and so, let's wait for that appraisal before we can be more definitive about what the number is, but we do think Payara itself will be significant. Paul Sankey : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ryan Todd : Yeah, thanks. Maybe as we just look over the medium term in terms of managing and kind of cash inflows and outflows, you have a large cash balance on hand right now. As you look towards - but a decent sized outspend likely in 2017 as well, so as you look forward over the next few years, how do you anticipate drawing down that cash balance versus the preference towards kind of achieving cash flow neutrality? Gregory Hill : Sure. So, again the key is, as we've been talking about, we've been spending this capital on these development projects, North Malay Basin and Stampede and we're getting obviously closer to getting them both online and generating free cash. So, if you are looking from like a general guidance of where we are this year, if you were excluding basically North Malay Basin and Stampede\u2019s capital, our operating cash flow would cover CapEx and dividends in 2017 kind of at the current strip prices that we have. So, it's - and then going forward, it's like John just said, I mean obviously prices are going to play an important role in this, but we're trying to balance our investment in growth and this generation in free cash flow and we've always said 2018 will be the big transition year for us. Now we're generating free cash flow from this North Malay Basin in Stampede and we can use that cash flow now to begin to generate into our development projects, say, in Liza and other growth projects like in Bakken. So, we will balance that continually going forward. Ryan Todd : Okay. And any consideration I know it was asked earlier about your appetite for just additional acquisitions. I mean as you look about at the extent of your global portfolio on the flip side, do you look at - how do you - how is the appetite for additional monetization of resource across the portfolio either from some of your global assets or even a farm-down of Guyana in terms of either allowing you to fund future developments or accelerate capital deployment in places like the Bakken? John Hess : Yeah, now fair enough portfolio optimization, as I said before, is something we look at every day and is in the normal course of business. So we're always looking to optimize that and go where the value is and go where the returns are. Having said that, outright acquisitions are low on the priority list because what we have captured in our portfolio both short cycle and long cycle already offers very attractive returns to our shareholders. And in terms of Guyana, it offers such attractive returns that that is not looking at something that we would sell down. But as I said in our overall portfolio we're always looking to optimize and as opportunities present themselves we\u2019ll consider them. Ryan Todd : Great and maybe one quick follow-up on the Bakken, fourth quarter, as you mentioned in your comments and as we see in the data, in the fourth quarter you saw significant increase in well productivity at least in terms of 30-day IPs versus prior quarters. Can you talk a little bit about what the mix shift was in terms of 50-stage fracs 3Q versus 4Q? And is that a number what we saw in 4Q that we should view as kind of a more representative number of the drilling program going forward in terms of well productivity? Gregory Hill : Yeah, I think in the fourth quarter, you're right. All the wells that we drilled are 50-stage and that was truly in the core of the core. So, the best wells that we've drilled in the Bakken that 1091 barrels of oil, kind of IP30, those were the wells we were drilling in the fourth quarter. We will stay in the core in 2017 that will be the bulk of where our drilling is. Certainly, on average because of the 50-stage fracs, the IP90s and the IP30 rates will be higher in 2017 than they were in 2016. So, the whole inventory is not going to be the 1091 kind of IP30s. That was truly some extraordinary wells. So, it'll still be - the average is going to be higher this year than it was last year. So, good upside there. Ryan Todd : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy. Your line is now open. David Heikkinen : Good morning guys and congratulations on the ramp going into fourth quarter. One thing with all the moving parts of Valhall and Malay that is gas but oil linked, can you just give a BO expectation, just barrels of oil for the fourth quarter in that split for the overall corporate guidance? Gregory Hill : David, make sure I understand your question. David Heikkinen : You gave BOEs, what\u2019s just the barrels of oil in the fourth quarter? John Hess : Barrels of oil for the fourth quarter of 2016? David Heikkinen : Yeah, in that 330 to 340 guidance, what would be the split? John Hess : Oh, now I understand, now I understand in the fourth quarter number. So, we would be moving up considerably here. I'd say it's going to go up approximately almost close to 14%, I'd say, between the first quarter and the fourth quarter on the oil. So, you're going to see that jump clearly above in the range of 210,000 barrels a day plus in the fourth quarter for the oil in that number. David Heikkinen : That's very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Touhy Brothers. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Campbell : Good morning. I was just wondering if you can share any early impressions of [indiscernible] that takes over the operation at Valhall, I mean I don\u2019t think it\u2019s rude to say that sometimes we felt like the prior operators left something to be desired, so I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re feeling about them in your early impressions? Gregory Hill : Yeah, thanks for the question. I think John and I have met with their senior management twice over the course of the year as recently as a month ago and we\u2019re encouraged by their approach and we really look forward to working together with them to maximize value from the Valhall asset. Hess did a lot with BP and I\u2019ll credit BP with their progress that they\u2019ve made in the last couple of years using many of the techniques that we develop on South Arne, applying those to Valhall both lean manufacturing and some shaft drilling and well [indiscernible] techniques that we developed in the North Sea. Acre, BP is carrying on with that and we\u2019re excited that they can even drive more improvement beyond what BP was able to achieve with our help in the last couple of years. Jeffrey Campbell : Okay, great. I think we\u2019ll look forward to that. I just wanted to ask one quick question with regard to Guyana. It sounds like the Liza-1, the Liza-3 and Payara, all tested different formations. I was just wondering with the next well that\u2019s coming and the visible explorations that you see, are you going to be just essentially testing one of those once again in a different location or are you going to be testing an entirely new formation? Gregory Hill : Now, these are all upper cretaceous, so every one of these wells has been upper cretaceous. So all of the well test, everything that we\u2019re doing is all confined to the upper cretaceous. Even the Liza deep is upper cretaceous accumulation. Jeffrey Campbell : Okay, thank you, I appreciate. Gregory Hill : Do you mind, I just want to clarify something for the group that I gave because that was - you were specifically asking before oil. I had some liquids numbers in there, so again from an oil and liquid standpoint there will be a significant increase as you go into fourth quarter. Oil again will have a significant increase, but oil will be about 190,000 barrels a day plus in the fourth quarter and then liquids will be above that. Thank you. Operator : Thank you and I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. Thank you very much. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

John Herrlin - Societe Generale Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2017 Hess Corporation Conference Call. My name is Vince and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. As you know, Hess Midstream Partners LP completed its initial public offering earlier this month. Please be aware that even though the IPO was closed, we are still restricted by securities laws and what we can say about Hess Midstream Partners at this time. As such, our remarks today about Hess Midstream Partners will be very limited. We expect that Hess Midstream Partners will file its 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017 in May. Now, as usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will review the progress we are making in executing our strategy as well as highlights from the quarter. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance and John Rielly will then review our financial results. Our company has had more than a decade of visible production growth secured with an expanding resource base, declining operating and development costs and strong leverage to oil prices, all of which should improve our financial returns and create significant value for our shareholders. Production growth, which is set to resume beginning in the second half of 2017 is underpinned by the Bakken, the North Malay Basin and Stampede developments, and offshore Guyana, where we have participated in one of the industry's largest oil discoveries in the past 10 years. Key to funding these growth projects is a strong balance sheet. With $2.7 billion of cash and total liquidity of $7.2 billion as of March 31, our financial position remained strong. To provide insurance for oil price uncertainty and our increasing activity levels, we have hedged 80,000 barrels of oil per day for the balance of 2017, utilizing a put-call strategy that provides a floor of $50 per barrel for WTI and $55 per barrel for Brent, while retaining $20 per barrel upside from those price levels. To unlock additional value, earlier this month, we successfully completed the initial public offering of Hess Midstream Partners LP. The transaction, priced at $23 per unit, well above the indicated pricing range of $19 to $21 per unit. As a result of strong demand, the transaction was upside by 20%, resulting in net proceeds of $350 million to our Bakken Midstream joint venture, with $175 million attributable to Hess Corporation. In addition, the MLP provides another attractive long-term funding vehicle for our company. With regard to our growth projects, in the Bakken, where we have a premier acreage position in the core of the play, we added a third operated rig in March, a fourth rig in April, and plan to add two additional rigs in the fourth quarter. In Malaysia, the Hess operated North Malay Basin development, in which Hess has a 50% interest, is expected to come online in the third quarter, and add in excess of 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, becoming a long-term cash generator for the company. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Hess operated Stampede development, in which Hess has a 25% interest, is on track to start up in the first half of 2018, after which production is expected to ramp up to 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Offshore Guyana, in March our partner, ExxonMobil, announced another discovery at the Snoek prospect on the Stabroek Block. This oil discovery is additive to those at Liza, Liza deep, and Payara, which have an estimated recoverable resource range of between 1.4 billion barrels and 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Also, we see numerous additional exploration prospects on the block that collectively offer multi-billion barrels of un-risked upside potential. Planning for the development of the greater Liza area is underway, with final investment decision and project sanction of the first phase expected mid-year 2017, and first production by 2020. The development concept for Liza Phase I is based on a floating production, storage and offloading vessel or FPSO that will process approximately 120,000 barrels of oil per day, produced from two subsea drill centers. Liza Phase I offers attractive project economics down to $40 Brent flat. The greater Liza development has the potential to be transformational for our company and positions us for more than a decade of material reserve and production growth, and improving financial returns and cost metrics. Now, with regard to our financial results, in the first quarter of 2017, we posted a net loss of $324 million, or $1.07 per share, compared to a net loss of $509 million or $1.72 per share in the year ago quarter. Compared to 2016, our first quarter financial results were positively impacted by higher crude oil selling prices and lower operating costs and exploration expenses, which more than offset the change in deferred income taxes and lower production volumes. With activity increasing in 2017, our focus is on execution in terms of delivering production, progressing our offshore developments, and continuing to drive cost reductions and efficiencies. First quarter production was above our guidance range, averaging 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, driven by strong performance across our portfolio. Bakken production averaged 99,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, above the high end of our guidance range, despite challenging weather conditions during the quarter. In summary, with our strong financial and liquidity position, oil leverage portfolio and exciting growth opportunities, we believe the company is well positioned to deliver strong cash flow growth and compelling long-term value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update on our progress in 2017 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. Starting with production. In the first quarter, we averaged 307,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, which was above our guidance range of 290,000 to 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on the same basis, reflecting strong operating performance across our portfolio. Regarding second quarter guidance, we expect net production to average between 275,000 and 285,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, which is a 5,000 barrel per day increase versus our previous guidance. The second quarter is lower than the first quarter, primarily due to planned seasonal maintenance in the offshore. However, the third quarter will be a major inflection point for production, as positive momentum returns to our portfolio with North Malay Basin coming on-stream and Bakken production ramping as a result of the increased rig count. Our full year 2017 production guidance remains 300,000 to 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, but as usual, we will provide an update to full year guidance on our mid-year call in July. Turning to onshore operations for the quarter. In the Bakken, we recovered quickly from the temporary operational impacts of extreme weather conditions over December and January to average 99,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, beating our guidance of 90,000 to 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, while bringing on line some of the highest IP rate wells that we have seen to-date. We continue to see outstanding results in the Bakken, driven by high well availability and improved well performance from our 50-stage completions. We are seeing a consistent 15% to 20% increase in well productivity as a result of the shift to 50-stage completions from our previous 35-stage standard design. As discussed on our last call, we continue to trial higher stage counts and higher proppant loadings. While still early days, we're encouraged by initial results. We will gather additional production and cost data from these tests in the coming months and will provide an update on our July call. In March, as John noted, we added a third operated rig in the Bakken and April a fourth, and we currently plan to add two further rigs in the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we drilled 11 wells and brought 8 new wells online. This compares to the year ago quarter when we drilled 19 wells and brought 31 wells online. In 2017, we still expect to drill approximately 80 wells and bring approximately 75 new wells online. For the second quarter, we forecast net Bakken production to average approximately 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Libya, we were able to complete a lifting in March and the asset contributed net production of 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. Despite the resumption of production, the political situation in the country remains uncertain and therefore we continue to exclude Libya from our forecasts. Moving to offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. In the second quarter, a 34-day shutdown is planned for the Conger Field and a 44-day shutdown is planned for the Llano Field, which should result in our Gulf of Mexico production averaging between 50,000 and 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. In Norway at the Aker BP-operated Valhall Field, in which Hess has a 64% interest, drilling resumed in March from the platform rig and we expect the first well to come online in the fourth quarter. A further 11-day shutdown is planned in the second quarter at the Okume Complex in Equatorial Guinea. Net production from Equatorial Guinea averaged 31,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. For offshore developments, at North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, we are now in the final phases of the full field development. The central processing platform was successfully installed in March, and hookup and commissioning is progressing according to plan. The three remote wellhead platforms have been hooked up and commissioned. The FSO is scheduled to sail out during the second quarter. And all of the 14 wells planned for full field startup have been completed. Once full-field development is completed in the third quarter of this year, we expect net production to build fairly rapidly to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day, becoming a significant long-term cash generator for the company. At the Stampede development in the Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, we successfully completed the first production well and have spud a second well. Sail-away of the tension leg platform and the commencement of installation are scheduled for the second quarter. First oil remains on schedule for the first half of 2018. Now, turning to Guyana, in the Stabroek Block, in which Hess holds a 30% interest, the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited announced that the Snoek well, located approximately 5 miles southeast of the Liza-1 discovery well resulted in another oil discovery. The well encountered more than 82 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. The rig has now moved back to Liza to drill the Liza-4 appraisal well, which spud on March 31. This well is designed to further evaluate the significant Liza oil discovery and help define the full-field development plans. ExxonMobil estimates gross recoverable resources for the greater Liza area to be in the range of 1.4 billion to 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which is expected to support multiple phases of development. The Liza-4 and Payara-2 appraisal wells will evaluate the high side of this range. We plan to continue to progress exploration of the wider Stabroek Block in 2017 and 2018, on which we see numerous remaining prospects across multiple play types, representing multi-billion barrel un-risked upside potential. We expect to sanction the first phase of development of the Liza field around mid-year. This development is expected to be configured for gross production of approximately 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with first oil expected by 2020, and will generate attractive project economics down to $40 Brent flat. In closing, we have once again demonstrated excellent execution and delivery across our portfolio. With an attractive mix of captured short and long cycle opportunities and top quartile operating capabilities, we are well positioned for a decade of value driven reserve and production growth. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today I will compare results from the first quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2016. In the first quarter of 2017, we reported a net loss of $324 million compared with an adjusted net loss of $305 million in the previous quarter. Turning to E&P, E&P incurred a net loss of $233 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to an adjusted net loss of $256 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The changes in the after-tax components of E&P results between the first quarter of 2017 and adjusted results for the fourth quarter of 2016 were as follows. Higher realized selling prices improved results by $34 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $14 million. Lower cash operating costs improved results by $44 million. Lower exploration expenses improved results by $19 million. Lower Midstream tariffs improved results by $15 million. Changes in effective tax rate reduced results by $89 million. All other items net improved results by $14 million for an overall improvement in first quarter results of $23 million. The E&P effective income tax rate was a benefit of 13% for the first quarter of 2017 compared with the benefit of 43% in the fourth quarter, excluding items affecting comparability and Libyan operations. The lower effective tax rate in the first quarter is due to not recognizing a deferred tax benefit on operating losses in the U.S., Denmark and Malaysia as previously discussed when we provided 2017 guidance. For the first quarter, our E&P sales volumes were under-lifted compared with production by approximately 1.4 million barrels, which did not have a material impact on our results. Turning to Midstream. In April 2017, the Corporation and its partners successfully completed the IPO of Hess Midstream Partners and we received our net share of proceeds totaling $175 million. The IPO transaction had no impact on the Midstream segment first quarter results, but has been incorporated into our updated guidance for the remainder of the year. In addition, as we previously announced, commencing January 1, 2017, our Midstream segment now includes the Corporation's interest in a Permian Basin gas plant in West Texas and related CO2 assets, and our wholly-owned water handling assets in North Dakota. We have recast all prior period financial information to include these assets and the results as part of the Midstream segment. In our first quarter supplemental earnings information presentation located on the Hess website, we have provided quarterly consolidating income statements for 2016, recast to reflect the transfer of these assets from E&P to Midstream. In the first quarter of 2017, the Midstream segment had net income of $18 million compared to adjusted net income of $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which included the recognition of a full year of deferred minimum volume deficiency payments earned at year-end 2016. EBITDA for the Midstream before the non-controlling interest amounted to $94 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $102 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Turning to corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $109 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to adjusted after-tax corporate and interest expenses of $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The first quarter results reflect not recognizing a deferred tax benefit on operating losses. Turning to first quarter cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $443 million. The net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital was $94 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $390 million. Proceeds from asset sales were $100 million. Net repayments of debt were $21 million. Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $92 million. All other items resulted in an increase in cash of $8 million, resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the first of $46 million. The sale proceeds received in the quarter resulted from the sale of approximately 8,500 non-core net acres in the West Goliath area of the Bakken, which at the time was producing approximately 240 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Turning to cash and liquidity. Excluding the Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.7 billion, total liquidity of $7.2 billion, including available committed credit facilities, and debt of $6.54 billion at March 31, 2017. Now turning to guidance. First for E&P. In the first quarter, our E&P cash costs were $14.15 per barrel, which beat guidance on strong production performance and cost management. For the second quarter, E&P cash costs are expected to be in the range of $15.50 to $16.50 per barrel, reflecting the lower second quarter production guidance and higher planned offshore facility maintenance costs, with full year guidance of $15 to $16 per barrel remaining unchanged. DD&A per barrel in the second quarter is forecast to be $25 to $26 with full-year guidance remaining unchanged at $24 to $25 per barrel. The resulting total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be $40.50 to $42.50 per barrel in the second quarter, and $39 to $41 per barrel for the full year. Exploration expenses excluding dry holes are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million in the second quarter, with full-year guidance remaining unchanged at $250 million to $270 million. The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million in the second quarter, and $520 million to $550 million for the full year, which is unchanged from prior guidance. The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 10% to 14% for the second quarter. For the full year 2017, we now expect a benefit in the range of 12% to 16%, down from original guidance of 17% to 21% due to a change in mix of operating results. Turning to Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $15 million to $25 million in the second quarter. Midstream net income attributable to Hess for the full year is projected to be $65 million to $85 million, which is down from original guidance of $70 million to $90 million. The change reflects the increased non-controlling interest from the MLP as a result of the IPO. Turning to corporate, for the second quarter of 2017, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million, and interest expenses are estimated to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million. Full year guidance remains unchanged at $140 million to $150 million for corporate expenses, and $295 million to $305 million for interest expense. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning, Doug. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I've got two questions, if I may, and the first one is on the capital guidance or the capital for the year. It looks like your first quarter spending run rate is a little bit light relative to the annualized rate. Is that just a pending issue or are you running below what your expectations are? And I've got a follow-up in Guyana, please. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Doug, right now, we're forecasting our capital spending in Q2 through Q4 to be higher than what you're seeing in Q1 and there is a couple of reasons. I mean, as you know, we're going to be ramping up rigs in the Bakken from two rigs at the beginning of the year to six at year end. Now, we are also forecasting an increased spend mid-year as we get closer to the North Malay Basin startup in Q3. So, as you've seen, cost and capital have been performing well here in the first quarter. So we'll continue to monitor what we're doing through the year and as usual, we'll update our guidance in mid-year. But, right now, our guidance remains $2.25 billion. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks for that. My second question is on Guyana. There is a couple of thesis to it if you can bear with me for a minute. So my understanding is you've signed that joint interest agreement with Exxon covering the broader Guyana-Suriname Basin. Can you walk us through what that means in terms of your potential entry into additional blocks? And the second part of my question, however, is more to do with the timing of sanction. There still seems to be some concern over the potential for a substantial step-up in your spending as you moved into development phase. Can you walk us through what your latest thinking is in terms of flexibility to fund your share and whether you are in fact moving forward with a leased FPSO, because obviously there are different capital ramifications? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: All right. Doug, I'll start with your last question on the capital spend associated with the early production system and our flexibility to finance it. And I guess the first thing I should say is, we are working with the operator, and we are looking to sanction the early production system for Liza around midyear. So at that point everybody can see the numbers associated with that early production system. Now, we expect the Guyana development to be phased, so with the cost spread out over a number of years, and for initial phases of development to fund future phases as Greg talked about earlier. Now, as you said, at this point in our discussions with the operator, we are looking at leasing the FPSO which will reduce our upfront spend for the development. And then again going to our flexibility, these increase in expenditures in Guyana coincide with the startup of North Malay Basin and Stampede, which become cash generator starting in 2018. And the last thing I would like to remind everybody, we are sitting with $2.7 billion of cash right now in our balance sheet and we have a high leveraged oil prices. So, as you know, every $1 increase in oil price adds approximately $70 million of after-tax cash flow to our portfolio. So we are poised to benefit from any increase in oil prices. So, our flexibility is there to fund the Guyana development. And then, Greg? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. So, Doug, on your first question, first of all, there's been nothing signed yet. However, Exxon and Hess are, given our understanding of obviously the greater Guyana basin, I'll call it, we are looking for other potential opportunities to expand our footprint. I really can't say much beyond that. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I appreciate the answers guys. John, if I may, just a quick follow-up. On the flexibility issue, $700 million is the capital allocated to Stampede and North Malay this year. Is that right? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So, it was $700 million last year, and I think, hang on, for this year for Stampede and for North Malay Basin, we had $275 million budgeted for North Malay Basin and $425 million. So, yes, you are correct. That $700 million of capital associated with those two assets. So, in 2018, the capital will go down for those assets combined, plus cash flow will go up. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse : Yes. Good morning. First question on the Bakken, and congrats on that productivity improvement and beating the forecasts. Maybe an update on the decline rate of the base, because when I look at how many wells you're going to complete and the improvements in the productivity, it seems as if the production guidance you're giving is a little bit low, maybe it's just timing. But interested in the decline rate on the base production at this point. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Ed, I think, as you know, that's a very complicated question because you have a whole number of wells that are in the base at a very low decline rate. You have wells that have recently come on that are in either their first or their second year of decline. So, I think any \u2013 as you kind of look at production in the Bakken this year, it's purely a function of timing of when wells are coming on. As we mentioned in our opening remarks, that positive momentum really picks up in the second half of the year. As we put that third and fourth rig to work and start completing wells, that momentum really picks up. So that's really what's driving it. I always hate to answer the decline question because it's extremely complicated. Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse : Second question is then on costs. I mean, you did come in below guidance and obviously, with maintenance, it will go up a bit in the second quarter. But presumably, when that maintenance is completed later in the year, then some of the cost benefits you've seen may come back down. Is it sort of an inflation driver that means you haven't lowered your full year cash cost guidance at this point? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: No. I'd say it's more \u2013 it's basically more of our practice right now. It's early in the year. We've had good cost performance and good production performance, so it was both of those combined on how we came in under our cash cost guidance. In the second quarter, as you said, we will have the higher maintenance cost and a higher cash cost. So, as you move to the third quarter, yes, the cost reduction efforts that we have been \u2013 that had been ongoing, and we did some further cost reductions at the end of 2016, will come back into the portfolio. The other thing that will happen is that North Malay Basin starts up in the third quarter. And that from our portfolio will be very accretive to cash cost because that is a low cash cost asset. So as North Malay Basin continues to ramp up in the third and then into the fourth quarter, that will help our cash costs as well. So, what we'll see is by our next earnings call, right, we'll have gotten through the maintenance season, we'll see where North Malay Basin is from the startup standpoint on timing and then we'll update our cash cost guidance at that point. Edward Westlake - Credit Suisse : I look forward to that update. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Good morning, all. Just the specifics, firstly, on your volume guidance. Can you just walk us through how we get to the fourth quarter guidance which is specified to be 330,000 to 340,000 barrels a day oil equivalent, but then within oil, we're interested in the 182,000 to 186,000 barrels a day. It seems low relative to where you are today. Could you just bridge us through why it's not higher? This is for 2017 obviously. Thanks. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, Paul, I think as we said in our opening remarks, we did update guidance for the second quarter, so we're up about 5,000 barrels a day versus our previous guidance. And we will, of course, mid-year give a revised update, or a new update, I should say, on what the guidance is for the year and for the remaining quarters. The reason we haven't updated our guidance yet is because, again, North Malay Basin, we just want to have some greater certainty on exactly when that's going to start up. So once that's clear, which will be in the second quarter, the exact date of startup, then we'll be in a better position to update guidance for the rest of the year. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : You hit the kind of area that we were thinking was the main reason. Is there anything else other than North Malay Basin that would be contributing or detracting from the outlook? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. So that's the major uncertainty. Great. And then if I could just ask a strategy question. With Guyana being what it is, is there any future for any other wildcat exploration? Is there any need for any other wildcat exploration for you guys in the future or can we say that that's the end of it really globally and Guyana plus Bakken is everything you need? Thanks. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah, no. Paul, we're going to be very selective and focused and capital disciplined in our efforts in exploration. As you know, our strategy has been and continues to be early access to material resource opportunities with running room focused on oil, Atlantic Margin, at low cost. And obviously that strategy is working in Guyana and Suriname Basin. A great example where Liza, Payara, the greater Liza area, already world-class in their own right, will generate very attractive returns down to $40 Brent flat, competitive with any unconventional play, and in our opinion even better. So, it's all about focusing on returns and creating long-term value that I think is going to distinguish our company for many years to come. Beyond that, we still see in the Guyana-Suriname Basin further un-risked multi-billion potential and that's where the majority of our efforts is going to be. Yes, there will be some wildcatting, but it will be within our framework of capital discipline and keeping a tight rein on our spending. So, we will spend some money outside of that, but the majority of our exploration efforts will be focused on Guyana. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you, John. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Morris of Citi. Your line is open. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. On the Bakken production that exceeded your guidance, you mentioned that you had some of the highest IP rate wells to-date. Is that performance \u2013 is there something beyond just the uplift from the 50-stage completions that's driving that outperformance and the strong well results there? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. I think it's really, the uplift is a 50-stage completions plus we're drilling in the Keene area, which is truly the core of the core of the Bakken. You noticed that our performance was up in fourth quarter of last year. That strong performance continued into the first quarter of this year and it's really a function of where we're drilling on the 50-stage fracs. Those were the two factors for both quarters. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And is the Keene area where you plan to drill and bring on most of the 80 wells and 75 wells for the year? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I mean a good majority of the wells will be in that section. As we increase the rig count, we'll stay in the core, but we'll be moving out of the core of the core which is really the Keene. So, our whole drilling program will be in the core this year, but not all of it will be in the keen area, simply because of some of the operational challenges of operating that many rigs in the same place, a lot of SIMOPS issues. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And finally there, where do you stand on maybe accelerating the rig adds (38:09)? You'd commented last quarter that depending on cash on the oil price that you could accelerate a fifth rig or sixth rig in Q3 versus Q4. Is that still dependent on what cash flow and oil prices are to do that? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. I think our current plan is still to add that rig in the fourth \u2013 add those two rigs in the fourth quarter. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just separately my follow-on is, in Guyana and from your comments that you've made so far with the 120,000 barrel per day FPSO, it appears that you will develop Payara and Snoek as part of that FPSO development with Liza, would that be the correct assumption? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, I think the assumption would be that there will be a greater Liza area development. So, as you get into full-field development, consider Liza and Payara as kind of one, Snoek yet to be determined, but it will most likely be tied into that greater Liza Payara development plan. I did want to correct one of my remarks in the opening. I said the Phase I is 120,000 barrel equivalents, it's actually 120,000 barrels of oil per day facility. So I wanted to correct that on the call. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Nice quarter. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Following up on a couple of the earlier questions with regards to the Bakken. You talked about in the press release some weather delays. Could you quantify what that was and then add a little bit more color on the \u2013 and then how, if those weather delays have gone away, that still leaves flat production sequentially or flattish production sequentially in the second quarter versus further step up? And then, I think, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you are planning an update in July on what these completions and the effectiveness they are having. But, can you give us your hypothesis for the 50-stage completions and what that does for EURs and recovery rates? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, I think, let me answer your last question first. So the 50-stage completions, we quote now, IP90 rates versus IP30, because we just think that's a better reflection of \u2013 that takes in the operational impacts. So, with the IP90s now, we're showing, in this quarter it was close to 800, I think, it was 793. And then the EURs \u2013 the corresponding EURs are in the range of about 1 million barrels. So that's on the 50-stage fracs. As I mentioned, in the first quarter, we're doing a lot of experimentation with higher stage counts. So we've got a number of 60-stage completions in the ground now. So we're actually considering did we just move to 60-stage. We want to get a few more on the ground to make sure they are reliable, make sure we understand the production performance of those. So that will be one thing that we'll update in July as we said. We've also got a few wells with higher proppant loadings. We plan to do more of those in the second quarter. So, again, all of this is a bit influx, which is why I said we will update all of that EURs, IPs, well costs, we'll update everything in our second quarter mid-year update as always. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. And then \u2013 go ahead, I'm sorry. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: In regard to your first quarter \u2013 yeah, sorry, your question on the first quarter, the weather really hit us in January. So we fully recovered from that in February and March, and as we mentioned, the current forecast for Bakken in the second quarter is about 100,000 barrels a day. So up a bit from the first quarter, and then you really begin to see, as we mentioned, the production momentum from the Bakken really kicking in in the third quarter and fourth quarter as you get the impact of that third and fourth rig being able to start completing wells in the last half of the year. So that's why the first and second is relatively flat, because you're drilling, you're not completing those wells from the third and the fourth rig. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. And my follow-up is with regards to actually the completion side. As you do plan to ramp up, then especially if you are increasing the stage counts of some of those completions, can you talk about what you are seeing in the Bakken in terms of both the cost on a pressure pumping side, and then also the availability from a people perspective and a sand and sand logistics perspective? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I think so. Certainly, on the \u2013 again, we'll update this mid-year, but the results of the higher stage counts, and although a few \u2013 only a few wells, the higher proppant loadings are encouraging. So that's good. Now in regards to your second question, we are seeing some upward pressure on costs in the Bakken in the completion space as you said. We've taken a lot of steps to really minimize that. Several things that we've done. We're locking in the rig rates. We're pre-purchasing sand and we're putting in place longer-term contracts both on the rigs and also on the pumping side. So these steps coupled with our Lean manufacturing approach where we still make operational improvements give us confidence that we'll be able to deliver our 2017 program with minimal inflation. There may be some, but we're really trying to minimize that as much as possible. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Phillip Jungwirth of BMO. Your line is open. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning. I believe there is a tender for a second rig in Guyana and I was wondering if you could discuss any plans, whether development or exploration and timing for the second rig? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Can't really discuss timing yet, because it's dependent obviously upon sanction, Phase I, which we hope to do in midyear. The current thinking is that we will probably have one rig dedicated to do exploration/appraisal and then as you move into development on Phase I, then you'll probably have a rig dedicated for drilling the development wells of Phase I. So that's the current thinking but again, we haven't made final decisions on when that second rig comes into the play, that's up to the operator. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then, when you do sanction Liza Phase I this summer, would you anticipate that incremental disclosure would be limited to Phase I or could you also provide some color on Phase II or a potential multi-phased development? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: I think you should assume for now that it will be primarily just a Phase I development disclosure because, again, this is going to be a large development, multi-FPSOs that are phased over a number of years. So that's going to require a lot of planning and thinking and all that kind of stuff and, as to how you sequence all that. So I think you could expect later color on that. So the first disclosure will be primarily on Phase I. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then you have the Penn State well that's expected to be brought online in the third quarter, and I was just wondering if you could talk to the opportunity set in the Gulf of Mexico for a similar subsea tieback wells, such as this, which I believe is expected to IP around 10,000 barrels a day? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, that's a good question. I think we see a number of similar opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico. And I think as we've said in the past, when we would add a rig in the Gulf of Mexico is really going to be a function of the oil price, as you see more strength in the oil price. We will bring that into consideration because I think as we've said before, you're going to want more strength in the offshore before you do that because typically you'll commit to a very expensive rig, although a lot cheaper now, but you'll commit to a rig and so you want to have confidence that you have a pretty good oil price outlook before you commit to that very high cost rig line and associated equipment, different than the onshore. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thanks. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is open. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, guys. Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Greg, will you be able to share any estimate that for the early production system, how much reserve that you guys expect that? Is it, say, 500 million or 600 million barrel that you will be able to extract from that and what the development cost may look like? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Paul, I think, we will share as much as we can when we sanction Phase I, so hopefully mid-year. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And you guys is not at a position that you will be able to share about the new discovery in Guyana what may be the estimated size? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. Because remember, we just finished that well in March. So there is still a lot of evaluation going on with the Snoek prospect. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Maybe this is for John Rielly. John, when looking at the international unit OpEx cost, from the fourth to the first quarter, you had really dropped a lot and your production actually internationally have gone down. So I am a little bit, unclear to me why the unit costs have come down that much? Is it just purely as simple as that because you're under lift so that the \u2013 but your production is higher, so that means that the causes only reflect what is being lifted. Is there any other explanation that you can give us? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So the cost reduction doesn't have anything to do with the under lift. In the fourth quarter when you're looking at those numbers, if you remember, we had some non-recurring special items and one of them was an inventory write-off, so on the international side we had approximately a $30 million pre-tax inventory write-off that's in those operating cost in the fourth quarter. So you had that special. Then even with that you can see, even across our U.S. and international though we have reduced cost throughout the portfolio, and are continuing to focus on that. Obviously, good production performance helps, but we did go through a lot of cost reduction efforts through 2016 and it bore some fruit as you can see in the first quarter. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So, I mean, just for the inventory write-down, I mean, your fourth quarter will drop to, say, call it $15.50, but you're still about $2 lower in the first quarter. So is that is all just by normal course of your cost reduction (49:48)? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes, correct, it's normal cost execution. Correct. It's just normal execution, good performance across the portfolio. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just curious there, I mean, in Permian, since that you really have no production there, why don't we just sell Permian into your MLP or sell to some other people, why keep the Permian gas plant under Hess today? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Okay. So, just to start with the Permian, so in the first quarter, it's still producing 8,000 barrels a day, so it's not an absolute material amount, but it's producing 8,000 barrels a day, and it's generating cash flow for the company. Now, what we have done is from an MLP standpoint, it's the gas plant and the CO2 where you don't take the E&P type commodity price exposure to put it in the Midstream. So we are, as I talked about moving the Permian gas plant and the CO2 asset into our Midstream segment, and that happened on January 1, and we did recast the prior 2016. So we have taken steps. Now, we still have that 100%. It has not been dropped into our joint venture with GIP, but it's something that's under discussion. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Final one for Greg. At six rigs, if we assume that you exit from there and stay there, what kind of Bakken target production growth rate from 2018 to 2020 we could expect? And also that, given the wide (51:26) commodity prices, and let's assume somewhere between $60 million to $70 million (51:31), what is the optimal Bakken petrol production rate that you guys is currently foreseeing? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Paul, so we'll give guidance obviously as we approach 2018. The reason I don't want to be more specific than that is because, remember, our completion design is in flux, right? So what the future completion design will be, will be a large factor in saying what the growth rate at the Bakken will be with six rigs. What we do know right now is it takes about 3.25 rigs to hold the Bakken flat at this roughly 100,000 barrels a day, let's call it. So, clearly, any rigs above that is going to be growth, but depending on the completion design, the rate of that growth might vary. So we'll give guidance as we kind of complete these completion trials and determine what the completion design is on a go forward basis. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Your line is open. Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International : Thanks very much for taking the call. I wanted to follow up on the Bakken and the pilot programs you have planned this year. But to what extent are better well results from your pilot programs, the 60-stage fracs, the higher proppant loadings factored into your 4Q 2017 Bakken production guidance? And would there be any upside to that guidance if you do begin to see an improvement in your IP rates? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: So, none of that's built into the guidance yet. And that's why we hope to update things in the middle of the year. Given the early results of the 60-stage wells, and even though few, but we'll do more in the second quarter of the higher proppant loading, the bias will be for that guidance to go up. Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International : Got it. That's helpful. And then, the oil cut in the Bakken looks like it also increased pretty considerably to its highest level since 2015 I believe. But can you talk about what the driver may have been of that higher oil cut this quarter? And is that higher level sustainable? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, it's not. So the \u2013 it's purely operational. If you look at the well GORs, it's about 15.50% (53:57). That has stayed constant for years and will stay constant in the future. It was purely operational, related to the weather in the first quarter where we had some compressor downtime, so you threw a lot more gas to flare than what you normally would have in normal operation. So that's what's causing that aberration in higher oil versus gas this quarter. Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International : Okay. Great. And then last one from me. I just wanted to circle back to the 1Q just overall production outperformance. But obviously you beat expectations. The Bakken was very strong. Where else did you outperform relative to the internal plan? The Gulf of Mexico looked good relative to our estimates, was that a driver? And on that note, can you give us an update on how Tubular Bells is performing and what expectations are for that asset this year? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: So, you're right. The Bakken was up about 7,000 barrels a day versus what we thought. The other 5,000 was really kind of spread out across the portfolio. But you're right, it was primarily the Gulf of Mexico that came in performing better. If you look at TBells, as we said in our January call, in Q1 we increased water injection and began slowly bringing on our fifth producer and also that well that we worked over right at the end of last year. So we're bringing those wells on very slowly and as a result, production continues to increase on Tubular Bells. So while those trends are encouraging, what I said last quarter is I really want to see some constant stable production on Tubular Bells before I forecast what it's going to do. So I'd like to see a few more months of stable production and injection data before we issue kind of a new full year forecast for TBells. But quarter-on-quarter, TBells is up about 4,000 barrels a day. Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International : And so what did that bring with the 1Q 2017 average to for TBells if you can share it? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: The first quarter was \u2013 average for TBells is about 13,000. Currently, we are kind of in the range of 18,000 to 19,000 barrels a day on TBells. So it continues to ramp. We're taking it very slowly, very cautiously and also watching hopefully the impact of water injection as well. Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, guys. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Hi, Evan. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Maybe first a strategic question. I mean, as Liza moves into development and Guyana through the exploration phase, how do you think about managing your position size relative to the total portfolio, meaning how, if or when do you consider monetizing or selling down any interest to pull forward the significant value there? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. We see exceptional value and returns in our position in Guyana and a lot more upside in some of the future drilling that we have there, so we're very happy with our position. If it makes sense to pull value forward, we might look at some others levers in the portfolio, because one of the best returns I think in the industry is going to be the investment we make in Guyana, the fact that it has very attractive economics with what we already have captured in the greater Liza area down to $40 Brent flat and a lot of upside potential. So there is a lot more running room there and it's going to be very low cost on the cost curve, so we think it's going to have exceptional return. So, we want light to shine on that and wouldn't want to be premature in terms of anything else. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's fair. John, maybe a follow-up to the 2017 hedges renew. I know that's been an variable program over time. Is there any change in your commodity outlook or hedging strategy given the significant investment potential within the portfolio and any comments there? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Obviously with the uncertainty about oil prices, we do think we're entering a new chapter of oil prices where they will start going up to attract more investment in the business, but we certainly think we're still in a volatile period and with the increase in activity levels that we have, we just thought having some price insurance for this year would be a wise idea. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And maybe lastly if I could. Just following up on the Bakken beat, I mean, it looks like the IP90 well performance was in line Q-over-Q from the ops report that was just filed. And so is the variance of the beat largely as you look at a completion timing in December and 1Q, I mean, given that you beat the Bakken with just eight wells TIL'd (59:01) in the quarter? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I think it was a combination of things. It was a combination of a little bit better well performance than planned in our 50-stage fracs. The second factor was we recovered from the weather much quicker, much more rapidly than we anticipated. So those were the few big things, Evan. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. So your plan is below the current performance and from at least IP90 basis that we see in the Bakken from 4Q and now into 1Q, is that right? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: It was in the first Q, so the wells did a little better than we thought in the first Q. Yeah. We only got eight wells on remember, so. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Appreciate it, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. First question on timing. When do you expect the third and sixth rigs coming to the Bakken to show a positive production effect in 2018? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, it will be late in the fourth quarter. So you really won't see any impact of those rigs in 2017, it will be primarily in 2018. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Right. And that was what I was wondering. When do you think that will start to show up in 2018? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Second quarter. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay, great. Touching on John's remarks earlier about future wildcatting. I was just wondering, do you consider drilling offshore Nova Scotia in 2018 wildcatting to some extent? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yes. That would be one of the wells that we would have a commitment on, but again, the majority of our exploration program is going to be very focused and the majority of the dollars are going to go to Guyana. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. And my last question. Utica Shale, Appalachian NGL prices have improved significantly. Industry peers are attempting an enhanced rates of return by drilling ultra long laterals, and this is also showing up in the Southwest PA Marcellus. I was just wondering if you could update your thinking on the Utica? Are you watching this long lateral trend? What needs to happen in the commodities to get rig into the Utica again? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. I think you're right. I think we are watching long laterals. Obviously, we are watching the margins change and the gas prices go higher. There are no plans for us right now to bring any rigs back into the Utica in 2017. But obviously, as those trends improve, we'll begin to evaluate do we bring a rig back in the Utica. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that you're kind of drilling in the core of the core Keene area now and I was just kind of curious, out of the 2,850 future locations, how many locations you'd assign to this area if you could? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, I think maybe a better way to answer it without being specific. Keene, we have several hundred wells that can deliver the kind of performance that we're seeing in the last couple of quarters. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : So, you've got well more than the 2017 drilling program that carries into 2018, and maybe even a little longer (1:02:21). Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: We do, and the only \u2013 again, the only reason you wouldn't concentrate all of your drilling there is simply because of SIMOPS issues. You just can't have that many rigs concentrated in one place like that. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : That's really helpful. Okay. That was it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line.. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question, guys. Just two quick ones about the Liza FID. Once you reach FID, you're presumably going to be booking some reserves. Do you have a sense of what you'll be able to book upfront in 2017? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, when we take sanction, we'll obviously give you a lot more color on that. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. So still figuring that out. And then the timing of reaching FID, is there any relevance in the fact that there're still a border dispute involving Venezuela? Is that going to be influencing the timing at all, the political landscape? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: No. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Societe Generale. Your line is open. John Herrlin - Societe Generale : Yeah. One for Greg regarding Guyana. You talked about good returns with $40 flat pricing. Obviously, rig costs are cheaper, but how are cycle times changing for the deepwater as well as other cost like completion for the deepwater, because the Street's very fixated these days on (1:04:06) shale earnings, but what's happening in the deepwater that you could pinpoint? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, I think obviously specific to Guyana, it's unique in itself because it's shallower wells, these are only about 13,000 feet to 15,000 feet below the mud line, so it's a bit of a unique province in itself. I think the broader question around industry and deepwater, obviously the costs are coming down still, particularly in the shipyard area, where shipyards now are half full and projected to be even less than that. Next year, still some softness in the offshore rig market. So, the price trends are awesome in the deepwater and that bodes well obviously for our Guyana development, both of those dimensions. Also, there is a broad effort in the industry and very significant effort in Hess around standardization. So I think all of that is going to significantly improve the cycle time. You have shipyards focused on much of your projects. You will have industry focused on standardization. So all of that is really collapsing the cycle time of when you can bring these things on, which is good. John Herrlin - Societe Generale : Great. Thanks. That's it from me. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

My name is Vince and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the risk factor section of Hess's annual report and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Now as usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will provide an update on our progress in executing our strategy including a number of major milestones achieved in the quarter. Greg Hill will then review our operating performance and John Rielly will review our financial results. We believe our company has the best long-term growth outlook in our history, as well as one of the best in the industry. It is value driven with an increasing resource base, production growth, lower cost per barrel and improving financial returns. Our growth is underpinned by four key areas; the Bakken; North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand; Stampede in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and offshore Guyana. With regard to the Bakken, we have an industry-leading strategic position with more drilling locations in the core of the play than any other operator. We are currently operating four rigs at 60-stage fracs and increased proppant levels should deliver production growth of approximately 10% a year over the next several years. With our productivity and technology improvements, we now forecast virtually the same production growth with four rigs that would've taken six rigs a year ago. We will decide whether to add two additional rigs as originally planned based on an improvement in crude oil prices and the results of our enhanced completions. Second quarter net production in the Bakken averaged 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to 106,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, we forecast Bakken production to average approximately 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the high end of our previous guidance of 95,000 barrels to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to strong performance by our Bakken team and results of our new completions. In the Gulf of Thailand, the North Malay Basin Full Field Development achieved first production of natural gas earlier this month. Hess is the operator with 50% interest and Petronas is our partner with the remaining 50%. We are still in the process of commissioning the field and expect net production to reach its planned plateau rate of 165 million cubic feet a day of natural gas during the third quarter. North Malay Basin is expected to generate strong and stable production and cash flows for many years to come. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Hess operated Stampede Development in which Hess has a 25% interest is on track to start up in the first half of 2018. Net production is expected to increase throughout 2018 and reach a peak rate of approximately 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Turning to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator. In June, we announced positive results from the Liza-4 well, which encountered more than 197 feet of net pay. Yesterday, the operator announced successful results from the Payara-2 appraisal well with 59 feet of net pay, which confirms a second giant oil field discovered in Guyana and increases Payara gross discovered recoverable resources to approximately 500 million barrels of oil equivalent. Gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block, which include discoveries at Liza, Liza Deep, Snoek and Payara have now been increased to an estimated 2.25 billion to 2.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In addition, to the considerable resources discovered to-date, we see additional multi-billion barrels of unrisked exploration potential on the Stabroek Block. In June, we also sanctioned the first phase of a planned multi-phased development of the Liza Field, which is expected to have a gross capital cost of approximately $3.2 billion for drilling and subsea infrastructure and will develop approximately 450 million barrels of oil, with first production expected by 2020. The development will utilize a leased floating production storage and offloading vessel that will have the capacity to process up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day. The Liza Phase I development offers very attractive financial returns and a rapid cash payback with a manageable pace of investment. Hess' net share of development costs is forecast to be approximately $955 million, of which $110 million is already included in our 2017 capital and exploratory budget. Of the remaining net development costs, approximately $250 million is expected in 2018 and approximately $330 million in 2019, with the balance in 2020 and 2021. Our success in Guyana is transformational and positions our company for a decade plus of resource and production growth with improving returns and cost metrics. Funding these growth opportunities requires a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, which remain a top priority for our company. At June 30, we had $2.5 billion of cash and total liquidity of $6.8 billion and we continue to take steps to keep our financial position strong. In April, we successfully completed the initial public offering of Hess Midstream Partners LP resulting in net proceeds of $175 million to Hess Corporation. The MLP structure will allow us to further unlock value with a combination of embedded growth in EBITDA as Bakken production continues to increase and through future drop downs. Hess Midstream Partners LP will announce its second quarter results tomorrow. Our success in Guyana also provides us with the opportunity to consider the divestment of mature higher cost assets, which can accelerate their value while upgrading our overall portfolio and also providing additional funding for our high return growth opportunities. Last month we announced an agreement to sell our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian Basin for a total consideration of $600 million. This transaction is on track to close on August 1. In addition, we expect net cash flow to improve over the next several years as our $700 million of annual spend for North Malay Basin and Stampede winds down and these two projects go from being sizable cash users to significant long-term cash generators for the company. In the current low price environment, we continue our efforts to reduce both capital and operating costs. For the second quarter, E&P capital and exploratory expenditures were $528 million and we now project our full year 2017 capital and exploratory expenditures to be $2.15 billion, or $100 million below our previous forecast. It should also be noted that our major growth projects, the Bakken, North Malay Basin, Stampede, and Liza are all expected to have cash unit operating costs that are substantially below our current portfolio average. Now turning to our financial results, in the second quarter of 2017 we posted a pre-tax loss of $425 million, which reflects improved operating results compared to the pre-tax loss of $678 million in the second quarter of last year. On an after-tax basis, our net loss was $449 million, or $1.46 per common share compared with the net loss of $392 million, or $1.29 per common share in the second quarter of 2016, reflecting a lower effective tax rate in 2017 resulting from a required change in deferred tax accounting. Second quarter production was above our guidance range averaging 294,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, driven by strong performance across our portfolio. Net production in Libya was 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. For the full year 2017, we now expect net production of 305,000 to 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, which is at the upper end of our previous guidance, even with the sale of our Permian EOR assets that have net production of approximately 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Production growth resumes beginning in the third quarter. And fourth quarter production is expected to average 7% to 10% higher than last year's fourth quarter pro forma for the sale of our Permian EOR assets. In addition, we expect next year to show strong growth driven by higher activity levels in the Bakken, a full year of production from the North Malay Basin, the startup of the Stampede field, and a full year of drilling at Valhall. In summary, we are well positioned to deliver value-driven growth to our shareholders with our strong short cycle position in the Bakken, our two offshore developments in North Malay Basin and Stampede expected to deliver a combined 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and our world-class development in Guyana, which also offers significant further exploration potential. We continue to prioritize a strong cash position and balance sheet to fund this growth, which we believe will create compelling value for our shareholders for many years to come. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update of our operational performance in 2017 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. Starting with production, in the second quarter, we averaged 295,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This was 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day above the midpoint of our guidance range of 275,000 to 285,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong performance across our portfolio, particularly in the Bakken. The third quarter will be a major inflection point for us in terms of production growth. We forecast net production to average between 295,000 and 305,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. The startup of production from the North Malay Basin Full-Field Development is expected to more than offset the impact of the sale of our Permian EOR assets, as well as a now completed unplanned 10-day shutdown in July at the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand to replace a flare tip. Our positive production momentum will continue in the fourth quarter, with a full quarter of production from North Malay Basin, a continuing ramp up in the Bakken, and as we bring online new wells at the Valhall Field in Norway and our Penn State field in the Gulf of Mexico. As John noted, given our strong operating performance year-to-date and even with the sale of our Permian EOR asset, which is currently producing about 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, we now forecast full year 2017 production to average between 305,000 and 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is the upper end of our previous guidance range. Turning now to onshore operations, net production from the Bakken averaged 108,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, significantly beating our guidance of approximately 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, as the productivity of our new wells continues to perform higher than forecast. As noted in our last call, we added a third operated rig in the Bakken in March and a fourth in April. As a result of our strategy to preserve capability during the downturn, we were able to onboard these two rigs safely and with a high degree of efficiency. During the second quarter, we drilled 23 wells and brought 13 new wells online compared to the year-ago quarter when we drilled 20 wells and brought 26 wells online. We also completed 14 wells in the quarter. We continue to test higher stage counts and proppant loading in line with our focus on maximizing the value of our DSUs. We currently have six 60-stage wells online and 11 wells completed with proppant loading of up to 140,000 pounds per stage. While still early days, we continue to be encouraged by the initial results from our new completions. Drilling and completion costs for our 60-stage 70,000 pound per stage wells are averaging between $4.5 million and $5 million, which is approximately $0.5 million below our initial guidance range. This result reflects our distinctive Lean manufacturing approach, which continues to drive improvement in our operations. Drilling and completion costs for the higher-proppant wells are in line with our previous guidance of $5.5 million to $6 million. To mitigate the risk of rising sand prices, in the second quarter, we pre-purchased our sand requirements for the balance of 2017, which is expected to save us between 15% and 20% versus current spot prices. Based on encouraging production performance from our trials and the positive outputs that our predictive models are showing, we have decided to move to 60-stage completions as our new standard, while continuing to evaluate the impact of higher proppant loadings up to 140,000 pounds per stage. Early results and predictive model outputs suggest a potential 10% to 15% uplift in EUR as a result of the higher stage counts and proppant loading. In addition, we are able to raise full year 2017 average IP 90 guidance to between 800 and 850 barrels of oil per day, an increase of 100 barrels of oil per day compared to our earlier guidance. The material increases in performance that have been achieved this year now allow us to hold Bakken production flat with 2.5 rigs versus 3.25 rigs required a year ago. Given the strong performance of our Bakken wells in the first half of the year, we forecast net Bakken production for the third quarter to average between 105,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the fourth quarter to average between 110,000 and 115,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This results in an increase to our full year guidance for the Bakken of 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to approximately 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent. Now moving to the offshore, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 51,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the second quarter, as planned shutdowns were successfully completed at non-operated host facilities for the Conger and Llano fields. No significant shutdowns are planned for the third quarter and production is forecast to average between 60,000 and 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the Gulf of Mexico. We also successfully drilled a new production well in the Penn State field. The well is currently being completed and is expected to be online in the fourth quarter. In Norway, at the Aker BP operated Valhall Field in which Hess has a 64% interest, net production averaged 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter. We drilled and are currently completing the first well of a seven well campaign and have spud the second well. The first well was drilled 38 days ahead of schedule and is now expected to come online late in the third quarter. A 10-day shutdown is planned for the third quarter, over which net production is expected to average approximately 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day before increasing to approximately 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. Moving to offshore developments. First gas was introduced to the platform on July 10 from the Full-Field Development of the North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand, in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator with Petronas as our partner. The North Malay Basin project delivery was achieved with first gas only three years after project sanction. We are still in the process of commissioning but expect net production to build to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day net during the third quarter and the asset to become a significant long-term cash generator for the company. At the Stampede Development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, the Tension Leg Platform was installed and hook up and commissioning are progressing to schedule. One well has been drilled and completed and completion operations are underway on the second and third wells. First oil is planned for first half of 2018. Now moving to the offshore Guyana. In June, we sanctioned the first phase of the multi-phased development of the Liza Field, in which Stabroek Block operated by ExxonMobil and in which Hess holds a 30% interest. This is an asset of exceptional scale with a high quality multi-DRC (20:57) permeability reservoir and attractive financial returns at oil prices down to $35 Brent. Phase I will utilize a leased floating production storage and offloading vessel that will have the capacity to process up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day. First oil is expected by 2020, only three years after sanction. With regard to the continuing exploration and appraisal of the Stabroek Block, as John noted, in mid-June we announced positive results for the Liza-4 well where we encountered 197 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. Yesterday, ExxonMobil announced the successful result of the Payara-2 well, which encountered 59 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. This positive result increases the gross discovered recoverable resource at Payara to approximately 500 million barrels of oil equivalent confirming the partnership's second giant oil field discovery in Guyana. The well results increase the currently discovered gross recoverable resource on the Stabroek Block to between 2.25 billion and 2.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We plan to continue to progress exploration of the wider Stabroek Block during the remainder of 2017 and 2018 where we see numerous remaining prospects across multiple play types representing multi-billion barrel unrisked upside potential on this 6.6 million acre block. Current thinking is that after completing the evaluation of Payara-2, the rig will move to the Turbid (22:44) prospect and then to the Ranger prospect. Earlier this month, we also announced early entry to Block 59 and Suriname together with our co-venture partners, ExxonMobil and Statoil, and in which Hess holds a one-third interest. This 2.8 million acre block shares a maritime border with Guyana and extensions of the play fairways that we see in Stabroek. Block 59 is also contiguous to the 1.3 million acre Block 42 and Suriname in which Hess holds a one-third interest with our co-venture partner Chevron and Kosmos. In closing, we have once again demonstrated excellent execution and delivery across our portfolio. Our production momentum continues with ever stronger results from the Bakken, the commissioning of the North Malay Basin Full-Field Development, and planned first oil from Stampede in the first half of 2018. Together with our partners in Guyana, we have sanctioned the first phase of development of the world-class Liza Field and the potential of the Stabroek Block continues to get bigger and better. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today I will compare results from the second quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2017. In the second quarter of 2017, we reported a net loss of $449 million compared with a net loss of $324 million in the previous quarter. Turning to Exploration and Production, E&P incurred a net loss of $354 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to a net loss of $233 million in the first quarter of 2017. The changes in the after-tax components of E&P results between the second quarter and first quarter of 2017 were as follows; lower realized selling prices reduced results by $51 million. Changes in sales mix driven by Gulf of Mexico maintenance reduced results by $26 million. Higher DD&A expense reduced results by $16 million. Unrealized losses due to crude oil hedge ineffectiveness reduced results by $16 million. All other items reduced results by $12 million for an overall decrease in second quarter results of $121 million. The E&P effective income tax rate was a benefit of 8% for the second quarter of 2017 compared with the benefit of 13% in the first quarter excluding Libyan operations. For the second quarter, our E&P sales volumes were under lifted compared with production by approximately 290,000 barrels, which did not have a material impact on our results. Turning to Midstream, in the second quarter of 2017, the Midstream segment had net income of $16 million which was down from net income of $18 million in the first quarter of 2017 due to a non-recurring charge of $3 million related to our Permian midstream business. EBITDA for the Midstream, before the non-controlling interest, amounted to $96 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $94 million in the first quarter of 2017. Turning to Corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $111 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $109 million in the first quarter of 2017. Turning to second quarter cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities, before changes in working capital, was $332 million. The net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital amounted to $167 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $480 million. Net proceeds received by Hess Corporation from Hess Midstream Partners IPO were $175 million. Proceeds from asset sales were $79 million. Net repayments of debt were $52 million. Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $90 million. All other items were a net increase in cash of $9 million resulting in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of $194 million. Changes in working capital during the second quarter included non-recurring payments totaling approximately $130 million related to line fill for the Dakota Access Pipeline, termination payments for an offshore drilling rig, premiums on crude oil hedge contracts and prepayments for frac sand in North Dakota. Turning to our financial position. Excluding Midstream, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.45 billion, total liquidity of $6.8 billion including available committed credit facilities and debt of $6.035 billion at June 30, 2017. In August, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $600 million from the sale of our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian basin. Now to turn to guidance, first for E&P. Our updated 2017 guidance includes the anticipated impact of the Permian sale which assumes a completion date of August 1. We project cash costs for E&P operations in the third quarter to be in the range of $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel and $13 to $14 per barrel in the fourth quarter reflecting the impact of higher fourth quarter production from North Malay Basin and Bakken. The lower cash costs projected for the fourth quarter of 2017 will continue in 2018 with Stampede commencing production and Bakken volumes increasing. Full year 2017 cash cost guidance is now $14 to $15 per barrel, which is down from previous guidance of $15 to $16 per barrel due to ongoing cost reduction efforts and strong production performance. DD&A per barrel is forecast to be in the range of $25 to $26 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017, and $24.50 to $25.50 per barrel for the full year of 2017, which is up from previous guidance of $24 to $25 per barrel. The increase in the full year guidance is due to better performance by Tubular Bells and the Bakken, both of which have higher DD&A rates than the portfolio average. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $39.50 to $41.50 per barrel in the third quarter and $38.50 to $40.50 per barrel for the full year. Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million in the third quarter with full year guidance remaining unchanged at $250 million to $270 million. The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million for the third quarter and $520 million to $535 million for the full year, which is updated from previous guidance of $520 million to $550 million. The E&P effective tax rate excluding Libya is expected to be a benefit in the range of 10% to 14% for the third quarter. For the full year we now expect a benefit in the range of 11% to 15%, which is down from previous guidance of 12% to 16% due to a change in mix of operating results. Now for Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million in the third quarter and $65 million to $75 million for the full year, which is updated from previous guidance of $65 million to $85 million due to the sale of our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian basin. Turning to Corporate, we expect corporate expenses to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of $135 million to $145 million, down from previous guidance of $140 million to $150 million. We anticipate interest expenses to be in the range of $70 million to $75 million for the third quarter and $295 million to $305 million for the full year, which is unchanged from previous guidance. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Our first question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Start out in the Bakken, as you think about the decision to take that rig count or not to take that rig count up to 6 to 4, can you talk to some of the points of guidance you expect to make that decision, oil price et cetera? And it seemed like in the Bakken one of the reasons maybe beyond the productivity for the very strong production came from a higher mix of gas and NGLs, and can you talk more to how much more upside there could be on the gas and NGLs from flaring less? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Let me take your first question Brian. So what's going to drive the decision to increase the rig count, as John mentioned in his opening remarks, we're currently operating 4 rigs that, with the 60-stage fracs and the increased proppant levels, 4 rigs should deliver a production growth of approximately 10% a year over the next several years which is nearly the same production growth with 4 rigs that would've taken with 6 rigs a year ago. So because of those factors, the decision is really going to be based upon the crude oil outlook at the end of the year and also, will we continue to see higher and higher performance from those enhanced completions. So those are going to be the two things that we're going to be looking at. In regards to your NGL and gas, as you know, we just brought on the Hawkeye Facility in the first quarter and so we continue to gather more and more third-party volumes as we go through as well as our own volumes south of the river, so. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah, the oil and gas mix at the wellhead is the same. This is just a question of us capturing more gas due to south of the river having the infrastructure there, reducing our flaring footprint. So it has nothing to do with well performance. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great, thanks. And then the follow-up, and I may have misheard but I think when you talked about the DD&A per barrel forecast going up attributed to stronger well performance than Tubular Bells and the Bakken. If the well performance is stronger, can you just talk to why that's increasing the DD&A rate versus lowering F&D costs/DD&A? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. So from a forecast standpoint on Tubular Bells, Tubular Bells actually produced 19,000 barrels a day on average in the second quarter. And so when you calculate the DD&A, it's still based on the same reserves that we had at the beginning of the year. Now with production we may get an update in reserves as we move through the year, but as of right now with the quarter, you're using the same calculation. So all we're getting is more barrels with the same DD&A rate that we had previously. So the DD&A rate for Tubular Bells is above our portfolio average rate. So the more barrels it produces, it just increases our overall DD&A. And right now with the Bakken same thing, and we'll continue to see with the uplift in EURs, adding more and more reserves, but right now the Bakken DD&A rate is above our portfolio average. So as we bring on more volumes there, it does increase DD&A. All non-cash, all happy to get because both Tubular Bells and Bakken are delivering more cash flow as a result of it. But just from a pure accounting requirement on the DD&A, it just gives us a higher DD&A. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And so it sounds like it's more timing than not. Obviously, the IRR goes up if you're getting the production out more quickly, but do you think that the EURs in both areas are actually on the rise? Or in places like Tubular Bells, it is just that the production is getting out more quickly? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So they both are getting higher. So I mean you've heard what's been happening with our type curves in the Bakken, so we are producing. Our EURs are performing above our type curve forecast, which will obviously then lead to higher reserves. And Tubular Bells, as well, we're doing kind of the slow ramp and bringing it up to production. Tubular Bells is currently producing around 20,000 barrels a day. So we are getting, like you said, better returns and over time that will get into our reserve numbers. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Just wanted to first talk about the results of Payara-2 and what are the implications as we think about a potential Phase II in Guyana? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Arun. Well, obviously, this upsizes the resources quite substantially. So we've gone the range from 2.25 million to 2.75 million barrels of oil recoverable. So we are working with the operator now on planning and engineering studies underway for, obviously, additional phases of development. And as that comes to fruition, we'll provide additional information on those future phases. However, obviously, this increases the resources very substantially. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. We're reasonably confident the operator is moving forward with a second ship (38:02), and with these recent results, there's a strong likelihood we'll have a third ship (38:07). Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: But it's going to be phased over time. So it's going to be very manageable from a financial perspective. But the thing here it's going to give us an increasing resource base, put us on a very sustainable growth trajectory, but significantly lower our cost per barrel. That will give us resilient returns in a $35 or $40 [a barrel] world. So I think it's really going to advantage the company in terms of improving cash-on-cash returns once production comes on in 2020. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And my follow-up, John, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the potential for Hess to look at divesting some of your mature, higher-cost assets. Could you just maybe give us a little bit more color around that in terms of what you're thinking about and perhaps timing of when we could see something like this? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yes. No. Very fair. As we see, we're in the investment mode, which depending on oil price, may mean continuing having a financial deficit. I think it's very important to know that we will selectively use asset sales to fund that deficit. And you're talking about mature, higher-cost assets, very much as we did with our sale of EOR assets in the Permian. But the key thing here is our growth is underpinned by the four key assets we talked about : 70% of our CapEx, the Bakken, the two developments offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Thailand and Guyana. Our other assets actually do play an important role in the portfolio in terms of cash generation with growth potential as oil prices improve. But we will selectively look at some of those assets in the normal course of business if it makes sense to sell them to continue to optimize our portfolio, very much as we did with the Permian. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Thanks. Our next question is from down Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. A quick follow-up to Arun's question, if I may, so all we understand in Payara right now is that the rig is still in location. Can you speak, Greg, to the pre-drill and the prognosis for the deeper well (40:31) that was going to be targeted as well? Has that been penetrated? Or are you still on location? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I might pick that one up, Doug, because we've coordinated this with the operator and our partner ExxonMobil. First, I think the most important thing here is the Payara-2 appraisal well was very significant. It confirmed a second giant oil discovery in Guyana and also increased the gross discovered recoverable resources just from Payara to 500 million barrels of oil equivalent. So it's going to be very economic. It's going to be a great investment and great return. And the key opportunity we have there, as you know, was we were able to deepen the Payara-2 well by only approximately 300 meters, or 1,000 feet, to evaluate a deeper exploration objective, which provided a low-cost opportunity to evaluate a potentially material prospect. I can say now, this is the same position from our partners as well, the well encountered high-quality sands. They were water-bearing, but they had oil shows throughout. So the results were and are very encouraging, from both the reservoir quality and hydrocarbon system perspective, and evaluation of the well results is ongoing. And I think the other key point is there is considerable resources discovered to-date, but we see additional multibillion barrels of unrisked exploration potential in the Stabroek Block ahead of us. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Appreciate that answer, John, and maybe just sticking with Guyana very quickly, because the pacing of cash flows is obviously a question that folks are asking. When you look at the development scenarios, are you still comfortable that Liza early production phase essentially self-funds subsequent phases? And if you could clarify the tax position, because I understand that PSC was ultimately published by the press earlier this year, so if you could address that. And I've got a quick follow-up in the Bakken, please. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. So from the funding, you saw in our release, right, that it was approximately $950 million is the capital associated with the first phase, with $110 million already in our budget this year, going to $250 million, then to $330 million, and the remainder split between 2020 and 2021, so very manageable within our capital budget. And the way we think about it, although nothing has been set yet with the operator, but if you're going to get to our second FPSO, you're probably talking a two to three-year period from today where we'll really start the same type of process. So if you take a look at that same phasing, that phasing will happen again two years from now. And then we will have the production startup of Liza Phase I. And as typical in a PSC, you can begin to get your cost recovery of your cost bank. And that will help fund the second phase. Now specifically on taxes, Doug, I am limited, because the terms are confidential, as you said. I know there's been some PSC leaked, but we can't talk about it with specifics, except to say I think, as both John and Greg have mentioned, that when we run out and you run out to like the Liza Phase I economics, this provides good returns down to $35 Brent. So, again, with the quality of the reservoir, the lower cost environment we're seeing offshore, and the combination with the PSC provides that good returns down to $35 in Guyana. It really truly is an exceptional discovery and development. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, John. My quick follow-up is to, Greg, very quickly on the guidance of the revised type curves in the Bakken. Does that include the higher proppant loading or just the move to 60 stages? And I'll leave it there. Thanks. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, I think that when we said upsizing by 10% to 15%, that assumes a higher proppant loading as well. Now what I can't tell you, Doug, is are we going to settle on 120,000 pounds per stage, 140,000 pounds per stage, 130,000 pounds per stage. We're still in the midst of basically figuring that out. But the early results from the 11 wells that we have online with 140,000 pounds per stage is very encouraging. So that gives us confidence to say that this is a 10% to 15% uplift in the EUR. It also allowed us to increase our IP90s by some 100 barrels a day on average for the remainder of the year. So it's a combination of both. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Morris of Citi. Your line is open. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Greg, just following up on the Bakken question. You mentioned the 10% to 15% uplift in EUR, but looking at the IP90s in the second quarter versus the first quarter, those were up about 30% and I know some of that is the additional gas capture. But how much of that is just contribution from those 11 wells with 140,000 pounds per stage that may have been on for 90 days, I don't know how many were online for 90 days, but how would you reconcile the much higher uplift in IP90s you saw in Q2 versus Q1 for what wells were online? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah, okay. So a good question. So really the Q2 IP90 performance was very good because we're drilling in the core of the core, which is the Keene area. And that's really the best area that we have in the core of the Bakken. And those wells were actually performing even higher than what our forecast was. Now as we go into the second half of the year, we're going to move outside the Keene area with a couple rigs. They're still good wells. They're just not as good as Keene, but they're still very good wells. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Hey, Bob, the only other thing \u2013 I just wanted to add is those IP90s are only oil. Those are barrels of oil, so it has nothing to do with gas capture. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: That's true. Good point Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. So that's even better. All right. Great. Second quick question, you confirmed that in Guyana the next two prospects will be Turbid (47:01) and Ranger, given how fast these wells are drilling I would expect that you would have results on both of those by year-end. Would that be correct? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, obviously, that depends upon evaluation and kind of what you find. But yes, I mean, most likely we would have results in both by year-end. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Guy Baber of Simmons. Your line is open. Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International : Thanks very much. Just wanted to continue the discussion here on Guyana and the exploration program going forward and the multibillion barrel potential you all have talked about. Can you talk a little bit more about Turbid (47:41) and Ranger, what type of prospects those are? Where they might be located on the block? And then just at a high level, how are you thinking about that pace of that program through 2018, maybe how many exploration wells you might plan to target over the next 12 to 18 months or so? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, Guy, thanks for the question. So let's start with Turbid (48:07), so Turbid (48:08) is very similar to Liza, meaning it's a stratigraphic play type that is on this rim of the bowl that we've talked about. It's to the southeast of where Liza is located. And then if you move to Ranger, Ranger is further out in the basin and it is a very different play type, which appears to be a carbonate buildup with on-lapping sediments, very large structure but they are very different play types. So again, Turbid (48:43) is more akin to Liza kind of a play type, whereas Ranger is completely different kind of play type. As far as a go-forward on exploration, remember, we have until 2026 to explore on the block, so effectively nine years from where we are today. The pace for next year, you can assume a one rig kind of pace doing exploration. So that's about $150 million a year or so in net to Hess. And within that exploration campaign next year, there may be some more appraisals on Liza because we see more upside on Liza as well. Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International : Very helpful. Thank you. And then you all mentioned using or potentially looking at the portfolio and asset sales in part of the funding mechanism for shortfalls. Can you also talk about what the potential might be for drop-downs into the MLP type of cash that that could afford the parent? Just trying to understand at a high level the runway there, kind of what the ultimate opportunity for drops might be? How you might think about that just from a high level in terms of the pace as well? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. So I'll address that. And we do view this as a win-win for Hess and for our midstream business as well. So what we would be thinking of drops is nothing imminent that would go from the JV we have down to the MLP because this is a public entity because of the organic growth that both John and Greg have laid out that we had with our four-rig program. What we are working with on our JV partner is we have within Hess still plenty of 100%-owned type midstream assets that we could put in the top-tier JV such as our North Dakota water-handling business, which we've spoke about. So that is something that can be dropped into the JV, and then later, so it bumps up the EBITDA runway at the top level and that asset then subsequently can be dropped into the public vehicle as the EBITDA growth continues in the MLP. There are other assets that we have in North Dakota, other 100%-owned assets besides the water handling that we'd be looking to put in. And then we'd look across our portfolio, even including assets in the Gulf of Mexico, such as like our Stampede TLP. So there's other types of assets that we'll be looking at it and it will be part of, kind of, as I said, a win-win part of our funding in this lower-price environment for Hess, and it's giving more EBITDA runway to the midstream business. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yes. I think the key takeaway here is continued tight capital and expense controls, selective asset sales of mature higher-cost per barrel assets using the MLP as a future funding mechanism, altogether with Guyana and our growth opportunities that we're investing in put us on a trajectory to be cash generative in a $50 world once Guyana comes on. And I think that's the key takeaway and that's the objective for our company. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: And the last thing I'd add, Guy, to your question on the play types, these play types are also what we see extending into the Suriname blocks, which is why we've gotten an interest in two of those as well. Guy Baber - Simmons & Company International : Very helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. And... John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : ... good to be back on the call after, I think, two years or something like that. Anyway... John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Welcome. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : ...just to get to Guyana, the $35 breakeven, if I remember correctly, $40 was the number. Can you give us an idea of is it just the greater reserves? Or is there something else you detected in the appraisal wells that's helped lower that breakeven number? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. I think there's a number of factors why the breakeven is what it is. So let's start with the reservoir. Very prolific reservoir porosity, permeability, which means that your producers in Phase I are going to recover about 56 million barrels per well. Secondly, the wells are very shallow. They're only about 12,000 feet to 13,000 feet below the mud line, and don't have any of the typical drilling things that you would financial in the Gulf of Mexico that require multiple casing strings. So the well costs here are a third, call it, of the Gulf of Mexico. I think the third thing is that we're doing this at the low point in the cycle. So, FPSO, Surf, drilling, all those things are occurring at a low point in the cost cycle. And then finally, although we can't be specific, it has a good PSC that really helps you at these lower prices. So all four of those things contribute to the very low breakeven. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then to the Bakken just in general, the idea of you're in an outspend position obviously for the next couple years until Guyana does come online. As you think about I would imagine better well performance and maybe stable well costs, any desire to kind of step on the accelerator or to pull your foot off the gas kind of given let's say a sub-$50 oil environment just as a starting point for that? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, I think, as John said, I mean, the couple things that will govern that decision on certainly increasing the rig count will be oil price and the performance of these enhanced completions. I think in any case we're running the Bakken for value and for cash and not growth for growth sake, right. So I think that's a key tenet in how we're actually running the Bakken. Regarding decreasing the rig rate, I mean that is a potential opportunity if oil prices get low, even lower. That's a pin that we could pull if we have to. That's currently not our plan but obviously we could if we had to. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just a... John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: At the current rig count we have, we're very comfortable being at a four-rig rate in a $40 to $50 world. I think that's a key point. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. I appreciate that. And just a quick follow up on that. If you did have to pull back at all, any contractual limitations on that? Anything you're kind of locked into? You mentioned buying the sand in advance, but I was just curious if anything else was kind of nailed down or committed. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. So we've got our rigs committed for three years and pumping for two. However, all of those contracts have flexibility in them both on the up and the down. So no major issue if we decided to reduce rigs. But as John said, that's not our plan. We're very comfortable with four rigs in the Bakken at this $40 to $50 range. I think another important point on that, we have over 800 wells that generate an after-tax return of 15% or higher at $40 WTI flat. So we've got a very healthy inventory of outstanding return wells. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is open. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Hey, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Greg, earlier you said that Bakken you're going to run based on cash and value. As forward program, can you give us a rough idea then what oil price you need in order for you to be cash flow breakeven from Bakken? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So we're at \u2013 at current prices, Paul, we're generating significant free cash flow from the Bakken. So it would, as Greg said, we've got 800 wells that give 15% type returns at $40. So, look, I know you and I have talked about this in the past. On a cash cost level for the Bakken, it is below our portfolio average. So prices would have to go significantly lower to cause us not to be breakeven, not to have free cash flow. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And, John, maybe I misread what you said. It sounds like you are saying that the Phase II for Guyana is going to be FID in 2019. Is that what you said because you're saying that the phasing of the next phase of the development would be two years out? Is that how I should interpret? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So what we were talking about is how the phasing of capital on a second phase. So this you really should ask the operator on the timing of that phasing. But now with the results of Liza-4 and it being so good and now Payara-2 again getting up to 500 million barrels, we feel pretty confident that there's going to be a second FPSO. So now it's timing with the operator is we sanctioned Liza-1 here this first one in 2017, so somewhere I was just estimating in a two- to three-year period it should be sanctioning the second one. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. I guess my question on there is more like (58:55) I thought we go for the early production in Phase I upon these (59:03) also using it as an extend or sanction test (59:04), I suppose. And you're going to incorporate that into the Phase II and Phase 3, if there is a Phase 3. And so from that standpoint, should we look at this such that you're not going to sanction it until the Phase I startup, or that you might actually sanction it say a year before? So I'm trying to understand, not trying to pin you down on the exact time, but the thinking that how the Phase I development is going to be used? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yes. So, I think, Paul, there will be dynamic data that we're gathering as part of Phase I, but you should think about that as a parallel path with doing FEED on Phase II. So as you're learning, as you're going, you'll incorporate those learnings because it's really going to come down to the dynamic data is going to give you learnings on the well behavior. And so that won't really make a difference until later in the project, the Phase II project. So parallel path, dynamic learning as you go and incorporating those as you are building and drilling Phase II. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And John, when you cut the CapEx by $100 million this year, is that a reduction the nature is (1:00:25) because some work being postponed? Or simply just on the efficiency gain, and if that's the case, is that all from Bakken or from where? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So, it really isn't an activity-based reduction. It really is efficiency and cost reduction efforts. I mean you've seen what's been happening on the cash cost side, so day-in and day-out we're focusing on reducing cost on the OpEx and capital. And Bakken actually isn't the biggest driver of our CapEx budget reduction because we actually are moving, as Greg said, to the 60 stages in the higher proppant. What we've been able to do with efficiency there though is not increase the budget in Bakken even with moving to that. So then it's more across the portfolio, you heard North Malay Basin did start up a little bit early, so we've had some reductions from North Malay Basin. I think you've been hearing where Stampede is, that it's out in the Gulf, so we've actually got some reductions there as well. And then the remaining pieces, it's just across the portfolio. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. My final question and just one comment. The final question is that if after the Stampede and North Malay ramp up to keep your production flat and the mix between oil and gas steady, any rough idea what is the annual CapEx requirement today based on that? And the final one is just a request on the Midstream to see whether that you can continue to provide more of the segment detail breakdown in your press release. Thank you. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. Let me answer your second one first. The only reason we don't have the Midstream information in this press release because, as John mentioned in his opening remarks, is Hess Midstream Partners, now it's a public company, is having its first earnings call tomorrow. So after the Midstream earnings call tomorrow, we will post in our supplement all the Midstream information that we had previously provided. So we just didn't want to front run their earnings call. As far as capital to maintain kind of our oil gas mix, our production type flat, the typical way I look at it is, take your number of barrels that you are producing in a year, this can be for any company, Paul, and then pick your F&D rate. If it's $15, if it's $20, so with us, if you're using anywhere a range of $15 F&D to $20 F&D, you're in that 1.7 billion to low 2 billion barrels to be able to maintain production at a flat range. So it is there. With Guyana, obviously, we've got some low F&D type projects coming into the portfolio as well as Bakken. But over the long run, that's to me a typical way to look at how you can maintain your production flat. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Maybe just as we look into 2018 maybe a follow up on CapEx. As we think of the moving pieces on capital, can you remind us of and maybe as we think of the next, maybe even 2018 and 2019, how much spend will be rolling off versus incremental spend could be ramping? I mean, if we were to hold at a four-rig program, how low could the capital budget trend over the next couple of years? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. So, assuming the four-rig program and let me just at least do 2018 versus 2017, so we have four rigs in 2018. On an average this year, we're going to be running three-and-a-half rigs in the Bakken. The other thing will be, for 2018, we'll be using right from the start, the higher stage counts and the higher proppant loading, whatever that level is. So Bakken capital will go up in 2018 for both those reasons, but not a tremendous amount, but there will be an increase there. The other, let's just go what else would increase in the portfolio. As you know, the Phase I of Liza was sanctioned. We had $110 million in the budget this year. It's $250 million in 2018, so that will be where the other increase is. Then offsetting those is both North Malay Basin and Stampede. So we have about $700 million of capital this year. Look, we will be providing guidance as normal in our January call, but you could look at somewhere around $400 million between the two on North Malay Basin and Stampede. So that will be a significant offset. We had some drilling going on in the Gulf of Mexico, which looks like will be reduced in 2018 as well. So hopefully, that can give you just general levels of where CapEx are and we'll update in 2018. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Sorry, and on North Malay and Stampede, is that it could be down $400 million? Or it could be down from $700 million to $400 million? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Oh, sorry. Yes, it'll be down from $700 million to $400 million. And then the only other thing I just remembered is with Valhall, we did start the platform rig a little bit later in 2017, so we'll be running that platform rig for the full year in 2017. So it could be a slight increase in Valhall's capital. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then maybe one follow-up on the Bakken, it's a great update there on well performance. Can you talk about how we should interpret those across the broader extent of your acreage and maybe across like the 2,800 wells of inventory that you talked about? Can you do the 60-stage fracs? Is that going to become the base case across the broader acreage position? And the 800 to 850 barrels a day of the IP90 rates, is that across the smaller subset in the core? Or is that broadly applicable you think across a larger portion of the 2,800 wells that you have of inventory? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Ryan, so the 60-stage will have broad applicability. So that has become our standard design now in the core of the Bakken. Recall we've got about 1,500 wells that generate 15% or higher after-tax return at $50 per barrel. Now that number was based on our old design, 50-stage, 70,000 pounds per stage. So as we update our models, we expect that that number will get even higher of the number of wells that breakeven at 50. So breakevens are going down, EURs are going up, IP90s are going up, all of which bodes pretty well. So the one piece of data that we can't be exact on yet is what is the proppant loading going to be? 140,000 pounds look good. We're trying to find the edge of the interference. We might back off a little bit from that, and hopefully by the end of the year and going into 2018, we can be more definitive on exactly what that proppant loading is going to be, but 60-stage is now the standard. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Greg. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Hey, Ryan, just to make sure I got the message out to you on CapEx. So with all those in and outs that I talked about here, you should not expect our CapEx really to be going up next year because of the reductions in North Malay Basin and Stampede and as well as the lower CapEx in the Gulf of Mexico, we'll be staying in the low end of that $2 billion range. So just to make sure I got that clear with you. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. I know. That makes sense. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, everyone. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Hi, Paul. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi, you referenced a tremendous number of moving parts, several of them very positive. And you've talked about, for example, $35 oil is a decent return for Guyana. But at the same time, you've referenced the current oil price as being a current low-price environment, which isn't suggested by the strip. Can you update us on the highest level on where you're aiming the company for in terms of the oil price that you assume, and what you're going to need just to break even in terms of your CapEx, your growth? What type of growth you would want at what type of price? And of course your earning? Thanks. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Paul, we're assuming $50 as the oil price that we're going to have for some time, and while we're in the investment mode now because of Guyana, and we earn very good returns in the future from that, and also the Bakken as well at the four rig count, we're putting the company to be in a position that when Guyana comes on in a $50 world, we will be cash generative. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : And could you just continue that into the Bakken, John, because I think in the past, you've spoken about $60. It seems that's changing, could you just update me on where that's going to be? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: From the Bakken, again, to make sure I get this out. Right now, at these prices or lower, the Bakken generates free cash flow. And, as Greg mentioned, we've got 800 wells, even at $40 WTI that generate 15% return. So, as John said, we do have deficits right now. Our target over that medium-term, once Liza comes onstream, is to be net cash flow positive, $50. That's post-dividend as well. And we believe we can do that while providing attractive and competitive rates of production growth and returns. So currently where we are right now, our cash flow from operations, say, in 2017 covers all our producing assets capital, and our dividend at these current prices. As we move into 2018, though, our North Malay Basin and Stampede projects will become cash generators. So again that's going to help lower that deficit. And then what we'll do until Guyana comes onstream, is we'll continue to use our strong cash position, remember we have the Permian asset sale coming in the third quarter, to supplement our cash flow to fund those growth projects which is Bakken, we're going to keep with the Bakken and four rigs, especially at the current prices as you've heard, because it does generate good returns. And then Guyana and because of the value that both Bakken and Guyana generate for us, and we're past the development spend on North Malay Basin and Stampede, we can drive to have an increase in cash flow, free cash flow position post Guyana coming on in a $50 world. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you. That's exactly what I wanted to hear. And could you just continue that into earnings please, John? You've mentioned and explained the slightly confusing DD&A that you mentioned earlier in the call. But when can we expect to see earnings positive? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Earnings is going to be the non-cash DD&A obviously, we have that high rate that we go on right now. Bakken and Guyana will continue to drive down that rate as Bakken reserves get added, and then as well as additional reserves we get booked with Guyana, and that production comes onstream. The exact point, Paul, I don't know. The breakeven on net income will follow kind of the cash flow, free cash flow numbers, so again it will be post Guyana. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Great. And then just as a follow-up, it seems that you're not being rewarded for a mixed business model that the market wants focus. When you talked about the potential for disposals, is there a potential for a major further restructuring so that you get rewarded for the quality of some of these assets without sort of mixing them and being diluted by the market valuation of mixed business models, which seems to be structurally lower for less focused companies? Thanks. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah, with all due respect, Paul, when you model us versus I would say other companies that have balanced portfolios, I actually think we're holding our own. So I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but from the numbers we've run we're actually starting to get recognition that what we have in Guyana is truly game changing. In our investor pack we show that the returns it will generate, the EURs per well, the cost per barrel like $7 a barrel development cost is quite distinguishing. And so when you compare our business model versus the pure plays, whether it's offshore or shale, we actually, I'd say, are probably holding our own in the middle of the pack, now we want to be at the top of the pack, and I think as we execute our strategy, we will. So I think that's the takeaway that I would respond to you with. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning, and congratulations on the continuing uplift in the resources offshore Guyana. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I just want to ask two quick questions back on the theme of the material asset sales. The first one being, just being an asset operator such as the South Arne versus being a non-op interest holder such as at Valhall, will that have any material influence on your thinking in the future? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Well, I wouldn't want to speculate on any asset sales. Being an operator offshore is fundamental to our strategic positioning going forward. Being an operator in the unconventionals is fundamental as well. It also helps us when we are a partner with someone else who is an operator. So we're going to stay as an operator, both onshore and offshore. And whatever selective asset sales we have in the future, we'll be focused on maximizing value, bringing value forward and lowering us on the cost per barrel curve, and there will be some selective opportunities that we look at as we go forward to meet some of our funding gap to fund our growth opportunities. And remember, John Rielly pointed out that we'll be also looking at the MLP as well, or our joint venture above the MLP. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Right. No, that was very interesting color, I thought. Bearing in mind the desire to lower the corporate BOE costs, are there portions of the Bakken that could actually be a potential sale at some time if you needed it? And one reason I'm asking this is because I remember not too long ago there was a discussion about maybe experimenting with plug-and-perf and cemented liners and that sort of thing in the less than core acreage to see if, perhaps, results could be improved. So I'm just kind of wondering what you're thinking about the Bakken outside of your obviously identified core. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So just as an example, earlier this year, we did do a sale. It was approximately $100 million for what we were considering non-core acreage that we wouldn't get to because of the quality of our DSUs still sometime in the future. And so, again, it's an example. As John said, we're going to look where the value is. It was worth more to someone else because they were going to drill it earlier than we would, and we did do that sale. So what we do is try to work together with our midstream business to get the overall best integrated value that we can for both Hess and the midstream on our acreage. And so could further sales of non-core acreage happen in the Bakken? Yes. Yes, that could happen. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. I appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Yeah. Hi. Just some quick ones from me. Greg, you said that the wells were running at about a third of Gulf of Mexico in Guyana. So what would be the completed well cost be? About $40 million or less? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Hi, John. It's John. The well cost in Guyana, so we're not being specific; we've got to ask the operator. So what has been happening for us and the numbers that you know out there are on, let's just call it, a dry hole cost. If you're just going down to the bottom to TD on an exploration well, it's only net to us, like $15 million, okay? So gross that up, it's like $50 million for a direct dry hole. So then you get into on our exploration wells on whether we're coring or testing, there's going to be more. And then the overall development wells, the cost of those wells are baked into that overall gross $3.2 billion of the development cost, but we have not broken out individually the wells, and I guess that would be more for the operator to do. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Okay. That's fine. In the Phase I, Greg also mentioned that there was 56 million barrels in recovery. So are you looking at about 10 producers? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: It's actually eight producers. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Okay. Good. That's fine. And since you're on the phone, John, how much was, for the working capital changes, the incremental sand, the rig contract and the pipe-fill? Can you break it down? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So we weren't going to be specific, so what I would tell you on the two biggest were the DAPL line-fill. It was 1.2 million barrels that we had to, as part of our being an anchor shipper in DAPL. So that was the biggest. The next one was the rig termination payment that we had. It was the rig that was working on Tubular Bells, and we've completed that, and this was the last payment on that. So those two were the biggest and then the remainder is between the hedge premiums and the frac sand. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Okay. Great. Thank you. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: You're welcome. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

My name is Vince and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the risk factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Now as usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will provide an update on the progress we are making in executing our strategy. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance and John Rielly will then review our financial results. Our strategy is to focus our portfolio by investing in our highest return assets and divesting mature, higher-cost assets, which in turn will lower our unit cash operating costs, bolster our balance sheet, and pre-fund our truly world class investment opportunity in Guyana. This strategy is designed to deliver significant value to our shareholders, even in a low oil price environment for many years to come. During the third quarter, we achieved several strategic milestones, including this week's announced sales of our interests in Norway and Equatorial Guinea as well as our enhanced oil recovery assets in the Permian in early August. We also announced plans to sell our interest in Denmark, which should result in a complete exit from the North Sea. In April of this year, we also completed the initial public offering of Hess Midstream Partners LP. Proceeds from these asset sales to-date are estimated at approximately $3.25 billion, and along with cash on our balance sheet, will be used to fund offshore Guyana, one of the industry's most attractive investment opportunities, which offers superior returns, even in a low price environment, and positions our company for a decade plus of visible reserve and production growth with outstanding returns. The Stabroek block, where Hess has a 30% interest, contains a massive world class resource that keeps getting bigger and better. Earlier this month the operator, ExxonMobil, announced a fifth oil discovery with the Turbot-1 well, which encountered 75 feet of high-quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir. We are encouraged by the results of this discovery, which is accretive to the estimated 2.25 billion to 2.75 billion barrels gross recoverable resources already discovered on the Stabroek block. Additional drilling at Turbot is planned for 2018 to further evaluate the full commercial potential of the resource. We also expect to spud the Ranger-1 well by the end of this month. We are also very excited about the Liza phase one development that is already underway, which will have the gross capacity to produce up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day, with first production expected by 2020. Guyana is simply an extraordinary investment opportunity that is uniquely advantaged by its scale, quality, cost, timing and financial returns. First as I mentioned, Liza and Payara are giant oilfields, some of the industry's largest oil discoveries of the past decade. Second, it has one of the highest quality reservoirs in the world, with high porosity and permeability and is expected to deliver very high recovery factors and production rates. Third, since the producing horizons are relatively shallow for deepwater wells, the wells can be drilled in approximately a third of the time and cost of those in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Fourth, development is set to occur at what is expected to be the bottom of the offshore cost cycle. Fifth, ExxonMobil as the operator is one of the most experienced project managers in the world for this type of development, with a great track record, which significantly reduces execution risk. And finally, we see multi-billion barrels of additional un-risked exploration upside on the block. In addition, allocating capital to our highest return assets and selling those that are mature and higher cost, together with a planned $150 million annual cost reduction program, will contribute to reducing our cash unit production costs by approximately 30% to less than $10 a barrel by 2020. Funding our high return growth opportunities requires a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, which remain a top priority for our company. At September 30, we had $2.5 billion of cash and total liquidity of $6.8 billion. Proceeds from asset sales announced in 2017 and the midstream IPO are estimated to exceed $3.4 billion with additional proceeds expected in 2018 from the sale of our interest in Denmark. Our asset sales will also extinguish approximately $3.2 billion in future abandonment liabilities and enable $500 million of debt reduction in 2018. At the same time, we have built a strong hedge position in a period of oil price uncertainty to protect our cash flows. For the remainder of 2017 using put-call collars, we have hedged 130,000 barrels per day of oil production, 20,000 barrels per day of Brent with a $55 floor and $20 upside, 60,000 barrels per day of WTI with a $50 floor and $20 upside, and 50,000 barrels per day of WTI with a $50 floor and $15 upside. For 2018, we have hedged 115,000 barrels per day of oil production using put-call collars with a $50 WTI floor and $15 upside. Now turning to our financial results, in the third quarter of 2017 we posted a net loss of $624 million, which includes net non-recurring losses totaled $300 million. On an adjusted basis, our net loss was $324 million or $1.07 per common share compared with a net loss of $340 million or $1.12 per common share in the third quarter of 2016. Compared to 2016, our third quarter financial results were positively impacted by higher realized crude oil selling prices and lower operating costs, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and exploration expenses, which more than offset the lower tax benefits following a required change in deferred tax accounting. Third quarter production was within our guidance range, averaging 299,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Net production in Libya was 12,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. The Bakken is our largest operated growth asset, where we have an industry-leading position with more than 0.5 million net acres in the core of the play and the capacity to grow production to approximately 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 103,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day currently. Our distinctive lean capability has enabled us to lower our well cost by 60% since 2010. In addition, our use of technology through the application of geo steering, optimized spacing, higher stage counts and profit loading has increased our well productivity by approximately 50% over the last two years. Together, these improvements have enabled us to generate returns that are competitive with any shale play in the United States. We are currently operating four rigs in the Bakken, that, with 60 stage fracs and increased proppant levels, are forecast to deliver virtually the same oil production growth of approximately 10% a year that would've taken six rigs a year ago. Based on the strong financial returns of our Bakken wells, we are evaluating plans to add up to two additional rigs in the Bakken during 2018 for a total of six rigs. In Malaysia, the North Malay Basin full field development achieved first production of natural gas in July. Hess is the operator with 50% interest and Petronas is our partner with the remaining 50%. For the third quarter, production averaged 86 million cubic feet a day and the field is on track to reach its planned plateau rate of 165 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter. North Malay Basin will be a significant long-term low cost cash generator for the company. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Stampede development, in which Hess has a 25% interest and is the operator, remains on track to start up in the first quarter of 2018 and ramp up production over the following 12 months. In summary, we are well positioned to deliver a decade plus of returns driven growth and increasing cash generation through continued execution of our strategic plan. The success of our asset sales program to-date further focuses our portfolio on higher return assets and lowers our cash unit costs. At the same time, we are strengthening our balance sheet to fund our world-class investment opportunity in Guyana, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders for many years to come. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thanks John. I'd like to provide an update on our operational performance in 2017. In the third quarter, despite several weather-related challenges, our team executed well across our producing and development assets. We also continued delivering value through exploration. The Turbot-1 well, some 30 miles to the southeast of Liza, resulted in a fifth significant discovery on the Stabroek Block in Guyana, reinforcing their tremendous potential of this 6.6 million acre block. Our recently announced asset sales, as John noted, further focus and simplify our portfolio, lower our cash unit operating costs and break-even oil price, and allow us to pre-fund the development of our world class discoveries on Stabroek as Guyana continues to get bigger and better. Now, starting with production. In the third quarter, net production averaged 299,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya at the center of our guidance range of 295,000 to 305,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our third quarter production was influenced by the following primarily weather-related factors. First, hurricanes Harvey and Irma along with third-party downtime at our Conger field impacted our Gulf of Mexico production by approximately 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Second, unusually heavy rainfall in North Dakota resulted in road closures and deferred completions, reducing our production there by about 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As a result, net production averaged 103,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, slightly below our guidance. However, both of these weather impacts were offset by a temporary adjustment in our JDA entitlement, which increased production by approximately 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we will have some carryover effects from these issues as follows. The cumulative impact of one tropical storm and three hurricanes has resulted in 40 days of overall downtime for the Noble Paul Romano drilling rig that will push the startup of the Penn State-6 well to December, and the subsequent workover of another well into first quarter 2018. These delays will impact fourth quarter production by approximately 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus plan. The Conger field has been offline in October due to downtime at the Shell operated Enchilada platform, which will impact fourth quarter production by approximately 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus plan. At the JDA, the third quarter benefit in our net entitlement will reverse, reducing production by about 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. However, in the Bakken, we plan to temporarily add a third completion crew to help us recover from the weather impacts experienced in the third quarter, and we expect net production to rebound in the fourth quarter to the range of 105,000 to 110,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. On this basis, we continue to expect delivery of our full-year guidance in the Bakken of approximately 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Assuming the sale of our interests in Equatorial Guinea closes at the end of November and the sale of Norway closes in December, our fourth quarter production will reduce by approximately 14,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As a result of all these factors, our company fourth quarter production is now forecast to be 290,000 to 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. As we enter 2018 with North Malay Basin fully online, four rigs operating in the Bakken, and Stampede coming on stream, we expect to deliver strong pro forma production momentum. We will provide production guidance for 2018 on our January call. Turning to the Bakken, during the third quarter we drilled 24 wells, completed 20 wells, but only brought 13 new wells online due to weather, compared to the year-ago quarter when we drilled 21 wells and brought 22 wells online. We continue to test higher stage counts and proppant loadings in our sliding sleeve wells and have begun to test and plug-and-perf completions in line with our focus on maximizing the value of our DSUs. To-date, we have fracked 14 50-stage wells and 20 60-stage wells with proppant loadings of 140,000 pounds per stage. 18 of these high proppant wells are online and although the wells are in the early stages of their type curve, results to-date have been encouraging. In our earnings release supplement, we've provided our actual drilling and completion costs of $5.8 million per well in the quarter. About three quarters of the wells completed were the 60-stage high-proppant wells, which had an average cost of approximately $6 million each. We expect these well costs will be further reduced through lean manufacturing and with the positive results to-date, we expect average growth EURs for wells drilled in 2017 to exceed 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per well. Early next year, we will issue new guidance in terms of completion design, well costs, IP90s and EURs. Now moving to our developments. At the North Malay Basin in the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, first gas was achieved on July 10. Production averaged 86 million cubic feet per day during the third quarter and following a continuing successful ramp up, is expected to reach its plateau production level of approximately 165 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter, which is expected to continue into the next decade, throwing off significant free cash flow for the corporation. At the Stampede development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in which Hess holds a 25% working interest and is operator, all pipeline pre-commissioning was completed during the third quarter. Three wells have been drilled and completed and first oil is now expected to be achieved during the first quarter of 2018, which is six months ahead of schedule and well below budget. Now moving to offshore Guyana. Earlier this month ExxonMobil, the operator, announced that the Turbot-1 well resulted in another discovery on the Stabroek Block, in which Hess holds a 30% interest. The well encountered 75 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone. This discovery follows the Liza, Payara, Snoek and Liza Deep discoveries. Our success at Turbot is exciting not just because of its large aerial extent, but also because it extends the play more than 30 miles to the southeast of Liza and confirms our geologic models and the vast hydrocarbon potential of the block which, even given the discoveries to-date, remain substantially untested. The drilling rig will now move to the Ranger prospect, which is expected to spud by the end of the month. Prior to the Turbot discovery, the operator ExxonMobil estimated gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block to be 2.25 billion to 2.75 billion barrels of oil equivalent and following further appraisal of Turbot, we expect volumes to continue to increase. Liza phase one development is underway following project sanction in June and first oil remains expected by 2020. This is an asset of exceptional scale with a high-quality Multi Darcy permeability reservoir and attractive financial returns at oil prices down to $35 Brent. We plan to conduct further exploration and appraisal drilling throughout 2018 on the Stabroek Block, where we see numerous remaining prospects across multiple play types representing multi-billion barrel un-risked upside potential on this 6.6 million acre block. In closing, we continue to execute well operationally, and are taking the necessary portfolio steps to improve returns and price resiliency by redeploying capital from higher-cost mature assets to lower cost, high-return assets. This will drive a meaningful reduction in our cash unit operating costs, and will generate proceeds to pre-fund our world-class investment opportunity in Guyana, as it continues to get bigger and better. Our pro forma production momentum will strengthen in 2018, with plateau production from the North Malay Basin, a further ramp up of the Bakken, and planned first oil from Stampede in the first quarter. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Thanks, Greg. Let me start by discussing our recently announced asset sales and the use of proceeds. We expect the sales of our interest in Equatorial Guinea and Norway to be completed by year-end 2017. And together with our Permian EOR sale, total proceeds are $3.25 billion from the announced transactions. Additionally, we anticipate that the Denmark sales process will be completed in 2018. As the proceeds from these transactions are received, we intend to reduce debt by $500 million and are evaluating plans to add up to two additional rigs in the Bakken during 2018 for a total of six rigs. The proceeds from asset sales along with our current cash position and importantly, our free cash flows from our low cost cash generative assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia, provide us the financial flexibility to fund our growing world-class investment opportunity in Guyana in an extended $50 oil price environment without the need to access the debt or equity markets. We do not intend to pursue any M&A activity, and believe that our reshaped portfolio provides us with superior returns compared to other outside opportunities. We are highly cognizant of the importance of cash returns to shareholders, given the strength of our current liquidity position. However, we need more visibility into Exxon's plans for phase 2 and 3 of the Liza development in Guyana. Until we have this clarity, we initially plan to maintain a strong liquidity position, but will clearly consider cash returns to shareholders as appropriate. I would also like to provide some additional comments on the deals just announced. The Equatorial Guinea and Norway asset sales will not incur any transaction taxes. We also will not incur any taxes on the repatriation of these proceeds. Additionally, the company has settled open tax matters with the EG taxing authorities for the tax years prior to the effective date. In this regard, the company will release $85 million in related tax reserves on the balance sheet, which it had accrued in prior periods for the years in question. These reserves fully cover the company's tax obligation under the settlement. Now turning to our results, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2017 to the second quarter of 2017. We incurred a net loss of $624 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared with a net loss of $449 million in the previous quarter. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $324 million in the third quarter of 2017. Third quarter results include an after-tax gain of $280 million associated with the sale of our enhanced recovery assets in the Permian Basin. The sale transaction included both upstream and midstream assets, and as a result, an after-tax gain of $314 million was allocated to the E&P segment, and an after-tax loss of $34 million was allocated to the midstream segment. Third quarter results also included a non-cash charge of $550 million after-tax for the sale of Norway. In the fourth quarter, an additional charge relating to the Norway cumulative translation adjustment included in shareholders' equity will be recognized. The cumulative translation adjustment for Norway at September 30, 2017 was approximately $840 million. Turning to E&P. E&P had an adjusted net loss of $238 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared with a net loss of $354 million in the second quarter of 2017. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the third quarter and second quarter of 2017 were as follows. Higher realized selling prices improve results by $37 million. Higher sales volumes improve results by $10 million. Lower operating costs and expenses improve results by $18 million. Lower DD&A expense improve results by $33 billion. Lower exploration expenses improve results by $12 million. All other items improve results by $6 million for an overall improvement in third quarter results of $116 million. The E&P effective income tax rate excluding specials and Libyan operations was a benefit of 18% for the third quarter of 2017 compared with a benefit of 8% in the second quarter. For the third quarter, our E&P crude oil sales volumes were under-lifted compared with production by approximately 280,000 barrels, which did not have a material impact on our results. Turning to Midstream, on an adjusted basis, the Midstream segment had net income of $22 million in the third quarter, which was up from $16 million in the second quarter. Midstream EBITDA before the non-controlling interest and excluding specials amounted to $109 million in the third quarter, compared to $96 billion in the second quarter of 2017. Turning to Corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses excluding items affecting comparability were $108 million in the third quarter of 2017, compared to $111 million in the second quarter of 2017. Third quarter 2017 results include an after-tax charge of $30 million in connection with vacated office space. Turning to third quarter cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $415 million. Changes in working capital reduced operating cash flows by $327 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $513 million. Proceeds from the sale of assets were $604 million. Net repayments of debt were $19 million. Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $91 million. Distributions to non-controlling interest were $33 million. All other items were a net decrease in cash of $2 million resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of $34 million. Changes in working capital during the third quarter of 2017 were net cash outflows related to Norwegian abandonment expenditures, advances to operators, premiums on hedge contracts and the timing of interest payments. Turning to cash and liquidity, excluding midstream, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.48 billion, total liquidity of $6.8 billion including available committed credit facilities, and debt of $6.16 billion. As previously mentioned, we also have a strong crude oil hedge position through 2018 to protect our cash flow. Now turning to guidance, but before I give the guidance for the fourth quarter, I will provide third quarter pro forma financial metrics that remove the EG, Norway and Denmark assets being sold, but exclude the projected $150 million of cost savings to assist with your modeling of the portfolio post asset sales. Our third quarter pro forma cash costs were $12.80 per barrel as compared to actual reported results of $13.67 per barrel. Our third quarter pro forma DD&A per barrel was $23.72 and actual DD&A was $24.79 per barrel. Finally our pro forma tax rate excluding Libya was a benefit of 2% as compared to our reported benefit of 18%. I will now provide fourth quarter guidance with a cautionary statement that this can be impacted by the timing of the asset sales. Also, our DD&A rate will be lower than expected because DD&A will not be recorded on EG and Norway post the contract signings, since these assets will be classified as held for sale. The lower DD&A will improve results and therefore also impact our tax rate significantly since Norway has a high statutory tax rate. For the fourth quarter of 2017, E&P cash costs excluding Libya are projected to be in the range of $13.50 to $14.50 per barrel of oil equivalent and full-year 2017 cash cost guidance remains unchanged at $14 to $15 per barrel. DD&A per barrel excluding Libya is forecast to be in the range of $22.50 to $23.50 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $24.50 to $25.50 per barrel for the full year, which is unchanged from previous guidance. As a result, total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $36 to $38 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $38.50 to $40.50 per barrel for the full year. Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $75 million to $85 million in the fourth quarter with full-year guidance of $225 million to $235 million, which is down from the previous guidance of $250 million to $270 million. The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $135 million to $145 million for the fourth quarter and $535 million to $545 million for the full year, which is updated from previous full-year guidance of $520 million to $535 million. The E&P effective tax rate excluding Libya is expected to be an expense in the range of 16% to 20% for the fourth quarter. For the full year, we now expect a benefit in the range of 5% to 9%, which is down from previous guidance of 11% to 15% due to the asset sales. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million in the fourth quarter and $70 million to $75 million for the full year, which is updated from previous full-year guidance of $65 million to $75 million. Turning to Corporate, we expect corporate expenses to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the fourth quarter and full-year guidance of $130 million to $135 million, down from previous guidance of $135 million to $145 million. We anticipate interest expenses to be in the range of $70 million to $75 million for the fourth quarter and $300 million to $305 million for the full year, which is updated from previous full-year guidance of $295 million to $305 million. This concludes my remarks. We would be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Guy Baber of Simmons. Your line is open. Guy Baber - Simmons & Company: Thank you, guys, very much for taking the call. I wanted to explore some of the implications here of your strategic investments that you've announced, but production at EG was obviously declining rapidly and neither EG nor Valhall were competing for capital. So my question is, can you just discuss how the monetization of those higher costs assets, which are more capital intensive to grow or even just to keep flat? I mean, to what degree do you think those divestments improve the medium term to longer term F&D costs that you think your company is capable of delivering on a sustainable basis? If you could just help us quantify that or give some thoughts on how you think about that, I think that would be helpful. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. This will clearly improve our F&D costs as we move forward. I mean, part of our strategy of divesting these high-cost assets is to free up capital, accelerate value and be able to put that capital into our high return Guyana and Bakken assets. So if you look at Guyana, I mean, right now, if you just take phase one, that's a $7 F&D. If you just look at the gross costs there associated with Liza and the reserves that we're going to get, it's a $7 F&D. Take our Bakken numbers. Again, under $10 F&D. So we'll have a substantial improvement and that is, again, part of the key of this portfolio strategy moves are to get this capital to invest in these great return assets. The other thing, the other aspect of it, as you said, Norway was not generating much cash flow from us at all. We have significant abandonment expenditures. Actually Norway was only going to provide us $20 million of net cash flow in the quarter. I mean, sorry, for 2017. EG, like you said, was in decline. So there was $170 million of net cash flow in 2017, but we weren't investing because it didn't compete for capital. So the way we look at this, from a net cash flow standpoint, the proceeds that we got, we received a 14 times multiple on that net cash flow. So again that \u2013 and also that net cash flow on Norway was not going to improve here through 2020. EG was going to decline, so that wasn't going to be generating much free cash flow for us in our portfolio. As John mentioned too with the high costs of all these assets coming out of the portfolio and our cost reduction program, we can really start driving down our break-evens on F&D and our portfolio cash costs will be driven down under $10. So, again we just think just great strategic moves for us and our portfolio. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: And I also have to say, you know, I think our asset sales programs exceeded expectations with really high outcomes for the Norway, EG and Permian and we exceeded expectations, I'd say both in terms of proceeds and timing on a NAV basis. So we're very pleased with those outcomes and we brought a lot of value forward for assets that were high cost that really weren't generating much cash. Guy Baber - Simmons & Company: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, I had just one other kind of strategic question here. But can you elaborate just in a bit more detail on the statement that you all made that M&A is not really something you're looking at here, given the strength of the returns you see in your portfolio? I mean I'm sure you all are looking at what's available in the market around your core areas of focus. So just curious if this is a statement reflecting that you just don't believe M&A is necessary strategically in your portfolio right now or if there's just no way from what you see, that what you see in an M&A environment can compete on a returns basis where it's just using your capital and investing organically in the portfolio as it stands. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Right. We're all about focusing our portfolio on returns. And one of the reasons John said that about, you know, we certainly don't intend to pursue any M&A activity is because of returns and that our reshaped portfolio provides us with superior returns, investing in what we have obviously led by Guyana and the Bakken compared to any other outside opportunities. We're always looking to optimize the portfolio. We said that we would sell the higher-cost, lower-return assets to basically pre-fund Guyana. I think as I said before, we should celebrate the outstanding results we had because basically that cash allows us to pre-fund Guyana which is extremely high return. So it's all about returns. It's all about capital discipline. It's not about volume. It's about value and we're building a portfolio that I think will be very resilient in a low price environment, but have world class cash cost per barrel that really will position us for a decade plus of outstanding returns and cash generation. Guy Baber - Simmons & Company: Okay, that's great. I will leave it there. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Morning, Brian. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I think you're pretty clear in that last response on not wanting to pursue M&A with the improved balance sheet. Can you comment on if there's any change to a dividend policy given in part, some of the reduction in free cash flow from the assets being sold, and also the comment that you made on wanting to maintain strong liquidity while awaiting clarity on spending needs for phase two in Guyana? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Obviously, we're very aware of the importance of cash returns to shareholders given the much stronger position we're going to have in terms of cash and liquidity. We just need some more visibility into Exxon's plans for phase two and phase three of the Liza development, which we should have in the next month or so. But until we have this clarity, and you talked about dividends, but whether it's dividend or share buyback, we initially \u2013 and which is really cash returns to shareholders, we initially plan to maintain a strong liquidity position. But we will clearly consider improving cash returns to shareholders as appropriate once we have that visibility. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And that means no reduction in the dividend would be being considered, just to be clear on that as well. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Correct. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. And then my follow-up is on the Bakken. You mentioned the additional completion crew, which seems to, I think as you said, be temporary given some of the delays that you've had. Wondered if there's any change to strategy from an investment perspective in drilling beyond the temporary point in the fourth quarter in part considering the improved balance sheet and narrowing of focus too towards the Bakken and Guyana? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. I think as we mentioned it in our opening remarks, we are giving consideration to increasing the rig count in the Bakken in 2018 to six rigs. We have not made that decision, but it certainly it'll be part of our calculus as we do the budget this year. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And that is a function of your outlook on oil prices or the narrowed focus, not that it maybe matters, but would you put that in the this-would-have-happened-anyway camp or as a result of the asset sales? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. No, it's I mean it's primarily return's driven. We've just got such an outstanding inventory in the Bakken of wells that deliver outstanding returns all the way down to $40 and $50, so we want to get after that, that business in 2018. Again, have not made the decision yet, but we're giving it strong consideration. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question's from our Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah Greg, I had a couple questions on the Bakken. I wanted to see if you could comment how your testing of higher Bakken proppant concentrations are going. I think you're shifting to 140,000 pounds per stage. And also if you could kind of discuss the uptick in completion costs from $1.8 million to $3.1 million sequentially in 3Q. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. You bet. So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, our average well costs in the quarter were $5.8 million and about three quarters of the wells were these high proppant loading wells, 140,000 pounds per stage and those averaged about $6 million in the quarter. We fully expect those costs to come down as we apply lean manufacturing to the new completion design. The results of the 60-stage wells, again as I said in my remarks, are encouraging. They're early in their type curves. But again, the EURs are anticipated to be over 1 million barrels per well in 2017. The actual uplift for modeling and predictive analytics is estimating a 10% to 15% uplift in IP90 rates and we're actually seeing that in the field. So, so far, things are matching the models. I do want to get more type curve performance, but in January of 2018, we'll be able to give new guidance on what is our standard completion design? What IP90s can we expect? What well costs can we expect? And what EURs can we expect? But so far, very encouraging and value accretive moving to the 60 stages and the 140,000 pounds per stage. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: And can I \u2013 I just also want to clarify one thing on your question, because again we're seeing all positives. But the way \u2013 when you asked the question you said the increase in costs from second quarter to third quarter. If you're looking at our supplement, make sure you look at the footnote down there. We have apples and oranges between the second and third quarter. If we had broken out in the second quarter the 60, 140,000 wells and the 50, 70,000 there was no increase actually in cost from the same type of wells being drilled. The thing was we were just doing pilots here in the first and second quarter, so we were only putting the 50-stage fracs with the 70,000 pounds proppant there. And so now in the third quarter, since we've moved basically to the 60, 140,000s, we're just including all the wells there. So I just wanted to clarify that there's no real increase in our well cost. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's very helpful. And just Greg, the oil mix was a little bit lighter numbers in 3Q in the Bakken. Was that impacted by weather or anything? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Let me talk about this mix issue, because we always get the question. The first thing is there's no change in product mix at the wellhead. So overall GORs have remained flat at about 1550 standard cubic feet per barrel of oil and we expect, you know, our oil mix to stay in this kind of low-60% range for long time. Now the decrease in Q3 reflects two things. First is lower oil production due to the weather, because we had lower field availability overall and lots of road closures and then that was coupled with a 20% increase in previously flared wells being connected to our gas gathering system. So you had lower oil volumes due to weather, plus you had a significant uptick in the number of previously flared wells being added to that midstream business that we have. So that's what's causing the mix change quarter-to-quarter. Now, as I said we expect to remain in the low-60s, lower 60s, for the foreseeable future. Oil, however, is expected to grow at 10% a year with four rigs, but we will continue to hook up more previously flared gas to generate more profit in our Midstream business. So, there will be these quarter-to-quarter fluctuations depending on all those various well hook ups. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's helpful. And just Greg, could you give us an update on Stampede? Looks like it's running early and could come online in the first quarter. Could you just give us a sense of how you expect the production profile to trend at that project? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, thanks. So, first of all thanks. I mean Stampede is about six months ahead of schedule and it's running well below budget, particularly on the drilling side. On the drilling side we're 15% to 20% below AFE on the drilling side, so that's going extremely well. I think what the industry has learned in the Gulf of Mexico is that you need to ramp these wells up slowly and carefully. So we don't expect to reach our peak in Stampede until 2019. Our current development scope has six producers and four water injectors and those will be ramped up slowly over 2018. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks a lot. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Your line is open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Morning. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : If I may, I'm going to put one for all three of you if you don't mind John. John Hess, I'll start with you if I may. So, John you've made a lot of steps obviously in the last couple of days and you've seen what's happened to your stock. The market clearly has some concerns about something. If you really believe in the value of what you're doing in terms of Guyana, I know you've talked about it already, but to pull everything together cash in the balance sheet, hedge protection, the dividend burden and the pending sales next year likely including Guyana I'm guessing, why wouldn't you send the more obvious signal to the market on the buybacks? Because your stock's suffering, the steps aren't being recognized and the best M&A you can do in the market right now is your own share. So can you address that and maybe give some thoughts as to the scale of what you might consider? Because I think at this point the market needs some kind of a message from you, John? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thanks, Doug. Obviously, I think the first point is, we just completed these asset sales yesterday with outstanding results. And I think we brought a lot of value forward, certainly exceeded on an NAV basis most of the third-party estimates, and certainly exceeded expectation in terms of both proceeds and timing, so this just happened yesterday. That's number one. Number \u2013 and really what that does, as you point out in a $50 forever world and whatever one's views of oil prices are, you want to be financially prudent here, we basically brought forward these values and bolstered the cash on the balance sheet that we can pre-fund Guyana. And that's a big deal, because Guyana is great return. People often talk about living within your means. Well, by bringing the cash forward we are living within our means, meaning that we can pre-fund this world-class investment opportunity. Having said that, now that we have completed the sales, we can deliberate and bring clarity to the very question you're asking. And the importance of cash returns to shareholders given the strength of our cash and current liquidity position obviously gives us an opportunity to consider bolstering cash returns to shareholders as appropriate. We are going to do that. We want a little more visibility into Exxon's plans for phase two and three of the Liza development in Guyana. But once we have that clarity, I can assure you, we are going to clearly consider improving the cash returns to our shareholders as appropriate because you're right; our stock is a great investment. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. I'll maybe move on to number two if I may. And this is just very quickly on CapEx, on the last call John, John Rielly I guess, you indicated that the CapEx in 2018 would be similar to 2017 at $2.1 billion. With all these moves, can you give an early look at directionally how that CapEx profile should move next year? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: At this point, I'd still \u2013 I'd stick with that guidance and here's what the difference is from that last quarter is. So we do have the asset sales. So Norway, you're in that $120 million to $130 million of capital this year that will not be there next year. EG was very low. Now, as Greg mentioned, we are considering adding two more rigs in the Bakken during 2018. So you do have that type of offset. So, we're still looking at being flat, but we're going to be going through our normal budget and plan process and we'll be updating that with our fourth quarter numbers. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. My last one if I may then is for Greg. So Greg, on the production guidance, at the start of this year, the fourth quarter guidance, 330,000 to 340,000 [barrels of oil equivalent per day]. Can you walk through in a little bit more detail perhaps on what that momentum you talked about going into the first quarter looks like? Because even adjusting for a month of Equatorial Guinea and I guess a full quarter of Norway, it still seems that the guide is a bit light. So could you help us understand or reconcile, what the differences are and what you would expect going into Q1? I'll leave it there. Thanks. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Doug, let me split your question into two. The first one is just fourth quarter guidance compared to our third quarter actual production, which I think was part of your question. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the asset sales will be 14,000 to 15,000 barrels a day negative depending on timing. We talked about the knock-on effects in the Gulf of Mexico, particularly as it's associated to Penn State-6, and then the unplanned maintenance downtime from the Shell operated facility on Enchilada that affects Conger. The combination of those two things is about 8,000 barrels a day. And then you get the reversal of that temporary NEI adjustment in JDA, which is another 8,000. Now all that's offset though by North Malay Basin coming up to full field ramp up and then also the Bakken. So that's why we guided this 290,000 to 300,000 [barrels of oil equivalent per day] in the fourth quarter relative to the 299,000 [barrels of oil equivalent per day] that we experienced in the third quarter. In regards to your momentum question, I mean if you think about it, year-to-date we've only been op \u2013 our average rig count in the Bakken is three. That'll be fully four rigs as we go into 2018. And as John Rielly mentioned, that could be six rigs in 2018. That's one piece. We have Stampede coming on stream in early 2018 now, in the first quarter. So, that'll be another strong production momentum. And the final thing is you'll have North Malay Basin fully at plateau. So, those three pieces are really what are going to provide the strong production momentum as we go into 2018. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. I'll walk through the moving parts with you, but appreciate the time guys. Thanks. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I guess, can we talk a little bit about, from a micro standpoint, price realization in the Bakken? Came in a little bit lighter than would've thought, whether hedged or not hedged. DAPL opening up, would have expected a little bit better. Just curious maybe what some of the moving parts were there. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So in the third quarter when you compare the third quarter to second quarter, actually even with DAPL, the Clearbrook was essentially unchanged, the second quarter to third quarter. And now, a good majority of our production doesn't go to Clearbrook. Just like all other operators, you have to get it out of the basin. So with Clearbrook essentially unchanged, and you're moving your product outside of North Dakota, you just have some additional cost comparatively between the second and third quarter even with DAPL starting up. So that's where that is in the third quarter. Now right at the end of the third quarter going into the fourth quarter, Clearbrook has clearly improved. So, those values from Clearbrook would show up more in the fourth quarter. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah, and we're also taking advantage of the export market. Year-to-date we've had three exports. In fact I think we were one of the first companies if not the first company to export Bakken crude a year ago. So we actually have had four exports over the last 12 months or so. So, we basically optimize all of our marketing outlets to maximize value and over time that's created relative superior value at the wellhead versus any of our competitors in the Bakken. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : No, I appreciate that. I was just curious if it was anything other than market conditions, but it's sounds like that's all it is. And then sort of a broader question, as you've gone through the asset sale process, and clearly the goal here to get overall operating costs, whether cash or non-cash down. You've done some of these asset sales and we've seen both gains and losses as you've adjusted to what the underlying asset values were. And I was just curious if you step back and look at the overall portfolio here going forward, are there any more sort of asset write downs that will affect depreciation in the future? I know this is an annual test type thing and, you know, prices at the end of the year. But I was just curious if that's any component of future lower DD&A or if we should think about it solely as the new projects coming in or simply you know, better than what's going out the door? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Well, first you should start with that, that the new projects or the projects like Bakken and Guyana, they're going to have better returns than the assets that we're divesting. So clearly, that's going to drive improvements in cash costs and DD&A and F&D, everything as we spoke about before. As far as just accounting, we go through and it goes on a quarterly basis. You evaluate what prices are. We'll be going through our budget and plan with the board and setting price (00:55:57) in the fourth quarter and we'll look at all assets at that point in time on where prices are, and then you go through your normal impairment reviews at that point in time. But that will happen on a quarterly basis. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Evan Calio of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah, good morning guys. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Maybe another follow-up on the cash balance question for John. Yeah, really reading between the lines of your comments, you mentioned you'll have a better idea on Guyana phase two and phase three timing in the next few months, that you could consider potential buyback at that time. Yet, I guess my question is on the spending side. What is the earliest you could be spending on Guyana phase two and phase three post FID type spending? Meaning, is there a reasonable scenario where you will need the cash from asset sales to support or to bridge to the post Liza startup period? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Hey, Evan, this is Greg. So again Exxon's still working on it. We are in early phases of feed on phase two, but we just can't be specific yet on the exact timing of when phase two and phase three could come about. I mean, clearly with 2.25 billion to 2.75 billion barrels of recoverable, you're going to need more than just phase one to get at that. But timing on both of those, I don't want to comment on because Exxon's still in various phases of planning that. We should have clarity on that, as John mentioned, as we go through the budget process by year end. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And that's clarity through I've got a 2020 timeframe then? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yes. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Let me ask a different question. I know you guys have been successful and very active in high grading the portfolio. Again, an asset that you didn't discuss, I mean, can you discuss the attributes that make Malaysia core to remain in the portfolio given that would likely be an accretive sale of pursuit? Can you talk about how that fits? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes. So I mean, just now when you look at our portfolio now and as we get through to 2020 with Guyana, we want to be in a situation right that we set ourselves up in this portfolio that we've got a low-cost, cash-generative portfolio and have the ability through these asset sales to bring cash forward to pre-fund effectively Guyana. What Malaysia now provides us, and I'm saying now is because we were developing North Malay Basin. North Malay Basin now is coming on. It's ramping up to its full production capacity. Putting North Malay Basin and JDA together, I guess the best way I'd describe this as a nice long-term infrastructure asset that provides this cash brick. Just cash flows year-in, year-out in your portfolio and it's both the JDA and North Malay Basin. Obviously their PSCs, prices go down, you get coverage as prices go down. So it's a great part, that this Malaysia asset is just really key for us to drive our cash flow to help fund our assets. Now, go forward, you never know long-term what happens, but Malaysia is right now a key core asset for us to generate cash flow and drive us through to 2020 as Guyana comes on. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah, and another way to bring perspective to it from a strategic viewpoint, is the cornerstone or core of our portfolio is going to be Guyana and Bakken which are low-cost, high-return growth assets and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia, which are low-cost cash-generating assets. The focus in the portfolio is much sharper. It's the areas that are low cost and basically we are redeploying the capital from the high cost mature assets into the low cost high return assets. And at the same time, simplifying and focusing the portfolio which we think will bring forward a lot of value for our shareholders. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Maybe one more if I could, just on the Bakken more minor. Can you talk about what drove the sequential declines in the 90-day cumes there? I know, it appears that most of the program is well within the McKenzie area. Just trying to understand that variance. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, thanks for that, Evan. I figured that would come up. So you know in the third quarter the IP90s averaged 840 barrels of oil per day, which is fully in line with our guidance of 800 to 850 [barrels of oil per day]. Now in the second quarter, we had IP90s that were in over 1,000 [barrels of oil per day]. So what's driving that? Really simple. It's where the rigs were located. So those IP90s in the second quarter were reflecting eight wells in the core of the core of the Keene area, which is the absolute best area in the field. I think, you know, if you step back though, you know, as John mentioned in some of his remarks, our IP90s have averaged 890 barrels of oil per day over the first three quarters of 2017 versus 580 barrels a day over those same three quarters in 2016. So that's an improvement of about 50%, you know, just comparing year-on-year in IP90. So the trend is outstanding. And again, that's from these higher stage counts, and then as we move into higher proppant loading as well. So the quarterly fluctuation is purely a function of well mix. And as we added rigs 3 and 4 in the Bakken, we had to spread those rigs out because operationally you had (01:02:05) issues, infrastructure that you're trying to balance. So you moved outside of that, you know fantastic core of the core rock in Keene. You had to put rigs in other areas of the field. But again, just look at the overall average; very substantial improvement in IP90s. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I presume that will be supported. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: But that will fluctuate. Yeah, there will be fluctuation quarter-to-quarter just based on well mix. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And 5 and 6 will add to that, I presume. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: It will. I mean, in terms of operational flexibility, you'll have to move into other areas of the field if you have 6 rigs versus 4 and we'll give guidance on that if we make the decision to go to 6. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. And we'll give guidance on that in January just like we always do, yeah. Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Appreciate it guys. Thank you very much. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And next question's from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Thanks for taking the call. This is Muhammad (01:03:06) on behalf of Pavel. So the two recent asset divestitures that you guys announced in EG and Norway, those are both pretty high-tax countries. How do you expect the closing of those divestitures to affect your income tax rate? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. So I gave on \u2013 when I gave the pro forma numbers, you saw the benefit that we were recording was \u2013 our actual was 18% in the third quarter and on a pro forma basis, that goes down to 2%. So it all depends that \u2013 what that means is as you can tell, those assets had losses and were generating losses in the portfolio. And so, we'll have less losses and you won't be benefiting, just like you said, at those higher tax rates. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Yeah. Sorry, I must have missed that. Thanks. One other question for me. So last month, the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea decided in favor of Ghana in their maritime dispute with the Ivory Coast. How do you guys expect to proceed with your, I guess, acreage in that region or in the offshore of that country. Are you guys planning to continue drilling or monetize that acreage? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Now that there's clarity on the border dispute, we can proceed with the best way to optimize the value of the asset. Unknown Speaker : So, no more details other than that. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Correct. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thank you. That's all for me. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Hi. Good morning, everyone. There's tremendous interest in the market, particularly on the buy side for return on capital employed improvements and I was hoping that you could walk me through the path to a better return on capital employed for Hess, perhaps over the next five years. I think we all understand that you're out spending for Guyana. It seems that with the hedging you've announced, you're kind of planning on $50 or sort of locking into $50 certainly for next year. Sounds like it'll be flat CapEx. So, with the cash on the balance sheet, I can get there on the cash side of the story. The problem I think has been that the shareholder equity keep shrinking and we're seeing net income losses. And I guess the easy thing might be, John Rielly, for us to talk about DD&A reductions given what you've said about marginal barrels being so much higher return than trailing barrels. But any help you can give me on that would be great. Thank you. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. I mean obviously I think we've said it over and over. The whole goal of our strategy here in these portfolio moves are to improve the returns on invested capital. So that's what we're focused on. So now by selling those high cost assets and just from that prior question, as you know, those assets, just from, as I told you on a pro forma tax rate, were generating losses in the portfolio, and you're right. We are doing all this and planning for, can you call it a low price or an extended $50 oil price environment, and we believe we set ourselves up to win in this $50 environment because one, now we have the cash to be able to fund Guyana just like you said. And then the assets that we will be investing in which are Guyana and we've gone through the returns there, and I know we've gone through this, we have it in our investor deck of how Guyana can compete and actually do better than even some Permian, Delaware type assets in a low price environment. So, that will improve our returns. And like we said earlier, Liza has a $7 F&D, so that will drive down DD&A. The Bakken as well will continue with the investments that we have at four rigs and as you know, we're evaluating going to six rigs. The reason we're evaluating going to six rigs is because of the tremendous returns that we see in our portfolio there and we have plenty of well locations that work at sub $50. So that will also, a low F&D and improved returns in both Bakken and Guyana are going to be at a cash cost lower than our current portfolio average. So the returns that we generate there are going to improve and the point and the goal and I guess the way you can measure it is, as we say post Guyana in a $50 world, when that comes up, it's all these investments will be generating free cash flow post the Guyana production starting up. And then as you will start to see that, we'll generate, post the Guyana production again, net income will continue to increase along with that cash flow. So it is all about trying to shift and reallocate the capital in our portfolio to the highest returns and we believe these Bakken and Guyana investments will really drive that improvement in return on capital employed. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : To be specific, yeah, thank you, I understand that. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Could you be specific on the dynamic of the DD&A coming down though? Do we have to wait several years for this to happen or how can we forecast for DD&A to start getting that net income improvement that we want? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Okay. So I mean, you heard at least from a pro forma standpoint, we're dropping in the third quarter. It went over $1. So that's one thing just starting there. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Yeah. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: When these assets come out of the portfolio, you're going to get that. Every time we bring on a new barrel in the Bakken, with this F&D, that's driving down our DD&A rate. And then Guyana, now the big change there with the F&D there, that won't happen until 2020. So it's just going to be a progression as we move through from 2017 to 2020 on driving down that DD&A rate. And like you said on the \u2013 we talked about on the cash cost, you can just start from where we are right now at $14 driving it down to under $10 as we go to 2020. So it's just going to be that slow progression on cash costs and DD&A as we move through. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Understood. So just very finally, could you guide me through DD&A for next year? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: No, I can't exactly at this point, but I can do that on the fourth quarter. With all else being the same, you would use this pro forma number of that I said were $23.72, and then that would come down based on the investments and the growth that we have in the Bakken coming through. So it'll be lower than that number in 2018. And then we'll continue to look at all the assets and on our portfolio mix, it depends on where production is as we go into 2018. And I'll update on our call then. Paul Sankey - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question's from Jeffrey Campbell of the Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning and congratulations on the recent asset sales. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Maybe another way to ask a question that is sort of tangential to some of this discussion we've been having around the portfolio and uses of cash. You said that Guyana will be self-funding once Liza phase one comes online. Or at least I believe that's what you've said. And there's obviously a lot of future development there. Do you have any idea how long you think it'll take to generate free cash flow from Guyana development? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. It's too early to comment on that because again, it depends on the timing of phases two and three. And we hope to get clarity about that from the operator in ExxonMobil before the end of the year. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Just for phase one, as we've said in meetings with investors, just phase one in and of itself, you get your cash back in about three years from first production. So that's infinitely superior to any shale investment you would make that's seven to 10 years, even the best of shale. So the cash-on-cash returns in Guyana are much superior to anything you can get in shale. It's not to disparate shale. Shale's a different investment profile, but Guyana is truly superior to almost any other investment you can make in the E&P space in the world. So we can talk intelligently about phase one because we've authorized it. We just have to wait for the phasing a phase two and phase three to give you the macro picture on Guyana itself for Hess. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: No, I appreciate that and I think kind of where I was trying to go is that before people get so comfortable with selling assets that are obviously generating free cash now, one should step back and think about when free cash is going to emerge from Guyana. If I could ask one other Guyana question real quick, does the success of Turbot influence your confidence in impending Suriname exploration in any way? And can you remind us what's coming up for exploration there? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. So Block 42 in Suriname as you mentioned, we see that as being part of the same play fairway as Liza. We're currently interpreting in 3D seismic there and evaluating to drill a well in 2018. So Block 42 looks great and of course we also, as you know, entered Block 59 along with ExxonMobil and Statoil; that's a third, a third, a third equity each. That's a very big block. That's 500 Gulf of Mexico blocks. We also see it as part of the same play fairway as Liza and the co-ventures now we're just beginning to plan seismic program. So 42, likely a well in 2018; 59, too early to comment on when we might be drilling there because we got to get the seismic done first. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the color. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question's from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Maybe just one first question on some of the guidance you provided with the asset sales on a move towards a $10 a barrel OpEx target and $150 million in cost savings by the end of this decade. Are there any efficiencies built into the assumption or is it just the result of rolling off higher cost barrels and overhead, or could we see upside to those numbers from additional efficiencies? And maybe what level of activity in the Bakken is embedded in those numbers? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So what we have in those numbers to get down to the $10 is, I'm not assuming any efficiencies per se in there. So, I mean, again our teams have been really good on continuing to drive down our cash costs across our portfolio. So there are potential upside to those numbers. So you do have the higher-cost barrels that will be coming out and then you have the $150 million of cost savings which I did not factor into those numbers there. Then, what helps to drive is kind of the \u2013 going back to what Greg was talking about on the pro forma production momentum. So you have North Malay Basin which is coming in at the full rate starting in 2018. That is one of the lowest cash cost assets we have in the portfolio. Stampede coming on. Gulf of Mexico assets very low cost, so that will continue to drive down the cash costs and then you have the Bakken. So activity levels that we talked about in here, we've got four rigs in there. We know we're considering going to six. We have the four rigs and the additional production, as you can talk about our oil production growth of 10% per year. With that our low cash costs will also drive down the cost. And then obviously when Guyana comes on you get the final piece to drive it down. So, yeah, no, we're not assuming any heroic efficiencies or anything in there. It's the quality of our assets and the investments in these high-return assets along with the start-up of our developments that will drive these costs down to $10 and below. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. And then maybe in light of all that talk about portfolio activity, any comment on how the Utica fits into this in terms of longer term plans and ability to attract capital within the portfolio? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I think the Utica as you know, the only challenge with the Utica right now is just that the netbacks, because it's infrastructure constrained. We see those infrastructure constraints opening up in 2018/2019. I always have to remind people it's a good position in the Utica. It's in the heart of liquids window. It only has 5% royalty. It just needs some help on price. It offers good growth. Currently, it doesn't and it currently it does not compete with the Bakken obviously. So, it's going to be a function of price as to what we do with Utica. But it's got good returns at a reasonable gas price, so. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question's from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is open. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys, and good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Hey, Paul. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Greg, on Turbot, I assume it will be a individual development, not a tie back. From that standpoint then, what is the minimum resource size in order for that to be economic at $50 Brent? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Paul, obviously it's \u2013 we're very excited by the discovery as we mentioned in our opening remarks, because it opens up a new province or area in the southeastern part of the block. It's too early to kind of speculate on how much volume it's going to take, et cetera. It's got its own sort of unique attributes, but it's very encouraging and very exciting. We will want to get an appraisal well in it sometime in 2018. Once we have that appraisal well, we'll have a better idea of go-forward development plans for that, I'll call it the greater Turbot area. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And the Turbot at 75 feet is there a continuous column or there is several different columns? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: It's broken into just a couple of sand packages, but there's one very large thick package within that column. So that's going to be the big target. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So that when you said very big is it what, 60 feet, 50 feet or up to 75 feet or 40 feet? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, of this 75 feet I think it's around 60 feet of it. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And that the next on Bakken, Greg, earlier you mentioned that one of the reason why, or the primary reason why the IP90 changed from the second to third quarter is because of the core of the core well, the conversation changed. Can you tell us that what is the average differences between the core of the core well and the rest of your portfolio? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, I think again Paul, you have to look at kind of what our guidance is for the year. So 800 to 850 [barrels of oil per day] is what we guided for the IP90s for the year. And again in Q2, the core of the core, which was the Keene area, and it was only eight wells, the IP90s coming in there were around over 1,000 [barrels of oil per day]. So I would just say, look at the average. The 800 to 850 [barrels of oil per day] is a good reflection of the average at the core that we're drilling this year. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. And... Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: But within that, there's some very outstanding wells obviously. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right, because it seems like Keene is maybe is more like in the 1,300 to 1,500 [barrels of oil per day], I would assume. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, because in Q2, the IP90 results that were reflected there were only eight wells in Keene. Right? Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So it will be even higher than that. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And all the... Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, those were \u2013 so Paul, just let me clarify that. So in Q2, we quoted over 1,000 IPs. Again, that's eight wells right in the heart of the Keene. So that is the average of eight wells and they were all about the same. So they were all around that 1,000 to 1,100 oil IP90. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Very good. And on the 2,800 additional drilling location that you have in Bakken roughly, how many of them are in the, what you call the core of the core? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, I think a better way to think about that is, which we've done in our investor conferences, there's a slide in our pack, is if you look at the inventory, now, I'm going to describe this as 50-stage, 70,000 pounds because it hasn't been updated for 60-stage, and 140,000 pounds, so these numbers will change. They'll get better. But certainly at 70,000 pounds, we have about 1,500 wells of the 3,000 wells that generate an after-tax return of 15% or higher at $50 Brent. Or $50 WTI, sorry. So that gives you an idea that at least half of the 3,000 wells generate a very high return at these kind of prices. So that gives you a sense, right? Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: For how much is there. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. And then the final one is for John Rielly. John, on the $150 million restructuring, can you give us some additional \u2013 elaborate a little bit more in terms of some detail on number of head you're going to cut the area that where that they're going to come from the functionality, that kind of things? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So it will be across the board. I mean, I think, you will see the majority from an income statement line item will be in the G&A line item. But we will have some that will be \u2013 some of our reduction will be in our operating costs as well. And just so \u2013 like we will be finishing all our work on that and our organization redesigning in 2018 and we will have transition costs in 2018 that offset some of these savings. So it's really, from 2019 on is where you'll see this $150 million cost savings kind of flowing through our numbers. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And can you tell us that what is the number of head count that you plan to reduce, and where is the ... John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: No, I... Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Is it in the corporate headquarter or is going to be in your Houston office, or what kind of function because... John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: This will be \u2013 it'll be a... Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: It's a pretty big number. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yeah. It's a big number. I mean obviously with Norway, EG and then Denmark being sold, there is a reduction in our portfolio and what we're doing is just rationalizing our fixed cost base that we have here to support our production portfolio. And it's just going to be part of that. We've done high level design on this. The reductions will be across all aspects be it central functions, be it corporate, be it E&P. So we're looking at all of that. And as I said, you'll start to see it in 2018 because we will be enacting it. It's just that we will have transition costs in 2018 and get the full benefit in 2019. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, because I just scratching my head on E&P given that in (01:23:32) you are not a operator so I would imagine the cost, your back office support cost associated there is not that great or not that high and just for Denmark and EG, since the elimination of those two assets translate into $150 million in reduction in G&A because that seems a very high number. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So look, we have put it on paper and we feel comfortable, very comfortable with that $150 million. You've got to factor in a lot of ancillary costs. So you've got supply chain activities in every one of those areas. We've got tax activities in every one of those areas. We do have finance support in all of those areas, IT support in all of those areas. So we've looked at all of that. And so, it will be head count, it will be other operational type costs that will be reduced and I will tell you I feel very comfortable about the $150 million by 2019. Again we will incur this transition cost in 2018. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Just a final one. Does that mean that the (01:24:44) from a P&L standpoint show up in your corporate (01:24:50) number or they're showing up in your U.S. E&P earning number? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: The bulk of this was because the support is really for our E&P, so the bulk of it will be in the E&P numbers, being able to reduce our costs within E&P, but there's going to be clearly corporate cost reductions as well. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question's from Bob Morris of Citi. Your line is open. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. We've gone quite a long time here, so I'll be brief here. But in looking at 2018 even with a flat budget and $50 oil, $3 gas, you'll outspend cash flow and I get the returns in the Bakken and adding perhaps two more rigs. But how do you think about the cash flow outspend in that environment? Is there a limit as to, with the cash on the balance sheet, how much you're willing to outspend cash flow in 2018, or how do you monitor that? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah, I think the key point here is the Bakken itself has to be cash generative. One of the reasons we went to two rigs and then four was to ensure in a low price environment, it would not only grow, but be cash generative. But one of the holdbacks on the Bakken was the corporate cash position. Now that the corporate cash position is better, we can invest in the higher-return low-cost projects, the Bakken really is one of those first calls on capital along with Guyana. And that really underpins sort of the base spend along with some of the investment that we still have to do in Stampede and the JDA even though they're going from cash users to cash generators. So that really speaks for like 90% of the spend that we're going to have next year and I can assure you, we're going to keep it very tight, minimize the outspend, but most of the outspend is being driven by the need to invest in Guyana which again, offers superior returns to almost anything else in the E&P business. So we're very mindful of the corporate position and that's why we're really redeploying the proceeds from the high-cost, lower-return and mature assets to the lower-cost, high-return assets which really positions the company for a much lower unit cost and improved cash generator and return on capital employed for many years to come. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Oh, that's great. That makes sense. And then Greg, just quickly here, you mentioned that the average EURs this year for the Bakken are sort of trending to just over 1 MBOE, but that appears to be a mix of the 50, 70,000 and the 60, 140,000 wells and if we break out the data on just the 60, 140,000s, those appear to be trending at something a little bit better than 1.2 MBOE. Is that on target there? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I think you're in the range. Again it's early days so I want to see more type curve performance before I'd be definitive, but you're definitely in the range. I just wanted to clarify one thing John said. The spend in Malaysia next year is not JDA; it's actually North Malay as we have to add some more wells to stay at capacity. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Yeah. I meant Malaysia overall. Exactly. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question's from David Heikkinen of Heikkinen Energy. Your line is open. David Martin Heikkinen - Heikkinen Energy Advisors, LLC: Thank you guys. You actually got all my questions. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Okay. Thank you. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. Our next question's from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Yeah. A couple for Greg and then one for John. Regarding Turbot, Greg, how would you characterize the structure vis-\u00e0-vis Payara vis-\u00e0-vis Liza, because it's a big step out? Is it a similar kind of structure? Could you describe it a little bit more? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, it is. I mean it's basically a stratigraphic trap, so it's like the Liza complex, again playing the stratigraphic traps that get trapped in the rim of the bowl as the sediments before they plunge down into the basin. Very similar. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Okay. Regarding inflation, you've locked in some sand purchases earlier this year for this year. Are you going to do that again in 2018, and what are you seeing on the inflation side in terms of cost for infill service? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. You bet. So, I think again, I think as I said last time, it's really a tale of two cities, right? So, in offshore we see flat to further declining costs, rigs and shipyard construction in particular are experiencing further downward pressure, which is being reflected in the Guyana development. Onshore, industry cost trends are increasing, but you know, as we mentioned, we have taken steps to contain the costs by not only locking in rig and pumping rates, but also pre-purchasing sand and putting in place some longer term contracts on many of those services. So, at least in 2018, those steps that we've made in our lean manufacturing approach, we think we can deliver our 2018 program with minimal inflation. There will be some, but it will likely be single-digit. It won't be massive. Now as we do our budget in 2019, we'll be relooking at all that. The pressure on sand has gone off as more mines have opened up. That was a transitory thing, and that's why we locked in the proppant, and we're still in the money on that deal. So that turned out to be a good deal on the end. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Okay, thanks. My one for John Rielly is the head count. Obviously, you just sold assets, so how much smaller is the Hess workforce going to be ballpark? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So, at this point, we're not going to provide that number. The cost reduction of $150 million are going to run across the board. There will be head count reductions, there will be vendor cost reductions, just due to the size of the portfolio getting smaller. But it's just premature for me to give those type of numbers. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : (01:31:09) John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. We've had over the last two years probably a 30% reduction in head count. And there's more to come. So, people want the sizing. Obviously it's a work in progress. It has to do with a reshaped portfolio, we'll reshape the organization, minimize corporate and then really right size the organization to support the asset portfolio we're going to have. So, we don't want to front run the announcement on that. But at the end of the day, I want you to know, there's been significant reductions already. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question's from Ross Payne of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : How you doing guys? Free cash flow, you're currently producing a decent amount of it and even after asset sales, you'll have a reasonable amount. Is it one way to look at this is, the current free cash flow covers the core CapEx for the company and then the asset sales are funding most of Liza? And second of all, it's $1 billion for phase one of Liza. Can we estimate about the same number for phase two, and maybe another $1 billion for phase three? Thanks. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So, your estimates are exactly right on the cash flow and that the asset sales are coming into to fund this great opportunity that we have in Guyana. As you said, you have that phase one cost. We don't have any guidance out there. The only thing I will tell you is that the initial phase one FPSO has a capacity of 120,000 barrels per day. It has not been landed what phase two and phase three are, but it could be likely to be at a larger size than that 120,000 [barrels per day]. But outside of that, we haven't had any additional guidance that we're able to give out at this point in time. Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then on the share repurchase, would you pretty much want to hear what phase two and possibly phase three is going to look like before you step into stock repurchases with the excess cash that it looks like you're going to be bringing in from this plus Denmark? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I mean, the thing on phase two and phase three, I would say Exxon's pretty far along on getting that definition. We just want a little more clarity on that. So, it's not that far out in time, when we would be able to get that clarity. And then, while we want to maintain a strong liquidity position to make sure we can prefund Guyana, which is a great investment, once we have that clarity, obviously we will clearly consider cash returns to shareholders as appropriate. Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : All right. Thanks. That's it for me. Thanks. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2017 Hess Corporation Conference Call. My name is Ayeila, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Ayeila. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information, which will be provided on our website during the Hess Midstream Partners Conference call today at 4 :30 PM. Now, as usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I will review our overall strategy and plans. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance and 2018 guidance, and John Rielly will review our financial results. Our company is making significant progress in our strategy : to grow our resource base in a capital-disciplined manner; to move down the cost curve so that we are resilient in a low oil price environment; and to be cash-generative at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price post 2020. In 2017, consistent with our strategy, we moved aggressively to high-grade and focus our portfolio by investing in our highest return assets in Guyana and the Bakken and divesting higher cost mature assets. This portfolio high-grading in turn is lowering our cash unit operating costs, bolstering our balance sheet and enabling us to pre-fund our world-class Guyana oil developments while also returning capital to shareholders and reducing debt. Our portfolio is now focused on Guyana and the Bakken as our growth engines and Malaysia and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as our cash engines. On a pro forma basis, we expect to generate capital-efficient compound annual production growth of approximately 10% per year through 2020. The combination of investing in lower cost assets and divesting higher cost assets along with a meaningful $150 million annual cost reduction program is expected to drive our cash unit production cost down by approximately 30% to less than $10 per barrel of oil equivalent by 2020. As a result, we expect to generate cash flow growth of more than 20% per year at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price and more than 30% per year at a $60 per barrel Brent oil price through 2020. In terms of our portfolio high-grading, our asset monetizations in 2017 resulted in total proceeds of $3.4 billion and the release of $1.3 billion of asset retirement obligations. In October, we announced the sale of our mature higher-cost assets in Norway for total proceeds of $2 billion and Equatorial Guinea for total proceeds of $650 million. Both transactions closed in the fourth quarter as planned. These sales followed the divestiture of our mature Permian enhanced oil recovery assets in August for total proceeds of $600 million and the successful IPO of Hess Midstream Partners in April that resulted in net proceeds of $175 million. In addition, we have commenced a sales process for our interest in Denmark, which we expect to complete in 2018. Proceeds from our asset sales will first and foremost be used to pre-fund our world-class investment opportunity in Guyana. In addition, we plan to increase from four rigs to six rigs in the Bakken in the second half of 2018, where we have a robust inventory of high-return drilling locations. Also, we intend to buy back up to $500 million in stock and reduce debt of $500 million. As we get further clarity on the capital requirements for future phases of development in Guyana as well as the outlook for oil prices, we plan to evaluate additional returns of capital to shareholders. Key to our strategy is our position in Guyana, an extraordinary oil investment opportunity that is uniquely advantaged by its scale, reservoir quality, cost, rapid cash paybacks and superior financial returns. The Stabroek block in Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest, covers 6.6 million acres and contains a massive world-class resource that keeps getting bigger and better. We have discovered some of the highest quality reservoirs in the world with high porosity and permeability that are expected to deliver very high recovery factors and production rates. Also, ExxonMobil, as a world-class operator, brings extensive project management experience and a great track record with this type of development. In January, we announced a sixth oil discovery on the Stabroek block with a Ranger-1 well, which encountered 230 feet of high-quality oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. This world-class discovery confirms the presence of a working petroleum system more than 60 miles northwest of the Liza development area, increasing the prospectivity of this part of the block where we see a number of large exploration prospects. Excluding Ranger, estimated gross discovered recoverable resources on the block were recently increased to more than 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up from the prior range of 2.5 billion to 2.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In addition, we continue to see multi-billion barrels of additional exploration potential across the block. The Liza Phase 1 development, which was sanctioned last June, will develop approximately 450 million barrels of oil through an FPSO vessel that will have the gross capacity to produce up to 120,000 barrels of oil per day. Development drilling is planned to start later this year. First production from the Liza Phase 1 development is expected in March 2020. An application for an environmental permit to develop the second phase at Liza has been submitted. The concept involves a larger FPSO and subsea systems that would have a production capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day with startup expected by mid-2022. As you may have seen from ExxonMobil's announcement last Friday, planning is also underway for a third phase of development with an FPSO at Payara, closely following Liza Phase 2. The size of this third ship will be a function of future appraisal drilling. With $7 per barrel unit development cost for Liza Phase 1 and cash payback in approximately three years at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price, our investment opportunity in Guyana is one of the most attractive in the world today. Now, turning to our 2017 financial results. Our adjusted net loss was $1.4 billion compared to $1.5 billion in 2016. And cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $1.7 billion, up from $842 million in the prior year. As you saw in our release, we took a non-cash charge of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter for an accounting write-down of our Tubular Bells and Stampede assets to fair value. John Rielly we'll talk more about this. But the charge was required under the accounting rules given our lower long-term oil price outlook and has no impact on our portfolios' ability to generate free cash flow at a $50 per barrel Brent to oil price post 2020. In terms of 2017 reserve replacement, we had an outstanding year. We replaced 351% percent of production with proved reserve additions of 397 million barrels of oil equivalent at an F&D cost of just over $5 per barrel of oil equivalent. Proved reserves at yearend stood at 1.15 billion barrels of oil equivalent, higher than 2016 even with asset sales that reduced reserves by 239 million barrels and production of 113 million barrels of oil equivalent during 2017. And our reserve life was 10.2 years. Full year production for 2017 was 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Pro forma for the sales of our interest in Norway, Equatorial Guinea and Permian-enhanced oil recovery assets, our production 2017 was 242,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. In 2018, our production is forecast to average between 245,000 and 255,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This forecast reflects reduced production of 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to asset sales and 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to the unplanned shutdown of Shell's Enchilada platform in the Gulf of Mexico, which is expected to be partially offset by growth in the Bakken and higher volumes from North Malay Basin. From our 2017 pro forma base of 242,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, we remain on track to deliver 10% compounded annual production growth through 2020. Now, turning to the Bakken, our largest operated growth asset. We have an industry-leading position with more than 500,000 net acres in the core of the play and are on track to grow production to approximately 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 compared to 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017. Through the application of geo steering, optimized spacing, higher stage counts and profit loading, we have increased our well productivity by approximately 50% over the last two years. These improvements, together with our low drilling and completion costs, have enabled us to generate returns that are competitive with any shale play in the United States. The increased activity from two additional rigs in 2018 is expected to generate capital-efficient production growth of 15% to 20% per year through 2020 and deliver average returns that are in the range of 40% to 50% at a $50 per barrel WTI price from 2018 wells online. Bakken production in 2017 averaged 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and in 2018 is forecast to average between 115,000 and 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In summary, we continue to execute on our strategy, and our reshaped portfolio is positioned to deliver a decade-plus of capital-efficient growth, with increasing cash generation and returns to shareholders. The success of our asset sales program in 2017 further focuses our portfolio on higher return assets and lowers our cash unit costs, while strengthening our balance sheet to fund our world-class oil investment opportunity in Guyana, which we believe will create significant value for our shareholders for many years to come. Now, Greg. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thanks, John. 2017 was marked by strong execution, both strategically and operationally. First, in terms of our developments, we achieved first gas in July at the North Malay Basin full field development where Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, safely, on time and under budget. During the fourth quarter, North Malay Basin reached its planned plateau rate of approximately 165 million cubic feet of net gas per day, establishing the asset as a significant long-term, low-cost cash generator for the company. Throughout 2017, we also successfully advanced development of the Stampede field, where Hess is operator and has a 25% interest. I'm pleased to announce that we have achieved first oil from the field in January. The Hess team, working effectively with our partners Chevron, Statoil, and Nexen, delivered a highly complex project in just over three years from sanction safely, ahead of schedule, and under budget. We intend to gradually ramp up production over the next 18 months. Second, in the Bakken, we executed successful pilots of 60-stage completions with increased proppant loading, which confirmed that we are getting a 10% to 15% uplift in IP180 productivity and expected ultimate recovery, or EUR, from our previous standard. As a result, we've increased our EUR estimate from our Bakken acreage to 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent from our previous estimate of 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Wells brought online in 2018 are expected to deliver an average EUR of greater than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent and generate returns of 40% to 50% at a $50 per barrel WTI. In addition, we've increased by 25% the number of wells that can deliver a 15% return or higher at $50 per barrel WTI to 1,780 wells, which represents more than 60% of our remaining well inventory. Third, on the 6.6 million acre Stabroek block in Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest, the extraordinary exploration success continues with discoveries in 2017 at Payara, Snoek, Liza Deep and Turbot. In January, we announced a sixth oil discovery. The Ranger-1 well encountered approximately 230 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. This is important in that it demonstrates a working petroleum system more than 60 miles northwest of Liza and opens up multiple further play types across the Stabroek block. Excluding Ranger, discovered recoverable resources for the block were increased to 3.2 billion gross barrels of oil equivalent, more than triple the estimate from this time last year. In June 2017, we sanctioned the first phase of Liza development, which will develop on a gross basis approximately 450 million barrels of oil through an FPSO vessel with gross capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. First production from the Liza Phase 1 development is expected in March 2020. Fourth, we successfully executed $3.4 billion of monetizations in 2017, with values and timing that exceeded expectations. Fifth, we delivered proved reserve additions of 397 million net barrels of oil equivalent, representing an organic replacement rate of 351% and an F&D cost of just over $5 per barrel of oil equivalent. About 70% of the additions were in the Bakken, reflecting new proved undeveloped reserves, improved prices, and our enhanced completion designs. Other significant additions include North Malay Basin and Stampede, as well as initial reserve bookings in Guyana. Now, turning to results and starting with production. In the fourth quarter, production averaged 282,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This result reflects unplanned downtime at the Shell-operated Enchilada platform in the Gulf of Mexico, which experienced a fire on November 8 and remains down. As a result, production is shut-in at our Baldpate, Conger and Penn State fields, as well as the Shell-operated Llano field with a daily production impact of approximately 30,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. The operator is working to safely restore production. Excluding Libya, full-year 2017 production averaged 295,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which reflects an impact from the unplanned downtime in Enchilada of approximately 4,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. In 2018, we forecast production to average between 245,000 and 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This forecast reflects the divestments completed in 2017, representing approximately 60,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and an estimated annual impact from Enchilada of 15,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over 2018. Our forecast also reflects higher year-over-year production from the Bakken and North Malay Basin of 12,000 and 15,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, respectively, as well as increasing production from Stampede. We forecast production in the first quarter of 2018 to average in the range of 220,000 to 225,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, increasing to between 265,000 and 275,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, as our impacted Gulf of Mexico production is reinstated and as Bakken and Stampede ramp up. On a pro forma basis, net production is forecast to grow by approximately 10% per year between 2017 and 2020. Now, turning to the Bakken. In the fourth quarter, production averaged 110,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represented an increase of more than 15% from the year-ago quarter. Oil production in the fourth quarter was 69,000 net barrels per day versus 63,000 net barrels per day for the third quarter of 2017. For the full-year 2017, production averaged 105,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. In 2018, we plan to add a fifth rig in the Bakken during the third quarter and a sixth rig during the fourth quarter. The timing reflects permitting and the efficiency of doing road and pad construction during the fair weather period between May and October. We expect to drill approximately 120 wells and bring approximately 95 new wells online over the year, compared to 85 wells drilled and 68 wells brought online in 2017. For the first quarter, we expect Bakken production to average approximately 105,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting a modest reduction in NGL volumes due to market factors. Oil volumes are expected to remain flat with the fourth quarter of 2017. For the full-year 2018, we forecast our Bakken production to average between 115,000 and 120,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, approximately 12% above 2017 levels. Longer term, we continue to forecast steady Bakken production growth to approximately 175,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 with a maximum rig count of 6. Moving offshore, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, production averaged 40,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 54,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full-year 2017, reflecting the unplanned downtime at the Shell-operated Enchilada platform discussed earlier. As a consequence, we forecast 2018 production from our deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets to average approximately 50,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which again assumes a full year production impact of 15,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the fourth quarter, when all impacted fields are expected to be back online, we forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average approximately 65,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. At the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess has a 50% interest, production averaged 35,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 37,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2017. Net production is forecast to average approximately 36,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018. At the North Malay Basin, also in the Gulf of Thailand, net production averaged 26,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day over the fourth quarter and is forecast to also average approximately 26,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018. Turning to Guyana. Following completion of the Ranger-1 well, the Stena Carron drillship has now spud the Pacora prospect, which is located 4 miles west of the Payara discovery. Additional exploration drilling is planned on the Stabroek Block for 2018, including appraisal of the Liza, Turbot and Ranger discoveries as well as a wider exploration program that will target additional prospects and play types on the block where we continue to see multi-billion barrels of exploration upside. Development activities are also continuing on the Stabroek Block. The Liza Phase 1 development is progressing and remains on track for first oil in March 2020. Conversion of a VLCC, very large crude carrier, to an FPSO is progressing; and development drilling is planned to start later this year. In addition, planning for the second phase of development of Liza is underway. That is expected to utilize an FPSO with a gross production capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day. Startup for Lisa Phase 2 is expected by mid-2022. A third phase of development will focus on the Payara area and is expected to closely follow Liza Phase 2. In Suriname, where Hess holds a 33% interest in the 1.3-million acre Block 42 along with Chevron and the operator Kosmos, interpretation of 3D seismic continues and we are seeing a set of attractive prospects and leads similar to those seen on Stabroek. A first exploration well on the block is planned for the second half of 2018. At the 2.8-million acre Block 59, where Hess also holds a 30% \u2013 33% interest together with Statoil and the operator Exxon Mobil, plans are underway to acquire 2D seismic in 2018. In Canada, Hess has partnered with operator BP to explore four deepwater frontier licenses offshore Nova Scotia, which combined are equal in size to approximately 600 deepwater Gulf of Mexico OCS blocks. Hess has a 50% working interest. Based on 3D seismic data, the geology appears analogous to deepwater Gulf of Mexico. A first play test is planned to spud in the second quarter of 2018. In closing, in 2017, Hess once again demonstrated strong execution on all fronts. We have taken proactive steps to high-grade our portfolio, move down the cost curve and build a business that will be cash flow-generative down to $50 per barrel Brent post 2020. Our leading position in the Bakken promises continuing growth and material future cash flow. Exploration results to-date underline the exceptional world-class potential for the Stabroek Block in Guyana, and we are excited by potential extensions of the plays into Blocks 42 and 59 in neighboring Suriname. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the third quarter of 2017 and provide guidance for 2018. We incurred a net loss of $2.677 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a net loss of $624 million in the previous quarter. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, was $304 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with an adjusted net loss of $324 million in the previous quarter. Fourth quarter results include an after-tax gain of $486 million from the sale of our interest in Equatorial Guinea and an after-tax loss of $857 million from the sale of our interest in Norway, both in line with estimates provided in our third quarter Form 10-Q. The fourth quarter also includes charges related to the Tubular Bells and Stampede Fields in the Gulf of Mexico totaling $1.7 billion primarily based on a fourth quarter reduction to our long-term oil price outlook used in our impairment tests. The charge related to Tubular Bells is $605 million, while the charge related to Stampede is $1.095 billion, where we incurred significant exploration and appraisal costs prior to unitizing into the Stampede project. In addition, we fully impaired our Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points project offshore Ghana with an after-tax charge of $280 million based on management's decision to not pursue that development project. We are currently evaluating options to monetize our Ghana asset. Turning to the new tax law. In December, the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, providing broad changes to the taxation of both domestic and foreign operations. We do not expect any U.S. federal cash tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, and the impact of the change in alternative minimum tax rules was immaterial. Further, we still do not anticipate any U.S. federal cash taxes over at least the next five years. Our tax loss carry-forwards and tax basis and fixed assets as of December 31, 2017 will continue to provide a significant cash tax shield. And under the new law, substantially all of our foreign earnings will qualify for exemption from U.S. federal tax. The decrease in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% leads to an approximate $1.475 billion reduction to our U.S. net deferred tax asset, which predominantly relates to the NOL carry-forward. A corresponding reduction in the previously established U.S. valuation allowance offsets this adjustment. Consequently, the re-measurement of deferred taxes using the newly enacted tax rate has no net impact on the income statement or balance sheet. Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $219 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a net loss of $238 million in the third quarter of 2017. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2017 were as follows : higher realized selling prices improved results by $133 million; non-cash option premium amortization on crude oil collars reduced results by $38 million; the change in mix of sales volumes reduced results by $33 million; higher exploration expenses, primarily seismic costs, reduced results by $32 million; higher cash costs reduced results by $17 billion; lowered DD&A expense improved results by $18 million. All other items reduced results by $12 million for an overall improvement in fourth quarter results of $19 million. The E&P effective income tax rate, excluding specials and Libyan operations, was an expense of 21% for the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to the accounting for assets held-for-sale, compared with a benefit of 18% in the third quarter. Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $20 million in the fourth quarter compared to adjusted net income of $22 million in the third quarter of 2017. Midstream EBITDA, before the non-controlling interest and excluding specials, amounted to $113 million in the fourth quarter compared to $109 million in the third quarter of 2017. Turning to corporate and interest. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $105 million in the fourth quarter compared to a net adjusted expense of $108 million in the third quarter of 2017. Turning to fourth quarter cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $492 million. Changes in working capital reduced operating cash flows by $149 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were $554 million. Proceeds from the sale of assets were $2.513 billion. Net borrowings increased cash by $280 million. Common stock acquired and retired were $110 million. Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $90 million. Distributions to non-controlling interest were $35 million. All other items were a net decrease in cash of $26 million, resulting in a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the fourth quarter of $2.321 billion. We estimate the fourth quarter impact from the Enchilada platform shutdown was a reduction to cash flow from operations of approximately $55 million. Turning to our financial position. Excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $4.5 billion. Total liquidity was $8.9 billion, including available committed credit facilities; and debt was $5.997 billion. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and providing current returns to shareholders. In January, we called for redemption of our 8.125% notes due February 2019 with a principal amount of $350 million, and we plan to repay an additional $150 million principal amount of debt in 2018 for a total of $500 million in debt reduction. We also continued to execute our previously announced plan to repurchase $500 million of our common stock. We purchased $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and plan to purchase the remaining $380 million of stock during 2018. Turning to our cost reduction program. As part of our portfolio reshaping, we have begun implementation of an organization restructuring and cost reduction effort, targeting annual savings of $150 million. In addition to direct head count reductions as part of our asset sales, we eliminated approximately 400 employee and contractor positions in January and expect to record employee severance of $40 million to $50 million in the first quarter. Since the end of 2014, total employee and contractor positions have been reduced by approximately 50%. In addition to the workforce reduction, we have identified further cost reductions in logistics, information technology, property, professional fees and other operating cost as a result of our portfolio reshaping. The benefit from this $150 million annualized cost reduction will begin to be realized over the second half of 2018. Now, turning to first quarter and full year 2018 guidance. Before I give guidance for 2018, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings, I will provide full year 2017 pro forma financial metrics that removed the impact of assets sold during the year. Pro forma cash costs were $13.09 per barrel of oil equivalent as compared to actual results of $14.30 per barrel, and pro forma DD&A was $23.62 per barrel versus actual DD&A of $24.53 per barrel. Finally, our pro forma tax rate, excluding specials and Libya, was a pro forma benefit of 4% as compared to our reported benefit of 7%. We project our cash cost per barrel in 2018 to decline significantly during the year as production related to Enchilada fully resumes and our cost reductions begin to be realized in the second half of the year. In the first quarter, due to the impact of the Enchilada fire, which is estimated to shut in approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of low cost production, cash costs are projected to be $15 to $16 per barrel. We project the remaining three quarters to be lower with an average cost of $12.75 per barrel, and our fourth quarter cash cost to be below $12 per barrel as compared to pro forma cash cost of $13.09 in 2017. DD&A per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year and first quarter of 2018 is forecast to be in the range of $18 to $19 per barrel, down from 2017 pro forma DD&A of $23.62 per barrel. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs of $31 to $33 per barrel for the full year of 2018, down from 2017 E&P pro forma unit cost of $36.71 per barrel. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million for the full year of 2018 and $45 million to $55 million in the first quarter of 2018. The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $625 million to $650 million for the full year of 2018, which is up from 2017 Midstream tariff of $543 million due to higher Hess-operated and third-party volumes. The Midstream tariff is expected to be approximately $150 million for the first quarter of 2018. The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 0% to 4% for the full year and first quarter of 2018 versus a pro forma benefit of 4% for the full year of 2017. As highlighted earlier, we have crude oil collars to hedge price risk for 2018 production. For 2018, we expect the non-cash premium amortization from these contracts, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices, will reduce our results by approximately $30 million per quarter. In Midstream, in 2018, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million for the full year and approximately $25 million in the first quarter. Now, for corporate and interest, we expect corporate expenses to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million for the full year of 2018, down from $134 million in 2017 and $25 million to $30 million for the first quarter. We estimate interest expense to be in the range of $345 million to $355 million for the full year of 2018, which is higher than last year as we will not be capitalizing interest for the Stampede project, which commenced production in January. First quarter interest expense is expected to be $85 million to $90 million. This concludes my remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I guess, if we could talk maybe a little bit here your performance in the Bakken. Six rigs is going to deliver growth up to the 175 level by 2021. How much more improvement in well performance is factored in on that? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Roger. As we said in our opening remarks, our new completion design, which is a 60-stage, 140,000 pounds per stage, has resulted in a 10% to 15% uplift in EUR and also IP180 rates. That 175 at 6 rigs reflects improvement from that move to that new completion design. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : So solely that design, not something additional from here? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. I think we continue to optimize. We continue to look at other completion techniques. For example, we're doing some plug-and-perf pilots this year. Reason being is, as the industry has continued to improve, the limited entry perforating, in particular on plug-and-perf, is allowing a very large number of entry points with very good fracture control. And so, we're looking at that and are going to pilot some of that this year. So, potentially, there could be a move to that. But we need to get more experience under our belt. And certainly, we know that we're going to have to do plug-and-perf outside the core. So that's why we want to really begin to experiment with that stuff. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks on that. And then, as we look at just broadly the cash flow from operations here, you referenced the Gulf of Mexico and NMB as your cash cow, so to speak. Can you frame at all kind of the expectations for cash from those operations as we think about 2018 and 2019, maybe just to kind of think about maybe a $60 oil price outlook there? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. So now with NMB coming online, our Malaysia assets are going to be significant free cash flow generators. You can see the Asian gas price that we now have. What we have in JDA is actually going to be the lowest, I guess, of the gas price because it goes back to 2016 oil prices. So we'll have that price through September 30 of 2018, and then it will increase going to 2017 prices. And then, obviously, so far in 2018, with the prices getting higher, JDA's price will continue to increase. North Malay Basin basically only has a one-month lag on oil prices. So we are seeing the benefit of that reflected right into our gas prices in North Malay Basin. So if you looked at the number in that fourth quarter, JDA is below that average and North Malay Basin, basically, significantly above that average. So we're seeing significant free cash flow actually from the Malaysian assets in 2018. And that will continue as you move into 2019 and 2020 because we'll start slowly bringing down the capital in North Malay Basin. As far as Bakken goes, so this year, we are actually reducing the cash flow from the Bakken a bit because we're moving to the six rigs. And as Greg said, the fifth and sixth rigs are coming in the third \u2013 one in the third quarter, one in the fourth quarter. So the wells that are drilled by the fifth and sixth rig are really not impacting production or cash flow in 2018. So we get the uplift on production and cash flow in 2019 from that. So while Bakken will be generating free cash flow, it'll give more in 2019. And then obviously with this growth that you just heard that Greg talked about, that will begin to significantly increase cash flow from the Bakken. And then, obviously, the other piece of our business is Gulf of Mexico. It's always been a significant free cash flow generator for us. Now, Stampede is coming online, so the capital is being reduced from the prior year. We do have this deferred production which, as I guided, was about $55 million affect the cash flow in the fourth quarter. It's reasonable for you to use about $1 million a day from that being shut in, so you got 15,000 barrels a day. So you're getting, on a half year basis, on 30,000 barrels. It is affecting us like somewhere between $180 million and $200 million in 2018. But Gulf of Mexico is going to be a significant cash flow generator as Stampede continues to ramp up, and we continue now to be actually bringing capital down there. So that's kind of how the cash flow works in our portfolio. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : John, so I wonder if you could give us some idea of the cadence you're assuming on \u2013 I mean, it sounds like Enchilada is down for the first half of the year as kind of what you're assuming. But what are you assuming for the cadence for Stampede and Bakken? I'm wondering if you could give an exit rate for 2018 on both of those, please. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, Doug. Let me talk about Stampede first. We will gradually bring that production on over the year. The first piece that will come on is Penn State and Baldpate. That'll come on in the first quarter. The next thing that will come on is Llano, which is in the second quarter. And then, finally, Conger will come on towards the end of the third quarter. So that's sort of the cadence there. So we'd pick up all that production. By certainly fourth quarter, all of that comes back on. So it'll gradually come up. And if you want kind of a quarterly impact of the Gulf of Mexico, it's about 26,000 barrels a day in the first quarter. It's about 17,000 in the second quarter. It's about 15,000 in the third quarter. So that's the cadence there. And then, in terms of Stampede, we're going to gradually ramp that up over the next 18 months. We've got three producers capable of producing now. We'll continue to drill producers throughout the year and into 2018. So we'll gradually bring those up. And then, in the fourth quarter, Stampede will average about 10,000 barrels a day and then will continue its climb, net obviously. And then, will continue its climb in 2018 as we bring additional producers that we drill this year on production. And I think, just overall production, I think the important thing is that we mentioned in our opening remarks, the whole increase from the first quarter to the fourth quarter, as we mentioned, our production is going to be very strong and exit the year very strong in the fourth quarter. So, in the fourth quarter, we're going to exit the year 265,000 to 275,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, whereas the first quarter 220,000 to 225,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. So that's a significant increase over the year. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Just to be clear, Greg, on the Bakken, what are you assuming in there on the Bakken exit rate? I'm just wondering if you had any weather issues to impact the first quarter, given the depth you're seeing. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: No. In the first quarter, Doug, we didn't have any weather issues. Again, as Greg said, oil will be flat from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. It's above-ground NGL volumes. And what it is, is that we had some ethane rejection. And by the way, none of this impacts actually our financial results. But there was some ethane rejection that we had in the first quarter that we're having, as well as higher NGL prices. It just works the way we process our gas that when you get volumes to up to the amount of the gas processing fee. So if the prices are higher, your NGL volumes go down. So there's no impact at all really from weather. We did see some right at the beginning. There was some difficult weather, but it didn't really impact. As you saw, we came in at the high end of the guidance in the fourth quarter. And, yes, there's some impact early on in January, but it's really not impacting our overall volumes. And I think you asked would growing \u2013 we said the Bakken will be 115,000 to 120,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over the year. So, obviously, you start at 105,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. By the time you get to the fourth quarter, it's going to be higher than that range that we have there. So it's going to be right at that upper end of the range. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, John. My follow-up \u2013 go on. Sorry. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. 120,000 to 125,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, Doug, in the fourth quarter. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. My follow-up, Greg, is on Guyana. And I guess a couple of interrelated points, if I may. Greg, can you tell us what the implication is of the carbonate versus the strat plays you got at Ranger. Obviously, that is not yet in the 3.2 billion. Just give us an idea what you \u2013 the implications could be there. And I guess, my follow-up would be for Mr. Hess. John, it seems that Exxon is laying out a line of sight now in development. The PSC is now public. So, what else do you need to see to reset your buyback program because it's always like the spending allocation or the requirement is going to become pretty transparent here fairly soon. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Thanks, Doug. I'll go first on Ranger. So, obviously, Ranger very significant outcome for the block. Why? 230 feet of very high-quality oil-bearing carbonate reservoir. Secondly, it's located 60 miles northwest of Liza, which says that the play is working certainly in terms of charge. The play is working that far away from Liza. I think the third thing is that we see a number of additional carbonate features on the block, so that says that the carbonate system is working. Now, obviously, we've got to get wells in those eventually. But it bodes very well for the block in Guyana and potentially even Suriname as well. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. John, on the \u2013 go ahead. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah \u2013 no, I'm happy to talk about your question, Doug. Look, obviously, we have an extraordinary investment opportunity in Guyana. It truly gets bigger and better. And we're delighted that Exxon Mobil announced last Friday on their quarterly call that the second FPSO would be a larger ship, 220,000 barrels a day and start production in 2022. And that would make our net working interest production from Guyana over 100,000 barrels of oil a day by 2022. And also, they announced that engineering would start on a third FPSO, and that would come on shortly thereafter Liza-2. The size of that is going to be a function of further appraisal drilling, starting with Payara that we're currently drilling right now. So, your point is, as we get more transparency, the transparency is the capital need is going up. And so, we need to get some more definition in those costs and oil price before we would consider adding to our share repurchase program of the $500 million that's already underway. So, some more work and visibility on that. But I think the most important thing is this is a phenomenal, one of the world's best return investments in the oil industry. And we are extremely well positioned to capitalize on it and to prefund it with the cash that we have not just for FPSO 1 but FPSO 2, and those financial returns are going to distinguish our company from many years to come. We have to be in position to capitalize on it. And that's our first, second and third priority. As the costs get a little bit more defined on FPSO 2 and the engineering for FPSO 3, serious consideration will be to add to the share repurchase program that's underway already. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks... Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Hey, Doug. Just one other comment on Guyana. If you think about Turbot, which is 30 miles south east of Liza and then you have Ranger which is 60 miles northwest of Liza, given the petroleum system is working over that entire areal extent, it also opens up other play types. It's been highly prospective in addition to the carbonate. So, there's further play types on the block as well. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I wanted to follow up on a couple of the questions there earlier. First, on Guyana, when you and the operator and other partner have conversations and you see the resource that has been discovered, what, if anything, would it take to accelerate the development to have two FPSOs moving for development at the same time or for the same schedule, i.e. not necessarily in every 18 to 24 months type schedule? Is it \u2013 is there anything that could happen there? Or do you see this as more definitively every discovery that you make will be very much staged in an order on down the line? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Couple comments there, Brian. I think, first of all, we did mention that Phase 3 some further appraisal drilling is required to really define how big that's going to be. So, that's the first step. I think the second step relates to how do you very efficiently develop this massive resource in Guyana. And certainly, the view of Exxon Mobil and us and Nexen is that the right way to do it is a phased approach, where you use the same project team and the construction resources, et cetera, et cetera and really just continue to phase this development in such a way that it becomes very capital efficient to do that versus, say, three things going in parallel, right? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: And as Exxon said in their call that they're progressing concept selection for Payara and the startup there is planned for 2023 or 2024 which actually could mean 12 to 18 months from Liza Phase 2 as opposed to 24 months. So, Exxon is definitely getting more efficient in this assembly line process. And the definition of that, Brian, obviously, we need the appraisal drilling to be able to finalize what the size of that ship is going to be. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's great. And then, my follow-up is with regards to the Gulf of Mexico. I'm trying to piece together some of the moving pieces of the Stampede and then the Enchilada platform but also get your sense of whether there's been any changes in the underlying decline rate in the Gulf and what that is. And I think, in response to an earlier question, you threw out some numbers of 26,000, 17,000 and 15,000 maybe in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter. I wondered is that total production that's falling in Q2 and Q3 versus Q1 or just maybe I missed those numbers? Thanks. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. Thanks for the clarification question, Brian. What that was the impact of the Enchilada fire on Hess Gulf of Mexico production quarter-by-quarter. So, again, it's 26,000 barrels a day off production on average in Q1, it's 17,000 barrels a day on average in Q2 and then 15,000 barrels a day on average in Q3. And that reflects the cadence that I talked about, where Baldpate and Penn State come on in the first quarter, Llano comes on the second quarter and then, finally, Conger, the last piece, comes on in the third quarter. So, that's what that reflects. And then, the other piece of the equation in the Gulf of Mexico is Stampede. As I've said, that's going to gradually ramp up over 18 months. We just started first oil in January. We're going to ramp those wells up very slowly. That's been a big learning for industry that you need to bring these on very slowly. And we will average in the fourth quarter some-10,000 barrels a day. So, that kind of gives you how the trajectory of the Gulf of Mexico will go. The rest, decline is very shallow. So, decline is not a big factor in the Gulf of Mexico this year. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Thanks. Actually, the prior question hit on a number of mine. But just final \u2013 I guess one more final follow-up on Stampede. Can you just remind me what do you think the kind of peak production profile Stampede would look like and when you'll reach that? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Michael, so it's early days. And what we'd like to do is get some dynamic data on these wells before we be as specific as what we think the peak rate will be. As I've said, we will ramp this up over the next 18 months. So, as we get that dynamic data, see what the wells are going to do \u2013 we just started this thing in January. Then, we'll be able to give some more definitive guidance on peak rates. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Fair enough. That's really all I have at the moment. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple for me. I mean, as you talked about the modernization process for the assets in Denmark, as you look across the rest of the portfolio, are you happy with the current state of the portfolio? Would you consider selling any of the Asian assets or are you in a position where you could consider to farming down Guyana at all? Or is there still too much undiscovered resource at this point? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Obviously, we've been pretty active optimizing our portfolio. We have an open mind. We're always there to maximize value. We have a long-term strategy in portfolio that we and the board worked on to have the cash generators along with the growth engines in Guyana and the Bakken. So, we will always have an open mind to maximize value as we've shown in the past. Having said that, the major focus for the company is to capitalize on the amazing investment opportunity we have in Guyana and the Bakken. And to do that, we got to have a strong balance sheet and cash. We don't have a funding deficit. We pre-fund it. And as Guyana gets bigger and better with FPSO 2 now being defined and FPSO 3 and, by the way, a pretty active exploration and appraisal program, we've got to make sure we have the cash for that. So, our focus is much more on Guyana and in funding the world-class investment opportunity and the high finance returns there. To sell part of that would not be the right thing for our shareholders because that is probably the best investment return certainly in Hess' portfolio and one of the best in the industry. And if we could get more of it, we would. But selling it would be the wrong thing to do. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. That's very helpful. And maybe one follow-up on the Bakken. I mean, clearly, very strong well results. Can you clarify \u2013 I think did you say that the drilling program in 2018 would have an average EUR per well of over 1 million barrels? And do you have an estimate of what the average per well EUR will be across the 1,780 high rate of return inventory that you talked about? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: So, let me start with the 2018 program. Yes, you're correct. So, the average EUR this year will be north of 1 million. Average IPA \u2013 IP 180, so this is cumulative now, is north of 100,000 barrels of oil. And then, also, if you \u2013 what in our portfolio do we think can generate over 1 million barrels a day or 1 million barrels of EUR? There's about 500 or so wells in our portfolio that can do that with our current completion design of 60-stage 140,000 pounds. That's substantially from where it was last year as a result of moving to that better completion design. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. Greg, when you give the production guidance, is that built in some timeline \u2013 the time that asset sales is going to be done? Or... John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: What we have... Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: (01:03:39) the production is in there? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So, Paul, in the pro forma numbers that we gave for 2017 of the 242,000 barrels a day, that \u2013 we only took out the assets sold. So, Denmark is in there, and we have Denmark in our production guidance next year. So, if you wanted to take 10,000 barrels out of the 242,000, drop it to 232,000 and if you could take 10,000 barrels out of our 2018 production... Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay... John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: If you were just doing a comparison. So, I just want to make sure when everybody looks at that, that our pro forma of 242,000, our midpoint right now is between the 245,000 and 255,000 is 250,000. If you add the Enchilada effect to the 265,000, we're getting to that 10% pro forma growth that Greg had talked about that will continue into 2020. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And, John, when you take the weight down on Stampede and Tubular Bells you say is based on the lower commodity prices. Can you share with us what price that you're using? I mean, is that really significantly down? I mean \u2013 so, what kind of carrying costs you still have in those two? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: So, we \u2013 I'm not going to be specific exactly on our \u2013 on the crude oil price outlook that we have and went through with the board. But let's just start with what we are doing from a management standpoint of the business. So, from a management standpoint of business, as we said, we are managing to $50 and being able to generate free cash flow at $50 post the Guyana start-up, and we are well on our way on track for that. So, again, with this pro forma production growth, 10% per year, plus our cash costs, as I said, by the fourth quarter going under $12. So, by 2020, we'll have our cash costs down to $10 and, again, now generating that free cash flow. So, as it relates to, just in general, where we're going with our cost reductions, we'll start getting that in the second half of the year. We're going to even get then the full annualized effect in 2019. And then, that will drop our cash costs per barrel even lower as we move into 2019. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: John, on the $150 million of the cost reduction, where are they going to show up the most? Is it in the corporate item or just in the upstream operating cost or what line item that you're going to see the benefit? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: What you saw \u2013 if you noted in my guidance for corporate. So, what you see actually in 2018 already is about a $24 million reduction in our corporate expenses, if you just take the midpoint of our corporate guidance. So, we're beginning to get that impact right now in corporate. We're going to have severance charges. There'll be pension settlement charges. So with things like that going through. But what I would tell you in general, by the time we get to the end of this, about two-thirds of the savings just \u2013 I'm using round numbers, Paul \u2013 is going to be labor-based and then the one-third is going to be the other operating cost that I talked about. So that labor base will go between corporate E&P and also within operating costs in production and even within exploration G&A, too, as well. So it's going to be spread throughout kind of the line items that we have in our financial statements. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Can you tell us that what is the Stampede and Tubular Bells \u2013 the cash operating cost may look like this year and also by year 2020? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So, for Stampede, as Greg said, there will be this slow ramp, right? So cash cost per barrel will not be obviously at its regular operating level at the beginning. So cash cost will be a little bit higher. But just like all Gulf of Mexico fields, Stampede itself is going to be below $10 as that is, as Greg said, when you get to the fourth quarter and you get that up to the 10,000 barrels a day. So, again, Gulf of Mexico is always a good low-cost operating environment. Tubular Bells is just a little bit higher. And we said because we've leased that facility. So that's the one unique asset you have in the Gulf of Mexico. So Tubular Bells is above $10 for that. But that will hold steady at that rate. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And two final one for me. One, on the hedging, you haven't extended any additional hedging into 2019, right? In 2018, are we still talking about 150,000 barrel per day or that has also been changed? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Okay. So there is no... Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And I am wondering if you can comment on Ghana, what have changed and lead you to, say, make the decision not to develop? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. So from the hedging standpoint, just confirming your point that, in 2019, we have not added any hedges in 2019 with the backwardation basically in the curve. So for 2018, it is unchanged. It is in the back of the release. It's 115,000 barrels per day, correct, that we have the collars on in 2018. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yes. And, Paul, in terms of Ghana, it's a good asset. There's oil there. But our strategy is to invest in the highest return projects, be capital disciplined and committed to being cash flow generative at a $50 Brent price post 2020, as Liza Phase 1 comes on. And, quite frankly, that project, while a good project, just can't compete for capital relative to the other investment opportunities we have. So, as a consequence, we're currently looking at options to monetize our Ghana asset. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Quick question. I was just wondering if you could just help us bridge the production forecasts for the other segments. You talked about 105,000 barrels a day in the first quarter for the Bakken. I'm assuming that your guidance implies about 30,000 barrels a day for the Gulf of Mexico. And I was just wondering if you can help us think about the Utica U.S. \u2013 other U.S. onshore, as well as Asia for Q1? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: If you're trying to bridge, let's just say, the fourth quarter number to our first quarter number, the biggest change is obviously asset sales. So the 282,000 barrels a day, if you take 41,000 barrels a day approximately as it relates to the asset sales, you have to take that off. Then, as Greg mentioned, we've got 26,000 barrels a day off on Enchilada versus the 17,000 barrels a day that we have. So you have to take another 9,000 barrels a day off. You've picked up the Bakken, right? So that's 5,000 barrels down. Utica will have a decline. So we have Utica declining approximately 3,000 barrels a day in the first quarter from the fourth quarter. As you probably saw it in our capital release, we will be completing some DUCs that we have, and that won't come in until really the end of the year. You won't see that in the Utica until fourth quarter production. So with that, you basically bridge the difference between the fourth quarter and first quarter. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's helpful. And, John, just to follow up on the NGL commentary you made in the Bakken, could you just maybe help us understand that a little bit better? Is that just going to affect 1Q, or is there any effect as we think about the full year in terms of the Bakken? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Okay. So first thing I have to say, there is no effect on our bottom line for these two items. So the first one is our buyer who takes our ethane, can execute and can reject ethane based on whatever pricing that they're getting and what benefits from their standpoint. However, they do have to pay us the economic amount of that ethane that we would have produced. So, again, just from a pure volume standpoint, we'll just have less ethane volumes flowing through our NGLs in the first quarter. So that's one. And basically that's going to go away and come right back on. The second one is the increase in NGL pricing. So just think about it as you've got a set gas processing fee, and it only works on some of the contracts that we have. And then you've probably heard POP contracts, or percentage of proceeds contracts. So what we get is actual NGL volumes to satisfy that gas processing fee. So as NGL prices go up, you just get less volumes. You get the same amount from your gas processing fee, but you just get less volumes to satisfy it. So as prices have come up from the fourth quarter, that's affecting that number. If prices stay the same or go down, you will get some fluctuations above ground. It shouldn't be big. It's not going to be a big effect. And again, as we said, Bakken, the real key is we'll be adding wells a little bit more towards the latter part of the first quarter and then just driving through the year and increasing Bakken quarter-on-quarter. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question, guys. Few weeks ago, the fiscal terms of the Guyana production sharing agreement were published. And I suppose, for those investors who might look at that and say, how can a deepwater project have a breakeven oil price below $40 a barrel? What are the key attributes of those fiscal terms that are contributing to that low breakeven? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Okay. So it's really all the attributes and you have to \u2013 not even just the fiscal terms, so let me just start with Guyana overall. So our Liza find that we have, the geology, the reservoirs are just fantastic. The permeability is fantastic. The size \u2013 obviously, you've seen the scale. So that plays into getting that low to breakeven. The next thing, as you compare, let's just say the other basins around the world, the depths that you drill to in Guyana are much shallower; and the other thing is there's no salt. So from an imaging standpoint, that helps; and then there is less casing strings. So the exploration wells and the development wells obviously just cost less, I mean, clearly as you would compare, let's say, to like a Gulf of Mexico-type aspect. We're also in the low point in the cycle from offshore. So, again, yards are looking for work, rigs are looking for work. So all the costs that Exxon is getting for our developments are just hitting this, obviously, at the right point in the cycle. And then it's just a blend of the fiscal terms. So you have a production-sharing contract. So just start with any production-sharing contract. It gives you downside protection. That's what it's set up for to encourage investment from oil companies. So as oil prices go lower, you get more barrels because you get the cost recover from that standpoint. So again, as prices go down and giving you that breakeven, you get that production-sharing cost impact. And then, the terms are out there. They're on the government website for people to see. And that along with just the unique attributes of the Guyana Basin, in general, allow you to get this really low breakeven cost. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Let me ask a quick follow-up about the dividend. One of your well-known shareholders has called for a dividend cut or elimination and the proceeds deployed towards more share buyback. Should I take it as a given that you are ruling out that scenario? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. I think what you should take as a feedback is that we talk to all of our shareholders, and a number of our shareholders put a high degree of importance on that dividend as a show of confidence in our future and our ability to generate cash. So we talk to all our shareholders. We have ongoing communications with all of our shareholders. And there are other views about the dividend than that one shareholder you were referring to. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from John Herrlin with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Your line is now open. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Yeah. Hi. Just two quick ones on Guyana. When we were out in December, John, you had mentioned or Greg had mentioned that possibly you would buy the FPSO for Liza 2. Is that still the case? And then, the other question is on Ranger. It took longer to reach TD in the carbonate well. Obviously, it was a cautious drill. But how much faster do you think the drilling would be for carbonate play? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So, let me answer the Ranger question first. Yes, it was a very cautious drill. John, as you know, carbonates can be very tricky. But we didn't discover any of the downsides in the drilling of this well that potentially could have been there. So I think certainly on the next appraisal well of Ranger, we anticipate the drilling time will improve and the cost will be lower obviously. Regarding the boat on Phase 2, that decision has not been made. But certainly, from a financial standpoint, it's better to purchase these things ultimately just so you don't have to pay the uplift on the lease cost, right? So, I think we're aligned with the operator that ultimately you'd want to purchase these things, but that decision has not been made. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Okay. Great. With Guyana, are you opening a data room? And that's it for me. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yeah. The Guyana process is ongoing, and I wouldn't want to comment further on that. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2018 Hess Corporation Conference Call. My name is Sonia, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Sonia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information that will be provided on our website. Now, as usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will review our strategy and key highlights from the quarter. Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results. Our company delivered strong performance this quarter and continues to make significant progress in our strategy. First, to grow our resource base in a capital-disciplined manner. Second, to move down the cost curve so that we are resilient in a low oil price environment. And third, to be cash-generative at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price post 2020. Our strategy reflects our view that shale alone will not be enough to meet the world's oil demand growth and offset base production declines. For the past several years, the industry has significantly underinvested in longer cycle projects, which currently represent approximately 90% to 95% of global oil supply. We have focused our portfolio on four key areas, offshore Guyana and the Bakken as our growth engines with Malaysia and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico as our cash engines. By investing in our highest return assets, divesting higher-cost mature assets, and implementing a $150 million annual cost reduction program, we expect to lower our cash unit production costs by 30% between 2017 and 2020, while reducing unit DD&A rates by 35% over the same period. On a pro forma basis, production from our high-graded portfolio is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% between 2017 and 2023, assuming a flat $50 per barrel Brent oil price, operating cash flow is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 20% over the same period. In 2017, our asset monetizations resulted in proceeds of $3.4 billion. Proceeds are being used to prefund our world-class investment opportunity in Guyana, increased from four rigs to six rigs in the Bakken, returned $1.5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2018 through share repurchases, and reduced debt by $500 million. Key to our strategy is our position in Guyana, which represents one of the most attractive oil investment opportunities in the world today. The 6.6 million acres Stabroek block in Guyana where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator is uniquely advantaged by its scale, reservoir quality, cost, rapid cash paybacks, and superior financial returns. In February, we continued our exploration success in Guyana with a seventh oil discovery at the Pacora-1 well. This discovery followed positive results from the Ranger-1 well in January, which demonstrated that the petroleum system is working in a new geologic play more than 60 miles Northwest of the Liza development and reaffirmed the extraordinary exploration potential of the block. Excluding Ranger and Pacora, estimated gross discovered recoverable resources on the block were increased to more than 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. And we continue to see multi-billion barrels of additional exploration potential on the block. The Liza Phase 1 development, which was sanctioned last June, is progressing well with first production of gross 120,000 barrels of oil per day expected by 2020 less than five years after discovery. Phase 2 with gross production of 220,000 barrels of oil per day is slated for start-up by mid-2022. The giant Payara field is planned as the third development with start-up expected in late 2023 or early 2024, bringing expected gross production from the first three phases of development to more than 500,000 barrels of oil per day. Turning to the Bakken, our largest operated asset where we have more than 500,000 net acres in the core of the play. We plan to add a fifth rig in the third quarter and a sixth rig in the fourth quarter of this year. This increased activity is expected to generate capital efficient production growth from a 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017 up to 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 along with a meaningful increase in free cash flow generation over this period. Turning to our financial results. In the first quarter of 2018, we posted a net loss of $106 million, or $0.38 per share, down from a net loss of $324 million, or $1.07 per share in the year-ago quarter. Compared to 2017, our first quarter financial results primarily reflect higher realized crude oil selling prices and lower operating costs and DD&A. First quarter production was above the high-end of our guidance range of 220,000 to 225,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day averaging 233,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Bakken production averaged 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day above our guidance of approximately 105,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In summary, our focus for 2018 is on execution. And we believe we are off to a very strong start to the year. In the first quarter, we increased cash returns to shareholders, reduced debt, exceeded our production guidance, continued to lower our costs and announced two significant oil discoveries offshore Guyana, Ranger and Pacora. Longer-term, our reshaped portfolio is positioned to deliver a decade-plus of capital-efficient growth, with increasing cash generation and returns to shareholders. With that, I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update of our progress in 2018 as we continue to execute our E&P strategy. Starting with production; in the first quarter production averaged 233,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance range of 220,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day to 225,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily reflecting strong performance in the Bakken. In the second quarter, we expect production to average between 235,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and 245,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. We maintain our full-year 2018 production guidance of 245,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day to 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Production is expected to grow steadily throughout the year increasing to between 265,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and 275,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, which represents a growth rate of over 15% between the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2018. In the Bakken, we delivered a strong quarter that continued to build upon the successes of last year. First quarter production averaged 111,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of more than 12% from the year-ago quarter. Our 60-stage, 8.4 million pound proppant completions continue to show a 15% to 20% uplift in both IP180s and EUR over our previous 50-stage's 3.5 million pounds standard. Because we were reaching the practical limits of the sliding sleeve system in terms of stage count. Last year, we began piloting limited entry plug-and-perf completions and initial results are encouraging. This new limited entry technique allows us to more than double the number of distinct entry points in a 10,000-foot lateral, while maintaining good fracture geometry control and should result in a further increase in initial production rates, estimated ultimately recovery, and most importantly net present value. Well, we only have a small number of wells that have been on production for 90 days or more. We are increasing the number of plug-and-perf completions and plan to complete approximately 40 and bring online 25 of these wells in 2018. We will keep you apprised of results as we go throughout the year. We're also conducting a comprehensive study of the Bakken to determine optimum development methodology for each area of the basin. As previously announced, we plan to add a fifth rig during the third quarter and a sixth rig during the fourth quarter. We also plan to add a third frac crew by the end of the year. In the first quarter, we drilled 23 wells and brought 13 wells online. For the full year 2018, we expect to drill approximately 120 wells and bring 95 wells online. In the second quarter, we forecast that our Bakken production will average approximately 115,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and for the full-year 2018, we forecast production to average between 115,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and 120,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Longer-term, we continue to forecast steady Bakken production growth to approximately 175,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021, assuming six rig. Moving to the offshore. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, production averaged 41,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, reflecting the previously announced downtime at the Shell-operated Enchilada Platform following the fire there in early November 2017. During the first quarter, production was restored at our Baldpate and Penn State fields as well as at the Shell-operated Llano field. Approximately 15,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day of production remain shut-in at our Conger field, but we expect Conger to resume production by the end of the third quarter. At our Stampede field where Hess is operator and has a 25% interest, we achieve first oil from the field in January. We will continue to ramp-up production gradually throughout 2018 and expect to achieve peak rates during 2019. Drilling will continue throughout this period. For the second quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average between 45,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and 50,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and maintain our 2018 full-year production forecast of approximately 50,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. By the fourth quarter with all Enchilada-impacted fields back online and the continued ramp-up at Stampede, we forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average approximately 65,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moving to the Gulf of Thailand, at the joint development area, in which Hess has a 50% interest, production averaged 34,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter. Production is forecast to average approximately 36,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018. At the North Malay Basin, also in the Gulf of Thailand, production averaged 22,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter and is forecast to average approximately 26,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018. Now, turning to Guyana. At the Stabroek block, in which Hess holds a 30% interest, we announced a seventh oil discovery at Pacora located approximately 4 miles west of Payara. The well encountered approximately 65-feet of high-quality oil barring sandstone reservoir. Following well operations on Pacora, ExxonMobil spud the Liza-5 appraisal well on March 8, the well has been logged and cored and the operator is currently performing a drill stem test, results from the Pacora-1 and Liza-5 wells will be incorporated to appropriately size the FPSO for the third phase of development, which will be between 175,000 barrels of oil per day and 220,000 barrels of oil per day. Following completion of the well test on Liza-5, the Stena Carron will drill the longtail 1 (15:45) prospect located approximately four miles Northwest of the Turbot-1 discovery. A second drilling rig the Noble Bob Douglas, spud an exploration well on the Sorubim prospect on April 3, which is located approximately 37 miles Southwest of the Ranger discovery. Well operations are still underway. Following Sorubim, the Bob Douglas will begin drilling the first of 17 planned development wells associated with Liza Phase-1. The Liza Phase-1 development sanctioned in June 2017 remains on track for first oil by 2020 with a nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. Liza Phase-2 is on track for sanction by year-end with a nameplate capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and first oil expected by mid-2020. The Liza Phase-3 development is in feed and first oil is expected in late-2023 or early-2024. In Canada, offshore Nova Scotia, The Aspy well was spud on April 22. BP is operator and has each hold a 50% working interest in exploration licenses that cover approximately 3.5 million acres equivalent to some 600 Deepwater Gulf of Mexico blocks. The well is targeting a large subsalt structure, analogues to those found in the Gulf of Mexico. In closing, our team once again demonstrated excellent execution and delivery across our asset base. The Bakken is on a strong capital-efficient growth trajectory and Guyana continues to get bigger and better. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017. We incurred a net loss of $106 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with a net loss of $2.677 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our adjusted net loss, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods was $72 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $304 million in the previous quarter. Turning to exploration and production. On an adjusted basis, E&P had net income of $12 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with a net loss of $219 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017 were as follows. Higher realized selling prices improved results by $54 million, lower sales volumes reduced results by $133 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $207 million, lower cash cost improved results by $40 million. Lower exploration expense improved results by $32 million. All other items improved results by $31 million for an overall improvement in first quarter results of $231 million. Turning to Midstream, the Midstream segment had net income of $28 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Midstream EBITDA before the non-controlling interest and excluding specials amounted to $123 million in the first quarter, compared to $113 million in the previous quarter. Turning to corporate and interest. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $109 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $105 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. After-tax adjusted corporate and interest expenses were $112 million in the first quarter of 2018. Capitalized interest in the first quarter was lower than the prior quarter by $21 million due to first production at the Stampede field in January. Turning to our financial position. We increased our share buyback during the quarter to $1.5 billion from $500 million, representing nearly 10% of shares outstanding. This combined with our previously announced plan to retire $500 million in debt allows us to maintain a strong balance sheet, while providing current returns to shareholders. Excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $3.4 billion. Total liquidity was $7.7 billion, including available committed credit facilities; and debt was $5.587 billion. In the first quarter, we purchased approximately 8 million shares of common stock for $380 million, which completed the initial $500 million program. In April, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter. During the first quarter, we paid $415 million to retire debt including the redemption of $350 million principal amount of 8.125% notes due in 2019 and to purchase other notes. We remain on target to complete our $1.5 billion stock repurchase program and our $500 million debt reduction initiative in 2018. Now turning to second quarter guidance; in the first quarter, our E&P cash costs were $13.46 per barrel of oil equivalent, which beat guidance on strong production performance and a deferral of Tubular Bells workover to the second quarter. As a result of the workover deferral, cash costs for the second quarter of 2018 are projected to be $14.50 to $15.50 per barrel of oil equivalent, with full-year guidance of $13 per barrel to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent remaining unchanged. DD&A expense in the second quarter is forecast to be in the range of $17.50 to $18.50 per barrel of oil equivalent with the full-year guidance remaining unchanged at $18 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs of $32 to $34 per barrel of oil equivalent in the second quarter, with the full-year guidance remaining unchanged at $31 to $33 per barrel of oil equivalent. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million in the second quarter, with full-year guidance remaining unchanged at $190 million to $210 million. The Midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $165 million for the second quarter and $625 million to $650 million for the full year of 2018, which is unchanged from prior guidance. The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 0% to 4% for the second quarter, with the full-year guidance of a benefit in the range of 0% to 4% remaining unchanged. With respect to our 2018 crude oil hedges, we are now able to realize the benefit of WTI prices above $65, which we accomplished by buying back the $65 WTI call options within our crude oil collars. We continue to keep the $50 WTI put options on 115,000 barrels per day of production for the remainder of the year. We expect amortization of premiums on our crude oil hedges, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices, will reduce our results by approximately $45 million per quarter for the remainder of 2018. We anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $30 million in the second quarter, with the full-year guidance of $105 million to $115 million remaining unchanged. Turning to corporate and interest. For the second quarter of 2018, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million and interest expenses are estimated to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million. Full-year guidance remains unchanged at $105 million to $115 million for corporate expenses and $345 million to $355 million for interest expenses. This concludes my remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Morning. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Guys or maybe Mr. Hess, I wonder if you could opine on the latest thoughts on your disposal plans, and what I have specifically in mind is, obviously oil prices are a little healthier? Now Denmark appears, I believe that process is underway. So, if you could give an update, any expectations on the timing. If I could ask you to also address Libya and the Utica and was in the back of my mind is, obviously, Marathon say with Libya, and any other issues you think may contribute to non-core assets sales this year? I've got a follow-up question. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah, Doug, you know the sale process for our Denmark assets is ongoing. So I can't say more than that right now. And while we obviously can't comment specifically on the Total-Marathon transaction, in the normal course of business, we're always looking to high-grade and optimize our portfolio. So that's what we'd like to say on Libya, and for that matter on the Utica. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : If I may, the one that's missing then I guess is, you'd talked previously about potentially dropping down some additional Midstream assets to the joint venture with specifically Bakken water handling, is that still the plan for 2018? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes, that's still the plan, Doug, that we do plan to have that done in 2018. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Can you give an order of magnitude as to what the EBITDA associated with that is, John? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: No, not at this point. So, we are still putting together the assets that will be dropped and will be working with our partner GIP. And I'll have to give guidance on that a little bit later in the year, Doug. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. My follow-up if I may is probably for Greg, on his exploration in Guyana. Greg, couple of weeks ago Exxon suggested that Sorubim would be completed last weekend or thereabouts. I realize you're not the operator, but can you offer any color around what you might be seeing there in terms of the fact that it is taken over \u2013 it seems to be taking a little bit longer and what's on my mind there is Exxon had suggested that in a success case, there was a possibility of bringing our third rig into the basin. So, I'm just curious, if that's consistent with your thoughts and any color you can offer (27:57)? Thank you. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, Doug, thanks. I think the only thing we can say about Sorubim, right now is that well operations are still underway. And as I said in my opening remarks, following Sorubim that Bob Douglass is going to move and start drilling those development wells for Phase 1. And then again, just to remind, everyone, we also have operations going on in Liza-5. Liza-5 has been logged, cored and is currently undergoing a drill stem test, so that's sort of where we are on the block in terms of exploration and appraisal right now. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Do you have a connectivity result on Liza-5 yet, Greg? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, we don't yet, Doug, it's early in the test sequence. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks guys, I'll leave it there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Morris of Citi. Your line is now open. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Nice progress in the quarter, gentlemen. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Greg, on the Bakken, it seems that you're a bit more encouraged by what limited results you've had on the 200-stage plug-and-perf style completions here going forward. And remind me, I think those costs maybe up to $500,000 per well more. And so, you did just raise the EURs based on the 60-stage sliding sleeve, but what sort of uplift are you thinking about or anticipating to sort of make this the go-forward design in moving to 200 stage plug-and-perf completions. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for the question, Bob. In terms of the cost first, we're early in this process and costs are running between $6.5 million and $7 million for those 200-stage, 8.5 million pound proppant wells. But, we believe that's going to come down as we apply lean manufacturing just like we did with sliding sleeves. As we apply lean manufacturing to that process, we know that we'll be able to bring those costs down. As I said in my opening remarks, we really don't have any wells that we have plug-and-perf. We have seven online right now, but we don't have any that are past their IP90 dates. So, it's a little bit premature. The results are encouraging, but it's premature because we just don't have a statistical enough sample yet to be definitive about what the uplift is. It's positive, but I don't want to get specific beyond that. Now, our plans are because of the encouraging results, we are going to complete 40 plug-and-perfs this year and we'll have 25 wells online by year-end. And as I also said in my opening remarks that data was going to be critical for the study that we're conducting on the Bakken, which is really designed to, on a go-forward basis, determine what now is the optimum methodology to use for each area of the field as we think about further development of the Bakken. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. And my second question relates to that longer-term development plan we've had. Several companies talk about what they refer to as parent-child love relationships in other basins whereas some operators have said that in the Bakken, you actually see better performance from the infill wells versus the parallel, because parallel was drilled so long ago with older technology. Are you able to discern any relationship in that regard or is that just sort of being masked or overshadowed by the continued improvement in the type of completions you're applying here in trying to assess whether there is some degradation at some point on infill wells, or is it just too hard to tell with continuing to do better or higher intensity completions? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I think in the Bakken the performance just continues to get bigger and better with the improvements we're making in completion design. I will say for us because we drill half of the DSU at a time, we actually have no parent-child relationship because what we'll do is we'll go and we'll drill half of the 1280 acres and then maybe 12 months to 18 months later, we'll come back and drill the other half of the 1280 acres. So that really minimizes any interference at all. So, there's no impact to us. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Todd of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thanks. Maybe the first question on CapEx. It was relatively light in the quarter, how much of that was timing related? Fewer well completions in the Bakken in the quarter are you seeing any continued efficiencies that could drive lower than expected CapEx for the year? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Right now, it's really timing. I mean we were early in the year that always happens with our CapEx program. And as you know, as Greg mentioned, so as we move through the year we're bringing in a fifth rig into the Bakken in the third quarter and then the sixth six rig in the fourth quarter. And then also now, as Greg mentioned, we are going to have two rigs running in Guyana. So, there is as we move through the year was kind of more back-ended on the CapEx. So, again, everything is going with the execution and the CapEx plan is going really well. But at this point, I would still tell you 2.1 (33:23) for the year. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And then maybe you touched \u2013 obviously we touched already on asset disposals. There have been and are a number of packages and probably may continue to be packages being shopped in the Bakken. Would you guys have any interest in acquiring additional resource in the Bakken, or would you consider most of the deals as being dilutive relative to your current asset quality, or what would you need to see to be interested in picking up additional resource there? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Look we're always looking to optimize our portfolio. Having said that anything that we could potentially acquire would have to compete with a high return projects we already have secured in our portfolio between the Bakken and Guyana. And thus far we haven't seen any package in the market that would compete favorably in terms of what we have already under our feet. Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: On costs, can you discuss progress towards your cost reduction targets and milestones that you and we should be looking for? And can you also discuss the service cost environment in the Bakken as you add the two rigs and one crew? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. Brian I'll start on the cost reduction program, it is going along according to our plan. I mean you could see from the \u2013 as a milestone we did have the severance charge in the first quarter. As I mentioned the \u2013 from a head count standpoint there's approximately 400 employees and contractors affected by the reduction in force. Now not all, it's a little bit above 65% of those employees have left the company in the first quarter. And so there will continue to be reductions in force as we move through the year. As far as other aspects of our plan I mean we're starting here in the first quarter and what I would tell you with our plan we expect to have everything done by the fourth quarter. And then in the fourth quarter combined with the Enchilada field, the Conger coming back online and our increase in the Bakken you should begin to see the effects of our $150 million cost reduction program as well as the investments in our higher return assets driving our costs lower. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: And Brian in terms of the cost trends in the Bakken, you know cost trends are expected to increase anywhere from 5% to 15% versus last year depending on which commodity line you're talking about. But we've taken steps to contain those costs by locking in rig rates, putting in place longer term contracts, and forming strategic partnerships with our key suppliers. So, the steps we've taken coupled with our lean manufacturing approach, we're pretty confident that we can deliver our 2018 program with minimal inflation. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up is that you mentioned that I think you bought back the portion of the hedges collars that now give you exposure to the oil price upside about $65, I may have missed if you mentioned if there was a cost, cost to do that or an effective dollar barrel to do that. But now that there is more exposure to the upside to the degree that oil prices do stay here or move higher. Can you talk about how that impacts capital allocation either in terms of using that cash for incremental share repurchase or debt pay down or for reinvesting in the business? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah, right now, obviously, we're keeping the downside protection. But we felt it is prudent in the current oil environment to buy those collars back. John can talk further on the cost of that. So, we will benefit and our shareholders will benefit in the higher oil price environment that we're in. And again, our priority number one, two and three is to fund Guyana and future capital requirements not just for FPSO-1 but FPSO-2 and also the engineering for FPSO-3, continue the exploration and appraisal program and in that \u2013 and move up to six rigs in the Bakken, in that it's really important and we've talked about this before to keep a strong balance sheet and cash position. So you know, incremental cash right now will just be keeping that balance sheet strong for the funding requirements that we see going forward. In terms of any further share repurchases to be contemplated, one let's finish the $1.5 billion program we have which we will do this year, and two, as we look into next year, we'll see where our capital requirements are specifically on Guyana and we'll see where the oil prices and at that time we can give consideration to further return of capital to shareholders. John, you might want to talk about the other. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure, on cost of the buying out the call options, it was approximately $50 million. Now in my guidance that I gave that is reflected in the amortization of the premiums on our hedge contract. So as I mentioned, so for the next three quarters of 2018, the results will be reduced by $45 million a quarter due to the buyout of those call options. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I just have a quick question. And on the Bakken, Greg, have you seen any cost inflation really start to picking up? I mean, Permian we heard that they have difficulty getting enough staff or equipment that when they start to see some other area they're moving the equipment and people there. So how's that looking in the course and the availability of the equipment? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And also when you're talking about Bakken can you also talk about you're saying that you're going to reach a 175,000 barrel per day by 2021, is that the better way (39:51) or that's subject to say other factor that you may change what is the better way (39:59)? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, first of all, on the cost trends, Paul, thanks for the question. As I responded to the last person, you know, we do expect the cost trends they increased by some 5% to 15%, very different than the Permian simply because if you look at the rate of growth of rigs in the Bakken it's much smaller than it is in the Permian. So, it's kind of onesie, twosie I say, people growing by one or two rigs. So, the rate of increase is not substantial. Now, we've taken a lot of steps to contain those costs by locking in some rig rates, putting in place longer term contracts, forming strategic partners with our key suppliers. And we're pretty confident that the steps we've taken and our lean manufacturing approach is going to enable us to deliver our 2018 program with minimal inflation. There'll be some but it'll be minimal, we think we can cover most of that. So very different than the Permian. Regarding the 175,000 barrels of oil a day in 2021 that's the only assumption in there is that we maintain six rigs for the next couple of years to get us to the 175,000 barrels of oil a day. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: But, should we look at it from a resource standpoint and holistically that that will be the sweet spot you're going to get to 175,000 barrels of oil a day and you're just going to staying at that level for a number of years or that may change also? So trying to understand what you guys have in mind and targeting? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, I think at this point the 175,000 barrels of oil a day is appears to be the sweet spot. Then we can maintain that for several years in the Bakken and of course, that's a combination of infrastructure build out and whatnot. And that's why the 175,000 barrels of oil a day appears to be a sweet spot. The only caveat I will put on that is we are conducting this comprehensive Bakken study this year and so depending on the outcomes of that study that could dictate how long you hold that peak, how fast you get there are some other factors. So that's the only caveat I'd put on that. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And let's go back into the cause. Have you seen people and the equipment being moved out from Bakken into Permian? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Not. Certainly, it hasn't affected us at all and that's all that I'm concerned about, is that it doesn't affect us. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And for John Rielly that the second question on the unit DD&A why from the first quarter to the second quarter you were jumped that much? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So from the guidance that we gave you remember Paul, since we're giving the guidance ex-Libya on there. So, if you're looking at actual costs that we had in the first quarter going into our second quarter guidance, so without Libya, right, our production is going to be lower, our cash costs are going to be lower and our DD&A. I'm sorry our cash costs will be higher and our DD&A will be higher and then our tax rate will be lower. So, there's really no change if you want to say quarter-on-quarter for the DD&A. It's just from a guidance purposes, we don't have Libya in there. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So that if I \u2013 so maybe then, let me ask then in the first quarter if you are excluding Libya, what was the cash cost and unit DD&A? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So that you could add about \u2013 yes, you can add about a $1.50 to the DD&A rate and you can add about $1 to the cash cost. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I see. So that's why you're saying that sequentially, as we need not such a big difference in anywhere. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Correct, correct. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Very good. Thank you. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Just to kick a little harder on the Bakken on the kind of service costs, and just what's going on there in terms of productivity. Are you seeing pressure on the pricing side, I know the question was asked about kind of labor and so forth. But any general pressure on any part of the service sector there for you? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I think you know as I said before that, here the cost trends are expected to increase 5% to 15% depending on the commodity line. You're talking about on the upper end would be the pumping services, on the lower end it would be the sand and kind of other commodities. So \u2013 but again with the steps we've taken by locking in the rig rates, putting in place longer term contracts, forming the strategic partnership with our key suppliers and lean manufacturing. We think that, we can execute our 2018 program with relatively minimal inflation. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then switching gears a little bit, your \u2013 the Gulf of Mexico has come back a little quicker than expected. I know you still are predicting the last part of it or budgeting the last part of it for late September. But is there a rational way to approach that, a reasonable way to approach that, that it could come on a little bit quicker just sort of gone by what the operators been saying? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yeah. So, I think as we said the instantaneous rate that was off at the end of year was 30,000 barrels a day after that came on in the first quarter, in March the other half we're projecting to be on by the start of the fourth quarter. The operator is still forecasting kind of June, July sort of a timeframe, so yes, there could be a little bit of upside, but obviously that depends on weather and all kinds of factor. So, we've got a little bit more conservatism built-in given it's a brownfield project, and we'll just see kind of where we end up. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then just the last question on the Sorubim well, if I remember correctly, it's sort of a different structure than what we saw with Payara, so the fact that it's taking a little longer to drill that, I would assume make sense or was within the budgeted expectations? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yeah, it's definitely within the budgeted expectations, and yes, it is a different play type, it's onlapping sediments on to a carbonate shelf margin, so. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: And, I can add just from a cost standpoint, because that is some of the benefits of drilling exploration wells in Guyana, just that typical exploration well there is our gross well cost is around $50 million, so net to us is about $15 million. So that's kind of a typical exploration well there. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Guy Baber of Simmons & Company. Your line is now open. Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks for taking the question, everyone. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.: So, the Bakken production during the quarter, obviously, seemed especially strong in light of you guys only bringing on 13 wells, and some of the plug-and-perf wells likely contributed, but can you talk a little bit more about the outperformance and how well productivity is shaping up relative to what is assumed in the full-year production guidance of 115,000 to 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. It just appears that that guidance might be a little conservative due to what you guys delivered at 1Q and the schedule and the number of wells you're planning to bring on the rest of the year? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Thanks for the question. A couple of comments. First of all that, the first quarter was strong and that was mainly driven by drilling wells in Keene, which is really our best area of the field. So that mix changes as you go throughout the year, but Keene performed particularly well during the first quarter and in our Investor pack, we show the IP180s in Keene and Stony Creek and East Nesson and Capa. And we've said, those IPs are north of 100,000 barrels, IP180s north of 100,000 barrels. Keene is coming exceptionally strong. So, if you weight average that and assume that Keene is going to continue to perform, our IP180s for the year will actually be some 15% to 20% higher than what's in our current investor pack. And that's a step-up from last year as we said of 10% to 15%. So yes, there's upside, driven mainly by Keene. If you look at East Nesson South, Stony Creek and Capa, they're coming in at about where we expected, but Keene has really outperformed. So very strong performance from Keene. As I said, the plug-and-perf wells, we just don't have enough to be statistically significant. There's only seven online, none of which have gone beyond IP90. So, it's just early days on that. But, it is encouraging. So, there is a little bit of additional volume associated with those plug-and-perf wells. Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.: That's helpful. Thank you. And then you all have been clear that the top priority for capital is prefunding Guyana. I was just hoping you could shed a little bit more light on the longer term plans there? And specifically, how you see the balance of cash inflow versus CapEx shaping up over time, especially with three phases happening and the discovered resource to do much more than that. But you all have highlighted rapid cash pay back there, cost recovery will help I'm sure. But can you just talk through maybe in a little bit more detail or give us a framework as to what point Guyana actually becomes self-funding or begins to generate excess cash flow on kind of base case expectations or plans? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Sure. So, the way as we mentioned in the scripts earlier, Phase 1 Exxon is planning to bring on by 2020. When that production comes on, we're beginning to pick up significant cash flow, but Guyana itself is going to be still maybe more in a breakeven to maybe a slight deficit as we go forward with Phase 2 and Phase 3 capital. Then what happens when Phase 2 comes on and remember that's a bigger FPSO 220,000 barrels per day, when that comes on and let's just say it's two years for now somewhere mid-ish 2022, just for an assumption standpoint. Guyana begins to throw off significant free cash flow at that point in time. So, our production with our 30% share in there gets over 100,000 barrels a day once that ship comes on in Guyana, then basically that supports all future capital in Guyana once the Phase 2 production comes on. Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great, that makes sense. And then I had one more follow-up on the 1Q cash flow number, but the pre-working capital cash flow number looked very strong, but obviously there were some meaningful working capital headwinds that you all called out. You had a large working capital drag last year, but with the divestment of some of your cash consuming assets, we'd expected that issue to maybe go away this year. So, can you talk a little bit more about the extent to which some of these issues that affected 1Q bottom line cash flow may or may not persist going forward? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Sure. So, what we have in the first quarter, let me just first talk about kind of, if you want to call it normal, but still non-recurring type pulls on working capital in the first quarter. So, as we said, there was a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. What happens in the first quarter, typically most companies, we're paying our bonuses in the first quarter. So, you're accruing through the year and then you're paying that bonus. So, you have that always in the first quarter. And then in our first and third quarters is where we pay basically semi-annually then the interest payments on our public bonds. So typically, you'll see a type of working capital pull for interest payments in our first and third quarter. Then the other one now, this is not recurring, I mentioned earlier was, we bought our call options on the WTI, so that was approximately $50 million. That will not recur. And then the only other thing I need to remind everyone on is, is we are still going through kind of the remnants of our portfolio reshaping, and we are going through a cost reduction program. So for example, we have that severance, we will be then paying severance off in the remainder of the year. So, you're going to see still some remnants of that portfolio reshaping and that's why I like to say, as I mentioned earlier, by the fourth quarter, we'll have gotten through our cost reduction program and all that benefits will begin to be shown through as you see in the fourth quarter and then into 2019. So again, nothing unusual except for really the buyout of the WTI call options and then further transition costs you may see through the year. Guy Baber - Simmons Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hall of Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Thanks. I guess I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of things. First, in the Williston, I think there's some tighter flaring regulations coming in in the back half of the year. How are you guys set up to handle that? And then second, in the second quarter on that 115,000 BOE a day what's the expected wells put to sales to support that? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Okay. So, on the first question, we don't have any issue with the flaring regulations coming up, we're set up well for that, why? Because we have 250 million cubic feet capacity at Tioga Gas Plant that can be expanded to 300 million cubic feet for very little capital, we won't need that this year but that's certainly an option out in the future. Q1 processing volumes are 214 million cubic feet, so you can see that we've got, we've got room to go there. And then secondly, thinking ahead we're adding a 100 million cubic feet of net capacity south of the river at the Targa JV that are Midstream announced. So because of those reasons we'll be set up \u2013 we'll be set up well for handling any flaring constraints. And your second question... Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Yeah. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: ...was related to wells, is that correct? Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Yeah, just how many wells do you expect to have turned to sales in the second quarter? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yes, our current forecast is to have 23 wells online in the second quarter versus 13 wells in the first quarter. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. And then, I guess the other follow-up is on, just uses of capital in this more elevated commodity environment. What would you say a targeted debt level would be on a dollar basis as you look towards 2019, 2020 just kind of on a longer-term basis as you enter the full Guyana development phase? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Our plan is that, we can fund, so we set up through our asset sale program that we pre-funded Guyana. So, we do not intend to go to the debt markets for any additional requirements for Guyana or for anything else that we have. So, we're set up from a pre-funded standpoint. So, you could expect our debt level to stay where it is after we finish our debt reduction initiative. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Yeah. I guess, I was thinking the other side, are there any further debt reduction targets that you think through on a longer database (56:13)? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: This is \u2013 John Hess mentioned earlier. So, what we'll do is, as we finish out this debt reduction plan, the $500 million and our stock buyback of $1.5 billion, as we'll finish that out. Again, our priorities are to make sure that we have Guyana pre-funded, because that's truly transformational. And then maintain a strong balance sheet. So, we want to be investment grade, maintain that investment grade, balance sheet, and then excess cash beyond that, we will be considering for stock buybacks or debt buybacks at that time. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. Understood. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question, guys. You've been asked about costs in the U.S., I would kind of expand that to what you're seeing in the offshore arena. So, as you're contracting for new rigs or development equipment in Indiana, how are those costs tracking relative to your original expectations from when Liza project was originally sanctioned a year ago? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Great. Thanks for the question, Pavel. The Deepwater offshore market continues to be oversupplied given the extended period of low activity that John talked about in his opening remarks. And as a result, we expect to see minimal if any cost inflation. In terms of Guyana Phase 2 versus Phase 1, costs are coming in lower, actually lower than for Phase 1 for most of the commodity line. So again, you're seeing that continue to oversupply reflect itself in Guyana Phase 2 as well. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And then a quick one about the dividends. So, it's been about five years since you've taking that down to $0.25 a quarter. Is that, at all, on the agenda as far as an increase goes alongside the buyback that you're implementing? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: On the dividend itself, that we want to see us being cash flow generative with our current capital requirements and our current dividend on a recurring basis for us to consider going up on that. We're not quite there yet. Obviously 2020, we start seeing our company being cash flow generative in a $50 world on a recurring basis. So, at that time, we can consider what's the best way to enhance return of capital to shareholders. And obviously, I talked earlier about how we're thinking about next year in terms of capital through share repurchases based upon funding Guyana, and keeping a strong balance sheet and cash position for future Phase of Guyana. And obviously, the oil price environment. So that sort of how we think about return of capital. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Appreciate it, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael McAllister of MUFG Securities. Your line is now open. Michael McAllister - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Thank you for taking my call. My question is about the Bakken, the scenario you're kind of presenting it's looking like a 50% increase in rigs could lead to a 30% increase in wells tilled for 2019? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: So again, yeah we are taking the rig count up. We'll add a fifth rig in third quarter and a sixth rig in fourth quarter. So that's true our actual wells online will go up in 2019 relative to 2018. Michael McAllister - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: And can I take that further to say that production would be or could be 20% to 25% higher? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, I think you know again, thinking about where we are on the road to 175,000 BOE in 2021, you're right the rate of increase will go up in 2019 as a result of that higher number of wells online. Michael McAllister - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that. And then to 2019 any thoughts on hedging at these prices? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So, we will be you know we continue to look at our hedging program. We've made some changes as you know in 2018. As of right now, we don't have any hedges on in 2019. We're continuing to look at it. Obviously, the curve is a bit backward dated and when you're this far from 2019, it is expensive on that time value with the volatility. So, at this point, we haven't had anything, but we'll continue to look at that. And then, obviously, as we continue move up as Greg was saying with the Bakken increase in production, production increase in next year, we don't have as much of a cash deficit as you move into 2019 and we don't have a funding deficit at all because of the asset sales. So any hedging we probably do would not be at the same level we did in 2018, but we'll continue to look at putting hedges on in 2019. Michael McAllister - MUFG Securities America, Inc.: All right. Thank you for that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Good morning. Greg, I was wondering if you could just maybe comment a little bit more on the study you're doing in the Bakken to determine the optimal development methodology and just give us a sense of what you're looking at and how could things potentially change? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. So I think, it's the right time to do the study in the Bakken because the Bakken is at an inflection point. We're adding rig count. We're changing, potentially changing methodology on completion type. And so, it's a good time just to step back and say, okay given that plug-and-perf looks like it's coming into the mix, how do we think about our development methodologies for various parts of the field. What's that mean for the core? What's that mean for outside the core? What's that mean for well spacing? Does that change our thinking on well spacing? All of these factors are going to go into this study to really define in the back-half of the year what is our revised development methodology going forward in the Bakken. So it's really a good time to do it, because we have more DSUs in the core than anyone else, we're stepping up the rig count, so it's time to just step back and really think thoughtfully where \u2013 how we want to take this asset forward. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And results will be later this year or something like that? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, it will be, I think we've talked about in Investor Day, fourth quarter of the year, we'd obviously share our result for that in the Investor Day. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. And just my follow-up, it sounds like results in 1Q in the Bakken outperformed, just given a better than results at Keene. Could you talk a little bit about the mix of the Keene versus outside of Keene for your 2018 completions? And would you think that your overall Bakken guidance is conservative just given the performance at Keene? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, again it's early in the air and Keene did outperform. And if you look at our programs of the 95 wells that we've guided to be online this year, 40 of those wells are in Keene, 25 of those are in Stony Creek, 20 are in East Nesson South and 10 are in Capa. And if you look at our investor presentation we actually showed the EURs in the IP180s for each of those areas. As I said Stony Creek, East Nesson South and Capa are coming in at about what we expected. But Keene is one that's really so far outperforming this year. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Herrlin of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is now open. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Yeah. Thank you. Following-up on what you were saying on the Bakken, Greg. Does this mean you're trying to better figure out your spacing densities, or should we assume that given the results of your study down the line that may go to longer wells in terms of the completions? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I think, John, thanks for the question. I think all of that is part of what the study will look at. As you know, we've been developing the Bakken on very tight spacing and so fracture geometry control is really, really important given that you're on tight spacing with limited entry plug-and-perf now, the methodology is such that you can get tighter fracture geometry control, but also a lot more entry points in the wellbore. So, if that's true that could affect your well spacing assumption, but way too early to predict what the outcome is going to be. That's one of the elements of the study that we'll be looking at. And it could vary depending on where you are on the field because obviously in the core you've got a lot more natural fracturing that's helping you out to get outside the core you don't have as much so all these things will be part of the study that we're looking at in the Bakken with the ultimate objective to maximize DSU and overall NPV for the Bakken asset. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : Great. And one, the follow-up on Guyana. I was able to see Chorus (66:24) the other day with Exxon and it looked to me like the reservoirs weren't super well cemented, and look like calcite cements, were you at all surprised by that? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Not really. No. I \u2013 and it \u2013 again it's \u2013 these wells are going to produce like gangbusters as you know just based on your look at the core. So, we weren't surprised by it and we're not particularly concerned about it. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : No, I did think it was a concern I just... Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. John P. Herrlin - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale : ... that looked like great rock. That's all. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Great rock. Yeah. Thanks Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Phillip Jungwirth of BMO. Your line is now open. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I think the Penn State well in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to be brought online in March and was just curious if there is any update here on timing, and also the rate of that well? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. So, the well did come on in March as planned and we're currently in ramp up operations on that well, just like Stampede wells, we're bringing these wells on slowly in the Miocene, adjusting the chokes slowly. That well is expected to be in the range of 5,000 barrels to 10,000 barrels a day once it gets to full choke. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. And then on the Bakken, you've talked about this asset as meaning to be a free cash generator to the corporation. Just looking at 2018 and maybe 2019, do you have a sense for what the free cash flow profiles of this asset would be at current oil prices, and how that can influence the decision to move beyond six rigs planned for year-end? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Sure. So again, at this point we are just planning on the fifth rigs and sixth rigs being added in the second half of the year with where prices are even with prices lower the Bakken was going to be generating a little free cash flow in 2018 and that's again because when you bring on the fifth and sixth rigs you're really not getting any production from those rigs yet that goes into 2019. Then as we increase production, it was 1920, then getting up to the 175,000 barrels a day and obviously holding six rigs, the Bakken will generate significant cash flow. A lot in 2019 and even more in 2020 and 2021 and that that's says, we've always said in the near-term that's what's driving us to be able to be free cash flow positive at $50 Brent post 2020 and then it's when Guyana and really that Phase 2 comes in that really continues to drive up our free cash flow. So, at this point in time we \u2013 there's no plans to go above the six rigs or a 175,000 barrel at a target is on that six rigs. But as Greg said, we are looking, we're doing a study and we'll let you know, if we make any changes but at this point in time there is no change to our six rigs. Phillip J. Jungwirth - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2018 Hess Corporation Conference Call. My name is James, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.: Thank you, James. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information which will be provided on our website. Now, as usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will provide a strategy update, Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results. We continue to make significant progress during the quarter in executing our strategy, to grow our resource base in a capital discipline manner, to move down the cost curve so we are resilient in a low price oil \u2013 low oil price environment and be cash generative at a $50 per barrel Brent oil price post-2020. Consistent with this strategy, in June, we announced the sale of our joint venture interest in the Utica for a net cash consideration of approximately $400 million as part of our continued efforts to high grade and focus our portfolio by divesting lower return non-core assets. In addition to the $3.4 billion from our 2017 asset sales, these proceeds are being used to invest in our highest return assets, Guyana, which is one of the industry's largest oil discoveries in more than a decade, and the Bakken, our largest operated asset, where we have more than 500,000 net acres in the core of the play, as well as to fund our previously announced $1.5 billion share repurchase program and reduce debt by $500 million. During the quarter, we announced that we will retain our interest in Denmark where we hold a 61.5% interest in the South Arne field and are the operator. The offers received in a previously announced sale process did not meet our value expectations. Key to our strategy is our position in Guyana; the 6.6 million acre Stabroek Block where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator is a massive world-class resource that is uniquely advantaged by its scale, reservoir quality, cost, rapid cash paybacks and superior financial returns. As such, our first priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet and our investment grade credit rating in order to fund one of the most attractive oil investment opportunities in the world today. Earlier this week, we increased the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block to more than 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up 25% from the previous estimate of 3.2 million barrels of oil equivalent. The increase follows completion of testing at the Liza-5 appraisal well, discoveries at Ranger and Pacora and the incorporation of results from the recent Longtail discovery into the Turbot area evaluation. The Liza Phase-1 development that was sanctioned last June is progressing rapidly with first production of gross 120,000 barrels of oil per day expected by early 2020. Phase 2 of the Liza development, which is targeted for sanction by the end of this year, will use a second FPSO with gross production capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day, start-up for Phase 2 is expected by mid-2022. The Liza-5 well was successfully tested the northern portion of the Liza field along with the giant Payara field will support a third phase of development in Guyana. Planning is underway for this third phase, which is targeted to be sanctioned in 2019 and will use an FPSO vessel designed to produce approximately 180,000 barrels of oil per day with first production as early as 2023. The Longtail discovery established the Turbot Longtail area as a potential development hub for recovery of more than 500 million barrels of oil equivalent. Additional prospects to be drilled in this area could increase this estimate. The total discovery discoveries on the Stabroek Block to date have established the potential for up to five FPSOs producing over 750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025. There is potential for additional development phases from significant undrilled targets and plans for rapid exploration and appraisal drilling, including at the Ranger discovery. We continue to see multi-billion barrels of additional exploration potential on the Stabroek Block. In April, we extended our acreage position in the prolific Guyana-Suriname Basin by acquiring a 15% participating interest in the Kaieteur Block which is adjacent to the Stabroek Block. The Kaieteur Block is approximately 3.3 million acres or roughly the size of 580 deepwater blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. Also key to our strategy is the Bakken, where we have a premier position and a robust inventory of high return drilling locations. We added a fifth rig in June and plan to add a sixth rig early in the fourth quarter which is expected to generate capital efficient production growth, from an average of 114,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter to 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 along with a meaningful increase in free cash flow generation over this period. During the quarter, we continued evaluating new completion techniques and initiated a comprehensive study to further maximize the value of this important asset. We plan to provide an update on these initiatives later in the year. Second quarter net production in the Bakken averaged 114,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2018 we continue to forecast that Bakken production will average between 115,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now, turning to our financial results, in the second quarter of 2018 we posted a net loss of $130 million or $0.48 per share down from a net loss of $449 million or $1.46 per share in the year ago quarter. Compared to 2017, our improved second quarter financial results primarily reflect higher realized crude oil selling prices and lower operating costs and DD&A expense, partially offset by lower production volumes primarily due to asset sales. Second quarter production was above the high end of our guidance range, averaging 247,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, driven by strong performance across our portfolio. For full-year 2018, we reaffirm our net production guidance of 245,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 255,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. This guidance includes the loss of production from the sale of our Utica joint venture interests and the benefit from the earlier than planned return of production from the Conger field in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In summary we continue to make significant progress in executing our strategy and positioning our company to deliver long (09:09) and superior financial returns to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update on our operational performance for the quarter as we continue to execute our strategy. In the second quarter, production averaged 240,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. This was above the top end of our guidance range of 235,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day to 245,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and reflected strong performance across our portfolio. In the Bakken, we delivered another strong quarter despite some despite some curtailments related to heavy rains in June that caused a significant number of road closures. Second quarter Bakken production averaged 114,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the second quarter, we drilled 28 wells and brought 27 wells online. For the full year 2018, we still expect to drill approximately 120 wells and bring 95 wells online. In line with our previous guidance, we have added a fifth rig in the Bakken and plan on adding a sixth rig early in the fourth quarter. We also added a third frac crew early in the third quarter. We continue to see encouraging initial results from our pilot of limited entry plug-and-perf completions. Of the 95 gross operated wells we expect to bring online this year, approximately 25 are planned to be plug-and-perf. In late June, we announced an agreement to sell our JV interests in the Utica Shale play to Ascent Resources. Production from this asset was expected to average 14,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over 2018 and we expect this transaction to close by the end of the third quarter. In mid-July, Shell brought its Enchilada facility in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico back online which allowed us to restart production from the Conger field. Production from Conger is in the process of ramping back up to its pre shut-in rate of approximately 15,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Taking these factors into account, we forecast third quarter production to increase to between 250,000 and 260,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. We are maintaining our full year 2018 production guidance range of 245,000 to 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, as the earlier than expected return to production of the Conger field is expected to offset the production associated with the sale of our Utica joint venture assets. Both in the third quarter and for the full year 2018, we forecast that Bakken production will average between 115,000 and 120,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. We continue to forecast steady Bakken production growth to approximately 175,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 assuming a six-rig program. Now turning to the offshore. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, production averaged 47,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter, in line with guidance and again reflecting approximately 15,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day of production that was shut in at our Conger field over the quarter. For the third quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average approximately 60,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. By the fourth quarter with all Enchilada-impacted fields back online and the continued ramp-up at Stampede, we forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average approximately 65,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moving to the Gulf of Thailand, production from our Asian assets averaged 63,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day during the second quarter. At the joint development area in which Hess has a 50% interest, production averaged 37,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. Production is forecast to average approximately 36,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over 2018. At the North Malay Basin, where Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, production averaged 26,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter and is forecast to average approximately 26,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over the year. Now turning to Guyana. We announced on Monday that gross discoverable recoverable resources at the Stabroek Block, in which Hess holds a 30% interest are now estimated to exceed 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent, which is up 25% from the previous estimate of more than 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In addition, total discoveries to-date have established the potential for up to five floating production, storage and offloading vessels or FPSOs to produce over 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day by 2025. As we've said before, Guyana continues to get bigger and better. In late June, the operator ExxonMobil announced an eighth oil discovery at Longtail-1, which is located in the southeast of the 6.6 million acre Stabroek Block, approximately 5 miles west of the Turbot-1 discovery. The well was safely drilled to 18,057 feet in 6,365 feet of water in 26 days. It encountered approximately 256 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir. With the success at Longtail, we believe the combined gross recoverable resources in the Turbot Longtail area exceed 500 million barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see several additional prospects in this area that could potentially take this estimate even higher. Post Longtail, the operator decided to perform routine maintenance on the Stena Carron. This provided an opportunity to complete the riser-less top hole section of Ranger-2 before proceeding to the Hammerhead-1 exploration well in the coming days. Hammerhead is located 9 miles southwest in \u2013 of the Liza discovery. In the coming days, the drillship will move to the Hammerhead-1 exploration well and following completion of the well operations on Hammerhead, the current plan is to return to Ranger. The Liza Phase 1 development sanctioned in June 2017 continues to make rapid progress. Development drilling began in May, laying the foundation for production start-up in early 2020. Liza Phase 1 will consist of 17 wells and an FPSO designed to produce up to 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day. Development drilling and construction of the FPSO and subsea equipment is progressing on schedule. Liza Phase 2 is on track for sanction by year end. The Phase 2 development will utilize an FPSO with a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day with first oil expected by mid-2022. Given the ongoing exploration success on the Stabroek Block and its significant remaining potential, the operator now plans to add a third drillship by the fourth quarter which will be dedicated to exploring and appraising the numerous high value prospects on the block. On the recently acquired 3.3 million acre Kaieteur Block offshore Guyana in which Hess holds a 15% participating interest, the 2018 work program will include processing and interpretation of 3D seismic data and evaluation of a future drilling program. In neighboring Suriname, Hess has exposure to an additional 4.4 million acres through our 33% interests in both block 42 and 59. We see these blocks as a potential play extension from the Stabroek Block in Guyana with similar play types and trap styles. The operator Kosmos plans to spud a first exploration well on a prospect called Pontoenoe in Block 42 by the end of the third quarter. In Canada, offshore Nova Scotia, the operator BP has spud the Aspy playtest well targeting a large subsalt structure analogous to those found in the Gulf of Mexico. BP and Hess each hold a 50% working interest in exploration licenses that cover approximately 3.5 million acres, equivalent to some 600 Deepwater Gulf of Mexico blocks. We anticipate results by the end of the third quarter. In closing, we have once again demonstrated excellent execution and delivery across our portfolio. The Bakken is on a strong capital-efficient growth trajectory and this combined with our sizable interest in the world class Guyana Suriname basin has positioned us for more than a decade of visible cash flow and production growth and improving returns and cost metrics. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2018. We incurred a net loss of $130 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared with a net loss of $106 million in the first quarter of 2018. Our adjusted net loss which excludes items effecting comparability of earnings between periods was $56 million in the second quarter of 2018, down from $72 million in the previous quarter. Turning to exploration and production, on an adjusted basis E&P had net income of $21 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $12 million in the first quarter of 2018. The changes in the after tax components of adjusted E&P results between the second quarter and first quarter of 2018 were as follows : higher realized selling prices increased earnings by $46 million, higher sales volumes increased earnings by $47 million, higher exploration expense reduced earnings by $25 million, higher DD&A expense reduced earnings by $23 million dollars, higher cash costs reduced earnings by $14 million, higher Midstream tariffs reduced earnings by $12 million, all other items reduced earnings by $10 million for an overall increase in second quarter earnings of $9 million. Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $30 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $28 million in the first quarter of 2018. Midstream EBITDA before the non-controlling interest amounted to $126 million in the second quarter compared to $123 million in the previous quarter. Turning to corporate, after tax corporate and interest expenses were $191 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to $109 million in the first quarter of 2018. After-tax adjusted corporate and interest expenses were $107 million in the second quarter of 2018, compared to $112 million in the previous quarter. Turning to our financial position. In April, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement which was completed in June, bringing total share repurchases under our previously announced $1.5 billion repurchase program to $1 billion. Total shares purchased to date amount to 19.2 million shares at an average price of $52.18 per share. We plan to purchase the remaining $500 million of shares during the second half of 2018 and are targeting $250 million of purchases in the third quarter and $250 million in the fourth quarter. In the second quarter, we also purchased approximately $110 million of our public notes, increasing total debt retired to $500 million. Excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.5 billion, total liquidity was $6.8 billion including available committed credit facilities and debt was $5.5 billion at June 30. In the third quarter, we completed the purchase of WTI put option contracts that set a floor price of $60 per barrel on a notional 35,000 barrels of oil per day during calendar year 2019. Proceeds from the recently announced sale of our Utica joint venture interests are expected to be received in the third quarter. Turning to guidance, first for E&P, in the second quarter, our E&P cash costs were $13.37 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $14.03 per barrel of oil equivalent excluding Libya which beat guidance on strong production and lower costs. We project cash costs for E&P operations excluding Libya in the third quarter to be in the range of $13 per barrel of oil equivalent to $14 dollars per barrel of oil equivalent, while full-year 2000 (sic) [2018] cash cost guidance remains unchanged at $13 per barrel of oil equivalent to $14 dollars per barrel of oil equivalent. DD&A expense in the second quarter was $16.85 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $17.92 per barrel of oil equivalent excluding Libya, which was in line with guidance. DD&A expense excluding Libya is forecast to be in the range of $18 per barrel of oil equivalent to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent in the third quarter of 2018 and full-year DD&A expense guidance of $18 per barrel of oil equivalent to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent is unchanged. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs excluding Libya of $31 per barrel of oil equivalent to $33 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and for the full-year of 2018. Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million in the third quarter with full-year guidance remaining unchanged at $190 million to $210 million. The Midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $165 million for the third quarter with full-year guidance forecast to be in the range of $635 million to $650 million. The E&P effective tax rate excluding Libya is expected to be an expense in the range of 0% to 4% for the third quarter. The full-year effective tax rate is expected to be a benefit in the range of 16% to 20%, which is updated from the previous guidance of a benefit in the range of 0% to 4%. For the full-year 2018, our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures guidance remains unchanged at $2.1 billion. Our 2018 crude oil hedge positions remain unchanged. We have $50 WTI put option contracts on a notion of 115,000 barrels per day of production for the remainder of the year. We expect the non-cash amortization of premiums on our crude oil hedges will reduce our financial results by approximately $50 million per quarter for the remainder of 2018. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $30 million in the third quarter with the full year guidance of approximately $115 million, which is above the midpoint of our previous guidance. Turning to corporate, for the third quarter of 2018, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million and the full year guidance is estimated to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million, which is down from the previous guidance in the range of $105 million to $115 million. Interest expenses are estimated to be approximately $85 million for the third quarter and the full year guidance is estimated to be in the range of $340 million to $345 million, which is also down from the previous guidance in the range of $345 million to $355 million. This concludes my remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Bob Morris with Citi. Your line is now open. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Congratulations John on the continued success in Guyana on that reserve update earlier this week. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Greg. You're welcome. Greg, just some quick questions on the Bakken shale. I know that 40 of the 95 completions this year are supposed to be in the higher productive Keene area. How many of those 40 wells in the Keene area have you done in the first half of the year? And then also of the 25 plug-and-perf wells, how many of those were completed in the first half of the year? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, let me \u2013 thanks, Bob. And before I get started, I do want to correct something in my remarks. Our second quarter production was 247,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, I believe I said 240,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was obviously incorrect. Let me start with the plug-and-perf wells first. So we expect to do 40 of those this year, drill and complete, but only have 25 of those online. And as you said, we do expect to have 40 Keene wells online, seven of those will be plug-and-perf by the end of the year that will be drilled and completed. Regarding how many we've got done in the first part of the year, I think we have about 12 done in the Keene area in the first half of the year, so the remainder will come in the second half of the year. Now, what I should say is those Keene wells are doing extremely well, so they're outperforming their type curves at least on the wells that we've done so far by some 25%. So the results here have been very good. Also in the Stony Creek area, the wells that we have done there, again reminding everyone we're going to do 25 of those this year in Stony Creek, those were outperforming their type curves by around 40%. So Stony Creek and Keene are really the top two areas in this year's drilling program and then our East Nesson South and our Capa wells are performing at, about at expectation on the type curve. So Keene and Stony Creek are the ones to watch. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks for that update. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Good morning, and congrats on the quarter. If we could maybe just hit Guyana a little bit here. So if we look at the guidance of 750,000 or more barrels by 2025, and the expectations of barrels out of the first three FPSOs, we'd be implying kind of Liza-1 sized FPSOs at the minimum in terms of phases 4 and 5, and is that \u2013 should we think of them as upside to maybe where Liza-2 is, when we're trying to frame the overall impact of the development? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Okay, thanks. Thanks for that, Roger. A couple of comments there. I think first of all, in our messaging you note that we said that we see the potential up to five FPSOs to produce over 750,000 barrels a day. So that's one caveat. I think the other one \u2013 the other thing is, is that the ultimate size and timing of those last two vessels very much in the scoping phase, and it's going to be a function of a lot further exploration and appraisal drilling as well as detailed engineering work. And again, these are massive reservoirs with very large areal extent and multiple horizons. So those are directional numbers. Let's get that appraisal and exploration drilling done, and then we can be much more definitive. But again, we see it as over 750,000 barrels a day. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. And one more clarification as we think about Guyana. I know Phase 1 here is an oil only situation, how are we thinking about the gas and the other liquids as you look at these future phases? Any plans to bring the gas to shore or are we thinking pretty much 100% oil in terms of production? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, I think that the grand majority of the gas will be re-injected in the reservoir. There is a small project being discussed with the Government of Guyana to bring a small amount of gas onshore for an onshore power plant. Other than that, all the gas right now is anticipated to be re-injected in the reservoir, because particularly in the Liza complex the gas is miscible. So there will be recovery uplift as a result of putting that gas in the reservoir. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Morning, everybody. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Morning. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Guys, maybe I could kick off with a follow up on Guyana, just very quickly. I think Roger kind of hit the point about the 752,000 FPSO math doesn't really seem to make any sense, but can you walk us through what the exploration plan is for the second half of the year, it looks like Ranger has obviously been brought forward in the plan. But with a third rig coming in, what should we think about \u2013 what you're trying to identify for the second half and what I'm really trying to get at is, are we getting to a point where we're going to start to see parallel developments on some of these things as you move into that 2023, 2024, 2025 timeline? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Let me answer your second question first, Doug, I think regarding in parallel, we are in absolute agreement and alignment with the operator that the way to approach this development is in a phased manner, so that's currently the thinking right now and we're absolutely in support of that. Regarding the exploration drilling program for the remainder of the year, all I can say now is that next we go to Hammerhead, we just are in the final phase of drilling the top or drilling the top section on the Ranger-2, we'll go to Hammerhead, then most likely we'll go back to Ranger, the sequence for the fourth rig we're still working out with the operator, but obviously we've got a lot of stuff to do, and we've got a lot of stuff to do in kind of the Turbot Longtail area; there's some things that we'd like to drill there as well, potentially a good resource increase there. So the exact order, we're still working out but there'll be more and more in the Turbot Longtail area. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just to be clear, Greg, is this a third rig or a fourth rig? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: It's a third rig, yeah. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Third rig. Okay. Thank you. Okay, so my follow-up is if I could take you back to the Bakken for a second and I appreciate the color on the Keene and the Stony Creek wells doing better, but can you kind of walk us through, have you completed any plug-and-perf wells yet? Is that contributing to the better performance or is there something else going on with the better performance? And then your answer, Greg, I wonder if you could take one other comment I think John had made at a prior third-party conference that you're starting to look at potentially putting ESPs down some of these wells as well. So I guess I'm really just trying to get a prognosis for what was embedded in your guidance because clearly the better type curve wasn't embedded in your guidance. So what are you assuming in your guidance and how should we think about the risks for that guide and for well performance as we move into 2019? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, so Doug, the grand majority of our guidance reflects the sliding sleeve wells, and the reason for that is because we only have three of the plug-and-perf wells on right now. Now, they're doing better than expected, but it's early days. So we didn't want to build a whole bunch of uplift in the guidance at this point until we got more data on those plug-and-perf wells. So far so good, but we wanted to have confidence in the data before we did that. Now on ESPs, we've been evaluating the use of ESPs as well as some other forms of lift. As you know, some operators up there are doing gas lift as well, particularly in the areas that have higher fluid rates and require the use of additional liquids handling. And in particular, the plug-and-perfs, if they continue to perform and have high fluid rates, obviously that's something we're looking at. But at the end of the day, the decision on which forms of artificial lift we're going to use is ultimately going to be driven by economics, not volume. So it will be an economic decision as to what we do on the lift side. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Sorry to press you on this, Greg. Just to be clear, the Keene wells, the Stony Creek wells are doing 25% and 40% better than your type curve, and they're the majority I think of the completions in the second half of the year and that's not in your guidance. So why haven't you raised the guidance in the Bakken? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, we've raised some of the guidance on those Keene wells but only on the sliding sleeve completions, Doug. So I wouldn't \u2013 watch this space, as we get more data, it will reflect itself in the production numbers, but we have not raised guidance on the Bakken until we get more data from the plug-and-perf wells. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah, I think the important thing here, Doug, and obviously you're onto something, which is with the improved completion techniques, we're doing a study to really optimize our investment in the Bakken going forward and we'll be ready to share the results of that study between now and the end of the year where we hopefully can give more specificity and clarity on to what our future production rates might be in the Bakken. So let's get a couple more wells under our belt, and as we do, incorporate that into our investment program, and then the output of that program, obviously focused on returns as Greg was saying, I think we'll be able to provide more clarity on the question you're asking by the end of the year. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for your patience, guys. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I had first a follow up on Guyana as it relates to the addition of the third drillship later this year. I was just hoping to better understand the CapEx impact of that. Now, I noticed that overall, CapEx guidance for the year is unchanged, so are there some offsetting efficiencies you're seeing elsewhere in the business that are allowing you to keep CapEx flat with that addition of the drillship? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes. I mean, if you look where our run rate is right now, so for the first half of the year we came in at $909 million on our capital spend. And the reason is we'd look at that and say why isn't the guidance coming down, but it's because of these type of things that you mention. So, what do we have in the second half of the year? So Guyana, we do have the third drillship, as you mentioned, coming in, it's going to come in the fourth quarter, so that will be an impact. What we also have is a little more Phase 2 spend as we're again coming up on sanction than we had in the first half of the year, so we'll have Phase 1 in Guyana 1 and more Phase 2 spend in the second half of the year. And then the other component that we have that is going to raise capital in the second half of the year is the Bakken, right? So we have the fifth rig coming in now and the sixth rig coming in later in the year. And yes, so far, our efficiencies have been good with our program. But as we see it right now, we're reaffirming that guidance to $2.1 billion. Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. That's helpful color. And then thinking just longer term on the overall cash flow profile of the company, you've talked about being cash flow positive post-2020. And I believe since then there's been upside to the Guyana resource estimate as well as potential for additional phases of development. Can you just talk about the latest thoughts there on cash generation post-2020 and also the ability to fund within cash flow these incremental developments at Guyana longer term? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. The best thing that we can do for our portfolio and matching up with our strategy on generating free cash flow at a $50 environment is to add more oil resources in Guyana. It's just a fantastic asset. Obviously, you've heard all the attributes on it. But combined with the great reservoir characteristic, it just gives superior financial returns and has a very low breakeven price, as we talked about, at $35. So what happens is that you add Phase 4, Phase 5, what we've done for the portfolio is it continues to lower our breakeven price as we go forward and can generate more cash flow in a low price environment or in a higher price environment. Now, just to get to your specific question on timing on free cash flow, let me tell you what we know right now and as Greg mentioned earlier what we really don't have good information on. So starting with Phase 1, obviously we've got really good information on that, what the capital, what the timing is. Phase 2 feed is progressing rapidly, we expect to sanction that before the end of the year and achieve first oil by mid-2022. So we have good information on that. Phase 3 has now been sized, expected to be sanctioned during 2019, so we have a decent estimate on that. So with those three FPSOs in place, we do see that we can generate free cash flow at $50 post 2020 with those three FPSOs. Now, Phases 4 and 5 still require, Greg mentioned it, we've got additional exploration appraisal drilling in order to size the projects and optimize the development plans. So at this point, I really do not have a good estimate as to timing how much of that capital could be in 2021 and what exactly the amount will be for future phases. It will be further out in the future. But what we can say about this funding is the way we pre-position the portfolio with our asset sales that the funding is very manageable and that Guyana itself is expected to become free cash flow positive really once Phase 2 starts producing. So that, as I mentioned, will be in 2022. So again, for us, Guyana, it fits right in our strategy, driving our cost down and driving our breakeven for the portfolio so that we can really drive production growth and free cash flow. Devin J. McDermott - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Excellent. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Arun, if your line is on mute, can you please unmute. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah, the first question is for Greg. Greg, as you test the plug-and-perf completions in the Bakken, can you remind us of how you're doing the well spacing within the Middle Bakken and the Three Forks for the plug-and-perf because I believe under sliding sleeve, you're doing eight wells or nine wells in the Middle Bakken per DSU, and maybe seven or eight in the Three Forks. I just wanted to see if you could give us a sense of what the spacing will look like for plug-and-perf? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Again, it's early days. So what we're doing now is we are using the same well spacing that we're using with sliding sleeve because we want to compare the two. So, we want to have a valid comparison by keeping the well spacing the same. Now as we mentioned as part of the Bakken study, we're going to take our data, relevant industry data and one of the outputs of the Bakken study will help us confirm the appropriate well spacing, completion type and proppant loading for each area of the basin. So, that's ultimately what we're trying to determine. And then the penultimate question is, what's the way to maximize value from those DSUs in the Bakken? So that's what we're aiming for with the Bakken study and through our own experimentation. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And just can you remind us what the current spacing is under sliding sleeve, just to get the baseline? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. It's on the nine and eight, nine and eight configuration. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Nine and eight, okay. Okay. Great. And Greg, just in terms of the 3Q Bakken guide of 115,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, you did 114,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day this quarter with some weather impacts. Do you view that guidance conservative? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, I think we're back on track in the third quarter. So we're right within our guidance range on the third quarter, recovering from the weather impacts that hit us in very late June. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got you. Got you. And my final question is just on Guyana, you have a gross 4 billion barrel kind of resource range. Can you help us think about potentially now five phases of the project? How much resource do you expect to recover in five of those potential distinct phases? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: I think the recoverable resource on the block again is 4 billion barrels. I think those last two phases as I said before are very much in the scoping phase as to where that \u2013 where those vessels could lie, are they going to be in Ranger or are they going to be in Turbot, kind of complex where are they. So there's still a lot of uncertainty in that. But clearly, we've got a lot of oil to recover here; extremely high value. We're going to do that as judiciously as possible. So this is all good news. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Sankey with Mizuho. Your line is now open. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Thanks, everyone. I wanted to ask about the free cash flow inflection, but you've clearly answered that. I guess one follow up would be, given this is so transformative for you in Guyana, the hedging, how do we think about that? And also I guess buyback given that you're currently buying back stock, is that really something that you'll be doing when you have these big asset sales, I assume? And then the final thing again thinking transformatively is dividend policy? Thank you. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. So, let me get the dividend policy and the buyback. So let me just start where we are with that right now. I think as you know, we've got $500 million left under our share repurchase program right now, and we expect to complete that by the end of the year, and we're targeting $250 million in the third and $250 million in the fourth. And so, as we look at it, we've got drilling coming here in the third quarter, we got an exciting well in Suriname, another well as Greg mentioned, Hammer on what our investment plans are going forward. So, it's a little early right now, we'll get to the end of the year, we'll see where prices are and at that point in time, we'll look where we are and see if there's anything from a buyback or debt reduction as we look into the future. Was there, I forgot, Paul, did you have another? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Hedging. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Hedging, sorry. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Yeah. I started with hedging, but you sort of headed towards dividend. Go ahead, sorry. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes. So from a hedging standpoint as I mentioned we did add 35,000 barrels a day for 2019 and you can expect us to add a bit more for 2019. Why again, it's we're still in the investment phase, Guyana production hasn't started up in 2020. So again from our standpoint, we just think it's prudent to put some insurance on in 2020. Obviously when we get to the free cash flow phases of Guyana then we're in a different position and hedging may be less as we move forward, and that's when we're generating the growth and free cash flow is when we'd start looking at our dividend policy as well and potentially increasing it at that time. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Great. Thank you. And then the follow-up would be, you talk about a $35 breakeven for Guyana, many of us on the call are oil finance nerds. Could you talk about the assumptions that you make to get that breakeven? Thank you. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. It's not \u2013 you don't have to do really that much from an assumption standpoint. So the contract is out there and it's public. It's there. We can't from a confidential standpoint talk about it, but it's public, so you can look at the contract. And the unique difference from a Guyana versus just \u2013 let's just call it a U.S. on a tax and royalty system is the production sharing contract impact. So, even if we're in a great point in the cycle and you have low cost from that, so you can get low F&D in the Gulf of Mexico. But what happens is if prices are lower, then obviously your breakeven is affected because you're not being able to get additional barrels out of the ground. With a production sharing contract what works with that is your cost recovery gets affected by the price. So, as prices go lower, you get more cost recovery to help with that and that's the way the point of a production sharing contract. So, it's really the mixture of \u2013 the mixture of the reservoirs, how good they are, the low point in the cycle, the F&D costs associated with it and the production sharing contract that gets you to that $35. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : That's great. I appreciate your answers. Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: You've undergone a significant restructuring here in preparation for the Guyana development and production, selling the non-core assets, repurchasing shares. I wonder if you consider yourself towards the final innings of that restructuring with a $0.5 billion of share repurchase left and the Utica assets to close in the third quarter, or do you see any more to come on the asset shifting side of the equation? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. The portfolio reshaping, I'd say the majority of the work's been done. There are one or two assets that still if we got full value for them, we would consider monetizing; if not, we're happy to have them in the portfolio because they're good cash generators. Having said that, I think the key point going forward is as both John and Greg have said; Guyana is really a truly world-class investment opportunity. One of the best if not the best in the industry with low breakeven oil prices and high financial returns across the industry, it's one of the best. So our first, second and third priority is to fund that, maintain a strong balance sheet, investment grade credit rating to ensure we have the capacity to do that. As we get further definition regarding our future capital requirements for the third phase of development and then potentially a fourth phase and fifth phase as well as the outlook for oil prices, then we're in a better position to give consideration to further returns of capital. But right now, we're focused on execution, finalizing the share repurchase program that we have and bringing more clarity both to our Bakken growth plan and our Guyana growth plan. So that's where we are, but we love the position we're in. And obviously, I think we're going to be in a position to generate superior financial returns and cash flow generation for many years to come as Guyana comes to fruition and our Bakken plan does as well. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up is with regards to that third drillship specifically from an exploration perspective, it sounded like there are some priorities for appraisal at Ranger and elsewhere, but can you speak more to the when and potentially where we would see exploration within the Stabroek Block? And maybe relatedly, can you talk about the extent to which the Ranger and Liza discoveries have de-risked the portion within Stabroek in between the two discoveries, the acreage in between and the plan for exploration there? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. The third ship is going to \u2013 as we understand from the operator now we're working with the operator, going to be focused on bringing further definition to the greater Turbot area with the success that we had at Longtail. To your point, this area is starting to be de-risked, we see some other prolific sand channels there and potential resource adds. So, that's what the third ship is going to try to appraise. The other exploration ship as Greg said goes to Hammerhead first, in the coming days that should be spud, then after that we'll go to further appraised Ranger, maybe one or two wells, we'll see where that goes. And yes, obviously, as we get definition in each of those campaigns and we get further seismic work correlating the well results with the seismic, we definitely see numerous more prospects on the block. I think Exxon said and we would agree, there are probably another 20 exploration prospects on the block to drill and yes we do see the Stabroek Block being further de-risked as we have more success remember, we're 8 out of 10. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from all Paul Cheng with Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey guys. Good morning. A number of questions ... John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good morning. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: ... first is for Rielly. On the hedges for 2019, do you have an estimate what is the amortization cost? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. The cost of the 35,000 barrels a day was approximately $50 million. So, it would be.... Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: For the full year? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: ... amortized over for the full \u2013 for the full year. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And that's after tax? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And John when \u2013 previously I thought the 2018 hedges you already closed out or that you already have to offset things so that I thought the amortization charges should be stay constant, why is edging up over the last several quarter? I mean initially you're talking about $30 million a quarter and then $40 million, now they're talking about $45 million. Any particular reason or, now it is $50 million, why there has been hedging up? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. There's two reasons, one that the jump from the $30 million to $45 million was due \u2013 you remember, we did have a collar in place with the $50 WTI options at $65 and we bought back that collar and obviously we're benefiting from the higher prices right now from that purchase. So, that increase from $30 million basically to $45 million. The only difference between the $45 million and $50 million is due to accounting. You have mark-to-market on the way these hedges, you get this ineffectiveness. So we've got this additional amount that sits in other comprehensive income that's going to be amortized for the remaining part of the year, so nothing except accounting associated with that. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. On the Phase 2 Guyana \u2013 on the development, should we assume that the unit cost is going to be about the same as Phase 1 or that because it's a new drillship, so that is going to be higher? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: So we are still, we're progressing feed right now and getting all of that information. So I'd prefer, Paul, we're going to be at the end of the year that we can be a little bit more specific on it. But obviously what I would tell you, this is still going to be a terrific investment there. But right now we're still working with the operator on exactly what the costs will be. We're working through the feed and we'll update you at the end of the year. And... (56:01) John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: What I will say, Paul, what I will say is that based on what we know so far that the costs are coming in lower on Phase 2 than they did for Phase 1 for most of the service line. So obviously that bodes well for Phase 2. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And Greg, should we assume 220,000, that given that size (56:21), that would be a new drillship, right? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yes, that will be a new build. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Because that Phase 3, on the other hand, will be potentially refurbished. If you only go for 180,000, is that the way how we should look at it? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yet to be determined, but I think it will be no matter what it is, it's going to be consistent with this design one, build many, very efficient kind of strategy where the only thing that flexes is the topsides, those will be modular based on the specific attributes of the development. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And can you give us some rough idea of what's the different cost between the refurbished and a new drillship, is that about $1 billion difference? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Paul, I don't have that information in front of me. What we're doing right now is just working with the operator. Obviously ExxonMobil has been doing a terrific job on that. We could refer that type of question to them, but we'll be again trying to maximize value on this is as we move from Phase 3. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I think the key point here, Paul, is we're finalizing our costs. The operator is doing a great job getting those numbers to be as cost efficient as possible. When we sanction the second FPSO, you'll have the number, and that will be before the end of the year, and then you'll be able to compare as other investors will with our Phase 1 ship as well. So, once we finalize the sanction numbers, we'll give them to you, and then you'll be able to compare that with the first ship that we already have contracted. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And John and Greg, (57:59), now that you no longer put it up for sale, how should we look at that asset, that I think before you put it up for sale, at one point you were thinking about spending some money to gradually expand the production. So, now that you are no longer selling it, should we just assume you're going to maintain it as flat or allow you to decline over time or you're trying to grow it a little bit over time, so how should we think of it? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Paul, South Arne is a very good cash generating asset. Obviously, Brent based pricing generates good cash flows, and it has upside potential both in terms of optimizing the field and further production with some investment, and also some nearby exploration that we could tie in. So, we're coming up with our plans now to have an investment program there. It will have to compete for capital in the rest of the portfolio. But having said that, as we get further definition on what our investment program there, which we think will be very manageable, we'll be happy to communicate that to you. And we're going to retain the asset. We're happy to do it. It's all about value. And in the normal course of business, we'll continue to evaluate options to maximize its value. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Sure. Hey, final one from me is probably for John Rielly, that if we're looking at your 2018 Midstream tariff, say call it $640 million, $650 million, that's roughly about $16 per barrel for the Bakken production. And that must be including some minimum volume. So as we looking out, when you get to 175,000 barrel per day, by 2021, what kind of unit tariff that we should be assuming? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So first, Paul, we do put in the supplement, you can see, how the Midstream tariff then gets calculated in coming back to Hess net barrels, because the first thing, when you calculate it on those numbers, you're getting kind on a tariff applied to a net number, which is really applied to gross volumes and also includes third-party numbers. So if you look at the supplement which we do, we'll put that in place after the call here, you'll see for us it's about $8.70 on a gross basis for our barrels. And then, we have 50% of that. So it's sitting in that kind of $4.00, $4.60 type range net to Hess. Then as we see going forward, when the volumes do increase from the Bakken, you will get \u2013 it is factored in, the growth is factored in the way we calculate the tariffs \u2013 but over time obviously, you'll get the efficiency of scale impact to those tariffs. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Now do you have a number you can share by 2021? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: No. So, I mean, again, we've talked about the Bakken study, what we're doing now, that all has to be integrated into our infrastructure plans and that will work into the tariffs. So that's all part of the Bakken study to maximize value. Paul Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advocators (sic) [Advisors]. Your line is now open. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Yeah, no problem. So, most of mine have been answered at this point. I'm just curious, on the Bakken, earlier in the year you had talked about a 4Q rate of around 120 to 125 mboe a day. Is that still in the cards? Is that something we should still be modeling towards? It sounded like maybe sub 120 per the comments, but I didn't know if that was just kind of rounding, for a lack of a better word? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: So I just want to make sure what you're asking, Michael. So on the Bakken volumes that we're talking about as we were getting to the end of the year? Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Yeah, I think it was about two calls ago or something, you talked about 120 to 125. Is that still fair? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, you can still expect us to be at 120,000 barrels plus in the fourth quarter... Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: ...in the Bakken. In fact if you just look at our guidance and the way we have the 115,000 to 120,000 barrels in the third and then going 115,000 to 120,000 barrels for the full year, you'll see we are still planning to be above 120,000 barrels. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Got it. Yeah, I didn't know if that comment on the full year meant the rest of the year or \u2013 sorry, I was just trying to clarify. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, no. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : That's helpful. Okay. And then the remaining wells to be turned online in the Williston this year, are those relatively evenly loaded across the year or is there any emphasis in 3Q or 4Q just from a timing standpoint? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: More of them will be in the fourth quarter because what happens now is we get the fifth rig coming in, really any wells that are drilled by the fifth rig, that won't impact the third quarter. That's why we'll get more wells online in the fourth quarter and the production going up from there. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yeah. The fourth quarter is going to be a very big quarter in terms of wells online. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. And then the last one, I guess, just on the Williston again and can you just quantify how much the weather impacted 2Q in June? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: It was a couple thousand because we were, as Greg said, we were right on track April, May, it was June and the weather \u2013 and that month was affected. So overall for the quarter it was a couple thousand barrels. And right now we are right back on track where we were before. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Great. That's it. Thanks very much. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Phillips Johnston with Capital One. Your line is now open. Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Hey guys, thanks. Greg, just to follow up on the prior questions about Keene, as we look out to 2019 with the rig count entering the year at six versus four in the first half of this year, from a directional standpoint should we expect activity will be less focused on the Keene area with the mix maybe dropping down to closer to a third of completions versus close to half this year, or would you expect to keep the Keene mix closer to 50%? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. I think the Keene percentage will go down, but obviously in our 2019 budget we'll update the guidance because we will be most likely in a 100% plug-and-perf mode by then. So all the IP180s and everything will have to be updated as we do our planning guidance for 2019. Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Okay. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: But, yes, there will be fewer Keene wells next year than this year. Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Okay. And can you quantify... Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: But that doesn't mean IP180s average for the year will be less. With plug-and-perf, there would be upward pressure on IP180s in a plug-and-perf situation. But we'll update all that when we give guidance next year. Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Okay. And you've quantified how many remaining locations there are at Keene or is that something that will come out after the study? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: That's something that will come out after the study as well. Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just a question maybe for John Rielly. You guys have reported working capital cash outflows for the past six quarters that have amounted to roughly $1 billion or so. What have been the primary factors there? And when would you expect that trend to sort of reverse? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. So first of all, we did have the hedging, right? So we'd kind of gone through with our hedges. Now we will have, as I mentioned earlier, we have $50 million on our 35,000 barrels a day in 2019. So that will come in the third quarter. So our hedging do go through there. Some of the things that were basically impacting us besides the hedges of premiums paid is we do have \u2013 you've got your normal things like pension contributions, you've got \u2013 we had abandonment. If you're going back several quarters in when we had Valhall, those were always significant amounts. We've got timing on income tax payments related to Libya, in the 93.5% tax rate. So those will always continue. And what I would say is on a normal run rate basis, our first quarter and our third quarter were going to be the higher pulls on working capital. So you have \u2013 because one, we \u2013 that's the semi-annual payments on our bonds happen in the first and third quarter. The first quarter always has your bonus payments in there as well. And then, outside of that, it's just normal recurring. So the only unusual things that we'll get in there is kind of from the hedging and things like that. So if you looked at this quarter, right, it wasn't much of a pull in cash flow and you can see it was an add in fixed assets. So we actually, on an overall basis, working capital had a positive on the bottom line from it. So things are going to move in and out just like that and first and third being bigger and second and the fourth not so much. Phillips Johnston - Capital One Securities, Inc.: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. I wanted to just ask Greg to kind of step back and give me an overview of all this plug-and-perf stuff. In the past, I thought you had said that you felt these were going to be best for maybe Tier 2 type resource, but it sounds like that it's, particularly based on what you just said about 2019, it sounds like this is moving towards becoming a primary way to complete the wells, so maybe I was confused. But, could you just talk about it kind of on a higher level? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. You bet. So I think you are correct. We always knew that as we went outside the core of the core that we would have to use plug-and-perf, so I think we've always said that. But what we are doing is part of the Bakken study, because some of our competitors are using plug-and-perf in the core of the core. We're trialing some of that as well. So again, our mission here is for the two-thirds of the inventory remaining in the Bakken, what is the best way to maximize value per DSU both in the core and outside the core. So we wanted to get some wells in the core as well to do a good comparison. So that's the ultimate, ultimate objective of the Bakken study. Now based on the results, so far, and again it's a limited sample but based on the results so far indicatively it looks like that even plug-and-perf in the core can give you an improvement. So, but, at the end of the day we're going to go area by area in the field and answer that question, what's the best way to maximize value per DSU. And that answer could vary depending on where you are on the field and the completion design could vary dependent on where you are in the field. Right now directionally we're just saying plug-and-perf looks pretty good, so from an assumption standpoint let's assume that we're going to do plug-and-perf throughout the field. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Well that's helpful and also I assume as you always say that case-by-case it's going to be economics, so if \u2013 if it were somehow possible that sliding sleeve would produce a better economic in.... Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: ....some place then you would use that. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Exactly. And I think what's happened with plug-and-perf, so there's been quite a change in plug-and-perf over the last couple of years which kind of changes how we think about it and that's the introduction and perfection of limited entry perforating. So, that allows you to tightly control where your proppant and fluids are going. And then secondly the cost of plug-and-perf have come down substantially during the downturn. So, that made plug-and-perf come more into queue on a comparison basis to sliding sleeve. And then finally we reached kind of the technical limit on sliding sleeve is about 60 stages is all you can really stuff in those. So, I can get more stages, have tight control and is a cost that's not that far off of plug-and-perf, or sliding sleeve. So, therefore it makes sense to evaluate that technology now. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: That was really helpful. I appreciate it. And I just wanted to ask quickly, you mentioned you're going to go to six Bakken rigs by the end of the year, and I think you said you've already added a third frac crew. I was just wondering, is this the activity level that you see maintaining going forward or are you still unsure until you complete the development study? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, I think directionally it looks like six rigs is about right, and that's a function of -- you don't want to build infrastructure too fast and overbuild and not be capital efficient. So six rigs at this point is still kind of the sweet spot. The third frac rig -- frac crew will be added in the latter part of the year. So we have not added that yet, but it's on its way. Jeffrey Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. Well, thanks for clarifying that. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, guys. Just one question for me, kind of a high level point about Guyana. Given the new targets you're putting out for 2025, at least a third, possibly half of the company's net volumes will be coming from Guyana at that point. How comfortable are you just kind of conceptually with that level of asset concentration, and to state the obvious, what's historically been somewhat of a frontier market? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: We're very happy to have one of the truly world-class investment opportunities in the oil industry that keeps getting bigger and better. We believe that our 30% working interest is appropriate for this world-class asset. We have a world-class operator in ExxonMobil, and so we're happy to have this opportunity to invest shareholder money which has a very high financial return. So net-net we are happy with it and you got to remember, it's part of our portfolio, we also have the Bakken, we also have the Deepwater Gulf and also Malaysia. So the combination of that portfolio I think manages and is really managing not only the risk of the different investments but the financial performance of those. So we think our focused portfolio with that balance and that's the key makes Guyana standout and be positioned the best way that it can be for our shareholders. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, clear enough, appreciate it. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2018 Hess Corporation Conference Call. My name is Gigi and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay R. Wilson - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Now, as usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will provide a strategy update, Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results. We delivered another strong quarter of execution with higher production and guidance and lower unit costs and guidance while keeping capital and exploratory expenditures flat with guidance for the year and generating a profit for the quarter. We continue to execute our strategy to deliver capital-efficient growth in our resources and production, investing in the highest return projects to move down the cost curve and be profitable in a lower price environment, with increasing cash generation and returns to shareholders. Fundamental to this strategy is our focused high-return portfolio with Guyana and the Bakken as our growth engines where we plan to invest about 75% of our capital and exploratory expenditures over the next five years, and Malaysia and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as our cash engines. Pro forma for our asset sales, our high-graded portfolio is on track to deliver capital-efficient compound annual production growth of approximately 10% through 2023 while driving cash unit costs down approximately 30% to less than $10 per BOE over the same period. The combination of growth and margin expansion is expected to drive compound annual cash flow growth of approximately 25% through 2023 at a $60 per barrel Brent oil price. An integral part of our strategy is maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position to ensure we have the financial capacity to fund our world-class investment opportunity in Guyana and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our position in Guyana is truly world-class in every respect and transformational for our company. As of June, gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator have grown and are estimated to be more than 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent with multi-billion barrels of additional exploration potential. In late August, we announced a ninth oil discovery on the block at the Hammerhead-1 well located approximately 13 miles southwest of the Liza-1 well, proving a new play concept for potential development. This month, a second exploration vessel, the Noble Tom Madden, arrived to accelerate exploration and appraisal activities on the block, starting with the Pluma prospect located 17 miles south of Turbot where we expect to spud in early November. The Liza Phase 1 development which was sanctioned in June of last year is well-advanced with first production of gross 120,000 barrels of oil per day expected by early 2020. Phase 2 development with gross production of 220,000 barrels of oil per day is on track for startup by mid-2022. A third phase of development at the Payara Field is expected to have a gross production capacity of approximately 180,000 barrels of oil per day with first production in 2023. We now see the potential to produce on a gross basis more than 750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025 with industry-leading returns and cost metrics. Also key to our strategy is the Bakken where we have a premier acreage position and a robust inventory of high-return drilling locations with a significant infrastructure advantage. During the quarter we continued testing limited entry plug-and-perf completions and higher proppant loadings, and initial results are encouraging. In September we added a sixth rig and we expect to generate capital-efficient production growth of 15% to 20% per year through 2021 along with a meaningful increase in free cash flow generation over this period. Now, turning to our financial results. In the third quarter we had net income of $52 million or $0.14 per share compared to a net loss of $624 million or $2.02 per share in the year ago quarter. On an adjusted basis, net income was $123 million or $0.38 per common share compared with an adjusted net loss of $324 million or $1.07 per common share in the third quarter of 2017. Compared to 2017, our improved third quarter financial results primarily reflect higher realized crude oil selling prices combined with lower operating costs and DD&A expense. We had a strong operating performance across our portfolio. Third quarter production was above the high end of our guidance range, averaging 279,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Net production from Libya was 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. For full year 2018, we expect production to average approximately 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, at the top end of our previous guidance of 245,000 to 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the fourth quarter, production is expected to average approximately 265,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Third quarter net production in the Bakken averaged 118,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to 103,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter. For the full year 2018, we continue to forecast that Bakken net production will average between 115,000 and 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In summary, our reshaped portfolio is positioned to deliver a decade plus of capital efficient production growth with increasing cash generation and returns to shareholders. We look forward to providing a further update at our upcoming Investor Day on Wednesday, December 12 in Houston. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update of our operational performance for the quarter as we continue to execute our strategy. In the third quarter, company-wide production averaged 279,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This was nearly 10% above the midpoint of our guidance range of 250,000 to 260,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the quarter and reflects strong performance across our portfolio. In the Bakken, production averaged 118,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, in line with our guidance for the quarter, and we drilled 34 wells and brought 29 new wells online. Consistent with previous guidance, we added a sixth Bakken rig and a third frac spread in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast Bakken net production will increase to approximately 125,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day; and we expect to drill approximately 35 wells and bring 31 wells online, bringing the total for full year 2018 to 120 wells drilled and 100 new wells brought online. Average IP 180 for the year, which will be dominated by our 60-stage sliding sleeve completion design, is expected to exceed 125,000 barrels of oil, an increase of approximately 15% from full year 2017. We are also seeing encouraging results from our transition to limited entry plug-and-perf completions. Of the 100 gross operated wells we now expect to bring online this year, approximately 30 are planned to be plug-and-perf. We'll provide further details regarding these new high-intensity completions at our Investor Day in December. On August 31 we closed on the sale of our JV interests in the Utica shale play to Ascent Resources for approximately $400 million. As a result of the sale, fourth quarter net production will be reduced by approximately 10,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day relative to the third quarter. Turning to the Gulf of Mexico. Net production came in well above guidance at 71,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting the return of production from the Conger Field in July, minimal weather-related downtime, and strong operating performance across all assets. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance to approximately 55,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the fourth quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico production to average approximately 65,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day which includes 6,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day of planned downtime primarily associated with an inspection of one of the risers at the Conger Field. Now moving to the Gulf of Thailand. Production from our Asian assets averaged 68,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day during the third quarter. At the joint development area in which Hess has a 50% interest, production averaged 37,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. Production is forecast to average approximately 36,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over the full year 2018. At the North Malay Basin, where Hess holds a 50% interest and is operator, production averaged 31,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter which came in higher than expected due to a one-time rebalancing of entitlement volumes. Production is forecast to average approximately 26,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018. Company-wide, we forecast fourth quarter production to be approximately 265,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Strong year-to-date performance across our portfolio enables us to raise our full year guidance to approximately 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day which is at the upper end of our previous guidance range of 245,000 to 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day despite the loss of volumes associated with the sale of our Utica assets. Now turning to Exploration. In August we announced our ninth discovery, Hammerhead, on the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana in which Hess holds a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator. The well, which is located about 13 miles southwest of the Liza-1 discovery well, encountered 197 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing Miocene age sandstone reservoir, opening up a new play type. We recently completed a successful flow test and further appraisal activities are planned. The Stenna Carron rig will now go to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands in Spain for recertification and is expected to return to the block in late December when we plan to spud a well on the upper Cretaceous Amara prospect located 24 miles southeast of the Turbot discovery. A second exploration vessel, the Noble Tom Madden drillship, has arrived in theater and is scheduled to spud a well on the Pluma prospect in early November. The well location is approximately 16 miles south of Turbot and will also target upper Cretaceous reservoirs on trend with the Turbot and Longtail discoveries. In Suriname, Kosmos announced earlier this month that the Pontoenoe well on Block 42 in which Hess has a one-third interest failed to encounter commercial hydrocarbons and the well was expensed in the third quarter. The partners are studying the results of the well and will reprocess seismic to improve our understanding of the subsurface and regional geology. We continue to see multiple additional large prospects on the block which are independent from Pontoenoe and will be tested in 2020. In Canada, offshore Nova Scotia, BP continues drilling the Aspy play test well targeting a large subsalt structure analogous to those found in the Gulf of Mexico. Moving to Guyana developments, Liza Phase 1 sanctioned in June 2017 remains on track for first oil by 2020 with a nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. Liza Phase 2 is also on track for first oil by mid-2022 with a nameplate capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day. And finally, Phase 3 is currently in feed with first oil expected in 2023. The operator is focused on maximizing value through rapid, phased developments and accelerated exploration plans. In closing, we have once again demonstrated strong execution and delivery and we are well-positioned to deliver significant value to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today I will compare results from the third quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2018. For the third quarter of 2018 we had net income of $52 million compared with a net loss of $130 million in the second quarter of 2018. On an adjusted basis which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we had net income of $123 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared with a net loss of $56 million in the previous quarter. Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P net income was $203 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $21 million in the second quarter of 2018. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P earnings between the third quarter and second quarter of 2018 were as follows. Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $146 million. Higher realized selling prices increased earnings by $65 million. Lower cash costs increased earnings by $12 million. Higher DD&A expense reduced earnings by $39 million. Higher exploration expense reduced earnings by $13 million. All other items increased earnings by $11 million for an overall increase in third quarter earnings of $182 million. Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $30 million in both the third and second quarter of 2018. Midstream EBITDA before the non-controlling interest amounted to $130 million in the third quarter compared to $126 million in the previous quarter. For corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $122 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $191 million in the second quarter of 2018. After-tax adjusted corporate and interest expenses were $110 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $107 million in the previous quarter. Turning to our financial position. Excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.6 billion, total liquidity was $7 billion including available committed credit facilities, and debt was $5.7 billion at September 30, 2018. Cash flow from operations before working capital changes and items affecting comparability was $738 million in the third quarter while cash expenditures for capital and investments were $566 million in the quarter. Changes in working capital reduced cash flows from operating activities by $258 million in the third quarter, reflecting premiums paid of $105 million on WTI crude oil hedging contracts for calendar 2019 and a payment of $84 million related to previously accrued legal claims associated with our former downstream interest. For calendar 2019, we have purchased WTI put options with a notional amount of 95,000 barrels of oil per day that have a monthly floor price of $60 per barrel. In the third quarter we completed the sale of our joint venture interest in the Utica shale play for a net cash consideration of approximately $400 million. We also entered into a sale and leaseback agreement for a floating, storage and offloading vessel to handle produced condensate at our North Malay Basin project and received net proceeds of approximately $130 million. The gross lease obligation is reported as debt on our balance sheet and we will recover our partner share through future joint interest billings over the lease term. In the third quarter we purchased $250 million of common stock, bringing total share repurchases under our previously announced $1.5 billion stock repurchase program to $1.25 billion. We plan to purchase the remaining $250 million in the fourth quarter. Now turning to guidance. For E&P, in the third quarter our E&P cash costs were $11.41 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $11.87 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, which beat guidance on strong production and lower costs. On a pro forma basis, excluding Libya and Utica which was sold in August, cash costs in the third quarter were $12.20 per barrel of oil equivalent. We project cash costs for E&P operations, excluding Libya, in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $12.50 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent which includes planned maintenance costs at the Conger Field in the Gulf of Mexico. Full year 2018 cash costs are expected to be $12.50 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent which is down from previous guidance of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent. DD&A expense in the third quarter was $16.14 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $17.03 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, which was below guidance. On a pro forma basis, excluding Libya and Utica, unit DD&A rates in the third quarter were $17.68 per barrel of oil equivalent. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $18 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter of 2018, and full year DD&A expense is projected to be $17 to $18 per barrel of oil equivalent which is down from previous guidance of $18 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, of $30.50 to $32.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and $29.50 to $31.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2018. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million in the fourth quarter with full year guidance expected to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million which is in the lower end of our previous guidance. The midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $170 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $655 million for the full year of 2018 which is up from previous guidance of approximately $635 million to $650 million. The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be a benefit in the range of 0% to 4% for the fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate is expected to be a benefit in the range of 7% to 11% which is updated from the previous guidance of a benefit in the range of 16% to 20%. For full year 2018, our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures guidance remains unchanged at $2.1 billion. Our 2018 crude oil hedge positions remain unchanged. We have $50 WTI put option contracts on a notional 115,000 barrels per day for the remainder of the year. We expect amortization of the premiums on these hedge contracts will reduce our financial results by approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter. For calendar 2019, we have purchased $60 WTI put option contracts with a notional amount of 95,000 barrels of oil per day for $116 million. We expect amortization of the calendar 2019 option premiums will reduce our financial results by approximately $29 million per quarter in 2019. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter with the full year guidance of approximately $115 million remaining unchanged. For corporate, for the fourth quarter of 2018 corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million and for the full year guidance to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million which is in the lower end of our previous guidance. Interest expenses are estimated to be approximately $85 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $340 million for the full year of 2018 which is also at the low end of our previous guidance. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Bob Morris from Citigroup. Your line is now open. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Nice quarter, John. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Thank you. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Greg, on the Bakken you've got 35 wells still to drill here in the fourth quarter. Looks like you've added five plug-and-perf wells in the slate. Where are those wells spread out between the four different areas in Q4 and where are you primarily drilling the plug-and-perf wells between Keene, Stony Creek, East Nesson, and Capa? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, they're actually spread out in a number of areas across the field. I don't have the actual well numbers in front of me but it's really spread out over our whole position. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. I didn't know if there was one area that sort of was left for the year end. So in the... Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: ...sixth rig that you just added, where was that put? What area? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: That was put in the core. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: In Keene or Stony Creek? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, it was put in East Nesson. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: East Nesson? Okay. And then I was going to ask about the continued outperformance at Stony Creek and Keene but I guess you'll give us an update on all that here in December. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: I will absolutely at Investor Day. Robert Scott Morris - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. That's all I had for now. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Morning. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I wonder if I could hit a couple of questions on exploration in Guyana to start off. Greg, I realize that Guyana is probably going to be a focus on December 12, but I just wonder if you could touch on the visibility you have today. I want to reflect on comments you made back in August about potentially fast-tracking Hammerhead. That's not in the 750,000 barrels a day or the more than 750,000 barrels a day as I understand it. And similarly, the latest thoughts on the scale of Payara/Liza-3, and I've got a follow-up, please. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Okay, Doug. Well, first of all, Hammerhead, we just completed it at DST. Couple comments on Hammerhead to start. This is a massive accumulation. A very thick sand package. In fact, it's the thickest single sand package that we drilled on the block. It's a very large structure so it's going to require some additional appraisal. What we can say is that the results of the DST were good, meaning that the reservoir quality is excellent and the reservoir seems to be well-connected. You're right to say that Hammerhead's accretive to the 4 billion barrels and it could jump the queue in terms of being ahead of some of the other phases that were on the Turbot cluster, but it's too early to say that because we need some additional appraisal before we make that final decision. But, again, it is accretive to the 4 billion barrels. On the Payara cluster, as you mentioned, we're in feed. Right now, the vessel is sized at 180,000 barrels a day but that's still under discussion and will be part of the final project sanction towards the end of 2018. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you for that, Greg. And my follow-up on Guyana, if I may, is the exploration program. You mentioned the Amara prospect. I just want to be clear. Did that have another name? Was that Escolar (00:29:30) or is that something different? And if you could just give us an idea of where Ranger now fits in the queue because my understanding was (29:39) was going to go back to a Ranger appraisal at some point. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Yeah, Doug, you have a great memory. Amara is actually Escolar (00:29:48) or used to be called Escolar (00:29:49). Regarding the sequence of exploration and appraisal next year, that's still under discussion with the operator. We'll let you know once we get our budget finalized in 2019, but Ranger will be one of the things in the queue in 2019 obviously. But we've got some Hammerhead appraisal we want to do; there's some more work that we want to do in the Turbot area, so all that sequence is still being worked out. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Last one for me if I may, guys, is for the two Johns. And John Hess, I realize you've made your thoughts on share buybacks quite clear, but I guess I'm looking at the strength of the cash flow this quarter, the underlying cash flow. The demonstrable part of the portfolio obviously in this environment is pretty punchy. What is the right level of cash to carry on the balance sheet? And what's at the back of my mind really is you've got your preference issue maturing next year. I'm just wondering if there's a potential offsetting buyback that could dilute that or offset that dilution we're going to see next year, and I'll leave it there. Thanks. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. Doug, as you know, we are currently purchasing our stock under our current program. We constantly assess our allocation of capital. And as you know, we have been a leader among our peers in return of capital so we will continue to balance investing in our highest-return projects and returning capital to shareholders. That's our investment proposition and that's the path we've been following and we will continue to follow. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great stuff. Appreciate the answers, guys. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett from Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning. I understand you're probably not willing to talk too much about the 2019 program, but can you talk about the planning process and how you balance oil price uncertainty against the capital program and against building free cash flow? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure, Bob. So the first thing as you heard that we were looking at, we've always looked at 2019 again as with our bridge to Guyana coming in 2020 and we know we're investing in Phase 1 and now you know we're going to be also investing in Phase 2 and others, that the first thing we did, we put the 95,000 barrels a day of WTI put options in place. So watching oil volatility, we made sure we put a floor on that price for us for a good part of our production to ensure that we have that base cash flow. So we will, as you said, we'll be talking a lot more about this later on in our Investor Day. But while our budgeting process is underway, we're really excited about our capital and exploratory expenditure program through 2025. We think it's distinctive kind of as John Hess talked about earlier, that it'll deliver capital-efficient production growth that generates significant free cash flow over the period. So just to be high level, talking about the activity levels that Greg was discussing, our 2019 budget will be closer to $3 billion. But it's important to note that all that incremental spend between 2018 and 2019 will be targeted, in our view, to the highest-return investments in the E&P business, and that's our Bakken and Guyana assets. And then just going longer-term, and again we'll give more detail on this, but maintaining our disciplined capital allocation, we currently expect capital and exploratory expenditures to average approximately $3 billion per year through 2025 and the portfolio to be cash-generative post-2020. And I would tell you, for now what we're looking at from a planning assumption case is using a $60 WTI and a $65 Brent. But, again, we'll provide more information later on in our Investor Day in December but, again, really excited about that. Just specifically because Greg had mentioned it, what's going on in the Bakken, it's basically that incremental spend is almost half and half between the Bakken and Guyana. So in the Bakken we're going to be operating six rigs, that's 30% higher rig count than 2018, and right now probably approximately 50% more wells online in 2019 than 2018. So the vast majority also of those wells in 2019 are expected to be the higher-intensity plug-and-perf completions which currently carry an incremental cost of about $1.5 million per well versus our previous sliding sleeve design. But these wells are expected to deliver increases in both IP, rates, and more significantly in NPV. So it'll result in our Bakken production exceeding our previous guidance of 175,000 barrels per day by 2021. Then in Guyana, we have the peak spend on Phase 1 in 2019. From our previous sanctioned release in 2019, it was about an $80 million increase in 2019 for Phase 1. And now you're going to see the commencement of spending for Phase 2. And remember, Phase 1, the initial year was $110 million so Phase 2 is obviously bigger than Phase 1, so you're going to see a little more spending for that. As well now feed costs for FPSOs 3 and 4 most likely and we are bringing the additional drill ship in, the Noble Tom Madden for next year. So that's kind of just high level. We'll go into more detail on it. But, again, from our overall program we're going to be generating significant free cash flow over the period because of these investments in Bakken and Guyana. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great, appreciate the color. A quick follow-up. Adding that second exploration rig to Guyana, can you talk about how many wells you can get down in 2019 and how you'd split those across exploration of brand new concepts, exploration across the proven concepts, and then kind of appraisal/development? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Well, Bob, obviously it depends on what we find as we continue to explore the block. Again, that whole sequence hasn't been lined out yet with the operator but we know that we want to do some more appraisal in Hammerhead, so there will be some more there. We know we've got some more exploration/appraisal around Turbot. We know that we've got appraisal at Ranger. We know that we're going to drill this Hamira (00:36:28) well which could lead to more appraisal. And in addition to that, we have 20 additional prospects and leads that we'd like to drill on the block. So it's going to be a mix of exploration and appraisal and it really depends upon what we find as to how much appraisal we need. So we'll give you more color when we do our budget for 2019. Robert Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Morning. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: As we try to figure out the cash flow piece of the equation for next year, and we look specifically at the Gulf of Mexico where there was a nice step-up in production and it seems like maybe you're free and clear of some of the issues over the last year and a half, is 70,000 barrels a day or BOE a day the new normal when there's no downtime and how do you think about a more sustainable run rate of production and then the CapEx required to keep it there? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: So what we've always said in the Gulf of Mexico is that kind of 65,000 barrels a day is a level of production that we can maintain here for several years because of the tieback opportunities that we have. So in 2019 we do have two rigs contracted, right, so we'll be completing the drilling and stampede with those two rigs. And then we talked about between signs of kind of like $100 million and $150 million that we spend every year just to do some tieback opportunities and hold that Gulf of Mexico production right around 65,000 barrels per day. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it, thank you. And then shifting to the Bakken, and I guess obviously we'll get more details shortly here in December, but to follow-up on the points you just made on the closer to $3 billion in 2019 CapEx overall, can you talk more on the Bakken specifically in terms of rig adds and then also expectations for well productivity/intensity and then also takeaway? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: Okay. Let me let me take the first two and then John can talk about the takeaway. Certainly, our plan for next year is to hold six rigs flat. So we added that sixth rig in the third quarter and our plan is just to hold the rig count at six. As I mentioned, we're transitioning to a plug-and-perf completion, so that'll be a 10 million pound per well proppant loading that was confirmed as the optimum in the Bakken study. Just a few words about the Bakken study. Remember, that was an independent third party look that examined over 10,000 wells, both ours and our competitors, and the study confirmed a couple things. First of all, it confirmed that our use of sliding sleeves and tight spacing during the downturn maximized DSU NPV which has always been our objective, and then secondly that the transition to plug-and-perf in 2018 as a result of improving technology and lower costs in that space is the right strategy to deliver more value going forward. And as John Rielly mentioned previously, the cost of those wells currently right now is running about $7.5 million per well, so about $1.5 million above the sliding sleeve completion. However, just as we did with the sliding sleeves, we begin to apply lean manufacturing to that process and we're reasonably confident that we can bring those well costs down over time as we apply lean manufacturing. But we will transition to that design over the remainder of 2018 and into 2019 on plug-and-perf. And, again, we'll give more color on that in our Investor Day in December. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. And, Brian, fair question. In terms of takeaway, our company does not have an issue in terms of takeaway capacity from the Bakken because of the pre-investment we've done to have access to multiple export markets, and that flexibility really positions us well to maximize the value of our sales netbacks. The recent widening in the Clearbrook differential began with October trading and is primarily the result of unusually high Mid-Continent refinery maintenance, not a takeaway issue, where that maintenance shut in more than 1 million barrels per day of refinery capacity. We expect this refinery demand to return in December with differentials narrowing towards historical levels. And our strategy of having these multiple export markets to maximize the value of our sales netbacks, recently in June when Clearbrook was a premium, was about $1 over WTI, we were actually maxing sales into the Clearbrook market. And in the current market, we are currently delivering about 70% of our crude to export markets where we receive Brent-based pricing which is about $6 over WTI. And in terms of the future, we're well-positioned now but we will continue to look at potential pipeline expansions as they may occur and may add additional firm transportation in the future to further optimize our marketing efforts. Brian Singer - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall from Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Your line is now open. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Just curious on the comment on the Williston and the new plug-and-perf-focused program being able to deliver higher peak volumes relative to the prior 175 MBOE a day that you all had discussed. Any willingness to talk about what that new peak looks like and how long you can hold it? What sort of rig and annual completion cadence is required to do that? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, we will talk about that at our Investor Day in December. But you're right. The peak is going to go up. Our current plan on the Bakken which, again, we'll cover on Investor Day is to take it to that new peak level, drop the rigs to four, and then hold it at that new peak level for a number of years. And, yeah, at that point the Bakken becomes a massive cash generator for the company, so cash flow will be significantly up in the Bakken. So as John Rielly mentioned, post-2020 you really have all of our assets generating free cash, significant amounts of free cash flow. And then of course, in 2022 when Phase 2 comes on, then Guyana becomes a major cash flow-generating asset. So you'll have all four assets generating significant amounts of cash when Phase 2 comes on. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay, that's helpful. How about how long you can hold that peak? Any commentary there at this point? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: We'll, again, talk about that in December but it will be multiple years. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay. And then I guess maybe just on Suriname. Any additional color or commentary on what you guys have learned here post-mortem on the initial test? And it sounds like additional activity is not planned until 2020, but any spending that we should expect in 2019 as it relates to that asset? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: I think first of all, the Pontoenoe well encountered 63 meters of really high-quality reservoir. Unfortunately it was wet, but now we're taking all that data from the well and we're going to recalibrate the seismic, rerun all the seismic, and that'll help inform future exploration in Suriname. But despite the dry hole, we still believe the block has significant resource potential as there's multiple play types on the block. So as you mentioned, current thinking is we won't get back to drilling until 2020 on the block and give us a good amount of time to reprocess things and understand what we saw. Michael Anthony Hall - Heikkinen Energy Advisors LLC : Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Ajun (sic) [Arun] (00:45:43), your line is now open. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : John, appreciate your comments on the Bakken takeaway where I think you are better positioned than your peers given your 50,000 barrels per day or so on DAPL, et cetera, and I think you only sell about 20% in the local markets today. My question is as we think about the incremental barrel that you produce in the Bakken, in our model we have you going from the mid-70s in oil to the low 90s in oil. So for those incremental barrels, where would you be selling those? Would they be on rail, et cetera? So just trying to understand what kind of diffs you could see on the incremental barrels that you're producing next year. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Good question, Arun. Our plan would be to continue to access Brent-based pricing between pipeline deliveries to the Gulf Coast and also rail deliveries either to the Gulf Coast, East Coast or West Coast. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Got it. And that's based on rail capacity that you have today or one or...? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yes. Yeah, we're positioned for this now. And we'll also look at, as I said, potential pipeline expansions and may add additional firm transportation on those to ensure that we continue to optimize our differentials by getting access to offshore Brent-based pricing. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And I understand you guys are going to leave quite a bit for the Bakken for the December update. But the plan as I understand is to do about 50% more POPs are tied in line in the Bakken in 2019. Is that correct, like 150 wells or so? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes. Yes, you can make that assumption there with the six rigs at right around 150 and maybe a little bit more. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. And my final question is, John, you mentioned that CapEx could approach $3 billion or so in 2019. Is that just in the E&P level or does that include with the consolidation of the Midstream the Midstream piece of that as well? Or if you could separate the two, that would be helpful. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: That's the E&P portion and includes the spend for exploration as well. So that's just that E&P, yeah. Arun Jayaram - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays. Your line is now open. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Morning. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Two quick questions. John, on the well capacity, can you tell us how much you plan to ship from Bakken in the fourth quarter? And also, we've heard from people saying that the well operator that they are unwilling to increase the (00:48:35) unless you are willing to sign multiple year contract. Is that what you, guys, are seeing? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: In terms of takeaway capacity, right now, I mentioned it before, it's about 70% of our crude is going to export markets where we can receive Brent-based spot pricing, most of it on DAPL, out to Nederland, and then some to both the East Coast and West Coast via train. And in terms of going forward, there are multiple pipeline expansion opportunities. We're looking at them and the terms and conditions of those vary. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Can you share with us that? I mean, how much is the cost for you to move from Bakken to the East Coast if you're going to (00:49:25)? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Well, I tell you, what I would say is going down south to Nederland is about $7. And train's a little bit higher than that, West Coast being closer to that number, East Coast being a little higher. Paul Y. Cheng - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Read, Read, whatever it needs to be today I guess. Good morning, guys. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: How you doing? Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Doing all right, thanks. Just one thing I'd like to follow up on on the CapEx side, the move from kind of $2.1 billion, $2.2 billion this year to $3 billion overall. You mention kind of half between the Bakken and half between Guyana. Since we had obviously a little spending on Utica and maybe some other places this year, kind of what's the right increment? Is that to think about it as $900 million and $450 million, $450 million or it's a larger number as the starting point is slightly different? And then maybe other way to think about it is does exploration spending go up from here relative to what we've seen which I would think has to happen given a second rig in Guyana and then potential in 2020 to restart in Suriname? So maybe just a little clarity on that if you could. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Sure. So first, outside like you said Utica or assets like that, we were not spending much capital in 2018 on that. So the base that you should start with is the $2.1 billion because our capital guidance remains unchanged, and so then moving up, I'd say, going to that, closer to $3 billion. There's a little bit more going to Bakken than Guyana. And if you can just \u2013 I'll do some simple math for you. Bakken guidance was approximately $900 million for this year. We're about at 4.75 rigs and we're going to six rigs for the full year. On average we're 4.75 rigs. Just do the math on that, you'll get about $240 million just with everything being exactly the same. Then as Greg and I had mentioned, the current plug-and-perf wells are approximately $1.5 million higher. We're going to be drilling a lot more of them next year than we did this year. So just simply, if you took that 150 times $1.5 million, put our working interests around 80% or so in it, you can kind of see how you're getting to the numbers there in the Bakken. So it's simply like that. And then Guyana, it's exactly what I talked about before. It's just the additional drill ship. That factors in for exploration. So when I was talking about Guyana, that included this additional exploration spend from that additional drill ship. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Yeah. And, Roger, just again to, I'd say, reemphasize the point that John made earlier, the increment in CapEx is going to very high-return projects, the increment being probably in the range of 30% to 50% IRRs, very quick paybacks. While next year we'll ramp up in CapEx, we should start becoming cash flow-positive in a $60 WTI, $65 Brent world. In 2020, covering the CapEx and dividend, we should become cash flow-generative there. And then the outlook going past that, and we'll go over this at Investor Day, is that CapEx going forward probably is going to be in the range of $3 billion, holding flat out to 2025. So our portfolio becomes very cash-generative, putting us in a great position to balance investing in the business in the high returns going forward and also returning capital to our shareholders. Roger D. Read - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : That's great clarity. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Good morning. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Morning. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I wanted to just ask a quick question regarding the expectations for the Pluma exploration well that you mentioned in the press release. And I'm really asking this because I'm trying to get some sort of a feel for how the hubs are going to develop. If it was successful, would it more likely be a tie-in to Turbot or could it potentially support stand-alone production? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, I think it'll be part of that what we call the greater Turbot complex. We're really trying to define that to understand how many vessels it's going to take to evacuate that, right, that area. There's a lot of accumulations there that we want to get a drill bit in. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. No, that's helpful. Thank you. And I just wanted a quick question, just a little color on the improved Bakken well performance that was mentioned in the press release. I was just wondering is there anything new going on at the completion candidate or was this just an example of exceeding prior expectations? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No, I think it's just continuous improvement in completion practices. That number that I gave you is primarily dominated by sliding sleeves fleet. So recall this year we increased the proppant loading in our 60-stage sliding sleeves to 140,000 pounds per stage, so that's about 8.4 million pounds on the sliding sleeve. So primarily that number I gave you reflects that increase in proppant in sliding sleeves. In addition to that, we're also transitioning to plug-and-perf. And based on the results of the Bakken study and some of the very preliminary results that we got from our early plug-and-perf trials, that move to 10 million pounds is going to be very value-accretive. So we'll give you some more color on that in December but that'll be to \u2013 the first jump was sliding sleeve move, the next jump will be plug-and-perf, and you'll get an increment on each of those. Jeffrey L. Campbell - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay, great. Yeah, that's very helpful and I look forward to the Analyst Day in December. Thank you. Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey from Mizuho. Your line is open. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Hi everyone. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: Hi. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Actually, John Hess just hit the nail on the head I was going to ask about the run rate of CapEx given next year's number, but you clearly answered that one so thank you there. Maybe I could ask on DD&A coming down. Could you give the outlook for that dynamic, what caused it to come in below expectations, and what do you think the outlook is there? Thank you. John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: And, Paul, before John Rielly answers it, I understand congratulations are in order for your marriage. So I want to get that out first. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : I appreciate that, John. Thank you very much indeed. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Paul, the DD&A in the third quarter, really, the better performance in guidance was due to the production. So what we had was that higher production in the Gulf of Mexico with lower DD&A, and so that's what's driving that third quarter DD&A rate down. And then on a go-forward basis, as we project into the future kind of what John was talking about with always our capital being focused in those high-return Bakken and Guyana assets, we continue to see over this period through 2025 that our DD&A rate will continue to come down, and we'll give more information on that on the Investor Day. Paul Sankey - Mizuho Securities USA LLC : Great. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question. It seems like every week now there is a parent company that is taking back and acquiring its MLP. In that context, I thought I would get your thoughts on how committed you are and Global Infrastructure Partners is to maintaining Hess Midstream as a stand-alone public entity. John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yeah. I mean, it hasn't been that long since we've done the IPO of the Midstream. And the Midstream has been performing fantastically and it's been a great partner for us in this build-out of infrastructure. And as we're going to talk about obviously moving to the plug-and-perf and our increasing production above the 175,000 barrels per day, having that midstream partner, GIP, and Hess Midstream overall will really help us in that. And as John had mentioned before in our takeaway capacity, it's really just in general put us in a great place from a revenue standpoint and a cost standpoint. So where we are with that? I know what you've been talking about. We've been watching that happen in the market but it's early days. We've got plenty of growth left in that public midstream vehicle that we have. We're happy with its performance and expect it to continue to perform well. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And one question about Guyana that \u2013 you'll maybe hold off on this until the Analyst Day, but you're very close to approving Phase 2. You're talking about five total. For a country as small as Guyana, and that has never had an oil industry, are you facing any labor shortages or other kinds of bottlenecks as you're creating essentially a brand new value chain where none has existed before? Gregory P. Hill - Hess Corp.: No. So far there's no issues with labor shortage. Remember, this is an offshore development so the majority of everything is floated in, right, and the work is all done offshore. And I think ExxonMobil as operator has done a great job in maximizing local content where possible. Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Appreciate it, guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, guys. Sorry for lining up again. I just wanted to clarify something on the capital program. So, John Rielly, I know you don't want to give details on the Guyana fiscal contract. But exploration costs on the entire block as I understand it can be recovered from any revenue? Is that still the case? In which case, once you've got first oil what can you say about the cost recovery on the exploration dollars? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: The contract works as the whole block is the ring fence, so all costs can be recovered once production starts. So you are correct in what you said. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And that applies to development dollars on subsequent phases as well? John P. Rielly - Hess Corp.: Yes, it does. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great stuff, thank you. And just one final quick one on the MLP given that question just got asked. Is your plan still to monetize units on the MLP over time? John B. Hess - Hess Corp.: We are committed to the MLP and we don't have the need as Hess to monetize anything right now and neither does GIP because basically the drop-downs from Hess is going to Midstream Partners and we have a multi-year runway where we don't need to do any drop-downs into the MLP, so I just want to be clear. And I also want to be clear that Hess and GIP are committed to the MLP and continuing the growth trajectory and really maximizing value from our investment in the Midstream business. Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2018 Hess Corporation Conference Call. My name is Amanda and I\u2019ll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Amanda. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. As usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I will review our progress in executing our strategy, Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will then review our financial results. Our strategic priorities are; first, to invest only in high return low cost opportunities. Through 2025, we plan to allocate about 75% of our capital expenditures to our Guyana and Bakken assets, two of the highest return investment opportunities in the industry. Second, we have built a focused portfolio with a combination of short-cycle and long-cycle investment opportunities with Guyana and Bakken as our growth engines and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Thailand is our cash engines. As we discussed at our recent Investor Day, our portfolios position to deliver approximately 20% compound annual cash flow growth and more than 10% compound annual production growth through 2025 with a portfolio breakeven of less than $40 per barrel Brent by 2025. Third, we will continue to ensure that we have the financial capacity to fund our world-class investment opportunities and maintain an investment grade credit rating. We entered 2019 with 2.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet, 95,000 barrels of oil per day hedged in 2019 with $60 WTI put options and the spending flexibility to reduce our capital program by up to $1 billion should oil prices move lower on a sustained basis. Fourth, we are focused on growing free cash flow in a disciplined and reliable manner. We are adding an exciting inflection point, transitioning from an investment phase in 2019 to a free cash flow generation phase beginning in 2020 with a start-up of the Liza Phase 1 development offshore Guyana, followed by the Bakken growing to 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021. And then the Liza Phase 2 start-up offshore Guyana by mid-2022 with an additional ship planed in Guyana for each year thereafter through 2025. Finally, as our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will prioritize return of capital to shareholders through dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. As we execute our strategy, we will continue to be guided by our long-standing commitment to sustainability in terms of safety, protecting the environment, and social responsibility. A key driver of our strategy is Guyana where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator. In December, we announced the tenth discovery on the block at Pluma. As a result of this new discovery, and further evaluation of previous discoveries, the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the block was increased to more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent with multi-billion barrels of additional exploration potential. Earlier this month, drilling began on the Haimara-1 exploration well, 19 miles east of the Pluma-1 discovery and on the Tilapia-1 exploration well in the Turbot area. The Liza Phase 1 development is on track to start-up in early 2020. Project sanction for Liza Phase 2 is expected in the first quarter of 2019 with start-up expected by mid-2022. Sanctioning of a third development Payara is expected towards the end of 2019 with start-up, as early as 2023. Also, key to our strategy is the Bakken. Our largest operated growth asset where we have more than a 15-year inventory of high return drilling locations. Our transition to plug-and-perf completions should increase net present value of the asset by approximately $1 billion. Net production is expected to grow to 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021, generating approximately $750 million of annual free cash flow post 2020 at current oil prices. Now, turning to our 2018 financial results. Our adjusted net loss was $176 million, compared to a loss of $1.4 billion in 2017, and cash flow from operations before changes in working capital was $2.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion in the prior year. In 2018, we delivered proved reserve additions of $172 million net barrels of oil equivalent representing an organic replacement rate of 166% at an F&D cost of just under $12 per barrel of oil equivalent. The majority of these additions were in the Bakken. Proved reserves at the end of the year stood at 1.19 billion barrels of oil equivalent and our reserve life was 11.5 years. Full-year 2018 production was 257,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Pro forma for our asset sales and Libya, our production was 248,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018, 10% higher than the pro forma 224,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day produced in 2017. In 2019, our production is forecast to average between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Bakken net production is forecast to average between 135,000 and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019. In summary, we are extremely well-positioned to deliver increasing and strong financial returns, visible and low risk production growth, and significant future free cash flow, the majority of which will be deployed towards increased return of capital to our shareholders.  I will now turn the call over to Greg. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. 2018 was a year of strong operational execution and continued delivery of our strategy. We delivered production of 250,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018, excluding Libya, which exceeded our original production guidance of 245,000 to 255,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was achieved within our capital guidance of 2.1 billion and even after accounting for the sale of our JV interest in the Utica, which reduced full-year 2018 net production by approximately 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day versus guidance. In Guyana, on the 6.6 million-acre Stabroek Block where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we continued our extraordinary run as exploration success with five further major discoveries over 2018 at Ranger, Pacora, Longtail, Hammerhead and Pluma. In December, the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block were increased to more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up from about 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent a year ago. The growing resource base on the block reinforces the potential for at least five floating production storage and offloading vessels or FPSOs, producing more than 750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025. Guyana is world-class investment opportunity in every respect. The combination at scale, exceptional reservoir quality, shallow producing horizons, and timing of the development in the cost cycle provide industry-leading breakevens, which is key to moving Hess towards a $40 per barrel Brent breakeven oil price by 2025, while delivering significant growth in returns on invested capital and cash flow generation. In the Bakken, we have a 15-year inventory of drilling locations that can on average generate IRRs of more than 50% at $60 per barrel WTI. Through field trials and an independent study, we confirmed that our planned transition to plug-and-perf completions in 2019 from our previous 60 stage sliding sleeve design is significantly value accretive. Based on these results, we expect production to grow to approximately 200,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021, after which the asset should generate approximately $750 million of free cash flow annually at current prices through the middle of the next decade. In 2018, we also brought further focus to our portfolio by successfully closing on the sale of our JV interest in the Utica shale play to Ascent Resources for approximately $400 million in late August. Now, turning to production. In the fourth quarter, production averaged 267,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance of approximately 265,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day on the same basis. For the full-year 2019, we forecast production to average between 270,000 and 280,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which on a pro forma basis is approximately 10% above 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, we forecast production to average approximately 270,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now, turning to the Bakken. In the fourth quarter, production averaged 126,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represented an increase of approximately 15% over the year ago quarter and above our previous guidance of 125,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full-year 2018, production averaged 117,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in-line with full-year guidance of 115,000 to 120,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day.  For the full-year 2019, we forecast our Bakken production to average between 135,000 and 145,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day approximately 20% above 2018 levels. In the first quarter of 2019, we expect Bakken production to average approximately 130,000 to 135,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. In 2019, we plan to drill approximately 170 wells and bring approximately 160 new wells online, compared to 121 wells drilled and 104 wells brought online in 2018. Moving offshore in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, production averaged approximately 68,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 57,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full-year 2018 above our guidance, reflecting strong performance from our new Penn State Deep 6 well and the early return to production of the Conger field. We forecast 2019 production from our deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets to average between 65,000 and 70,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. At the Malaysia Thailand joint development area and the Gulf of Thailand in which Hess has a 50% interest, production averaged 35,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 36,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full-year 2018. At the North Malay Basin, also on the Gulf of Thailand, net production averaged 28,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day over the quarter and 27,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full-year 2018. Combined production from our JDA and North Malay Basin assets is forecast to average between 60,000 and 65,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full-year 2019. Turning to Guyana. Earlier this month the Stena Carron drillship began drilling the Haimara-1 well, located 19 miles east of the Pluma-1 discovery and the Noble Tom Madden drillship began drilling a second well, Tilapia-1, located 3 miles west of the Longtail-1 discovery, both in the southeastern part of the Stabroek Block. We expect to have results from both of these Wells shortly. Following completion of drilling operations on these wells, the Stena Carron will conduct a drill stem test at the Longtail discovery and the Noble Tom Madden will drill an additional exploration well on the Turbot area, likely Yellowtail. Beyond these wells, 2019 drilling on the Stabroek Block is expected to include appraisal of the Hammerhead and Ranger discoveries, and further exploration and appraisal in the Turbot area. Additional prospects and play types on the block, where we continue to see multibillion barrels of exploration upside, will also be prioritized for the drill schedule. The Liza Phase 1 development is progressing the schedule, drilling of Phase 1 development wells in the Liza field by the Noble Bob Douglas drillship is well advanced. Subsea equipment is being prepared for installation, and the topside facilities modules are being installed on the Liza Destiny FPSO in Singapore. Preparations are underway for the installation of subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines in the second quarter and the Liza Destiny FPSO is expected to sale from Singapore and arrive offshore Guyana in the third quarter of 2019. Also, as mentioned earlier, we continue to expect sanction of Liza Phase 2 in the first quarter and the Payara development to be sanctioned later this year. In closing, I believe that we have built distinctive capabilities and created a world-class portfolio that together will enable us to deliver industry-leading performance and significant shareholder value for many years to come. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the third quarter of 2018, and provide guidance for 2019. We incurred a net loss of $4 million in the fourth quarter, compared to a net loss of $42 million in the third quarter. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, results in the fourth quarter were a net loss of $77 million, compared to net income of $29 million in the previous quarter, resulting primarily from lower realized crude oil prices. Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $5 million in the fourth quarter, compared to net income of $109 million in the third quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2018 were as follows : Lower realized selling prices reduced results by $122 million. Lower exploration cost improved results by $78 million. Higher DD&A expense reduced results by $58 million. All other items reduced results by $12 million for an overall reduction in fourth quarter results of $114 million. Turning to Midstream. The midstream segment had net income of $32 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $30 million in the third quarter of 2018. Midstream EBITDA before the noncontrolling interest amounted to $127 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $130 million in the previous quarter. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $31 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $122 million in the third quarter of 2018. On an adjusted basis after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to $110 million in the previous quarter. Turning to our financial position. Excluding midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.6 billion, total liquidity was $7 billion, including available committed credit facilities, and debt was $5,691 million at December 31, 2018. Cash flow from operations before working capital changes was $584 million, while cash expenditures for capital were $664 million in the fourth quarter.  Changes in working capital increased cash flows from operating activities by $297 million in the fourth quarter, due to an increase in accounts payable and a reduction in accounts receivable. In the fourth quarter, we purchased $250 million of common stock, which completed our previously announced $1.5 billion stock repurchase program. Now turning to guidance, we project E&P cash cost, excluding Libya to be in the range of $12.50 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2019, and $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent for full-year 2019, which includes costs for pre-production activities for Guyana Phase 1 and pre-development costs for future phases. DD&A expense, excluding Libya is forecast to be in the range of $18 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter of 2019, and for the full-year of 2019. This results in projected total E&P unit operating cost, excluding Libya of $30.50 to $32.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and $31 to $33 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full-year 2019. As guided earlier, capital and exploratory expenditures in 2019 are expected to be $2.9 billion. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million in the first quarter with full-year 2019 forecast to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million. The midstream tariff is expected to be approximately $170 million in the first quarter with full-year 2019 projected to be in the range of $750 million to $775 million. The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya is expected to be an expense in the range of 0% to 4% for the first quarter and full-year 2019. Our 2019 crude oil hedge positions remain unchanged. We have 95,000 barrels of oil per day hedged for calendar 2019 with $60 WTI put option contracts. We expect option premium amortization will be approximately $29 million per quarter in 2019. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $35 million in the first quarter with full-year 2019, expected to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million. Turning to corporate, for the first quarter of 2019, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, and full-year guidance to be in the range of $105 million to $115 million. Interest expenses are estimated to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million in the first quarter and in the range of $315 million to $325 million for the full-year of 2019. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. John Rielly, the CapEx plan obviously hasn't changed given you only just put out a few weeks back, but given the dynamics of the oil price what would it take, I guess given the hedge position you are in, what would it take for you to need to cut, I guess going into perhaps the second half of this year, what I'm really thinking is, obviously oil prices are well below where they were when you set the budget, I'm just curious if you\u2019ve got any contingency plan just to where the flexibility would come? John Rielly : Sure, Doug. I mean, as we laid out at our Investor Day, we do have this long-term strategy and we do intend to continue to execute it. We really feel that we have the portfolio on a really nice place from the asset sales and we\u2019re really \u2013 now this portfolio can deliver the 10% production growth and the 20% cash flow growth as John Hess mentioned earlier. So, the only thing that we can't predict with this, with our portfolio is commodity prices. So, all we\u2019re doing now is trying to manage uncertainty. So, what did we do with proceeds from the asset sales? We\u2019ve left $2.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet and we have the hedges in place for 2019 and that\u2019s 95,000 barrels of oil per day with the $60 floor price and that\u2019s WTI. So, the company is well-positioned to deliver that strategy even in this low-price environment. Now, if we get extended in an extended low-price environment and really would have to go really more into 2020, the tail-end of 2019 into 2020, in that case an extended low-price environment we have the flexibility as we mentioned to reduce our annual CapEx by as much as $1 billion and that\u2019s principally by reducing rigs in the Bakken. But right now, our plan is to execute with six rigs in the Bakken and deliver everything that we said that we laid out in Investor Day. Doug Leggate : Okay. I appreciate. Obviously, we\u2019re not expecting at this point, but we will keep an eye on it. My follow-up if I may is on exploration and it\u2019s kind of couple of part question, I guess. The Tom Madden as I understand was only contracted for 2 well slots, I was just wondering if that has now been extended and if so, what do you have in the plan for this year by way of total exploration wells? And I realize that can move around, but well test and so on, and if I may just on that last point, Greg, I wonder if you could just characterize Haimara for us in terms of scale, it looks like it's a big green block to the east of the Turbot-Longtail, but as you probably saw from the other day, our understanding is that service sector is telling is that is already under test, which would imply discovery. So, any confirmation or color you can offer around that would be appreciated? Thanks. Greg Hill : Yes, thanks Doug. So, Haimara\u2019s operations are currently underway and as we said in our opening remarks, we expect to announce something on that shortly, as well as the Tilapia well. Regarding the Tom Madden, yes, we plan to use that rig throughout 2019. We really have, without talking about specific well numbers because again it does depend on kind of what we find in testing and etcetera as we go forward, but our main objectives on the block this year are really threefold. One is, to appraise Hammerhead; second is to appraise Ranger; and then our third objective is to continue to explore/appraise around Turbot. And the purpose of those three objectives is really to underpin vessels four and five, where are they, how big are they, et cetera. So, those are our main objectives this year, and we\u2019ll do that with two rigs in the exploration/appraisal theater. Doug Leggate : Just to be clear, the $200 million guide that\u2019s a G&G cost not a dry hole cost, right? John Rielly : I'm sorry Doug, the 200 million guide from\u2026? Doug Leggate : Yes, the guidance that you suggested I think for exploration, that is G&G, not dry hole? John Rielly : Okay. So, exploration spend for 2019 is going to be $440 million that\u2019s what we laid out in Investor Day. Doug Leggate : Sorry. I thought I [indiscernible]. John Rielly : Oh, so are you talking from my \u2013 when my guidance that I give out, we give exploration expenses without dry hole costs, so, that\u2019s the expense. The capital spend for exploration will be approximately $440 million in 2019. Doug Leggate : Right. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Singer : Thank you, good morning. John Hess : Good morning. Brian Singer : Wanted to follow-up actually on the point on Guyana you were just talking about with regards to appraisal, so what degree does the appraisal program over the next 6 months to 9 months, as you said, just underwrite FPSO is 4 to 5 versus open up the door for additional FPSOs beyond 5 or it is the emphasis on the plus \u2013 5 plus FPSOs expansion beyond 5 contingent on additional exploration as opposed to appraisal success? John Hess : Yes, Brian. So, the answer is both. I mean, as I said in my remarks earlier, one of the primary intentions though with the program this year is to underpin vessels 4 and 5. So, where are they? We know that there will be one or more potentially in the Turbot complex so it is likely to be one or more on the Hammerhead, and then finally Ranger or how does that play in and when does it play in. And as you mentioned, we will additionally be doing additional exploration on new prospectivity on the block above and beyond that. So, it\u2019s really both, but we\u2019re anxious to get 4 and 5 underpinned, obviously, because we want to keep the cadence of design one, build many, kind of, a ship a year coming online. So, it\u2019s important to understand where those are, get them engineered, get them designed, and more importantly how big to build them. Brian Singer : Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up is that with regards to the Bakken, can you just give us the latest that you're seeing in terms of the service cost environment of may be unrelated to your shift to the plug-and-perf, but just more of the service cost environment in the Bakken and then what you're currently seeing on the realization front? Thank you. John Hess : Yes. So, I\u2019ll take the service cost. So, I guess first point Brian is, you know the Bakken is very different than the Permian. It\u2019s a more regional market. Therefore, it\u2019s not experiencing the level of cost inflation that the Permian is seeing. Now, having said that, we\u2019re seeing an average cost increase of 5% to 10% on average in the Bakken in 2019. Most of that\u2019s in the form of higher labor cost, but having said, we\u2019re confident that with the combination of the performance-based service contracts we've established with our suppliers or many of our suppliers and our lean-manufacturing capabilities we will be able to cover all of that inflation. So, from a well cost guidance standpoint, we're very confident we\u2019ll deliver what we promised, in spite of the inflation. John Rielly : And just Brian to your question on the realizations, they are back to normal in the Bakken. So, during the fourth quarter, at the beginning of the fourth quarter, the Clearbrook spread moved from a plus $0.78 of the [TI] to minus $8.30 per barrel and that was due to about 1 million barrels of demand going away just due to refinery maintenance. So, now like the refineries are back online, the differentials are back around normal. They\u2019ve been a dollar above to a dollar under and so we\u2019re just seeing more of the normal type of Bakken differentials. And if I can just add again, our strategy is to have multiple export markets there to provide us flexibility to move our oil into the highest value market. So, we can get about 70% of our oil to the coast to get the Brent influenced pricing. So \u2013 and that\u2019s through a combination of our firm transportation of pipelines in rail. Brian Singer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Ryan Todd of Simmons Energy. Your line is open. And Mr. Todd, you line might be on mute, your line is open. Ryan Todd : Sorry, I apologize for that. A couple of quick questions on the Bakken. Of the 35 wells that you brought under in the fourth quarter how many of those if any were plug-and-perf and can you comment on how early production looks relative to expectations in your targeted type curve for the 2019 program? John Hess : So, in the fourth quarter it was 13 were plug-and-perf that came online and as we said basically going forward, it\u2019s almost 100%. We could have had some carryover sliding sleeves being coming online, but really all our program is plug-and-perf. I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg on performance in the plug-and-perf. Greg Hill : Sorry. I was on mute for a second. Just a reminder, the high intensity plug-and-perf completions are expected to deliver a 15% to 20% increase in IP 180. At least a 5% increase in EUR. That increase is our plateau production to 200,000 barrels a day from the previously guided 175. And importantly an increase in overall Bakken NPV by over $1 billion at $60 per barrel WTI, and what I will say is that results so far indicate that we are meeting or beating expectations on IP rates. So, we\u2019re in good stead going forward. Ryan Todd : Alright. It\u2019s good to hear and maybe any near-term impacts from the weather, and you had a relatively strong oil mix in the fourth quarter as well, I know that bounces around every time is ask you from quarter-to-quarter, but anything on those two things? John Hess : Now there has been some minor weather impacts. You know, it\u2019s extremely cold. So, the polar vortex is alive and well in North Dakota just like the rest of the nation, but we expect to recover from all that as normal. Greg Hill : And then, just going to the oil cut too and I know the way you asked your question you\u2019re right. I mean oil cut is going to fluctuate quarter-on-quarter really due to changes in gas volumes captured, NGL's extracted and also NGL pricing, but just from our guidance standpoint, we do expect to average in the low-to-mid 60% range for the foreseeable future. So, the increase in Q4 relative to our gas it was driven by lower gas was gathered because we did have Tioga Gas Plant maintenance in the quarter, and that drove up the oil cut. Ryan Todd : Perfect. I appreciate the help. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open. Jeffrey Campbell : Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. John Hess : Thank you. Jeffrey Campbell : I was just wondering could you add some, kind of color with regard to the Guyana, 2019 well test program, you know how specifically how that\u2019s going to help you to confirm or eliminate development options for the future? John Hess : Well, I think, you know the purpose of the testing program, the primary purpose is always to establish reservoir continuity. So, is there compartmentalization or anything like that going on so far. All of our drill stem tests have indicated very good reservoir continuity everywhere we go. So, that\u2019s important as you think about vessels 4 and 5 to have some tests under your belt to understand how many wells will it take to evacuate those reservoirs. So that will be the purpose again, if looking at 4 and 5 and the majority of the testing will be dedicated to that or new discoveries that we would like to get drill stem testing, while we\u2019re there. Jeffrey Campbell : Okay, thank you. And I was just wondering, could you comment broadly on the distribution of the drilling and completions in your best areas such as Keene and Stony Creek versus East Nesson and Beaver Lodge in 2019? Just kind of wondering how you're going to distribute the rigs around the completion? John Hess : Yes. So, if you think about the 160 wells online that we're going to drill, about 45 of those would be in Keene, about 30 or more be in Stony Creek, 40 or so will be in East Nesson, and then 20 will be in the Beaver Lodge, kind of [cap area], and then we have another 25 miscellaneous wells that are really spread out to try different loadings etcetera. So, kind of test wells in other parts of the field. Jeffrey Campbell : On the 25, is that \u2013 I know that other operators in the Bakken have talked about this as well, is that sort of an effort to try more moderate completions may be in areas where you haven\u2019t done it recently to see if you can push those EURs up? John Hess : Yes. I think so. You know those 25 wells, we\u2019re going to be about 11 in Goliath and 14 in Red Sky. So, really that as you kind of move out, how do we think about profit loading and potentially even spacing in those areas of the field. So, we want to get some of that experience under our belt this year. But if you look at the program for this year, the IP 180's are going to average 120 to 125. And certainly, the EURs will be well north of 1 million barrels for the program. So, good healthy program and returns in the 50% to 100% range. Jeffrey Campbell : Great. I appreciate that color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Bob Brackett : Hi, good morning. Could you talk in terms of Guyana, the pending government and regulatory approvals. How do you see the milestones coming through the first quarter and are they influenced by the election down in Guyana? John Hess : Let\u2019s handle it two ways. With the recent no-confidence vote in elections still being scheduled, there is absolutely no impacts to our exploration or development activities. Liza Phase 1 remains on track to achieve first oil in early 2020. And we also expect Liza Phase 2 to start up by mid-2022. The government on the final approval on plan of development it\u2019s just a question of getting a third-party engineering firm in place, which is underway to work with ExxonMobil to basically vet the details of the plan of development and we anticipate getting that in the first quarter and moving forward, but I think the important thing there Bob is that \u2013 all steam ahead. Bob Brackett : Yes. That\u2019s clear. Related follow-up that the F&D of under $12 a barrel is quite strong. If you look back to the 2017, that was an amazing $5 a barrel as those Liza bookings came through. How do we think about the cadence of Guyana reserves booking either on project sanction or then production-related revisions as we go forward? Greg Hill : Sure, Bob. We really believe we\u2019ve got competitive advantage with our reserve resource and backlog basically. One, just so you know we only have 40 million barrels of Guyana booked at this point, and as Exxon says there\u2019s greater than 5 billion barrels discovered. And it is this cadence because with the cadence we have the sanction of the Phase 1. We\u2019ve booked the approximately 40 million barrels and did not book any barrels here in 2018. So, when Phase 2 as John says get sanctioned, we will pick up barrels then. Phase 3 is Exxon is same by the end of the year. We\u2019ll pick up those barrels. Then also as we drill the production wells now for Phase 1 and begin to start-up performance on Phase 1, we\u2019ll be picking up additional reserves at that time. So, from a reserve standpoint, Guyana will be the gift that keeps on giving for us here over the time because as John Hess mentioned earlier, as we expect to have these phases come on once every year, we\u2019ll continue to record additional reserves every year as this moves out and you saw the low F&D cost associated with that. So, little on the scale and just the uniqueness of the low-cost reserves it just puts us in a terrific competitive advantage. Bob Brackett : Great. And thanks for that color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Roger Read : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to follow-up on some of the Guyana stuff, can you talk to us a little bit about, I guess what some of the issues we should watch for in terms of completion and delivery of the destiny vessel and then anything else on the development drilling or any other critical equipment timelines we should be watching to remain comfortable with the early 2020 start-up? John Hess : Yes. So, I think as I mentioned in my opening remarks, you know the cadence of when the vessel will show up and whatnot, we\u2019re on schedule to do that, so there are no issues foreseen yet. We are on schedule to get the vessel on location. I think the next key thing to watch is all of the surf activities that really start in the second quarter in Guyana. So, those are key activities, but we are \u2013 based on the project progress to date, we are on schedule to deliver oil in early 2020. Then you will ramp those wells up over a 4-month to 6-month period so it won't be an instantaneous ramp. The reason for that is you will bring them on flow just to make sure that you don't have any say in control issues. So, there will be a ramp of 4-months to 6-months, according to the operator. Roger Read : Yes, of course understand that. And then just one last question on balance sheet flexibility, obviously hedged up for this year the 95,000 barrels, I was curious is there and you may have mentioned this, I may have just missed this in the original commentary, but what\u2019s been done or could be done for 2020 or what do envision maybe needing to do for 2020, if the opportunity to hedge at $60 would represent itself again? Greg Hill : Yes. We will continue to look to add hedges as we move into 2020 or 2021. As I said earlier, we\u2019re just looking to manage the uncertainty, and we do like to have that healthy insurance to ensure our program and continue to be executed because, as I said earlier, we really like where the portfolio is right now and what it can deliver that 10% production growth and 20% cash flow growth. So, with the 95,000 barrels a day hedged at the $60 WTI floor for 2019, once we look to 2020, we will look to put on hedges as well to add insurance. John Hess : And I think it\u2019s important to know that the structure we\u2019d use would be similar where we protect the downside, but we don't cap the upside. Roger Read : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Barclays. Your line is open. Paul Cheng : Hi, guys. Good morning. John Hess : Good morning. Paul Cheng : John Rielly, I have to apologize, you gave a number about amortization cost per quarter for the hedges is that 29 million after tax? John Hess : Yes. That is 29 million after tax? Paul Cheng : Okay. And John just curious that, I mean, have you or Exxon have ever reached out to the opposition party and see what is their current view about contract and everything? John Hess : Yes. So, you know that both major parties, the current ruling party, as well as the opposition party have stated that they are supportive of the development and have consistently stated their intention to honor our PSCR contract. Paul Cheng : And based on the current trend, when the consortium will start to developing the natural guess for the local market? Greg Hill : Paul, that project is still under review and under discussion with the government and we were doing some early engineering studies to figure out what it will take, but in any case, it will be a small amount \u2013 relatively small amount of gas going onshore in the main to deliver to a gas fired power plant. But that project has not been sanctioned. It\u2019s still under feasibility studies and whatnot. Paul Cheng : Great comment. So, that saved me some reading through the entire PSC, is that being specified in the PSC in terms of this scoop and the when that gets the market and need to be developed? Greg Hill : No. All that\u2019s still under discussion with the government. Paul Cheng : Okay. So, that is actually subject to discussion is not framed into PSC? Greg Hill : No. I think we\u2019ve agreed for the necessity for it, but timing and how it all is going to work and all that is yet to be determined. Paul Cheng : Okay. And at Bakken, at 200,000 barrel per day of the peak, many years that you can sustain based on the [full rigs]? Greg Hill : 4 to 5. Paul Cheng : 4 to 5 rigs. I mean how many years [indiscernible]? Greg Hill : Based on what we know today. I mean 4 rigs, but 4 to 5 years at a peak, you know obviously based on what we know today, you know completion technology could get better. I mean there\u2019s lots of things that could get better that could extend that? Paul Cheng : But the current base on what you know today the resource is 4 years to 5 years on that? Greg Hill : Right. That\u2019s roughly 200,000 barrel a day peak. At a 4-rig level, so let me be clear about that? Paul Cheng : Yes. John Rielly on the Midstream, can you tell us what is the expected CapEx for 2019 and 2020? John Rielly : For 2019, the Midstream has put out its guidance. It\u2019s 275 million to 300 million of CapEx for Midstream. There is some small amounts that are in that Midstream related to water assets, because you know the water asset sale is expected to close in the first quarter. That\u2019s approximately 25 million to 30 million on top of that, but that\u2019s the gross amount that I was giving you. Paul Cheng : Okay. How about 2020, any kind of rough number? John Rielly : No. We don't have guidance out on that. So, again, it will depend all on our plans, as well as any potential third-party opportunities that the Midstream has. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Payne of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Ross Payne : How are you doing guys? Obviously, Venezuela got involved with Exxon\u2019s exploration ship on the very western part of the Guyana border, can you give us an update on when you think that will be resolved through the UN? Thank you. John Hess : Drilling and development operations in offshore Guyana are unaffected by the incident that involved the seismic acquisition vessels on Saturday, December 22 when the vessels were approached by the Venezuelan Navy. The area where the incident occurred is more than 110 kilometers from the Ranger discovery, the closest of our 10 oil discoveries, and approximately 190 kilometers from the Liza development area. So, the point is, our drilling and development operations in offshore Guyana are unaffected by that incident. And I think it\u2019s also important to know that exploration and development drilling is continuing in the Southeast area of the Stabroek Block. Greg just talked about that. The activities related to Liza Phase 1 development, which is expected to be producing up to 120,000 barrels oil a day in early 2020 also unaffected. And in terms of where it goes from here, it will be going to an international court. The UN fully supports Guyanese position. The United States supports the Guyanese position, as well as the CARICOM. So, this is an issue that is diplomatic that will have to be handled through the court, but at the end of the day we're very optimistic and encouraged that the Guyanese position will prevail. Ross Payne : Okay, thank you very much. One more question on the Bakken, can you, it sounds like you can get about 70% of your barrels to the Gulf, what percentage is pipeline versus rail and is that mix going to change at all in 2019 or 2020? John Hess : So, what we have right now is approximately 50,000 barrels a day that goes on DAPL. So that can get to Patoka, it can get to [Netherland], you can export from there. Then we have approximately from the rail that can go east, west or Gulf Coast. You've got like 25,000 to 30,000 barrels a day on rail that we can move. So that's basically how we get to the Gulf \u2013 to the various coasts and get the Brent-link pricing.  And we will \u2013 there are multiple potential expansions going out such as DAPL and we'll continue to look to keep that competitive advantage as our Bakken production grows to again access more of those Gulf \u2013 I keep saying Gulf, but coast pricing to get Brent-link pricing on our crude. So, we are looking at some of these expansions such as DAPL. Greg Hill : So, you looked at the future of the majority of our movements to market our Bakken crude will be through pipeline and the rail will be there for flex. Ross Payne : Okay, perfect. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Pavel Molkanov of Raymond James. Your line is open. Pavel Molkanov : Thanks for taking the question guys. Back to the general topic of takeaway capacity in the Bakken, any issues with gas flaring or anything around those lines that are facing constraints as you continue to ramp volumes? John Hess : No, we don't anticipate any gas flaring restrictions as we ramp our volumes. We have adequate capacity in place. Pavel Molkanov : Okay. And then just a quick one on buyback, having completed the previous authorization in Q4 as you mentioned is it fair to say that no additional buyback is envisioned as part of the 2019 capital allocation? Greg Hill : Our first second and third priority is to maintain a strong cash and balance sheet position, ample liquidity to ensure that we can fund our world-class investment opportunities in Guyana and the Bakken without the need for further debt or equity financing by the way. As we transition from our investment phase and our portfolio begins to generate recurring free cash flow, and you go forward in time out to 2025. We plan to return the majority of that free cash flow to shareholders through higher dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Pavel Molkanov : Alright. Very good, appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of John Herrlin of Societie Generale. Your line is open. John Herrlin : Hi, just some unrelated ones. With reserve additions this year you said they were primarily Bakken where most of the addition is extensions Greg? Greg Hill : It was actually a mixture John of extensions and add. So, generally with the ads you're going to get the extra year in the five-year program, so we\u2019re going to get those ads. Then you get some of these technical ones where you could have had in a program well A, in the previous year and now well A, is out, you got well B, so you get ads versus revisions, but you do get the additional year of the pods and then you get some revisions pick up. The prices were higher, so you do pick up some revisions from that as well. John Herrlin : Okay. Would you ever consider discussing your captive resource base given the fact that reserve additions are going to be lagged in Guyana and it\u2019s so large and you do have other resource potential elsewhere because it's not something you frequently discuss? John Rielly : No. We don't \u2013 we typically don't discuss this like the 6P type resource number, but what we do and as we laid out on Investor Day and Exxon has laid out that we do have greater than 5 billion barrels growth in Guyana. Obviously, we have a 30% working interest. So, people can get the scale of that and as I mentioned we only have 40 million of that booked right now. And then in the Bakken, obviously with our 15-year well inventory that we have with greater than 50% returns and then we have obviously an inventory of well locations beyond that. So, that's how we give that flavor because to your point, we do believe we have a real good competitive advantage with our backlog, our resources and reserve position. GregHill: Greg. And the estimated EUR in the Bakken is somewhere around 2.3 billion barrels there as well. John Herrlin : Thanks, Greg. Since, John was answering a lot of the questions, where do you capitalize on this year in terms of interest expense for 2019? GregHill: John, I'm going have to dig that one out. John Herrlin : We can do it off-line that\u2019s fine. GregHill: Yes, maybe I can get back to you off-line on exactly what that is. John Herrlin : Yes. That's fine. And then the last one for me as for 2018 costs incurred. Could you give us a sense of what was exploration? What was development? John Hess : So, from our cost incurred standpoint in 2018. Our exploration spend was $440 million. John Herrlin : Okay, great. Thanks. John Hess : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Amanda. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Now as usual with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy, Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance, and John Rielly will review our financial results. Our company delivered strong performance this quarter. Our portfolio which is balanced between our growth engines in Guyana and Bakken and our cash engines in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Thailand is positioned to deliver approximately 20% compound annual cash flow growth and more than 10% compound annual production growth through 2025 at a $65 per barrel Brent oil price. In addition, we project that our portfolio breakeven will decrease to less than $40 per barrel Brent by 2025. A key driver of our strategy is also our Guyana and extraordinary investment opportunity that is uniquely advantaged by its scale, reservoir quality, low cost, rapid cash paybacks and superior financial returns. The Stabroek Block Guyana where Hess has a 30% interest in ExxonMobil is the operator, covers 6.6 million acres and contains a massive world-class resource that keeps getting bigger and better. We continue to have exploration success on the block with three new discoveries since the start of 2019 at Tilapia, Haimara and Yellowtail. Last Thursday, we announced that the Yellowtail number 1 well located about 6 miles from Tilapia, encountered approximately 292 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir. This discovery is the fifth in the greater Turbot area, which is expected to become another major development hub. In February, we announced that the Tilapia number 1 well encountered approximately 305 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir, the thickest net pay of any well yet drilled on the block. Tilapia is located approximately 3 miles west of the Longtail number 1 well, which is also in the greater Turbot area. In February, we also announced that the Haimara number 1 well located in the southeastern part of the block, encountered approximately 207 feet of high quality gas condensate bearing sandstone reservoir. We have now made 13 significant discoveries on the block since 2015, which will underpin at least five floating production storage and offloading vessels to produce more than 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day by 2025. Gross discovered recoverable resources on the block are estimated to be more than 5.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent with multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. The Liza Phase 1 development is progressing well and remains on track to achieve first oil by the first quarter of 2020, less than five years after discovery. This phase will develop approximately 500 million barrels of oil utilizing the Lisa Destiny FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to a 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day. The Liza Phase 2 developments will use the Liza Unity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day with startup expected by mid 2022. A final investment decision is expected soon subject to government and regulatory approvals. Planning is also underway for a third phase of development at the Payara field, which is expected to have the capacity to produce between a 180,000 and 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day from the third FPSO. Sanction is expected to occur before the end of this year with first oil in 2023. Also key to our long-term strategy is the Bakken where we have a 15-year inventory of high return drilling locations. Our transition this year to plug-and-perf completions from our previous 60 stage sliding sleeve design is expected to increase the net present value of the assets by approximately $1 billion. Bakken net production is expected to grow approximately 20% per year to $200,000 of oil equivalent per day by 2021, generating approximately $1 billion of annual free cash flow post 2020 at a $60 per barrel WTI oil price. Now turning to our financial results. In the first quarter of 2019, we posted net income of $32 million or $0.09 per share versus an adjusted net loss of $72 million or $0.27 per share in the year ago quarter. Compared to 2018, our first quarter financial results primarily reflect our strong production performance, which was partially offset by lower oil prices and higher DDNA expenses. First quarter net production averaged 278,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya above our guidance of approximately 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and up from 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter, pro forma for the sale of our Utica joint venture interest. Bakken net production averaged 130,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day up from 111,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter of 2018. In closing, our company remains committed to executing our strategy that will deliver increasing financial returns, visible and low risk production growth, and accelerating free cash flow well into the next decade. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks John. I would like to provide an update on our progress in 2019 as we continue to execute our strategy. Starting with production, in the first quarter, net production averaged 278,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, which was above our guidance of approximately 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong operating performance across our portfolio. In the second quarter, we expect net production to average between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. This reflects the impact from plant shutdown and maintenance activities at North Malay Basin in Malaysia and at the Tubular Bells and Baldpate fields in the Gulf of Mexico, all of which was included in our full year guidance that we provided in January of 270,000 to 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. As usual, we will update our full year guidance on our second quarter call in July. In the Bakken, we delivered a strong quarter capitalizing on the success of our new plug-in-perf completion designs. Despite severe weather conditions in the Williston Basin in February, first quarter production averaged 130,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day an increase of more than 17% from the year ago quarter and within our guidance range of 130,000 to 135,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the first quarter, we drilled 38 wells and brought 25 wells online. Weather conditions in the basin have improved. And in the second quarter, we expect to drill approximately 40 wells and bring online approximately 45 new wells. For the full year 2019, we still expect to drill about 170 wells and bring 160 wells online per our January guidance. In the second quarter, we forecast that our Bakken net production will average between 135,000 and 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And for the full year 2019, we continue to forecast production to average between 135,000 and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, approximately 20% above 2018 levels. Moving to the offshore, first quarter production performance was strong in our Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia, Thailand assets. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day; and in the Gulf of Thailand, net production averaged approximately 68,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now turning to Guyana. Our exploration success on the Stabroek Block continues with three new discoveries so far in 2019 at Tilapia, Haimara and Yellowtail, bringing the total number of discoveries on the block to 13. In terms of drilling activities, the Stena Carron recently completed a drill stem tests of Longtail and is now drilling the top whole section of Hammerhead-2, after which it will begin drilling Hammerhead-3. Following the completion of well operations at Yellowtail, the Noble Tom Madden will drill out Hammerhead-2. Results from these tests will provide data for the operator to size and optimize plan of development for this area. Drilling plans for 2019 also include a second well at Ranger and three additional exploration wells the locations of which are being finalized. Now turning to our Guyana developments. Liza Phase 1 is progressing to schedule. At the Keppel yard in Singapore, installation of topside modules is now complete on the 120,000 barrel of oil per day Liza Destiny FPSO and commissioning activities are underway. The vessel is expected to arrive offshore Guyana in the third quarter of 2019. Drilling over the Phase 1 development wells is proceeding and installation of subsea infrastructure as well advanced with installation of subsea umbilicals, risers and flow lines planned for the second quarter. We're on track to achieve first oil by the first quarter of 2020. Liza Phase 2 will utilize the Liza Unity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 barrels of oil per day. Six drill centers are planned with a total of 30 wells including 15 production wells, nine water injection wells and six gas injection wells. Government and regulatory approvals are expected soon after which final project sanction will be taken. First oil remains on track for mid 2022. The final investment decision is also expected later this year for a third phase of development Payara, which is expected to have a gross capacity of between 180,000 and 220,000 barrels of oil per day with start off as early as 2023. In closing, our team once again demonstrated excellent execution and delivery across our asset base. Our offshore cash engines continue to generate reliable cash flow. The Bakken is on a strong capital efficient growth trajectory and Guyana continues to get bigger and better, which in combination position us to deliver industry-leading returns, material cash flow generation and significant shareholder value for many years to come. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2019 to the fourth quarter of 2018. We reported net income of $32 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to an adjusted net loss of $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Turning to E&P. E&P had net income of $109 million in the first quarter compared to a net loss of $5 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of E&P results, between the first quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter of 2018, were as follows. Lower exploration expenses increased earnings by $57 million. Lower cash costs increased earnings by $37 million. Lower DD&A expense increased earnings by $35 million. Changes in sales volume increased earnings by $7 million. Lower realized selling prices decreased earnings by $9 million. All other items decreased earnings by $13 million for an overall increase in first-quarter earnings of $114 million. Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $37 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to $32 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Midstream EBITDA before non-controlling interests amounted to $129 million in the first quarter compared to $127 million in the previous quarter. For corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $114 million in the first quarter of 2019 and $104 million on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of 2018. Turning to our financial position. At quarter end, cash and cash equivalents were $2.3 billion excluding Midstream, and total liquidity was $6.7 billion including available commented credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $5.7 billion. In April, Hess entered into a new fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility that matures in May 2023 and replaces our previous credit facility that was scheduled to mature in January 2021. Cash flow from operations before working capital changes was $635 million, while cash expenditures for capital investments were $678 million in the first quarter, including cash consideration of $89 million for the Midstream assets acquired from Summit. Changes in working capital decreased cash flows from operating activities by $397 million in the first quarter. This included a one-time repayment of approximately $130 million to our joint venture partner for each share sale-leaseback proceeds related to our sale of the North Malay Basin floating storage and offloading vessel, which was completed in the third quarter of 2018. The remaining working capital items included semiannual interest payments on debt and increase in accounts receivable and a reduction in accounts payable. In the first quarter, we adopted the new lease accounting standard which resulted in the recognition of operating lease liabilities of approximately $800 million on our consolidated balance sheet. The adoption does not impact our P&L or cash flow. Turning to guidance. Our first quarter production, cash unit cost and capital and exploratory expenditures beat guidance and position us favorably for the full year. As is our normal practice, we will update full year guidance on our second quarter conference call. With respect to the second quarter, as Greg mentioned, we expect production and cash unit cost to be impacted by plant maintenance shutdown at North Malay Basin and at the Tubular Bells and Baldpate fields. These plant shutdowns were incorporated in our full year guidance provided in January. We project E&P cash cost excluding Libya to be in the range of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent in the second quarter of 2019, up from $11.54 per barrel oil equivalent in the first quarter, reflecting higher costs for the planned maintenance shutdowns and higher second quarter work over activities in the Bakken including weather-related deferrals from the first quarter. DD&A expense excluding Libya was $18.37 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2019 and is forecast to be in the range of $18 to $19 per barrel oil equivalent in the second quarter 2019. This results in projected total E&P and operating cost excluding Libya of $31 to $33 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter. Exploration expenses excluding dry-hole costs are expected to be the range of $45 to $55 million in the second quarter and the Midstream tariff is expected to be approximately $170 million in the second quarter. The E&P effective tax rate excluding Libya is expected to be expense in the range of 5% to 9% for the second quarter. Our 2019 crude oil hedge positions remain unchanged. We have 95,000 barrels of oil per day Hedge for calendar 2019 with $60 WTI put option contracts. We expect option premium amortization to be approximately $29 million per quarter in 2019. E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $750 million in the second quarter, which includes drilling the Llano-5 well in the Gulf of Mexico that was deferred from the first quarter and drilling and completing more wells in the Bakken with tough winter conditions behind us. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess on the Midstream segment to be approximately $35 million in the second quarter. For corporate, for the second quarter of 2019 corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million and interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open. Bob Brackett : I will start by observing that it took 22 days to drill Yellowtail and then from that start to think about the cadence of what you're doing this year in terms of the exploration program. And how do you feel about the commentary with ExxonMobil potentially adding a fourth exploration drillship? Greg Hill : Yes, thanks, Bob. Yes, ExxonMobil is indicated they do plan to add a fourth rig to the theater. However, the drilling sequence and all that, we're still working out with the operator. I think they announced, they will come into the theater sometime in September. But what gets drilled on our block and their other blocks joint blocks, we're still working with that with the operator. So stay tuned on that. Bob Brackett : And in terms of once Hammerhead-2 and Hammerhead-3 are appraised, what are the Tom Madden and Stena Carron going to do? Have you decided that? Greg Hill : Yes, I think, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we definitely want to get a second well down at Ranger and then we have three other expiration wells right now. The sequence of which are being worked out between us and the operator, also depending on success and what you find remember, you might have an appraisal well or testing or whatever as success continues on the block. Operator : Thank you. And your next question is from the line of Arun Jayaram from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Greg, I was wondering, if you could detail maybe the objectives that at Hammerhead 2 and 3? And also maybe give us a little bit more color on Haimara 1, and if you guys tested the deeper objective at Haimara? Greg Hill : So, let me start with the appraisal wells. Obviously, the objective of those is to understand the extent of the reservoir and continuity of the reservoir. So, that's really the purpose. Haimara that will feature later in the sequence, again, I think the plan is to have some appraisal wells there as well, but the sequence and cadence of when that comes, again we're still working all that with the operator. Arun Jayaram : Did you all test anything deeper at Haimara? Or is that going to be the next potential well. Greg Hill : That will probably subject to later appraisal. Arun Jayaram : Fair enough. Greg, switching gears to the Bakken. Just wondering, if you could highlight any of the testing that you planned at Goliath and Red Sky? And also, we also noted this week that you had, we think as maybe a record kind of Bakken completion at Brumback [ph]. I don't know, if you could maybe comment a little bit on that well, which can hit the state. I think it had an IP in the 10,000 BOE range. Greg Hill : Yes, let me start with the Brumback [ph] well test. Why we'd do that? It was really designed to better understand open flow potential, and it was a great result because we believe that the well achieved the highest IP-24 ever recorded for U.S. onshore well and that was some 14,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now while we achieved a very high IP rate and it confirmed that our acreage performed very strongly in comparison to other operators. We don't think this completion technique will be the standard practice just simply due to the higher costs and efficiencies. But again, it was a great well, great result. Regarding the testing in the Goliath acreages, as we kind said earlier in the year, we will drill 25 wells or so outside the core areas this year and that's really just to begin to establish what completion practices do we want in different parts of the field. Our current standard design is 36-stage with about 280 entry points. We know that that can vary as we get out to other areas of the field, so we really want to get some wells out in that area to begin to understand and optimize what completion designs will be. Because obviously in the future, those will feature in our inventory, so we want to get ahead of that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Devin McDermott : My first question is on Guyana and as given the continued success there, incremental discoveries, growing resource size. I just wanted to talk at a high level about how that might impact the long-term development plan, which I\u2019m sure is still in flux? But what I\u2019m thinking about is specifically, how the potential might be for pallet developments, tiebacks or better use of shared infrastructure that might drive down the cost overtime or improve returns on the development of future phases? John Hess : Devin, good question. Obviously, a lot of our work this year is to do further appraisal, to start to get more clarity on the answer to your question. ExxonMobil is the operator and we're working closely with them or trying to optimize what that development will be obviously with the bigger resource. We're still looking at phasing, but it is possible that we will be more than five ships going forward to produce oil, but the key is going to be doing further appraisal on the resource that we have and evaluation worked really optimize what the ultimate development will be. So, work in progress. Devin McDermott : Got it, make sense. And then shifting over to the Bakken, as noted on the call and one of the previous question, the results there continued to be strong and even with the weather issue that was seen in the past quarter. You guys came in within guidance. I just wonder, if you could give an update on, you know, what you're seeing there as you roll out the plug-and-perf completions across all of your wells relative the guidance and base plan you all laid out last year? John Hess : Yes, I think as you mentioned, we did have a good performance in the first quarter and despite the bad weather, we actually got 10 wells last online and what was in our plan, but still were able to stay within the guidance. We guided that these high intensity plug-and-perf completions are delivering a 15% to 20% increase in IP 180 and 5% to 10% increase in EUR versus at previous sliding 60-stage sliding sleeve design. We\u2019re confirming those results. I mean, we're well within that range. Because wherever we're drilling in the first quarter was a little better than that, but that's still going to be our guidance for the year. And as John mentioned in his opening remarks, this is going to increase Bakken NPV by over billion at $60 WTI. So far so good, we're very pleased with the results. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Your line is now open. John Abbott : This is John Abbott on for Doug Leggate. Doug is currently on a plane. Doug is currently on a plane flying back from the Destiny FPSO. I'm sure he's listening in on the plane, if the Wi-Fi is working. He has sent me a list of questions. His first being, it is his belief that the FPSO will sell in mid-June and likely be in Guyana in August. Can you now confirm that first oil may possibly start before the end of the year? Greg Hill : Well, I think as we said in our opening remarks, we expect first oil by first quarter 2020. The project is going well. The project is ahead of schedule. There is a chance that it will be on before that. I think it's the reason that there is a little bit left in the schedule is because we started all the open water activities. So, I think it's prudent to stick with our buy first quarter 2020 for now until everything shows up in theater and you start the open water work. John Abbott : Appreciated and his second question is on hedging. You're fully hedged on short for 2019 with $60 floor, but you've also said at $60 oil in the Bakken you can generate around $450 billion of free cash in 2020 at $60. Given that oil is trading above that level now. How should we think about your hedging strategy going forward? As it seems to us, you have a chance to draw an early line under any future cash burn. Greg Hill : Thanks. So just like you said, we are well-positioned here for this year in 2019 with our hedges that are $95,000 barrels a day to put options at $60 WTI floor. So, we're comfortable and well positioned in 2019. To your point, it is our intention to add positions for 2020 obviously depending on market conditions. We do not have any 2020 positions on right now, but it is our intent to add that just like you said to draw that line in the sand, ensure that we have a strong cash flow next year, as we continue to invest in Guyana and Bakken. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Singer : I wanted to follow up on the topic of oil prices, maybe a little bit less on the hedging front, but more, if these oil prices hold likely higher relative to what was originally anticipated. Can you just talk about the strategy for use of excess cash and in terms of either returning to our shareholders paying down debt or investing in the business? John Hess : Yes, Brian, our first priority as you know is to make sure we have a strong financial position and cash position to fund the first ship in Guyana, the second ship in Guyana and the six-week program we have in the Bakken. So, the strong cash position will be prioritized for investing in those high return projects. Brian Singer : And then my follow is on Guyana. Can you just talk and compare and contrast? What you're seeing so far in the Tilapia, Yellowtail area with the strong thickness of pay in comparison to say what you see at Liza? I know there is a knowledge difference right now, but little bit of comparing contrast will be helpful. John Hess : Now, I think the Yellowtail was a great result. It had high net to gross. As John mentioned in his opening remarks, 292 feet of that, well had good porosity and it has got good oily fluids that are Liza-like. So, Yellowtail is closer to Liza from a geologic standpoint. And so, we're very pleased with that result. Brian Singer : And then, in Tilapia nearby? John Hess : Tilapia, again, a very good well, 300 feet, very high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir, so we're also very pleased to that also. I think the key point here is both of those wells are great talk about are very oily. high quality oil, and really increase our confidence that the greater Turbot area should underpin the fourth and fifth FPSOs that are being contemplated. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Campbell : To that point, I just wanted to -- it's kind of asking some that was asked before, but I just want to ask it a different way. It appears that you may have actually discovered additional Guyana resources. It's beyond what might have been currently your mark for the development plan through 2025. And that may not be right, you can tell me, but I was wondering. If exploration success continues, could this potentially expand the plans into 2025%? Or is it more likely that it becomes longer dated oil? John Hess : No, again, we're optimizing our plans. The first three ships are very much defined. The fourth and fifth ship, we still have more appraisal work to do. We're also looking at Hammerhead how that might fit in the queue. But since this is a phase development, it's very manageable from a financial perspective and very much aligned with the financial outlook we gave out to 2025 in our Investor Day in December. Jeffrey Campbell : And I just want to turn quickly to North Malay when noted the output increase. I was under the impression we're already close to near peak that obviously wasn\u2019t the case. So, I was just wondering this future growth beyond what we saw in the first quarter expected at some point or the volumes getting near their new ceilings? John Rielly : Really, what you saw in the first quarter were increased nominations above typical nomination, now the field as you could see, it has a capability of delivering that, but it really based on local demand. So, what I would say is, you should expect that that nominations come down. We're expecting that part of our second quarter forecast is to have some of that demand for the nomination come down a bit. But the field to your point is performing very well and has the availability to produce at a higher level, should the demand be there. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Pavel Molchanov : I don\u2019t think anyone's asked you about the Midstream. You guys had a pretty sizable drop down. A few ago, if I\u2019m not mistaken, the largest dropdown since the MLP originally went public. What's kind of the expectation for additional dropdown beyond the organic expansion that I know you guys announced this morning? Greg Hill : Yes, so, you're right. We did. In the first quarter, we sold our water business or dropped that down into the upper tier into the Midstream JV. So, that was complete in the first quarter and then also in the first quarter of Midstream did acquire some other North Dakota transportation assets from Summit Midstream partners. So, they did that. They've been busy. And as you know, you mentioned that we are expanding our Tioga Gas Plant from 250 million to 400 million scuffs. So, there's a lot of activity and there is a lot of demand for our infrastructure of North Dakota. So, we're well-positioned for it and we're excited actually for the increase in the gas plant. As far as other assets, we do have other assets in North Dakota; and actually outside in North Dakota, we've talked about the Gulf of Mexico as well, that could be dropped in. So, we will continue to look at that and we will put assets into the Midstream overtime. But as of right now, nothing immediate I would tell you. Pavel Molchanov : And when I look at the guidance for the Midstream tariff, starts at, you did 162 million in Q1, guiding to 170, so the implied rate for the second half of the year is about over 200 million per quarter. Is that right? And what explains the increase? Greg Hill : So, we will have a significant -- begin to get significant increase of throughput capacity when the little Missouri four plant comes online. That is expected to come online in the third quarter. So, the Midstream will see and it's not just test, its third parties as well, utilizing our additional capacity at the little Missouri plant. So, it is just the throughput increase that will increase the tariff. Some of it'd been in Hess related and some of it'd be in third party. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Payne of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Ross Payne : Nice job guys across the board. Can you speak to the process to sanction Liza 2 in any governmental challenges you expect to get that sanctioned and permitted? And second of all, what's the latest news on the no-confidence vote? And does that have any impact on future permitting? Greg Hill : I think I will talk to Phase 2 and John will speak to no-confidence vote. But on Phase 2, as we said in our opening remarks, the approval is eminent. So, we don't expect any issues. John Hess : In terms of the no-confidence vote, as you probably are aware, the no-confidence vote was overturned in court. It's now going to a higher court to have that ruling upheld. We expect that to occur during the month of May and I can assure you. The current government is running their approval process in the normal course of business, and we don't see the no-confidence vote or the overturned of the no-confidence vote of having any impact in the day-to-day running of the Guyanese government and their oil affairs. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Amanda. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website www.hess.com. Today\u2019s conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess\u2019 annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today\u2019s conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Now as usual with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I will provide a strategy update, Greg Hill will then discuss our operating performance and John Riley will review our financial results. In the second quarter, we continued to execute our strategy and deliver strong operational performance. With our full year production now expected to come in at the upper end of our guidance range and our capital and exploratory expenditures projected to come in under our original guidance. Our portfolio, which is balanced between our growth engines in Guyana and the Bakken and our cash engines in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Thailand, is on track to generate industry leading cash flow growth. With a portfolio breakeven that is expected to decrease to less than $40 per barrel Brent by 2025. A key driver of our strategy is our position in Guyana. The 6.6 million acres Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator is a massive world class resource that is uniquely advantaged by its scale, reservoir quality, cost, rapid cash paybacks and strong financial returns. In April, we announced our 13th discovery on the Stabroek Block at Yellowtail. The Yellowtail number 1 well encountered approximately 292 feet of high-quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir and is the fifth discovery in the Turbot area, which is expected to become a major development hub. Total discoveries on the Stabroek Block to-date have established the potential for at least 5 floating production storage in offloading vessels or FPSOs producing over 750,000 barrels of oil per day by 2025. Drilling and appraisal activities were completed at the Hammerhead 2 and Hammerhead 3 wells with encouraging results, including a successful drill stem test in July. These results are being evaluated for a potential future development. Exploration and appraisal drilling continues on the block at the Tripletail prospect in the greater Turbot area and at the Ranger discovery where a second well is underway. As a result of this year\u2019s discoveries and further evaluation of previous discoveries, we have increased the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block to more than 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up from the previous estimate of more than 5.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent and we continue to see multibillion barrels of additional exploration potential. In terms of our developments, Liza Phase 1 continues to advance. On July 18, the Liza Destiny FPSO, which has the capacity to produce up to 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day, set sail from Singapore and is expected to arrive in Guyana in September. First production is expected by the first quarter of 2020. Phase 2 of the Liza development, which was sanctioned in May, will use a second FPSO, the Liza Unity with production capacity of up to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. Startup is expected by mid-2022. Planning is underway for a third phase at Payara, which will use a FPSO with a capacity to produce between 180,000 to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. First production is on track for 2023. In the Bakken, we have a premier acreage position and a robust inventory of high-return drilling locations. We plan to continue operating 6 rigs, which is expected to grow net production to approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 along with a meaningful increase in free cash flow generation over this period. Now turning to our financial results, in the second quarter, we posted a net loss of $6 million or $0.02 per share compared to a net loss of $130 million or $0.48 per share in the year ago quarter. On an adjusted basis, we posted a net loss of $28 million or $0.09 per share compared with an adjusted net loss of $56 million or $0.23 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Compared to second quarter 2018, our improved financial results primarily reflect increased U.S. crude oil production and reduced exploration expenses, which were partially offset by lower realized selling prices and higher DD&A expenses. Second quarter net production averaged 273,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, up from 247,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter. For the full year of 2019, we forecast that net production will average between 275,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which is also at the upper end of our previous guidance range. Second quarter net production in the Bakken averaged 140,000 of oil equivalent per day, up 23% from 114,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day a year ago. For the full year 2019, we now forecast that the Bakken net production will average between 140,000 and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, at the upper end of our previous guidance range. Before closing, I would like to note that we published our Annual Sustainability Report earlier this month for the 22nd year. We believe sustainability practices create value for our shareholders and position us to continuously improve our business performance. Our sustainability report is available on our company website at www.hess.com. In summary, we are successfully executing our strategy, which will deliver increasing and strong financial returns, visible and low risk production growth and significant future free cash flow. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. I would like to provide an update on our progress in 2019 as we continue to execute our strategy. Starting with production, in the second quarter, net production averaged 273,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was within our guidance for the quarter of 270,000 to 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Strong performance across our operated portfolio was partially offset by unplanned downtime at the Shell-operated Enchilada facility in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which reduced our second quarter net production by approximately 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the third quarter, we expect net production to average between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, as continued ramp up of the Bakken is expected to be partially offset by planned maintenance at our JDA asset in Southeast Asia and the impact of Hurricane Barry in the Gulf of Mexico in early July. Based on our year-to-date performance and our expectation of strong production growth from the Bakken, deepwater Gulf of Mexico in Southeast Asia in the fourth quarter, we now forecast full year 2019 net production to average between 275,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is at the upper end of our previous guidance range. Turning now to the Bakken, capitalizing on the success of our new plug and perf completion design, we delivered a strong quarter. Second quarter Bakken net production averaged 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was at the top end of our guidance range of 135,000 to 140,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day and approximately 23% higher than the year-ago quarter. For the third quarter, we forecast our Bakken net production will average between 145,000 and 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For full year 2019, we now forecast Bakken net production will average between 140,000 and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is also at the upper end of our previous guidance range. In the second quarter, we brought 39 new wells online, and in the third quarter we expect to bring approximately 45 new wells online. For the full year of 2019, we still expect to bring approximately 160 new wells online. Moving to the offshore, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, reflecting planned maintenance activities at Tubular Bells in Baldpate as well as an unplanned shutdown at the Shell-operated Enchilada facility in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which resulted in a 22-day shut-in of production at our Conger Field. In line with our strategy of investing in high return opportunities, we are pleased to report that the Llano 5 well in the Gulf of Mexico, where Hess has a 50% working interest, was successfully brought online in July and is expected to reach a gross production rate of between 8,000 and 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. The well was drilled and completed in approximately 60 days, 2 weeks ahead of schedule. In Southeast Asia, net production averaged approximately 59,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, reflecting a successfully completed planned shutdown for maintenance activities in North Malay Basin. As I mentioned earlier, we also completed a planned 2-weeks shutdown at the JDA last week and production is now back to pre-shutdown levels. Now turning to Guyana, our exploration success on the Stabroek Block continues, with 3 new discoveries so far in 2019 at Tilapia, Haimara and Yellowtail, bringing the total number of discoveries on the block thus far to 13. We completed drilling operations on the Hammerhead-2 and 3 wells in June and July, respectively, which included a successful drill stem test on Hammerhead-3 and we are currently evaluating the results for a potential future development. Our Noble Tom Madden drillship is currently drilling the intermediate section of one of the Liza Phase 1 development wells and will then return to finish drilling in the Tripletail 1 well with results expected in October. The Stena Carron drillship recently commenced drilling of the Ranger 2 appraisal well as a follow-up to the successful Ranger 1 exploration well, which in January 2018 established a large oil-bearing carbonate structure, located approximately 60 miles northwest of the Liza field. An extensive logging and quarrying program as well as the drill stem test are planned for Ranger 2. Now turning to our Guyana developments, Liza Phase 1 is progressing as planned. The Liza Destiny FPSO, with a gross production capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day, has departed Singapore and is expected to arrive in Guyana in September. Drilling at the Phase 1 development wells by the Noble Bob Douglas drillship is proceeding to plan and the installation of subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines is approximately 70% complete. The project is on track to achieve first oil by the first quarter of 2020. Liza Phase 2, sanctioned in May, will utilize the Liza Unity FPSO where fabrication activities are currently underway. Liza Unity will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and will develop approximately 600 million barrels of oil. First oil is expected by mid 2022. A third phase of development at Payara is expected to have a gross capacity of between 180,000 and 220,000 barrels of oil per day, with first oil on track for 2023. In closing, our execution continues to be strong, and in 2019 we are positioned to deliver production at the upper end of our previous guidance range along with lower capital and exploratory expenditures than our previous guidance. Our offshore cash engines continue to generate significant cash flow, the Bakken is on a strong capital efficient growth trajectory and Guyana continues to get bigger and better, all of which position us to deliver industry leading returns, material free cash flow generation and significant shareholder value for many years to come. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2019. We incurred a net loss of $6 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared with net income of $32 million in the first quarter. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting compatibility of earnings between periods, we incurred a net loss of $28 million in the second quarter of 2019. Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P had net income of $46 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to net income of $109 million in the previous quarter. The price and volume variances between the second quarter and first quarter were immaterial. The other changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P earnings between the second and first quarter of 2019 were as follows : higher operating cost, as guided, driven primary by workovers and maintenance activities at North Malay Basin and Tubular Bells decreased earnings by $27 million; higher production in severance taxes decreased earnings by $7 million; higher seismic expense in Guyana decreased earnings by $9 million; changes in foreign exchange decreased earnings by $8 million; all other items decreased earnings by $12 million for an overall decrease in second quarter earnings of $63 million. Turning to Midstream, the Midstream segment had net income of $35 million in the second quarter of 2019 compared to $37 million in the first quarter of 2019. Midstream EBITDA, before no controlling interest, amounted to $127 million in the second quarter compared to $129 million in the previous quarter. For corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $109 million in the second quarter compared to $114 million in the first quarter of 2019. Turning to our financial position, at quarter end, cash and cash equivalents were $2.2 billion, excluding Midstream, and total liquidity was $6.1 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $5.7 billion. During the second quarter, we entered into a new, fully un-drawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility maturing in May 2023, which replaced our previous credit facility that was scheduled to mature in January 2021. Net cash provided from operating activities was $675 million, while cash expenditures for capital and investments were $640 million in the second quarter. Changes in working capital increased operating cash flows by $115 million in the second quarter. Now turning to third quarter and full year 2019 guidance, for E&P, our E&P cash costs were $12.11 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.72 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the second quarter. We project E&P cash cost, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter of 2019, which reflects the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns at the JDA and Baldpate, planned maintenance projects in the Bakken and the impact of Hurricane Barry. Full year 2019 cash costs, excluding Libya, are now expected to be $12.50 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is down from previous guidance of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent. DD&A expense was $17.20 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $18.31 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the second quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $18 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent in the third quarter of 2019, with full year guidance unchanged at $18 to $19 per barrel of oil equivalent. This results in projected total E&P unit operating cost, excluding Libya, to be the range of $31 to $33 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter, and in the range of $30.50 to $32 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2019. Exploration expenses, excluding dry haul costs, are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million in the third quarter and full year guidance to be in the range of $200 million to $210 million, which is in the lower end of our previous guidance. The Midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $185 million for the third quarter, with full year guidance expected to be $740 million to $750 million. The increase in the third and fourth quarter tariff expense is due to an anticipated increase in Midstream volumes driven by growing Hess production and increasing third-party throughput with the startup of the Little Missouri 4 gas processing plant in North Dakota. The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be an expense in the range of 0% to 4% for the third quarter and for the full year. Our crude oil hedge positions remain unchanged. We have 95,000 barrels of oil per day hedged for calendar 2019, with $60 WTI put option contracts. We expect option premium amortization to be approximately $29 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $800 million in the third quarter and $2.8 billion for the full year, which is down from original guidance of $2.9 billion. For the Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $40 million in the third quarter and in the range of $170 million to $175 million for the full year. Turning to corporate, for the third quarter of 2019, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million and full year guidance to be in the range of $110 million to $115 million. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million for the third quarter and full year guidance to be in the range of $315 million to $320 million. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Hi thanks. Good morning everybody. I wonder if I could ask a couple on Guyana and then just one on the Bakken. On Guyana, Greg, it\u2019s probably for you. Could you give us a little bit more color on the Hammerhead appraisals? Obviously, they\u2019re kind of scant detailed in the release, but what does this mean for the potential of, I guess, an accelerated development? I think that had been alluded to in the past but to boost your exploration assets and then bring forward the development seems a little bit unusual. And the related question is when you describe the Yellowtail Turbot Longtail area as a major development hub, one assumes that doesn\u2019t relate to a single FPSO. So it seems that we\u2019re kind of stacking up development visibility here. I just wonder if you could offer us any color on why we still haven\u2019t seen an uplift to the greater than 750,000 guidance for 2025? Greg Hill : Yes, Doug. Thanks. So let me take your first question. So first of all, the Hammerhead well results for both Hammerhead-2 and Hammerhead-3 really demonstrated three things : first of all, both had high-quality reservoirs. The DST on Hammerhead-3 showed very good mobility. And finally, very good connectivity. And the connectivity is actually between all 3 wells. So, all 3 wells are in pressure communication so that bodes well for a development. Now we\u2019re rolling all the results of this obviously into the development planned studies for that area. So, we\u2019re just not ready to announce anything but we are rolling all the data in earnest into the studies as we speak. Regarding your second question, you\u2019re right, we do have a lot of volume now underpinned really between the Liza complex and the Turbot complex, and we\u2019re also, in earnest, doing development studies on that area. Obviously, it\u2019s going to be a multi-FPSO kind of situation given the amount of volume we found. And then furthermore, as we look forward between now and the end of the year, we are going to do some more exploration drilling really along that northeastern part of the Stabroek Block between Turbot or southeastern block between Turbot and Liza. And we\u2019ll drill probably 3, potentially 4 additional wells or get them started this year, starting with Tripletail first and then 2 or 3 other prospects along that southeastern seaboard. So, continue to see a lot of upside into that area. But again, all that\u2019s being rolled into development studies as we speak. Doug Leggate : Thanks for the clarity, Greg. My follow-up is hopefully a quick one. You guys process a lot of third-party volumes, I believe on a payment in kind system in the Bakken. My question really relates to the oil mix relative to the NGL mix, I guess, in the liquids that you saw this quarter, it seemed that the oil mix dropped quite a bit. I wonder if you could speak to what\u2019s going on there and further, we should read through any material change to your expectations for oil mix going forward in your development area? And I\u2019ll leave it there. John Rielly : Sure, Doug. Thanks for that. And no, there shouldn\u2019t be any change in our mix going forward. So, let me just talk first at a high-level our Bakken asset. It is doing really well and it\u2019s in terms of, I\u2019ll call it, production overall production, capital and cost and specifically, oil production. So, what we had during the quarter, April and May were tough weather months and well availability was low, but June was really strong and July has been really strong. So, what we can tell you is we\u2019ve always said we\u2019re in this low to mid-60s oil cut, so let me just say 63%, 64%. You can feel comfortable using that number on our third quarter production guidance that we gave for Bakken. And you can see there that we\u2019re going to have a very strong oil production increase from the second to the third quarter. So then specifically, let me get to your point on the second quarter, what happened. As I mentioned, April and May were tough weather months, so well availability was low and that affected both oil and gas. Then if you look at our first quarter, we had a high oil cut of like 66% in that and it does get into the timing of gas capture, so we had additional gas capture in the second quarter. So, all else being equal, I would\u2019ve said our overall production would have been in the 136,000 to 137,000 area, with an oil cut percentage in that 63% to 64%. But now it gets to your, call it, payment in kind on the gas processing fee. So, we do have a percentage of our contracts at the Tioga Gas Plant that are percentage of proceeds or POP contracts. And so, what happened, obviously, between the first and second quarter with lower NGL and gas prices, we received more volumes for those contracts. So, all else being equal, we probably picked up 3,000 to 4,000 barrels a day of NGL sand gas, if you want call it barrels, in the second quarter. So that\u2019s why the oil cut is showing where it is. But let me just say, going forward we\u2019ve always said we\u2019re going to maintain this low to mid-60% oil cut all the way up to 200,000 barrels a day, so we are right on track for the 200,000 barrels a day. The Bakken asset team is executing really well and the plug and perf wells are doing really well. So, we\u2019re excited about the asset and the third quarter looks good. Doug Leggate : Appreciate on the detailed answer John. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Bob Brackett : Good morning. Quick question on the [indiscernible] prospect in the Guam, can you give us an update on the status of that? John Hess : Yes, Bob, so we are poised to begin drilling that in the third quarter so we will spud that well in the third quarter. And that\u2019s a tieback. If successful, that\u2019ll be a tieback Tubular Bells. Bob Brackett : Okay. And then a follow-up on Ranger 2, can you talk about what the purpose of the appraisal is? It looks like that well sits pretty high up on the structure as opposed to the edge of the structure. Are you looking at sort of the reservoir quality or what are you testing for? John Hess : Well, I think, Bob, you know the Ranger 1 well was drilled on the leeward side. It was drilled in a relatively safe position from a drilling standpoint. The Ranger 2 well, we\u2019re actually going to move to the windward side of the historic carbonate reef. So, we expect higher porosity because that\u2019s the portion of the reef that was subjected to wave action and also rainwater, et cetera. So, we\u2019re looking for reservoir quality there. We want to do a DST and that will help us also establish connectivity. Bob Brackett : Great. Thank you for that. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Roger Read : Yes, thank you good morning. Just wondering if we could come back to the change in the CapEx guidance and maybe give us an idea of where the efficiencies are flowing through the roughly $100 million decline? John Rielly : Roger, I wish I had an easy just one-off way but it really is across our portfolio, so it\u2019s been good execution. So, this is in Bakken, it\u2019s in Southeast Asia, Guyana, costs have been quite good. So, it really is across the portfolio. Same thing on the cash cost, the reduction there from the $13 to $14 per BOE down to the $12.50 to $13 BOE. We\u2019re seeing it across the portfolio. I guess probably on the capital the biggest piece would be the Bakken but it really is across the portfolio. Roger Read : So, we\u2019ll just call it a potpourri or something like that? John Rielly : Yes. That\u2019s a good name. Roger Read : Alright. And then kind of like the rest of the crowd here, I guess let\u2019s talk Guyana. As you think about the continued E&A process alongside the development, I mean, should we think about you being able to achieve as you go out, I believe to 2025 for the exploration program, being able to achieve everything you want on exploration with the existing rig fleet or do you think we\u2019ll see expansions there as, I guess, we all would like to see parallel development, continued execution on the original 5 FPSOs that are highlighted and then the ability to achieve all the exploration? Greg Hill : Yes. So, Roger, we do plan to add a fourth drillship to the theater and that will be initially focused on exploration on the Stabroek Block in the fourth quarter. Obviously, as we begin to get into Phase 2 drilling, etcetera, there will be a couple of rigs drilling development wells at that point in time. But these rigs are going to be flexible. They\u2019re going to move from E&A work depending on success, might move over to development for a while, come back the E&A. So, we are developing a great plan to get everything we want to get done from an E&A standpoint in time before exploration of the block. So we are developing a plan to do all of that. Roger Read : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. Greg Hill : Good morning. Brian Singer : Just a couple of additional follow-up questions on Guyana and the first does relate to exploration. You mentioned that some of the wells that are going to be drilled are in the southeast corridor upcoming. Can you just talk a little bit more beyond Ranger and there if you see any step out locations that you plan to drill with this fourth rig or otherwise over the next year? And specifically, away from the either between Ranger and Liza or a step out away from Ranger into potentially new structures carbonates or not? Greg Hill : No. So let me just, again, lay out the kind of drilling sequence for the next 6 months. So, first of all, we\u2019re going to drill the Ranger 2 appraisal well and then follow that with an extensive logging and quarrying program and DST. So, the rig will be on that location for a fair amount of time. The next rig will spud go back to the Tripletail well, so that\u2019s going to be the first exploration well in the second half of the year. And then beyond that, we anticipate 2 or 3 additional exploration wells that spud before the end of the year. With, as I mentioned earlier, the focus really being on drilling out the southeast part of the block between Turbot and Liza. So, really defining that southeastern corridor of the block and obviously, that is so that we can plan our developments down there, how many ships and how do we sequence them, et cetera. And then looking beyond that, of course, in 2020, we\u2019ll spud a well in Kaieteur block as well and then also on the Hess side, we\u2019ll have a Block 42 well in Suriname in 2020 also. But I think it\u2019s important that we continue to add to the inventory of exploration prospects on the block that represent multibillion barrels of upside. So, there is going to be an extensive E&A program over the next several years in Guyana for sure. Brian Singer : That\u2019s great. And my follow-up is, with regards to some of the discoveries that at least initially should get connected that you\u2019ve made like Haimara. Can you just talk about any new data or planning you\u2019ve seen and how you think about monetization there? Greg Hill : No. I think that\u2019s being rolled into our overall block development plans. And when and how Haimara plays in, not sure yet, it\u2019s certainly in the queue. But as far as sequencing, not clear yet. And part of it is we want to appraise some more and explore some more in and around that Haimara hub in the next 18 months, we\u2019ll say. Brian Singer : Great thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey of Mizuho. Your line is open. Paul Sankey : Hi good morning everyone. Greg, I guess this is very much a variation on the theme in terms of the exploration success and the, sort of, luxury problem you have in Guyana. Is there a point at which there is simply too much inventory and you change plans accordingly or is the very long-term potential nature of this development really mean the levels of activity that you\u2019ve really quite clearly outlined are fairly stable and are really anticipating major discoveries, therefore, plans don\u2019t change? Greg Hill : Yes, Paul, excellent question. No, we\u2019re taking a phased approach here, which we think is the most capital-efficient one and it will maximize our financial returns. So actually, from a financial return perspective, the roadmap that we\u2019ve laid out, which is getting Liza 2 on in mid-2022 after Liza 1, which actually is running ahead of schedule, on in the first quarter of 2020, that will be followed by Payara in 2023 and then the exploration and appraisal program that Greg\u2019s talking about is going to give us further definition about a fourth ship, which would probably be a year after Payara, and a fifth ship which would probably be a year after that one. And that really gives you the line of sight for the 5 ships. The exact sizing of the fourth and fifth ship is the reason we\u2019re doing the exploration and appraisal program. So, we\u2019re very comfortable about the financial requirements for that, and we\u2019re very excited about the financial returns we\u2019re getting from that. Obviously, further exploration drilling may have an impact on those ships in terms of sequencing and also identify further ships. But it\u2019s very manageable from a financial perspective, and we and Exxon and CNOOC are totally aligned about maximizing value from this opportunity that we have. Paul Sankey : If I can jump and if I could ask a follow-up, we\u2019ve had a lot of volatility in times passed regarding oil markets can you just update us on your latest thoughts for how Guyana will impact Gulf oil markets, given how things have changed over the past couple of years? John Hess : Well, I think Guyana being a very low-cost development with the first ship having a breakeven Brent price of $35 a barrel and the second ship having a breakeven price of $25 a barrel, they\u2019re going to be very well situated to fit into the world oil market. World oil market, as you know, is very much determined by demand and supply. The headwinds that we\u2019ve had and GDP growth worldwide are obviously having an impact on demand growth, demand is still growing, but at a slower rate as GDP grows at slower rate and then how shale, how these new developments and how OPEC all intersect to keep the market balanced to have a price high enough for investment and low enough for demand growth is obviously something that\u2019s unfolding. So, volatility is something we have to live with. And obviously, that\u2019s why we want to build a portfolio that has a low cost per barrel. So, we have resilient returns in almost any price environment. Paul Sankey : Thank you, John. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys good morning. John Rielly : Hi Paul. Unidentified Analyst : A couple of questions. I know that it\u2019s still early but I want to look at the preliminary outlook for the 2020 CapEx. I suppose that we should see the Bakken expense to be up on a full year after sixth rig. And then also the Guyana spending probably would be up given that the Phase 2 spending is going to ramp up probably pretty substantially. So maybe, John, you can help us to look at in those items that how the delta is going to change? John Rielly : Sure, Paul. Obviously, we\u2019ll give our guidance in for 2020 as per our normal practice in late 2019 or early 2020. But I think you can go back to our Investor Day in December 2018 and we laid out the plan that John just talked about as well. So, based on that, we do expect that capital and exploratory spend for 2020 to be approximately $3 billion as we had laid out. To your specific question, so Bakken, what\u2019s going to happen with Bakken, we have 6 rigs this year in Bakken and we\u2019ll have 6 rigs next year, and then we go down to the 4 rigs that we had talked about in 2021 and generate that $1 billion of free cash flow. So, the activity level is the same from that standpoint, so we\u2019re not expecting any big increases there in the Bakken. And obviously, as we talked about, we\u2019ve been getting some nice efficiencies there. Guyana, yes. That\u2019s as we\u2019re coming in at $2.8 billion this year, that\u2019s what we had expected per the Investor Day that there would be some increase in Guyana. And that will be the add in and we\u2019re perfectly comfortable with that exactly, as John Hess just laid out, and the timing of that with Phase 2 coming on in mid-2022. So, everything is going along according to plan. Bakken is executing well at 200,000 barrels a day. We\u2019re a quarter closer to starting up in Guyana. And so, you can expect that type of guidance when we get to 2020. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Two a quick one. One, I think you overlift by 6,000 barrels per day, maybe I missed it in your detailed remark. What\u2019s the earning and cash flow contribution for the quarter? And secondly, John, as you indicated rightfully that with the Phase I coming onstream next year, and so from that standpoint, and let\u2019s say you have a pretty strong balance sheet at this point, is it really necessary for us to have the hedging? What is the future hedging strategy going to look like? John Rielly : Sure. So just starting with the overlifts, so you can probably tell by our tax line that one of the big overlifts was in Libya, so overall, we had about, let me just call it, 200,000 barrels a day in Libya, we had 200,000 barrels a day in Denmark and we also had a 200,000 barrel a day overlift with JDA, offset by North Malay Basin being under 200,000 barrels. So, what happened is just from an overall earning standpoint it was immaterial, since Libya and Denmark driving that overlift. So, nothing material there. Then as far as we\u2019re looking on, yes, with our program that we have going forward, we do intend to put hedges on for 2020. We just think it\u2019s a prudent thing to do, as we just discussed or John Hess just discussed, the oil price volatility. So, it\u2019s just something that we want to do from an insurance standpoint to make sure that we can execute this great program that we have. So, you can expect us to subject to market conditions to adding hedges for 2020. Unidentified Analyst : The only comment I would make is that seems like everyone lost money over the long haul in hedging. So, I\u2019m not sure that is really for the benefit for the shareholder. Anyways thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Yes. My first question is for Greg. Greg, I was wondering, you did 39 wells in the Bakken in 2Q and I was wondering if you guys have tested some of the areas such as Goliath or Red Sky or some of the areas perhaps outside of your kind of core development area, key, etcetera? Greg Hill : Yes. So first of all, let me say that we have, and we don\u2019t have a lot of wells out there yet. But what I will say is that the wells drilled to-date in those areas are meeting expectations, that\u2019s with returns in the order of 40% to 50% at $60 a barrel. Our plan for those areas in 2019 is to drill about 25 wells, and we\u2019re going to be testing kind of different completion designs and well spacing in order to try and further optimize their development in these areas. As you recall, we\u2019ve got at least a 15-year inventory of wells that exceeds 50% IRRs at $60 a barrel. And I expect with the optimization that we\u2019re going to do this year in those areas like Goliath and Red Sky, that \u2013 I expect that inventory is probably going to grow as a result of that optimization. Arun Jayaram : Great. And this one\u2019s for John Rielly. John, you gave us some great color on overall production guidance and as well as your thoughts on the Bakken oil mix. Could you help us with your thoughts on a range of oil production versus the BOE total for Q3 and Q4? John Hess : So if you were looking at where we were kind of the first two quarters and you\u2019re saying overall production, we \u2013 our oil was 52% of our production in the first quarter and was 52% in the second quarter. So I would say \u2013 are you doing \u2013 and this is overall I\u2019m talking about. Arun Jayaram : Overall? Right. John Hess : Overall, yes, company guidance. So for the third quarter, I would expect it to go up slightly driven by good Bakken oil production growth. Arun Jayaram : Fair enough. And just to sneak one more in, the Llano, is it the number 5 well. Can you remind us what kind of production impact that will be on a net basis? Greg Hill : Yes. So on a growth base, it\u2019ll be between 8,000 and 10,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter and we have half of that. So the net would be half of that. Arun Jayaram : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Jeffrey Campbell : Good morning. The press release mentioned improved well performance in the Bakken. I was just wondering, was this anticipated from the shift to plug and perf or was this something in addition to that? Greg Hill : No. I think this is really referencing the shift to plug and perf. And those are delivering, again, about a 15% increase in IP180 and a 5% to 10% increase in EUR versus our previous sliding sleeve design. And our whole program for 2019 \u2013 on average, EURs are going to be about 1 million barrels, IP 180s between 120% and 125% and the IRRs at 60% between 60% and 100% for the program this year. So a very strong program and we\u2019re extremely pleased with the results and the Bakken is doing very well. Jeffrey Campbell : Okay. And referring to the Slide 21 of the May presentation. Discussed tighter well spacing for higher Bakken net present value in the \u2013 for the drilling acreage, I was just wondering, if you\u2019ve settled on optimal spacing in your core areas or are you still testing closer spacing in certain areas? Greg Hill : No. I think the 9 and 8 configuration in the core that we\u2019re pretty settled on. I think the optimization that could occur is as you get out into Tier 2 acreage, I\u2019ll call it, although it\u2019s all really good acreage, you might actually widen the spacing as you get out there. And why do I say that because our objective is to maximize DSU NPV. So it\u2019s going to be that equation of profit loading, well spacing, et cetera, to basically maximize DSU NPV. So you might change the well spacing, you may not be as tight as you go out into the other acreage. Jeffrey Campbell : Okay. And if I sneak one last one in there, just going back to Hammerhead real quick, I was just wondering are there any further Hammerhead tests in the current plans or are the 3 wells that you\u2019ve discussed sufficient to determine next steps? Greg Hill : Yes. I think we have got enough well data and evaluation data to determine next steps. Jeffrey Campbell : Okay, great. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is open. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for taking the question. It\u2019s not a huge part of your U.S. production mix but you did have 17 Bcf of gas last quarter and in that context with Henry Hub hovering around $2 obviously Bakken pricing is below that. What\u2019s the point where you might resort to shutting in wells? John Hess : No. We don\u2019t see us shutting in wells there. So again, a lot of what we have is associated gas with our Bakken well. So, we wouldn\u2019t be shutting in anything. Also you have to remember the Bakken gas stream has probably 3 times the amount of liquids in it than most other shale wells. So as a consequence in the rest of the country, we are in a pretty good position to optimize our net backs even though the natural gas price and NGL prices are down, they are still accretive to our overall net backs. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. And in that same context what\u2019s your stance on flaring and the latest status update on that? Greg Hill : Yes. We are well within regulatory requirements. And I think in particularly, as LM4 south of the river gas plant comes on, our joint venture with Targa, which is actually imminently on that will substantially drop our flaring south of the river and we will be substantially below regulatory requirements at that point in time. So, flaring is not an issue for us, it\u2019s not a problem for us, particularly with LM4. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you Andrew. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. Now, as usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer, Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you Jay. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I will provide a strategy update, then Greg Hill will discuss our operating performance and John Riley will review our financial results. We continued to execute our strategy of disciplined capital allocation, focusing only on low-cost, high-return opportunities. We had another strong quarter, delivering higher production and lower capital and exploratory expenditures than our previous guidance. Our portfolio with Guyana and the Bakken as our growth engines and Malaysia and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as our cash engines is on track to deliver industry-leading performance in terms of financial returns, cash flow growth and a portfolio breakeven below $40 per barrel Brent by 2025. A key part of our strategy is maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. With $1.9 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter, we are in a strong financial position to fund our high-return growth projects across a range of prices. As a result of strong execution throughout the portfolio, we have reduced our full-year 2019 capital and exploratory expenditures guidance by further $100 million to $2.7 billion. Earlier this month, Hess Midstream Partners announced plans to convert to an Up-C structure and acquire Hess Infrastructure Partners, including its oil and gas midstream interests, water services business, outstanding economic general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in Hess Midstream Partners. Upon completion of this transaction, which is expected in the fourth quarter, Hess Corporation will receive approximately $275 million in cash and will own approximately $134 million units or 47% of the new Hess Midstream consolidated entity valued net to Hess at approximately $2.85 billion as of last night's close. Cash proceeds will be used to fund our world-class investments in Guyana and the Bakken where we plan to invest more than 75% of our capital expenditures over the next five years. Turning to Guyana. On the Stabroek Block where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, gross discovered recoverable resources are estimated at more than six billion barrels of oil equivalent with multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. In September, we announced a 1fourth discovery on the Block at the Tripletail-1 well located in the Turbot area approximately three miles northeast of the Longtail discovery. The well encountered approximately 108 feet of a high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. Subsequently, additional hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs have been encountered below the previously announced Tripletail discovery. Tripletail is still under evaluation and will further underpin the Turbot area as a major development hub. During the quarter, drilling and appraisal activities were completed at Hammerhead with encouraging results, including a successful drill stem test. These results are being evaluated for potential future development. Also, drilling and evaluation activities continue on the Ranger 2 well with the objective of appraising the Ranger oil discovery. In terms of our developments, the Liza Phase 1 development is now targeted to start up in December and will produce up to 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day utilizing the Liza Destiny floating production storage and offloading vessel or FPSO, which arrived in Guyana on August 29. The Liza Phase 2 development is also progressing to plan and will use a second FPSO, the Liza Unity with a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day. First oil is expected by mid-2022. Planning is underway for a third development at Payara, which will use an FPSO with gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and first production from Payara is expected in 2023. We are also seeing positive results from our focused exploration program in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where we have acquired 60 blocks over the past five years for approximately $120 million to pursue high-return infrastructure led and hub class prospects. Yesterday, we announced the successful oil discovery at the Esox-1 exploration well in Mississippi Canyon, which encountered approximately 191 feet of net pay in the high-quality oil-bearing Miocene reservoir. Hess is the operator and holds a 57.14% interest. We expect to commence production in the first quarter of 2020. Esox will be a low cost tieback to the Tubular Bells production facilities and is expected to generate strong financial returns. We also plan to spud the Oldfield well by the end of the year. Kosmos is the operator and Hess has a 60% interest in this prospect, which is located approximately six miles east of the Esox-1 well. Moving to the Bakken. Our transition to plug and perf completions has been very successful and we are seeing the expected uplift in initial production rates, in estimated ultimate recovery and most importantly in value. Net production in the Bakken is on track to reach approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021. We then plan to reduce our current six rig program to four rigs, which will enable us to maintain production of approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, resulting in material free cash flow generation across the range of prices. Now, turning to our financial results. In the third quarter, we posted a net loss of $205 million or $0.68 per share, compared to a net loss of $42 million or $0.18 per share in the year ago quarter. On an adjusted basis, we posted a net loss of $98 million or $0.32 per share, compared with adjusted net income of $29 million or $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Compared to our third quarter 2018, our financial results primarily reflect lower realized selling prices, which were partially offset by reduced exploration expenses. Third quarter net production averaged 290,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, up from 279,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the year ago quarter. For the full year 2019, we are raising our guidance for net production to approximately 285,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, up from our previous guidance range of 275,000 to 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Third quarter net production in the Bakken averaged 163,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 38% from 118,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day a year ago. For the full year 2019, we are raising our guidance for the Bakken net production to approximately 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from our previous guidance range of 140,000 to 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In summary, our strategy of disciplined capital allocation and a focused portfolio of assets is achieving positive results and uniquely positions our company to deliver increasing and strong financial returns, visible and low risk production growth and significant free cash flow. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks John. I would like to provide an update on our progress in 2019 as we continue to execute our strategy, starting with production. In the third quarter, net production averaged 290,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was above our guidance range for the quarter of 270,000 to 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Based on this strong year-to-date performance, we are increasing our full year 2019 net production guidance, excluding Libya, to approximately 285,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our previous guidance range of 275,000 to 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We expect fourth quarter production to average approximately 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day on the same basis. In the Bakken, third quarter net production averaged 163,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, significantly above our guidance range of 145,000 to 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and nearly 40% higher than the year ago quarter. Compared to the second quarter, net oil production was up by 12% as a result of continuing strong performance from our plug and perf completions. Natural gas and NGL volumes were also higher in the third quarter as a result of increased gas capture from the startup of the Little Missouri 4 gas plant in late July and the decline in NGL prices during the quarter, which increased our entitlement from gas processing contracts operating under percentage of proceeds agreements in the Bakken. During the third quarter, we brought 33 new wells online and over the fourth quarter, we now expect to bring online between 55 and 60 new wells. For the full year 2019, we expect to bring online approximately 155 new wells, which is slightly below our original guidance of 160 wells, primarily due to weather related issues earlier this year. For full year 2019, with stronger well performance more than offsetting fewer new wells coming online, we now forecast Bakken net production will average approximately 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our previous guidance range of 140,000 to 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the fourth quarter, Bakken production is expected to average approximately 165,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This modest increase from the third quarter reflects the back-end loaded completions program, contingency for winter weather and our expectation for seasonally higher NGL prices, which may reduce our entitlement from percentage of proceeds contracts. In the third quarter, our average drilling and completion costs were $6.7 million per well, down to 8% from $7.3 million in the first quarter. Through the continued application of lean manufacturing, we expect to achieve further cost reductions as we progress towards our targeted drilling and completion costs of $6 million per well. Overall, we remain firmly on track to deliver net production of 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2021 while continuing to drive down well costs. Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 59,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, reflecting planned maintenance and downtime associated with Hurricane Barry in July, which reduced third quarter net production by approximately 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The gradual ramp-up of the Llano-5 well in which Hess has a 50% working interest has been underway since July when the well was first brought on production. The well is approaching its peak rate, with current production at approximately 8,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our infrastructure led exploration in the Gulf of Mexico is also proving successful. Yesterday, we announced an oil discovery at the Hess operated Esox-1 exploration well in which Hess holds a 57.14% interest. The well encountered approximately 191 feet of net pay in high-quality light oil bearing Miocene age reservoir. Planning is now underway to tie back to the well into an existing slot at the Tubular Bells production facility during the first quarter of 2020. We also plan to spud another infrastructure led exploration well by year end on the Oldfield prospect approximately six miles east of Esox-1 in which Cosmos is the operator and Hess has a 60% interest. Turning to Southeast Asia. Net production averaged 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter, reflecting the completion of a successful two week planned shutdown for maintenance activities at the joint development area. Now turning to Guyana, where exploration success on the Stabroek block continues and development activities are progressing to plan. Last month, we announced an oil discovery at the Tripletail-1 well located in the Turbot area approximately three miles northeast of Longtail discovery. Tripletail-1 is our fourth discovery in 2019 and brings the total number of discoveries on the block to-date to 14. The well was drilled in 6,572 feet of water and encountered approximately 108 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. Drilling operations and evaluation are ongoing with additional hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs encountered below the previously announced discovery. Following completion of activities at Tripletail, the Noble Tom Madden drillship will next drill the Uaru-1 prospect located approximately 10 miles east of the Liza-1 well. Also on the block, the Stena Carron drillship is currently conducting well operations on the Ranger-2 appraisal well, which includes an extensive logging and quarrying program. Following Ranger-2, the rig will move to the previously announced Yellowtail-1 discovery to conduct a production test. A fourth drillship, the Noble Don Taylor is expected to arrive in Guyana in November and will drill the Mako-1 exploration well, located approximately six miles south of the Liza-1 well. Turning to our Guyana developments. The Liza Phase 1 project is now targeted to achieve first oil in December. The Liza Destiny FPSO with a gross production capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day arrived in Guyana on August 29. Drilling of the Liza Phase 1 development wells by the Noble Bob Douglas drillship is proceeding to plan and subsea installation is nearly complete. Liza Phase 2, sanctioned in May of this year, will utilize the Liza Unity FPSO, which will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and will develop approximately 600 million barrels of oil. The hole is nearing completion and is expected to sail to the Keppel yard in Singapore by year-end where the topside modules will be installed and the vessel commissioned. Development drilling of Liza Phase 2 will commence in the first quarter of 2020 with first oil expected by mid-2022. Pending government approvals, a third development at Payara is planned to utilize an FPSO with a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and is expected to achieve first oil in 2023. In closing, our execution continues to be strong. In 2019, we are on track to deliver higher production on lower capital and exploratory expenditures than previously guided. Our offshore cash engines continue to generate significant free cash flow. The Bakken is on a strong capital efficient growth trajectory. Our Gulf of Mexico exploration program is proving to be successful and Guyana continues to get bigger and better, all of which position us to deliver industry-leading returns, material free cash flow generation and significant shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2019 to the second quarter of 2019. We incurred a net loss of $205 million in the third quarter of 2019, compared to a net loss of $6 million in the second quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we incurred a net loss of $98 million in the third quarter of 2019, compared to a net loss of $28 million in the previous quarter. Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $34 million in the third quarter of 2019, compared to net income of $46 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the third quarter and second quarter of 2019 were as follows. Higher sales volumes increased results by $63 million. Lower realized selling prices decreased results by $66 million. Higher DD&A expense decreased results by $48 million. Higher cash cost decreased results by $24 million. All other items decreased results by $5 million for an overall decrease in third quarter results of $80 million. Turning to midstream. The midstream segment had net income of $39 million in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $35 million in the second quarter of 2019. Midstream EBITDA before non-controlling interest amounted to $133 million in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $127 million in the previous quarter. Turning to corporate. On an adjusted basis, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $103 million in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $109 million in the previous quarter. Now to our financial position. At quarter-end, cash and cash equivalents were $1.9 billion excluding midstream and total liquidity was $5.7 billion including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $5.6 billion. As John Hess mentioned, we will receive approximately $275 million in cash upon completion of Hess Midstream Partners' acquisition of Hess Infrastructure Partners, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year. In the third quarter of 2019, net cash provided from operating activities was $443 million or $543 million before changes in working capital and items affecting comparability. Cash expenditures for investing activities were $721 million in the third quarter. Now, turning to guidance, first for E&P. In the third quarter, our E&P cash costs were $12.13 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $12.75 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, which beat guidance on higher production than forecast. We project E&P cash cost, excluding Libya, in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $12.50 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent and full-year 2019 cash cost to be unchanged at $12.50 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent. DD&A expense in the third quarter was $17.67 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $18.79 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya. DD&A expense excluding Libya is forecast to be in the range of $17.50 to $18.50 per barrel of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter and $18 to $18.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year, which is at the lower end of previous guidance. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $30 to $32 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and $30.50 to $31.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2019. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $75 million in the fourth quarter with full year guidance expected to be in the range of $190 million to $195 million, which is down from previous guidance of $200 million to $210 million. The midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $250 million for the fourth quarter and full year guidance is expected to be approximately $725 million. The increase in fourth quarter tariff expense compared with the third quarter is due to an anticipated increase in midstream volumes during by increasing third-party throughput with the ramp up of the Little Missouri 4 gas processing plant in North Dakota. The E&P effective tax rate, excluding Libya, is expected to be an expense in the range of 0% to 4% for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our crude oil hedge positions remain unchanged. We have 95,000 barrels of oil per day hedged for the remainder of 2019 with $60 WTI put option contracts. We expect non-cash option premium amortization to be approximately $29 million for the fourth quarter. Full year E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are now expected to be approximately $2.7 billion, down $100 million from previous guidance. The reduced spend reflects efficiencies across the portfolio but primarily in the Bakken, where we have reduced well costs and the number of wells expected to be completed for the year, while being on track to exceed our original production guidance for the year. For midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the midstream segment, excluding specials, to be approximately $55 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $165 million for the full year. For corporate, for the fourth quarter of 2019, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, with full year guidance unchanged at $110 million to $115 million. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million for the fourth quarter with the full year guidance unchanged at $315 million to $320 million. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Devin McDermott, Morgan Stanley. Devin McDermott : Good morning. Congrats on the strong results today. John Hess : Thanks Devin. Devin McDermott : So my first question is actually on the Bakken. And it's been one of the strong points in the portfolio each quarter so far this year, despite some of the weather headwinds. So it's a bit of a two-part question. The first one is, one of the areas of strength on production this quarter was on the higher gas and NGL volumes and you mentioned that part of that was the Little Missouri 4 plant startup and part of that was the POP contracts, some of which reverses into the fourth quarter. I was wondering just how you are thinking about with that reversal, the normalized oil mix going forward and as a rule of thumb on how we can think about the sensitivity around those POP contracts? And then the second part of the question is stepping back, as you think about this transition to plug and perf and how it's gone relative to the expectations, it seems like the results have been beating at least the guidance that you laid out at the Investor Day last year, particularly on cost side. So what opportunities have you found to drive down costs so far and what opportunities do you see going forward to further cut cost out of the system and improve returns there? John Hess : Okay. Let me take your first question. So yes, you are right. This is a really good thing. The volumes in the third quarter due to higher midstream capture. So the first thing I want to say that is it's not a reservoir issue at all. There is no material change in the GOR at the wellhead. I think it's important to note that in the third quarter we had very strong oil production growth. So, it was 12% increase versus the Q2 level. So, the oil is doing great. And as you mentioned, the higher natural gas and NGL volumes amounted to about 7,000 barrels a day and that was due to two things. First of all, the increased capture from the Little Missouri 4 gas plant that came on in July. And then secondly, as you mentioned, the higher gas and NGL entitlement under our POP contracts. Now how those POP contracts are going to perform in the future is obviously going to be a function of NGL prices. Seasonally, in the fourth quarter, we lowered our expectations for those typically because NGL prices are higher with the weather. Now as we look forward, I think what we can say is that we expect that the Bakken oil percentage is going to average approximately 60%, low-60s on a go forward basis. Now, one other thing I will say is, if NGL prices stay low, there is a chance that it will actually be higher than the 200,000 barrels a day as a result of additional POP volume. So this is all a very good thing. Now, on your second question in terms of performance of the Bakken wells, you are right. Extremely pleased with the performance of the team, both not only on the productivity side. So the plug and perf is, on average, exactly on track with what we expected. The 15% uplift in IP180s, the 5% uplift in EURs, well on track for that. But the second thing I am really proud of the team on is their performance on the cost side. Recall, we started the first quarter of the year at $7.3 million a well. Second quarter, we came in at $7 million a well. And the third quarter, we came in at $6.7 million a well. Now all of that is lean manufacturing gains primarily. We are also doing some technology things where we ran some fiber-optic in the wells that allowed us to reduce our stage count and that also led to our lower well cost. Now we are marching our way towards the $6 million a well that we talked about at Investor Day and if we are successful in achieving that $6 million well cost, it's going to add a further $1 billion to the NPV of the Bakken. So we are well on track from a productivity standpoint and a well cost standpoint. Devin McDermott : Great. So pretty impressive improvement there. And just one more, if I may, is actually on the Gulf of Mexico. And I think it's been a strong area of the portfolio that probably doesn't get as much attention as it may be should. And you mentioned you picked up 60 new blocks over the past few years there and we had the Esox discovery announced yesterday. And at a high level, how should we think about the Gulf of Mexico and the role of the portfolio going forward in terms of investment level, production profile and also the cadence of the exploration here over the next few quarters and into 2020? John Hess : Yes. Sure. So obviously, it's a very important part of the portfolio, strong cash generation. We have outstanding capability there, not only in terms of exploration but also project delivery. So the way we think about the Gulf of Mexico is, think of it as being relatively flat at about 65,000 barrels a day over the next several years. And we are confident that we can keep it at that level really through a combination of high-value, short-cycle exploitation projects and infrastructure-led exploration. A couple of examples of that. Obviously the Llano-5 well, which we talked about in our opening remarks, still ramping but producing 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, net to us. And then in terms of ILX, the Esox-1 discovery, which we are very pleased with the outcome of the well, 191 feet of light oil-bearing high-quality Miocene reservoir, exceeding our pre-drill expectations. And the thing I would say about Esox is, this is not your typical tieback in terms of size. This is a significant discovery that's going to generate very high returns and cash flow, particularly since it's tied into that existing slot and will be brought online very quickly. So discovery to first oil is a matter of a few months. Now the evaluation of that well, the result is still ongoing. And we intend to provide further updates including a resource estimate, production rate, et cetera early next year after we have some dynamic production data. But I really wanted to highlight Esox, because I think it's a great example of what we think we can do in the Gulf in the short term and the next well up, which is similar to Esox is the Oilfield ILX well. Now beyond that, we will need a new hub to keep it flat or grow it. And as we have acquired those leases over the past five years that John mentioned in his opening remarks, we see some 25 leads and prospects in there. So we have got a fairly healthy inventory. John Rielly : And you can assume it for capital planning purposes, this would be within our long term capital plan and probably have two wells a year. It might be infrastructure-led, hub class, all infrastructure-led, all hub class, but about two shots on goal a year. Devin McDermott : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. John Hess : Good morning. John Rielly : Good morning. Roger Read : I guess maybe you kind of answered one of the questions I was going to ask. If we think about CapEx next year with fewer wells this year in the Bakken and then the Esox development, do we have any thought process at this point on 2020 CapEx, whether maybe the bias is to the upside with those two factors, maybe more wells in the Bakken as a catch-up? And then anything in the Gulf? John Rielly : No. Roger, this was all part of our plan. Now, we will give guidance for 2020 in January. But kind of I mentioned it on the last call and consistent with our Investor Day, we expect our capital and exploratory spend for 2020 to be approximately $3 billion. And it's going to be exactly what we said back in that Investor Day. We are only investing in that high-return, low-cost opportunities like Esox that you just mentioned in order to grow that free cash flow in a disciplined and reliable manner. But our capital really through 2025, 75% of forward spend is going to be allocated to our world-class assets in Guyana and the Bakken and everything you talked about now with wells, we do expect to be more efficient in the Bakken, because as with lean, we will reduce the cost, we will get maybe more wells in 2020 verses 2019. But that's all factored into that $3 billion spend that I mentioned. Roger Read : Okay. Great. And then the commentary about the Llano-5 well kind of ramping up and looking at Guyana starting production in December of 2019, what's the right way we should think about how that field will start up? I know you are not the operator. But is that a phased kind of say thing? We are going to be pretty careful with the wells? Or there is enough understanding that we should think about those, I think it's eight wells in total just kind of coming on in rapid succession. John Rielly : No. I think you should assume a three to four month ramp in production. We want to get a lot of dynamic data, including some potential build-ups along the way. So this was all designed to slowly ramp the wells up and see what we have got going on the reservoir. First well is in the reservoir. That's not uncommon in deepwater to do that. John Hess : And I think another point that needs to be made is the production ramp-up from first oil discovery to production in five years is industry-leading performance and we are very proud of the job. The joint venture is done, specifically ExxonMobil as our operator in bringing that forward and that's going to auger well for our future developments as well. Roger Read : Great. Thank you. I will leave it there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate, Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Hi. Yes. Good morning. That was a good effort. Good morning everybody. I guess, John, maybe I could kick off, John or Greg, just kick off with Guyana. We have been on Ranger now for quite a while and I just want to make sure I am not reading too much into your language, John, about difference between evaluate with the intention of appraising. Can you just give us any early prognosis that you have currently? And I guess, Greg specifically, the thing I guess we are all watching here is you were planning a flow test, as I understand it. What has been the conclusion of pressure communication with the Ranger-1? Because I guess that's going to be the key thing here is whether or not we have got compartmentalization or whether we have got a viable development. Anything you can share there? And I have got a follow-up, please? Greg Hill : Yes. Doug, what I can say is that on Ranger, drilling and evaluation are ongoing. As you recall, we have got a very extensive logging, coring program, et cetera on this well. But what I can say is that, however, based on the logs and core that is taken so far, we have seen encouraging reservoir development, confirmation of the presence of oil. So that's about all we can say at this point in time. So stay tuned. There's a lot of operations ongoing on the well. Doug Leggate : Maybe just press you a little bit on this, Greg. Is there anything that's disappointed you on Ranger? Greg Hill : Not to-date. Doug Leggate : Okay. My follow-up is also Guyana-related because obviously, we are going to see a change in reporting here in terms of how the earnings and cash flow are going to flow through. I am just wondering, John Reilly, if there is any help you can give the street in terms of how this is going to play out? Because you will obviously have to report tax associated with this. But as we all know, there is no tax. So is there any way you can -- how are you going to navigate this going forward, because it is going to be such a large part of the portfolio of cash flow going forward? Because headline earnings, if I am not mistaken, are going to be kind of all over the place when this thing comes online. So any help you can offer? And I will leave it there. Thank you. John Rielly : Sure, Doug. And really what I will do is on the January call that we gave the forecast for the year, that's when we will give some more detailed explanations on this. But you are exactly right. So the way that contract works after the cost recovery, the profit oil, they split for the government and the working interest owners. And the government out of its profit oil pays for the taxes of the working interest owners. So what that requires us to do is record a tax. So we will have a tax line associated with our Guyana production and then what you have is up above in revenue essentially additional barrels being recorded to offset that tax. So the revenue line up above will offset that tax line. Now we will lay that out as we get through the year and I will get through the full forecast, we get Exxon's numbers and then put it together with all our numbers, I will lay out what the tax rate looks like for next year. It can be a little more specific about Guyana. But you are exactly right. Whatever taxes that show up there do not affect the bottom line cash flow from our Guyana production. Doug Leggate : Okay. I know it's going to be complicated, but I appreciate the answers. Thanks, fellows. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer, Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. Two Guyana bigger picture questions. The first is, can you broadly speak to how you see the cost structure of future projects evolving? You benefited from the dearth of international project sanctions and low oil services activity? Now oil services companies on the margin are highlighting some inflection in international activity. How do you see cost evolving for future projects, the efficiency side of the equation versus the service cost outlook? John Rielly : If you look at the deepwater offshore service sector, it continues to be over-supplied, given the extended period of low activity. And as you mentioned, I think also the industry's focus on efficiency and simplification and standardization continues to drive unit cost down. So as a result, we expect to see minimal cost inflation on that front. Brian Singer : Great. Thanks. And then my follow-up is on the gas condensate discoveries at Haimara and Pluma. Can you just talk about any update there on the process of determining the timing, if at all, of development? And how you would see the rates of return there relative to the other options? Greg Hill : No. I think these reservoirs will be developed, but certainly they won't be part of the first five FPSOs that we have discussed getting us to the 750,000 barrels a day in 2025. So it will be after that. But they are still very good reservoirs, very good fluids. So they will be developed at some point. John Hess : And our exploration and appraisal program that we are doing this year, last of which is Tripletail, which is still under evaluation, is going to give us more granularity to sort of give guidance on what the fourth and fifth ship or potentially a sixth ship in that southeastern Turbot Hub area. So I would think next year we can give more clarity on the phasing of the fourth and fifth ship and future ships potentially thereafter. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Hi. Good morning. I had a question around the commissioning of Liza Destiny. Does the Noble Bob Douglas drillship, what does it do as you get toward commissioning? Is that going to get repurposed? Will that stand by to drill further wells? John Rielly : No. It will stay there and just finish out the drilling of both producers and injectors for the Liza Field. Bob Brackett : So the initial ramp will be a partial set of injectors and producers and then drilling will continue during that kind of three to four month ramp? John Rielly : Yes, it will. Bob Brackett : Okay. That makes sense. That's all I had. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber, Citigroup. Scott Gruber : Yes. Good morning. John Rielly : Good morning. Scott Gruber : I may have missed it earlier, but any color you can provide on Bakken wells you brought online in 4Q? John Hess : In terms of basically, the Bakken program in general continues to meet all expectations. We are on track for the 15% on average IP180 increase due to the plug and perf. We are on track for the 120,000 to 125,000 barrels of oil of IP180. So basically all on track. There was nothing remarkable necessarily about the third quarter. Now, we did have lower wells online, but they did outperform in the third quarter. Scott Gruber : Got it. And just as you consider Bakken CapEx for next year, it sounds like this year there's a lot of general process improvement and efficiency improvement. But as you think about Bakken CapEx next year, do you anticipate incorporating service cost deflation and any color on order of magnitude? John Rielly : So to your point, Scott, we are not seeing pressure on costs in North Dakota. And obviously, with the decline in the rig count, that helps from the cost standpoint. So at this point right now what we are more focused on is, as Greg said earlier, are just driving our lean manufacturing and continuing to drive down those well costs with our goal of getting to a six million D&C well. So when you are looking at capital next year, we will have some reductions baked in for our efficiencies for those well costs, not really for cost deflation or anything like that, just our lean manufacturing, offset by with our efficiencies, there will be more wells that gets drilled next year, just again as we get better and better drilling the plug and perf. So that's kind of how we are laying out the program for next year. And remember, as John has mentioned earlier, it's six rigs for 2020. Scott Gruber : Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi. Good morning everyone. John Hess : Good morning. Jeanine Wai : Good morning. The Bakken, it's outperforming this year and you just increased the full year production guide. So I just wanted to follow-up from some of the prior questions. So could this outperformance potentially bias the plan to level load at that 200,000 barrels a day? And I think I heard you say earlier in the call that it could be higher than 200,000 barrels a day, but I think that was more related to your NGL contracts. So I guess, if you think about achieving your target, could you do it on less wells and less CapEx? Or would you rather kind of let things float and have higher production and maybe kind of higher free cash flow? And I know there's a lot of moving pieces, but kind of similar to what other people have been saying, there's been, a lot of your recent activity suggests that you have a lot of other opportunities in the portfolio. And I also think there are some infrastructure considerations on that 200,000 a day. So I wanted to check in on that to see if that's a limiting factor. Greg Hill : Yes. Well, first of all, let me say there is no infrastructure constraints at all for us to make it to the 200,000 barrels a day. We are still on track to deliver 200,000 barrels a day in 2021, a six-rig program next year and then after that we will drop the rig count to four and as you suggested in your remarks, we will then hold that production flat for a number of years at 200,000 barrels a day. And as a result of dropping four rigs, we will be generating significant free cash flow, $800 million to $1 billion of free cash flow, once we drop the rig count to four. So it becomes a very significant cash flow generator for the company. We do get asked why not go higher than 200,000 barrels? If you look at the infrastructure required to build for a bigger peak, it doesn't make economic sense to do that. So the right thing to do from an overall value standpoint is hold it at 200,000 barrels a day. And you are right, the POP contracts are going to ebb and flow with prices. And what I mentioned was, if NGL prices stay chronically low, we could be above 200,000 barrels a day as a result of those additional NGL volumes that we would capture. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And my follow-up, again, it's on the Bakken. There's been a lot of talk about well cost reductions and performance. In terms of the base production, we have heard commentary from other operators that making sure that your base is performing well is some of the highest return on CapEx dollars you can spend. So is better performance on the PDPs a component of what's going on with the higher Bakken production? Greg Hill : It is. I mean, the base continues to hang in there achieving or beating expectations. So we see no problems in the base production. And then, of course, you have the new wells which you are doing much better with the plug and perf design. That's how we are continuing to overachieve in the Bakken. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Greg Hill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Yes. Good morning. Greg, I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on whether the oil mix in the Bakken should hold relatively flat in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? And it sounds like you still remain comfortable in terms of the 2021 outlook of 200 MBOE per day with a low 60% oil mix. Is that correct? Greg Hill : Yes, we do. Yes, we are very confident in that number. As I said, probably what's going to effect fourth quarter mix again is the NGL pricing. Does that go up or down? Because always, when this oil volume, always when this gas percentage fluctuates in the Bakken, it's purely due to the midstream, it's increased gas capture and it's POP contracts. That's the only thing providing really the variation. If I look at wellhead GORs, those are staying the same. So, it's purely a midstream issue and the result of how we consolidate our volumes on the balance sheet. Arun Jayaram : Okay. But at the 165, you would assume it pretty similar to the guide, I believe? John Rielly : Yes. And again, it all does depend on the NGL pricing as we go forward. So we have estimated NGL prices going up. So it will be a little bit less from the POP contracts. But yes, just as Greg said, we believe we can keep this low-60 with, kind of call it, a normalized NGL price. But I guess the point I think Greg was trying to point out is, is you don't need to focus really on that, right. Our oil production was up 12% quarter-on-quarter. It's going really strong. Everything is going really well in the Bakken from an execution standpoint and a reservoir standpoint. And we will get fluctuations on the gas and the NGLs just due to pricing and gas capture. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. And then just my follow-up. Liza-1 is coming online a bit early. I was wondering if you could help us better understand how long the ramp would be to full productive capacity at 120. And also, John, maybe you could give us some thoughts on the operating costs. Once you do get the capacity, I think you did lease the vehicle -- the vessel, pardon me. So I was just wondering if you could give us maybe some broader thoughts on op costs as well per barrel. Greg Hill : Yes. Again, Arun, I think you can assume a three to four month ramp on Liza-1 to get to the 120. And again, that's not uncommon for first wells in field in a deepwater reservoir, because you really want to see how those wells are performing. You will gradually increase the chokes. You may do some shut-ins to get some build-ups. You really want to understand the dynamic nature of the reservoir, again not uncommon at all in deepwater. John Rielly : And then, Arun, as far as the cost per barrel that will produce, obviously we will get the full guidance as we go out in January. So we will obviously have the ramp, right. So you will have a higher cost per BOE as we are doing the ramp here. Then as it moves on, you are right, we have it leased here for a period of time, which is adding $3-ish per barrel on the cost. So it will be above $10 cash cost per BOE on Phase 1 here on the ramp until that FPSO, which the plan would be later on to be purchased, which would drop that $3 off the op cost and move it to the DD&A line. But this will be a good low-cost addition to our portfolio. So again, it's part of this plan. The Phase 1 will begin to take down our cash cost. Phase 2 will even do it more as we get the bigger ship and more production on at that point. Arun Jayaram : Great. So the cash cost excluding the leasing cost would be $6 to $7 per barrel. Something like that? John Rielly : No. It will be a little bit higher than that number. So it will be a little bit above the $10. So you can do let's just call it around $12-ish in that type of range and then you can drop just to a little bit under 10 after the FPSO is purchased. But we will give full guidance as we move into next year. Arun Jayaram : All right. That's super helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotia Howard. Paul Cheng : John, at some point that by 2022 when Liza-2 come on stream, I would suppose that either 2022 or 2023, you guys will be free cash flow. So on a longer term basis, do you have internally a target? What will be the right production growth rate and free cash flow yield combination that you may be targeting? John Hess : Well, very much we laid this out in our Investor Day as our long term plan out to 2025. We are on track to execute that strategy, which is 20% cash flow from operations growth, 10% production growth out to 2025. We are on track. Our results this year underpin it. Our results next year that we forecast underpin it. And that's how we really look at any guidance we would say. We put out a long term strategy and we are executing it. Having said that, as our cash engines continue to generate cash and then the Bakken starts becoming a major cash engine, 2021 and beyond and Guyana, 2022 and beyond, obviously we will be a significant free cash flow generator. We see that free cash flow compounding over time and the first call will be continuing to invest in our high-return projects. As John Reilly said, 75% of our CapEx in that $3 billion range goes to the Bakken and Guyana. But once we start to generate free cash flow on a recurring basis, our top priority will be starting to return capital to our shareholders on a consistent basis and the first priority there will be increasing the dividend. Paul Cheng : I guess my question is that on the longer term basis that do you have a target? Like how much is the cash flow you will return to the shareholder or a free cash flow yield, say 6%, 5% per cycle? Any kind of target like that you have in mind? John Hess : Because our free cash flow increases over time, I think the best way to look at it is the majority of that free cash flow will be returned as capital to shareholders. I think that's the best way to look at it. Paul Cheng : Okay. And maybe this is for John Rielly. You have a target cash cost for the corporation will drop below $10 by 2021 versus right now it's like $12 to $13? And you just mentioned that Guyana is going to be, say, call it roughly $12. So what is the major component, the reduction going to be in order for you to drop that much? John Rielly : Right. So I am going to call it to the two biggest drivers are, as I said, Guyana starts around $12. We will buyout that FPSO because as you know, that's part of the plan. That would happen in 2021. That will drop that cash cost by $3. They are going on Phase 1. So you are under $10 right there with Guyana. And then Bakken again driving up to 200,000 barrels a day is a big contributor there to drop our cash down to $10. Again, now with you got Esox coming in, very good. That's going to be a nice low-cost cash add to the portfolio, as Greg mentioned, Llano-5 ramping up. So it's really is a combination of our portfolio in total, but with the big drivers being Guyana and Bakken. Paul Cheng : John, what is Bakken your target in 2021 on the cash costs? John Rielly : I don't lay out a target, per se, by asset there. But as I have always said here, Bakken's cash cost is below our portfolio average right now. So the $12.75, it is below that and it's going to continue to drive down with this significant increase in production going to 200,000 barrels a day. Paul Cheng : Do you have a number, what is the Hess Midstream total CapEx supply in 2020 and 2021? John Rielly : No. We have not put those numbers out yet. Although I would tell you when in the announcement that of the midstream transaction, they did put some guidance out for 2020, but not 2021. Paul Cheng : Okay. Final one. This is for Greg. For Esox-1, I know that you are not going to give us some additional data early next year. Do you think this is a one-well or two-well program ultimately? And also that what's the well production and oil and gas mix which we should assume? Greg Hill : Yes. So I think, again, evaluation of the well results are still ongoing and we will give you further updates, including resource estimate and production rate probably early next year after we have some dynamic production data. We are going to start with the first well, but we see enough hydrocarbons here that it could take another well to evacuate all that we see. Paul Cheng : Do you have a oil and gas mix? Greg Hill : No, not yet. We will provide that. GOR is in the 2,000 to 3,000 range in the reservoirs. Paul Cheng : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell, Tuohy Brothers. Jeffrey Campbell : Good morning and congratulations on a solid quarter. John Hess : Thank you. Jeffrey Campbell : I want to return back to the Esox-1 just because it sounds like it's a really big well and maybe even two wells. And then when we put that together with the flat 65,000 barrels of equivalent per day target, it sounds like, I am wondering how that fits together. I mean, will you choke back the well to stay within the 65,000? Or will we have a period where we might have some excessive production? Because if a well exceeds expectations like Esox does, wondering also is there some infrastructure limits embedded in there some place? Greg Hill : No, there is not. I mean, I think you can assume that Gulf of Mexico will be between 65,000 and 70,000 barrels a day, really in that range. There is no infrastructure constraints. Necessarily we won't choke back wells. We will maximize production in the Gulf of Mexico. Jeffrey Campbell : Okay. Thanks. That makes more sense. And I had one Guyana question. I have just noted with interest that a number of these upcoming exploration wells are in the Liza Phase-1 neighborhood. And bearing in mind that's the earliest project to get sanctioned. That strikes me as interesting. And I was wondering if you could add any color on what the thinking is behind the continued exploration in this area. Greg Hill : Sure. I think I think as we have talked about before, what we are really trying to do is delineate what I call the eastern seaboard that exist between Turbot and Liza. And we see a lot of prospectivity kind of in that whole eastern margin. So really what we are trying to do is understand all the volume we have there to inform the cadence of the future vessels. So that's really the purpose, because as you get closer to Liza, probably higher value in there just because you have a higher oil content on a relative basis than as you get closer to Turbot. So our interest is really, can we delineate as much of that stuff in and around Liza for a future vessel in that area? Jeffrey Campbell : Right. I understand. And also you want to be capital efficient as well. So thanks very much for the color. Greg Hill : Absolutely, yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall, Heikkinen Energy. Michael Hall : Good morning. Thanks for the time. John Hess : Good morning. Michael Hall : Yes, I guess a couple of quick ones on my end. I am just curious, given all the moving pieces around the POP contracts that we saw last quarter and then again this quarter and it sounds like there's some of that, although less assumed next quarter. How much of the increase guide in the Bakken is a function of gas capture exceeding expectations and/or POP contracts as opposed to reservoir outperformance or well timing? John Hess : As Greg mentioned earlier, about 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter was due to a combination of the increased gas capture and the POP. So you can get a feel for that number there. Now again, we are forecasting a higher NGL price, so lower POP volumes for the fourth quarter. So you would have to bake the 7,000 in overall for the year divided by four quarters. So there's an additional 2,000 barrels a day coming in through that. And then we should get picked up a little bit more gas capture in the fourth quarter as well. So nothing specific, nothing that's driving a significant increase in the production from that, but it is a factor, as Greg mentioned. Michael Hall : Okay. Sorry to beat that dead horse. I just wanted to be clear. I appreciate it. And then I guess just if we think about 2020, clearly as you have outlined, you have got a big ramp in free cash flow coming over the next few years. But at the current strip and with all the different moving pieces, kind of how do you see the outspend shaping up next year? John Rielly : So, as John Hess mentioned, we have this long term strategy. We laid it out at Investor Day and we continue to execute that. And to go along with the strategy, we have a strong financial position to be able to execute that. So at the end of the quarter, we have $1.9 billion of cash on hand. As we mentioned, post the closing of the midstream transaction, we also get an additional $275 million. And just as a reminder, we still do have the $60 WTI put options in place for 95,000 barrels a day for the remainder of the year. So we are in a really good, strong financial position to fund our program. And we do realize there is an investment program here until Phase 2 comes on. But looking forward now, we have got production from Guyana starting up in December. So we are going to be picking up some cash flow there now in Guyana. And as you mentioned, Bakken is becoming significantly cash flow generative. And by 2021, as Greg mentioned, $800 million to $1 billion of free cash flow. So we will use that cash flow from operations, along with the cash on the balance sheet to fund the Guyana investment program through Liza Phase 2. And when Phase 2 comes on then Guyana is generating free cash flow. So all of our assets are generating free cash flow at that point. So we feel we are in a good position to execute that. Michael Hall : Okay. But specific to 2020, I mean just to kind of help us think about next year, any figures you can provide? John Rielly : No, nothing specific. Obviously, commodity prices are going to move. And so as we get into January, we will give more guidance on where our production is from that standpoint. We will be using our cash flow from operations, some of the cash on the balance to fund it. But again, we feel we are in a good position to get through to Phase 2. John Hess : And also, depending upon market conditions, we will certainly look at adding to our hedge position for 2020 that really is going to look to protecting the downside. We think that's prudent and we are just being disciplined about how we think about that. Michael Hall : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov, Raymond James. Muhammed Ghulam : Hi guys. This is Muhammed Ghulam, on behalf of Pavel Molchanov. Thanks for taking the question. John Hess : Thank you. Muhammed Ghulam : First of all, do you have any update on the exploration plans for Suriname? Are you guys still planning to drill there in 2020? John Hess : Yes. So as you recall, there's two blocks in Suriname. So let me talk about each one separately. So in Block 42, we believe there is excellent potential there and a second exploration well is currently being planned for 2021. So there will be nothing on Block 42 in 2020. Recall, Kosmos is the operator there, Hess has a 33.3% interest as does Chevron as well as Kosmos. So third, a third, a third. On Block 59 in Suriname, recall the operator is ExxonMobil there. And what's going on there is the operator's nearing completion of a 2D seismic acquisition on the block. Following that, the data will undergo processing. Then we will shoot a smaller, more focused 3D survey in and around any prospectivity that's identified. And so the first exploration well will likely be spud in 2022 on that block. And the other partners are Hess and Statoil each, with a third again. Muhammed Ghulam : Okay. Understood. And this one is kind of, well, I know you guys don't focus as much on this segment, but can you guys talk a bit about Libya? What's going on there and what are the next steps, if there are any? John Hess : Yes. Look, our production continues in Libya. Obviously, there is significant civil unrest there. So giving more clarity, other than that is a hard thing to do. It's a cash generator, not that material. But at the end of the day, operations continue but it's subject to disruption based upon political unrest. And so far it's been fairly stable. Muhammed Ghulam : Okay. Understood. That's all from me. Thanks. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today\u2019s conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess\u2019 annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today\u2019s conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. As usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operating performance, and then John Rielly will review our financial results. We had an outstanding year in terms of operational performance and continued execution of our long-term strategy, achieving a number of important milestones and delivering higher production and lower capital exploratory expenditures than our original guidance. With Guyana and the Bakken as our growth engines and Malaysia and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico as our cash engines, our portfolio is on track to deliver increasing and strong financial returns, visible and low risk production growth and industry leading cash flow growth. It is important to note that both Guyana and the Bakken will become significant cash generators over the next several years. As we have stated in our investor presentations, where we provide a financial outlook through 2025, our portfolio is positioned to generate approximately 20% compound annual cash flow growth and more than 10% compound annual production growth. And our portfolio breakeven is projected to decrease to below $40 per barrel Brent by 2025. As our free cash flow grows, we will prioritize return of capital to shareholders both in terms of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. Another key element of our strategy is maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position and managing risk. We ended the year with more than $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet and have hedged 150,000 barrels of oil per day in 2020 using put options, with 130,000 barrels per day at $55 per barrel WTI and 20,000 barrels per day at $60 per barrel Brent. With outstanding execution throughout our portfolio, we were able to reduce our full year 2019 capital and exploratory expenditures to $2.74 billion, down approximately $150 million from our original guidance. We have kept our 2020 capital and exploratory budget to $3 billion in line with the guidance we provided at our December 2018 Investor Day. During the fourth quarter, we closed the previously announced transaction in which Hess Midstream converted to an Up-C corporate structure and acquired Hess Infrastructure Partners. As a result of the transaction, we received approximately $300 million in cash and own 47% of Hess Midstream. Turning to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator. 2019 was an outstanding year in terms of both exploration and developments. On December 20th, the Liza Phase 1 development achieved first production and is expected to reach its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day in the coming months. We recognize this pivotal moment in Guyana\u2019s history and are committed to working collaboratively with the government, our partners and the people of Guyana to build a safe and sustainable industry that fulfills the promise of shared prosperity. The Liza Unity floating production storage and offloading vessel or FPSO is under construction for the second phase of Liza development. It is expected to start production in Guyana by mid-2022 with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. Front-end engineering design for a third FPSO, the prosperity is underway to develop the Payara field pending government approvals and project sanctioning. Production from Payara could start as early as 2023, reaching an estimated 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. From an exploration perspective, 2019 was a banner year with five new discoveries at Haimara, Tilapia, Yellowtail, Tripletail and Mako. On Monday, we announced an increase in the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block to more than 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We continue to see multi-billion barrels of exploration potential remaining. We also announced a significant oil discovery at Uaru marking the 16th discovery on the Stabroek Block. The Uaru discovery will be incremental to the new resources estimate. Turning to the Bakken, our largest operated asset. Our team had a very strong year. Full year net production in 2019 for the Bakken averaged 152,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, well above our original guidance range of 135,000 to 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and nearly 30% higher than 2018. Our Bakken performance showed the benefits of our successful transition to plug-and-perf completions. As a result, net oil production for 2019 was up 22% compared to 2018 and we are on track for Bakken production to average approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our successful oil discovery last quarter at Esox will be brought online next month as a low-cost tieback to the Tubular Bells production facilities. Hess is the operator and holds a 57.14% interest. Now turning to our 2019 financial results for the fourth quarter. Our adjusted net loss was $180 million compared to adjusted net loss of $77 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting the effects of lower realized prices. Full year 2019 net production was 290,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, 17% higher than the pro forma 248,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day produced in 2018. In 2020 our net production is forecast to average between 330,000 and 335,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Bakken net production is forecast to average approximately 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020. As we continue to execute our strategy, our board, our leadership team and each of our employees will be guided by our longstanding commitment to sustainability in terms of safety, protecting the environment and making a positive impact on the communities where we operate. We are gratified to have been recognized by a number of third-party organizations for the quality of our environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure, most recently achieving leadership status in CDP\u2019s Global Climate Analysis for the 11th consecutive year. In summary, we are proud of our 2019 performance and look forward to continuing this momentum into 2020 and future years, as we execute our differentiated long-term strategy. With increasing cash margins and production volumes, our cash flow through 2025 is projected to grow at a rate that outpaces our industry peers and most companies in the S&P 500. As our portfolio generates increasing cash flow, the majority will be deployed toward increased return of capital to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. 2019 marked another year of exceptional performance and strategic execution. In particular, I would like to call out three major operational highlights from 2019. First, we beat our guidance for both production and for capital and exploratory expenditures. Our 2019 net production averaged 290,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was above our original guidance of between 270,000 and 280,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and also above our more recent guidance of approximately 285,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. At the same time, our 2019 capital and exploratory expenditures were $2.74 billion, approximately $150 million below our original guidance. Second, we continued our extraordinary run of success on the 6.6 million acres Stabroek Block in Guyana with five discoveries with the start of production from the Liza Phase 1 development in December ahead of schedule and under budget, and with the sanction of the Liza Phase 2 development, which is on track for first oil by mid-2022. Third, in the Bakken we successfully completed our transition to plug-and-perf completions, while driving down drilling and completion costs. Our plug-and-perf transition has on average delivered a 15% uplift in IP180 production, at the same time, we reduced our drilling and completion costs from an average of approximately $7.5 million per well in the fourth quarter of 2018 to approximately $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. By the end of 2020, we expect our D&C costs will approach $6 million per well. Proved reserves at the end of 2019 stood at 1.197 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Net proved reserve additions and revisions in 2019 totaled 121 million barrels of oil equivalent, including negative net price revisions of 35 million barrels of oil equivalent, resulting in an overall 2019 production replacement ratio of 104%. The majority of the additions were in the Bakken and Guyana. Now turning to production. In the fourth quarter of 2019 company-wide net production averaged 316,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance of approximately 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day driven by strong performance across the portfolio and in particular the Bakken. For the full year 2020, we forecast net production to average between 330,000 and 335,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which is a 15% increase from 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, we forecast net production to average between 320,000 and 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Bakken fourth quarter net production averaged 174,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of approximately 38% above the year ago quarter and above our guidance of 165,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2019, Bakken net production averaged 152,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day above our original guidance of between 135,000 and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and our most recent full year guidance of 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. These results reflect the strong performance of our plug-and-perf completions and the quality of our acreage position. For the full year 2020, we forecast Bakken net production to average approximately 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is approximately 18% higher than 2019. Our full year forecast reflects the impact of a 45 day planned shutdown of the Tioga Gas Plant in the third quarter. During the shutdown, we will perform a turnaround and tie in the planned expansion project, which will increase capacity from 250 million cubic feet per day to 400 million cubic feet per day. In 2020, we expect to drill approximately 170 wells and bring approximately 175 new wells online, compared with 160 wells drilled and 156 wells brought online in 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, we expect Bakken net production to average approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our first quarter 2020 forecast reflects lower planned activity levels, due to seasonally difficult winter weather conditions, where we expect to bring online approximately 30 new wells compared with 59 in the fourth quarter of 2019. Net production will increase in the Bakken throughout the year, growing to approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of 2020. As discussed previously, we plan to drop our rig count from six rigs in 2020, four in 2021. At this level of activity, we expect to hold production relatively flat for at least five years and generate approximately $750 million of free cash flow annually, at $55 per barrel WTI. Moving to the offshore, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production average 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2019 in line with our guidance. Our focused exploration program in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico yielded an oil discovery in the fourth quarter at the Esox-1 well in Mississippi Canyon. A dual completion was successfully run and the subsea installation is underway, which will tieback to the Tubular Bells production facility. We expect to achieve first oil in February. Esox is a high return, cash generative tieback opportunity that was well executed. The timeframe from discovery to first oil is expected to be less than four months. In 2020, we forecast net production from our deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes extended planned maintenance shutdowns in the second quarter. At the Malaysia, Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess has a 50% interest, net production averaged 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2019. At the North Malay Basin, also in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess is operator and has a 50% interest, net production averaged 28,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2019. Combined net production from our JDA and North Malay Basin assets is forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2020. Turning to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator. In December, we announced a 15th discovery on the block at the Mako-1 well located approximately 6 miles southeast of the Liza field. Mako-1 drilled in 5,315 feet of water, encountered approximately 164 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. On Monday, we announced another significant oil discovery at Uaru, which is located approximately 10 miles northeast of the Liza field. Uaru-1 well drilled in 6,342 feet of water, encountered approximately 94 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. The well was drilled in a down-dip location on a large stratigraphic trap, further appraisal and testing is planned. Based on the 15 discoveries through year-end 2019, the estimate of growth discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block has been increased to more than 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up for more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent only one year ago. The Uaru discovery is incremental to this new resource estimate. The continuing growth of the resource base on the block has been truly remarkable. Looking forward, after the Noble Tom Madden completes the evaluation of the Uaru discovery, the drillship will move to development drilling for Liza Phase 2. The Stena Carron is currently engaged on a well test at the Yellowtail discovery, after which it will drill and test the Yellowtail-2 appraisal well. After completing the evaluation program for Mako-1, the Noble Don Taylor next drill and test the Longtail-2 appraisal well. Finally, the Noble Bob Douglas will continue drilling development wells. As announced on Monday, the operator intends to bring in a fifth drillship later this year. We expect the first half of 2020 will be dominated by appraisal activities, primarily in the greater Turbot area. In the second half of the year, we plan to drill several new exploration wells, including some that will test the emerging deeper plays on the Stabroek Block. Turning now to our Guyana developments, on December 20, production commenced from the Liza Phase 1 development less than five years after the discovery of hydrocarbons and wellhead of the industry average for deepwater developments. The project also came in under budget and with the sanction of Liza Phase 1 was budgeted at $4.4 billion gross, including the purchase of the FPSO. We now expect the gross cost for the development to be approximately $3.5 billion or 21% below the sanction estimate. Liza Phase 1 production continues to ramp up. Current gross production is approximately 75,000 barrels of oil per day from three of the five producers available at start-up. Production is expected to reach the FPSO capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day in the coming month. For the full year 2020, we forecast our net production to average approximately 25,000 barrels of oil per day. The Liza Phase 2 development is progressing to plan. On January 13, the hole for the Liza Unity FPSO, which will have a capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day arrived at the Keppel yard in Singapore. Construction of all 13 deck modules is currently underway. Meanwhile, in Guyana, installation of subsea flow lines and equipment is underway and development drilling is expected to begin next month. We continue to forecast first oil by mid-2022. Pending government approvals and project sanctioning, a third development at Payara is planned to utilize an FPSO with a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day with first oil as early as 2023. Together with Hammerhead, discoveries on the southeast portion of the block including Turbot, Yellowtail, Longtail, Pluma, Tilapia and Tripletail will underpin future FPSOs. In closing, our execution continues to be strong. The Bakken is on a capital efficient growth trajectory. Our offshore assets and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia continue to generate significant free cash flow, and Guyana continues to get bigger and better, all of which positions us to deliver industry leading returns, material free cash flow generation, and significant shareholder value. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2019. We incurred a net loss of $222 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to a net loss of $212 million in the third quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we incurred a net loss of $180 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a net of $105 million in the previous quarter. For E&P, on an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $124 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to a net loss of $41 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the fourth quarter and third quarter of 2019 were as follows : higher exploration costs reduced results by $56 million; lower realized selling prices reduced results by $13 million; all other items reduced results by $14 million for an overall reduction in fourth quarter results of $83 million. For Midstream, on an adjusted basis, the Midstream segment had net income of $49 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $39 million in the previous quarter, reflecting higher throughput volumes. Midstream EBITDA, on an adjusted basis and before non-controlling interest, amounted to $157 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $134 million in the previous quarter. For corporate, on an adjusted basis, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $105 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $103 million in the previous quarter. Now turning to our financial position, at quarter-end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $1.540 billion and total liquidity was $5.4 billion including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $5.640 billion. In December 2019, Hess Midstream completed its previously announced acquisition of Hess Infrastructure Partners with a conversion to an Up-C corporate structure and incentive distribution rights simplification. As consideration for the transaction, we received additional shares and approximately $300 million in cash. We now own approximately 134 million shares of Hess Midstream or approximately 47%. In the fourth quarter of 2019, net cash provided from operating activities was $286 million or $550 million before changes in working capital and items affecting comparability. While cash outlays for capital expenditures were $825 million in the fourth quarter. Changes in working capital reduce cash flows from operating activities by $234 million in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting premiums paid for crude oil hedging contracts. For calendar year 2020, our crude oil hedge positions consist of WTI put options with a notional amount of 130,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel and Brent put options with a notional amount of 20,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel. Now turning to guidance, first for exploration and production, we project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $11.50 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2020. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $16.50 to $17.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2020. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $28 to $30 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2020. As guided earlier, capital and exploratory expenditures in 2020 are expected to be $3 billion. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the first quarter with full year 2020 guidance expected to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $225 million to $235 million in the first quarter, with full year 2020 guidance expected to be in the range of $940 million to $965 million. E&P tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million for the first quarter and in the range of $80 million to $90 million for the full year 2020. As highlighted earlier, we have purchased crude oil hedge positions for calendar year 2020. We expect non-cash option premium amortization, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices to reduce our results by approximately $70 million per quarter. Now turning to Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million in the first quarter and full year 2020 guidance is expected to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million. For corporate, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter and full year 2020 guidance is expected to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million for the first quarter, with the full year 2020 guidance expected to be $350 million to $360 million. The increase from 2019 is due to ceasing interest capitalization at the Liza field, which commenced production in December 2019. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Guys, it looks like the market doesn\u2019t like the guidance too much. So I wonder if we could talk a little bit about the cadence of what\u2019s going on with downtime through the course of the year. Greg, you touched on Tioga. But I want \u2013 obviously, you\u2019ve given us a first quarter run rate for the Bakken. But can you kind of walk us through how that progress is through the year, because clearly 174,000 in fourth quarter and 180,000 average for the full year looks a little soft and maybe touch on the Gulf of Mexico planned downtime as well? Greg Hill : Yes. Thanks, Doug. So as we mentioned, we do have the turnaround at Tioga gas plant. It\u2019s going to be about 45 days. And we\u2019re going to turn it around and also tie in the gas plant expansion as we mentioned. Now that\u2019s not going to have much impact, if any on oil. It\u2019s going to be primarily gas. And the net effect of that is about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. If I turned it\u2026 Doug Leggate : For the year, Greg, or for the quarter? Greg Hill : Yes, for the year. Doug Leggate : For the year. Greg Hill : Thanks, Doug. And then if I turned to the Gulf of Mexico, we have two major shutdowns in the second quarter, one at Conger and one at Llano, both of which are down for 30 days. We also have Penn State down for about eight days in the second quarter. So the net impact of that on the quarter is about 13,000 barrels a day. Doug Leggate : Okay. That starts to make a bit more sense, and I appreciate the emphasis that oil doesn\u2019t gets hit. Thank you for that. My follow-up is, so not to be too predictable, it\u2019s obviously on Guyana. And I know we have the Exxon Analyst Day on March 5, so to the extent you can share. It seems that the appraisal activity focus around Turbot is probably, I\u2019m guessing, is to define what the scale of that development is going to look like over time. And you\u2019ve previously defined that as a major development hub, but we also know that Hammerhead has been passed to the development team for Exxon. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can kind of walk us through your current thought on the timing over the scale of that 2025 run rate, and John Rielly, how does that impact the 2018 guidance, you gave us over run rate $3 billion capital program? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Greg Hill : Yes, thanks Doug. I think, as we\u2019ve spoken before, you\u2019re right, I mean Hammerhead has been passed off to the development team that notionally right now is about 140,000 barrels of oil capacity, kind of vessel. And then as you mentioned, all of the appraisal activities that are ongoing really what I call on the eastern seaboard between Turbot and Liza are really trying to understand, how many vessels will it take to evacuate all of that oil, which is substantial along that eastern seaboard. So clearly, vessel 5 is going to be in that area and probably several vessels after that, but we\u2019re trying to figure all that out. How many vessels will it take? And obviously, the fifth vessel will be a large one. It\u2019ll be in the 220,000 class, like the others are. But specific timing of the number of vessels and timing of the ones after five, that\u2019s really what we\u2019re working on. And that\u2019s kind of the heavy lift for this year, Doug, to really understand that. John Rielly : And then, Doug, as far as our capital program is, as we laid out on our Investor Day, we had $3 billion this year. We do have, if you see from the Investor Day, a little bit more next year as we move on with these developments. And then as we\u2019ve talked about as an approximate $3 billion, and right now there\u2019s no change to that number. We\u2019ve got a nice cadence going to Exxon, as an aside, has been doing a fantastic job on the execution of Phase 1. And now Phase 2 is the execution is going along well. And so it\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019re doing a great job for Guyana and for the partners. So what we\u2019re seeing from our capital program is that, that $3 billion is a good number right now. As Greg said, we\u2019re unsure of FPSOs beyond the five and we\u2019ll see that. But again, that will be much later in the profile of our timing of free cash flow, because as you remember, once Phase 2 comes on, it\u2019s a big inflection point for us from a free cash flow standpoint. So any FPSOs would be at six, seven or something beyond that. We\u2019ll be in a good period for us when we\u2019re generating a lot of free cash flow. Doug Leggate : I appreciate that guys and I\u2019ll see you in a couple of weeks. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Ryan Todd : Great, thanks. Maybe one follow-up initially on Guyana. Can you talk about on the upwards revision to the resource estimate to 8 billion barrels, was all that based on the inclusion of incremental discoveries since the last estimate? Or was there any component driven by upward revisions to estimates at prior discovery? Maybe just can you talk about the primary drivers of what you continue to see as a significant upward pressure on resource? Greg Hill : No. I think the absolute grand majority of that was all new discoveries. So it\u2019s just continuing to add to this extraordinary success rate, five in 2019 and already another one in 2020 with more to come. Ryan Todd : Great, thanks. And then maybe a follow-up in the Bakken. And then Bakken continues to exceed expectations in terms of productivity, and also impressive costs. Can you talk about some of the drivers of what you\u2019ve seen in terms of the strong Bakken production? And maybe you highlighted Exxon targeted reductions of well cost for the Bakken in 2020. What are the drivers and what are you seeing there in terms of costs in the basin? Greg Hill : Yes. So let me start with cost first. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I\u2019m really proud of the team and their ability to drive costs down with lean manufacturing. So if you think about our journey in 2019, we started at $7.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, $7.3 million in Q1, $7 million in Q2, $6.7 million in Q3, and $6.5 million in Q4. So that\u2019s an amazing cost reduction over 12 months driven primarily by lean manufacturing, but also technology. And then as we look forward to next year, obviously that flattens out a bit part of lean manufacturing. But we still think we\u2019ll be at $6 million by the end of the year. The biggest driver on that is going to be, again, technology and lean. But we also are seeing some softness in the sand costs and also pressure pumping. So we built some of that into our cost estimates for next year. Regarding the productivity, really a function of where we\u2019re drilling, but also the plug-and-perf coming in very well. So on average, our IP180 are up 15%, but if you look at certain areas of the field, particularly, in the southern part of the field, we\u2019ve outperformed that 15% in those areas and those are very good prolific areas of the Bakken. And as we look forward to our 2020 program, again, it\u2019s 175 wells be very similar, EURs kind of in the 1 to 1.2 range, IP180s in the 1.10 to 1.20 range. And the IRR is at 60%, well above 75%. So again, a very strong program in 2020. Ryan Todd : Great, thanks Greg. Very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just to follow-up on that Bakken question, and this may be premature, but given that you\u2019re continuing to see improvements as we think about holding flat at 200,000 a day, kind of end of this year onwards, any reason at this point? Or any optimism to think about that costing less, or maybe not taking quite four rigs as we go forward? Or do we just need to balance that as you kind of move from, as you mentioned the premium spots to maybe the next tier down that\u2019s incorporated in the outlet? Greg Hill : Yes. I think it\u2019s a balance as you said. So we\u2019re pretty confident that we can hold it flat at the 200,000 range for at least five years and probably longer. And as you mentioned, as technology improvements to continue to occur, as costs potentially continue to come down, obviously that plateau be extended even longer. And I will mention that in our Tier 2 acreage, we are doing a lot of trials on proppant loading, on number of entry points on spacing. So we are not \u2013 we\u2019re not decided yet in some of those areas exactly what that\u2019s going to be. So the assumption going forward is none of that\u2019s built-in. So I\u2019m very optimistic that that will get much better as we go forward as we learn in those areas. Roger Read : Yes. It certainly has not been a static environment so far, right? One other question and it\u2019s got two parts, I apologize for doing it that way, but it\u2019s some of the pushback we\u2019ve gotten post results here. One is the hedging programs. So I\u2019ll just kind of put the question up to you of why hedge? The second part is, we did see debt go up in the quarter. It looks like mostly that was to take care of the Midstream side of things. But I was wondering if you could clarify on those two points for us. John Rielly : Sure, Roger, and only do the second one first, it\u2019s quick to debt. That went up was related to Midstream and the completion of the transaction that we spoke about, the acquisition of Hess Infrastructure Partners and the conversion to the Up-C that was the debt. So it\u2019s just purely Midstream debt. That is non-recourse to Hess. As far as the hedging, Roger, the price we have that, from our Investor Day there, with Bakken getting up to 200,000 barrels a day and bringing on Phase 2. So what we do is, we look at it year-by-year and we put these hedges on for insurance just to ensure that we can fund that investment program because of the returns of that program will drive for us. So we\u2019re getting closer and closer. Phase 2, right, is mid-2022. We just want to finish this Guyana program, executed, continue to execute that. And as Greg say, continue to execute our six rig program, which will drop the four rigs the following year. And so we just put hedges on for insurance purposes and hopefully we don\u2019t use them. Roger Read : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning, everyone. I guess my two questions are on CapEx and Guyana. The first one is, it looks like total E&P CapEx for the quarter came in a little bit higher than expected and I believe some of that might be related to Guyana. So can you provide any color on that and any implications for Phase 2 that it may imply? John Rielly : It did come in for the quarter, very small amount. Again, we just went out with an approximately $850 million, came in at $876 million. As Greg mentioned, with the Bakken, we did get a little bit more completions in Bakken. And so a little bit is in the Bakken, a little bit of it is an acceleration in Guyana, and the rest of it is kind of just through the portfolio, really small numbers. Again, we were just given approximate amounts. So there\u2019s no implication on that going forward. We had the $3 billion capital that we set. We are going up approximately $300 million in Guyana next year versus 2019. And again, we laid that out for the continuation of Phase 1, $400 million for Phase 2, and then the rest of it for Phase 3 and future developments. Jeanine Wai : Okay, great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you for that. My second question on Guyana, can you comment on any of the recent news headlines about the potential for contract renegotiation? John Hess : Yes. Most of the news that you hear is not from reliable sources, neither the current government or opposition government. I think they both have been pretty clear that they\u2019re going to honor the PSC. So I think that\u2019s the real takeaway you should have. Jeanine Wai : Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Deckelbaum with Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask you, you talked about having the first tanker loading attributed to Hess or allocated that has in March with 1 million barrels. How do you see the listings or tanker loadings progressing throughout the year? Should we always be thinking about the same sort of capacity and what kind of cadence are you expecting throughout the year? John Rielly : So the cadence can move around a little bit from that on how they get allocated. But here there\u2019s a general rule of thumb, it will be 1 million barrels each lift. And for us, as you heard, Greg gave the guidance on Guyana, that it\u2019s 25,000 barrels a day for the year. If you multiply that by 365, you\u2019re getting just about 9 million, little over 9 million barrels. So we expect just from a forecast standpoint to have nine lifts this year. I can\u2019t exactly be specific, which quarters that we come in our first lift, you\u2019re right, is expected in early March. David Deckelbaum : Okay. I appreciate that. But it does sound like your net sales amount as approximating your production guidance for the year. So that\u2019s incorrect. John Rielly : That is correct. Quarter-by-quarter, you could get some under over lifts, but right. For the full year, it \u2013 the sales should approximate the production amount. David Deckelbaum : Got it. And then just to revisit some in the Bakken guidance, I know that it\u2019s difficult to forecast with lumpiness around the quarters. But the expectation is that you\u2019d be exiting 2020 at approximately that 200 equivalent target? Greg Hill : Yes. Yes, we\u2019ll achieve that sometime in the fourth quarter. David Deckelbaum : Okay. And then the \u2013 in the third quarter with the Tioga turnaround and expansion, how is it that oil volumes are not impacted there from a logistical perspective? Greg Hill : Well, again, there are separate systems, right? So you can \u2013 the gas is separated on the pad from the oil and it goes through a separate system. So you can still produce the oil, but obviously that gas goes through the plant, so that\u2019s where the impacts going to be. So we\u2019ll do some local flaring on the pads and some flaring at the gas plant as well during that 45 day shutdown. But the oil will largely stay on. David Deckelbaum : Okay. But I guess as a total program, you\u2019d still be under the regulations for flaring at the state level? Greg Hill : Yes. Yes, there will be some restrictions that we\u2019ll have to deal with. But of course, you can get some dispensation for things like turnarounds, et cetera. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate the color on that. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hall with Heikkinen Energy Advisors. Michael Hall : Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019m just curious a little bit of an accounting question. I guess, on the Guyana volumes the 25,000 a day, does that include costs barrel recoveries? If so, how much, if not, how should we think about that for 2020? John Rielly : It does include that. It\u2019s just part of the normal production sharing contract that cost recovery barrels are included as part of our production and the partners production. Michael Hall : And do you have an estimate of how much of that is cost recovery by chance? John Rielly : I could walk you maybe through a little bit more detail after the call, but the contract that is out there that you can see, but the way it basically works is on the revenue, then 75% of the revenue goes for cost recovery for the contractors. So that\u2019s how you can factor in. Then you go into profit share after that. Michael Hall : Okay. Yes. Just want to make sure we\u2019re calibrating right. And then, I was curious, I guess the Gulf of Mexico, the capital on the 2020 plan. I think we backed into around $350 million or so relative to 2018 Analyst Day you talked about annual average capital of $150 million to sustain 65 MBOE a day. So I\u2019m just trying to line those two things up and should we be \u2013 how do we reconcile those two things? John Rielly : I just want to make sure that we are on the same page with the numbers. So in our release that we went out for 2020, the Gulf of Mexico capital will be approximately $135 million for this year. That\u2019s we\u2019re spending from a production aspect of it. Last year we did have a higher amount, it was approximately $290 million. And that is because we were running full year, we had two rigs running for Stampede, which will be coming off contract here basically in the second quarter. So there\u2019s lower Gulf of Mexico spend. And so as you know, we will be tying in Esox, which again helps and keeps us at that 65,000 barrels a day, that we\u2019ve talked about. Greg Hill : And then, as we did mention, going forward, you can expect about $150 million to $200 million of CapEx per annum for infill and tie-back wells. And this is our objective in the short-term to medium-term to maintain the Gulf at about 65,000 barrels a day. And we\u2019ve been very successful doing that. If you look at Conger-10, that was about 6,000 barrels a day. Penn State-6, about 14,000 barrels a day, Llano-5, about 8,000 and Esox is anticipated to be a very good well. We see four to six more things that we\u2019d like to drill in the next couple of years and our expectation of keeping those hubs full. Then beyond that, of course it\u2019ll be greenfield. So we\u2019ll drill a greenfield expiration well probably one a year on average over the next several years. Again, trying to maintain that production or potentially even growing it with the new hub. Michael Hall : Okay. Yes, I guess \u2013 that\u2019s helpful. I guess, maybe make sure I\u2019m thinking about the numbers right here. I was trying to connect $1.73 billion of total U.S. capital per the release with the $1.375 billion in the Bakken and the remainder being in the Gulf of Mexico. I\u2019m assuming some of that being for exploration. So I guess, what\u2019s being spent in the U.S. outside of the Bakken and the Gulf of Mexico if anything? And how would you break out the $1.73 billion between the Bakken and the Gulf of Mexico? John Rielly : So let\u2019s \u2013 so you have $1.730 billion, you\u2019re saying in the U.S. right? So you have $1.730 billion back out the Bakken, which is $1.375 billion, right, in production. And you\u2019re going to back out $1.35 billion for the Gulf of Mexico, right. So then the rest of that amount is in exploration. That can be wells being drilled or seismic being spent. So that approximate $200 million that you have left relates to exploration. Michael Hall : Sure. Okay. And that exploration is all in the Gulf? John Rielly : In the Gulf, correct. At U.S. piece, correct. Michael Hall : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Hey guys. Good morning. I apologize that I joined late. So if my questions have already been answered, just let me know. So I would just look at the transcript. John, I think two quick questions for you. On the accounting, the hedging premium amortization, the $70 million a quarter, is that pretax and after? And also from an accounting standpoint it seems in Guyana, you have the government willing to pickup the income. So when you guys reported, are you going to report that the corresponding tax as it grows up and then that you report it also with the tax or that you just don\u2019t report any tax at all. How is the accounting treatment going to be? John Rielly : Okay. So first on the hedges, it is pretax and post-tax. So that will be the same amount, because we have a valuation allowance against our net operating losses in the U.S. So that will be the same number. In Guyana, we do pay taxes. It\u2019s in the entitlement of our contract. So the taxes are embedded in our entitlement, effectively reducing our entitlement. And therefore, what we do then with our entitlement for financial reporting purposes is disaggregate that, and then show the tax and gross it up from relating to that. I can walk you through that more after the call, but that is how we are doing it. Paul Cheng : Yes. Because I think that\u2019s how Apache have done in Egypt. I just wanted to make sure that that\u2019s the same methodology because that\u2019s how we modeling right now. John Rielly : Yes. That is how we\u2019re working. Happy to discuss that further, we can do that. Paul Cheng : Okay. And Greg, when I\u2019m looking at your production guidance that seems conservative. Is there any area that maybe we have a bit of more of the upside? Greg Hill : I think you probably miss the \u2013 you probably missed the start of the call where we kind of went through the shutdowns. Again, Tioga Gas Plant down 45 days and then a heavy maintenance buried in the Gulf of Mexico where we have two of our big assets down 30 days in the second quarter. So that\u2019s really kind of what reduced our normal capacity of our production with those two shutdowns. Paul Cheng : Okay. I will read the transcript. And then the final one, have you guys booked any additional reserve related to the Liza 1 last year? John Rielly : We booked a minor amount for the wells that we were drilled here. Again, rule of thumbs, Paul probably we\u2019ve got a third of the reserves on the books right now for Phase 1. And then as we get the dynamic data, see how the injection goes, we\u2019ll begin to pick up additional reserves. Paul Cheng : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov : Guys, thanks for taking the question. So this year after about five years, you will begin to drill on a brand new exploration block Indiana. And given your experience on Stabroek, I\u2019m curious, what kind of expectations should we be thinking about in terms of pre-drill estimates and the geology of this new acreage that you are going to be getting underway? Greg Hill : No. I think you\u2019re referring to the Kaieteur Block, which is outboard of Stabroek, which we have a 15% interest in Exxon, the operator. See very similar play types that exist on the Liza block around the Stabroek Block. And in fact, we\u2019ll split our first well a well called Tanager this year on that block, so stay tuned. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. All right, fair enough. And a question about Hess Midstream. So now that the Bakken is very close to it, if it\u2019s not reaching plateau. What\u2019s going to be the dropdown model for the MLP if the underlying production is essentially flat-lining? Greg Hill : So for Hess Midstream now, it\u2019s not an MLP and all the assets in North Dakota have been acquired by the Midstream, because we completed that transaction in the fourth quarter. So they now have all the gathering facility there and the Tioga Gas Plant. So from the old dropdown model that won\u2019t be happening going forward. So what you do have here is this growth that we have. So in the Bakken, obviously, we\u2019re going from 180,000 to 200,000 barrels a day, they\u2019re going to pick up that growth, the Hess Midstream picking up that. Then as you know, the flaring regulations get tighter and tighter as we move on in North Dakota. And so what Hess Midstream is doing now is they\u2019ve completed the LM4 plant and so picked up additional gas processing capacity there. We\u2019re doing the expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant. And so that\u2019s going up to 400 million cubic feet a day and it is looking to pick up third-party business as these flaring regulations get tighter and tighter and we are in a good infrastructure position in a good position to pick up that. So there\u2019s a lot of growth going from there and they\u2019ll look for other opportunities up there in North Dakota. Pavel Molchanov : All right. Appreciate it guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. Can you talk about the benefits and risks in Guyana, co-development of FPSOs and how discussions and plans with the operator are evolving, if at all? As you ramp up the first FPSO and you gain greater insight into the reservoir and processes. How on the table is this when you look out to FPSO three, four, five or beyond? Greg Hill : No. I think, Brian, the current strategy, which we agree with is, the design one, build many, because you can get such leverage of learnings as you go from vessel one to two to three, right? Now, what is likely going to happen is the timeframe between those vessels will begin to collapse. So from a cadence of maybe one a year, maybe becomes every nine months or potentially even every six months, as you get out in time. That\u2019s what those synergies will do for you. So that\u2019s what we really see. We don\u2019t really see doubling or tripling up because that\u2019s very inefficient. But rather design one, build many that continue to collapse the timeframe based on efficiencies. John Hess : Yes. And just to embellish on that. It\u2019s really a phased approach to be capital efficient. ExxonMobil has done a great job of optimizing the development, lowering the costs, the learnings from ship one, help us in ship two and that will continue in ship three. So we\u2019re really looking at a phased approach, but as Greg said, maybe with more compression of the timeframe. I just want to remind everyone, the 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent we talked about, we\u2019ve had 16 successes. So it\u2019s basically a 500 million per discovery. And that\u2019s world-class and it\u2019s got very low cost, very high returns. And ExxonMobil is doing a great job moving the project forward. Brian Singer : Great. Thanks. And then John, in your opening comments, you talked about cash flow overtime going to dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchase. Is there any change in the timing of when you would expect to consider that? Is that still when you get more indifferent cash flow mode post or with the startup of Phase 2 in Guyana? Or is that something that we could see earlier or later than that? John Rielly : No, I would say right now stick with our guidance that it\u2019s going to be timed with Phase 2 coming online. Again that is the big inflection point for us from a free cash flow and earnings standpoint. John Hess : And the priority would be on increasing the dividend as the first call. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vin Lovaglio with Mizuho Securities. Mr. Lovaglio, your phone may be on mute. Paul Sankey : Hello? Hi. Sorry, it\u2019s Paul Sankey here. Can you hear me? John Hess : Yes, we can hear you Paul. Paul Sankey : Sorry about that. I got myself on mute. Guys you put out a note on the ESG and oil and gas, and you attested very, very well in terms of certainly your disclosures. Can you talk a little bit about some of the areas where you think you can still get better? And I\u2019m specifically thinking about flaring. And beyond that could you talk about the impact of Guyana and how that will change some of the metrics that you do such a great job of disclosing? Thanks. John Hess : Thank you, Paul. Obviously, ESG sustainability is core value for the company. We\u2019ve been doing a sustainability report for 22 years. We\u2019re honored and proud to be an industry leader. We want to make sure we continue that leadership role. As we look at our flaring, let\u2019s say in the Bakken, we\u2019re ahead of the state limits and we have a program in place to continue that. And we\u2019re looking at updating our sustainability efforts in terms of the environment. And we\u2019ll be coming out with some new targets within the year for the next five years. So that\u2019s a work in progress. But we always want to stay ahead of the regulations. And in terms of Guyana, the gas is basically reinjected. Again, ExxonMobil does a great job, minimizing the flaring in startup, et cetera. But the majority of gas is reinjected, so there\u2019s really not an issue there. And one of the things we\u2019re going to be looking at in Guyana is how can we help the country going forward in social responsibility, which is something that\u2019s very important to our company and our board and every employee. Paul Sankey : Got it. John, thanks very much for that. And then a follow-up on the previous hedging question, totally different subject. How do you expect that hedging program that has sort of changed around a little bit overtime? I wonder how you expect Guyana to affect that going forward and whether or not you will have a different hedging strategy, let\u2019s say in perhaps five years time? Thanks. John Rielly : Sure. I mean, we do look at it, Paul, year-to-year and make our decisions on our hedging requirements. And right now, obviously with the investment still going in for Guyana until we get to that Phase 2, we wanted to put a significant amount insurance on to ensure we fund that. As we move forward and we get to more free cash flow, we\u2019ll still be, obviously have a heavy oil portion in our portfolio. We\u2019ll make those decisions year-to-year and we could make some different decisions at that point in time. Paul Sankey : Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, May. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and is on our website, www.hess.com. I would first like to express our hope that all of you listening and your families are safe and well. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced spending plans we've put in place, many of the forward-looking statements from our previous presentations and investor materials have changed and should not be relied upon. We will provide updated guidance during this call. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations and those of our business partners, service companies and suppliers have experienced and may continue to experience adverse effects, including disruptions, delays or temporary suspensions of operations and supply chains, temporary closures of facilities and other employee impacts. In addition, the pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our oil demand and prices, export capacity and the availability of commercial storage options, which could lead to further curtailments and shut-ins of production by our industry. To the extent we or our business partners, service companies and suppliers experience these or other effects, our production, liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects may be adversely affected. The time line and potential magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic is currently unknown. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. On the line with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. In compliance with social distancing protocols, we are conducting this call remotely, so please bear with us. In case there are audio issues, we will be posting transcripts of each speaker's prepared remarks on www.hess.com, following the presentation. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call, and we hope you and your families are well and staying healthy. Today, I will discuss our strategic response to the market downturn and the steps we are taking to manage in a sustained period of low oil prices. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations and John Rielly will follow to review our financial results. As we all know, the world has been battling a global pandemic and the danger it poses to society. Our hearts go out to those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19 and also to those who are struggling with the loss of jobs. Our top priority throughout this crisis is the safety of our workforce and the communities where we operate. Our multidisciplinary Hess emergency response team has been overseeing our plans and precautions to reduce the risk of COVID-19 in our work environment. We are grateful to every healthcare worker and first responder for all they are doing during this very difficult time. In addition, the pandemic has had a severe impact on the near-term oil demand, resulting in a sharp decline in oil prices. Our priorities in this low-price environment are to preserve cash, preserve capability and preserve the long-term value of our assets. In terms of preserving cash, we came into 2020 with approximately 80% of our oil production hedged, with put options for 130,000 barrels per day at $55 per barrel WTI, and 20,000 barrels per day at $60 per barrel Brent. To maximize the value of our production, we have chartered three very large crude carriers or VLCCs to store two million barrels each of May, June and July Bakken crude oil production, which we expect to sell in Asia in the fourth quarter of 2020. As announced on March 17, we further strengthened the company's cash position and liquidity through a $1 billion three year term loan underwritten by JPMorgan Chase. We also have a $3.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility and no material debt maturities until the term loan comes due in 2023. We have further reduced our 2020 capital and exploratory budget down to $1.9 billion, a 37% reduction from our original budget of $3 billion. This reduction will be achieved primarily by shifting from a 6-rig program to one rig in the Bakken by the end of this month and the deferral of certain exploratory and development expenditures in Guyana. Continuing to operating one rig in the Bakken, our largest operated asset, will help us preserve our capability in lean manufacturing, which over the years has generated significant cost efficiencies and productivity improvements. We plan to stay at one rig until WTI oil prices stabilize in a $50 per barrel range. In terms of preserving long-term value of our assets, our top priority is Guyana, which is one of the industry's most attractive investments. On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we have made 16 discoveries since 2015. The current estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the block stands at more than eight billion barrels of oil equivalent, with multibillion barrels of exploration potential remaining. The Liza Phase one development achieved first production in December and is expected to reach its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day in June. The Liza Phase two development remains on track for a 2022 start-up, with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. Development of the Payara field with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day has been deferred six to 12 months pending government approval to proceed. In addition, pandemic-related travel restrictions have temporarily slowed our drilling campaign in Guyana. As a result, our production objective of more than 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day has been moved into 2026. In summary, our company is in a strong position to manage through this low-price environment and to prosper when the oil market recovers with our low cost of supply and high-return investments that will drive material cash flow growth and increasing financial returns. Finally, we want to thank our employees for their strong commitment to operating safely and reliably during this pandemic. We are deeply proud of every member of our team and confident in our ability to meet the challenges ahead. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. I'd like to provide an update on our detail on our response to the significant decline in oil prices. First, I'd like to describe the actions we're taking to protect the health and safety of our business continuity in the midst of the global pandemic. A cross-functional Hess response team has been implementing a variety of health and safety measures in consultation with suppliers and partners, which are based on the most current recommendations by government and public health agencies. This includes enhanced cleaning procedures, travel restrictions, extended work schedules at offshore platforms and social distancing initiatives such as remote working [Technical Difficulty] of personnel on work sites wherever possible. As a result of these measures, I am pleased to report that to date, we've had no report [Technical Difficulty] COVID-19 among Hess employees. Turning to our operational results for the quarter. We delivered strong performance across our portfolio and especially in the Bakken. Companywide net production averaged 344,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was above guidance of 320,000 to 325,000 per day. In the second quarter, we expect net production to be in the range of 310,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This reduction from the first quarter is due to low nominations in Southeast Asia caused by COVID demand impacts, nonoperated well shut-ins Bakken [Technical Difficulty] in the Gulf of Mexico. For the full year 2020, net production is forecast to average approximately 320,000 barrels of oil per day, excluding Libya. In the Bakken, we are currently operating two rigs and expect to be [Technical Difficulty] this month. Our plan is to maintain at one rig as oil prices move above $50 per barrel on a sustained basis. Operating one [Technical Difficulty] key operating capabilities that we have worked very hard to build over the years, both within Hess and within our primary drilling and completion suppliers. Bakken capital spend is now expected to be approximately $740 million in 2020. And assuming a 1-rig program in 2021, Bakken capital spend would drop to approximately next year. In the first quarter, our Bakken team delivered strong results. [Technical Difficulty] success of our plug and perf completion designs and mild weather conditions. Before reducing the rig count of 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for 11 days in March, well ahead of schedule, demonstrating the exceptional production capacity of our Bakken position. First quarter Bakken net production, 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of more than 46% from the year ago quarter, [Technical Difficulty] guidance of approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In 2020, we now expect to drill approximately 70 Bakken wells and to bring approximately 110 new wells online. We plan to complete wells [Technical Difficulty] wells online unless netback prices drop below variable cash production costs, or we are physically unable to move the barrels. In the second quarter, we forecast that our Bakken net production will average approximately 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2020, we continue to forecast [Technical Difficulty] approximately 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Assuming a 1-rig program through next year, we forecast net Bakken production in 2021 will average between 255,000 [Technical Difficulty] barrels of oil equivalent per day, [Technical Difficulty] lower than this year. We continue planning for the Tioga Gas Plant turnaround in the third quarter of 2020, while closely monitoring potential COVID-19 risks. Moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico [Technical Difficulty] averaged 74,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Esox-1 well, which came online in February, is [Technical Difficulty] plateau rate by the end of the second quarter. No other production wells are planned to be drilled in [Technical Difficulty]. We will participate with a 25% working [Technical Difficulty] BP-operated Galapagos deep exploration well, expected to spud later this month. This is a hub-class cretaceous-aged [Technical Difficulty] in the Mississippi Canyon area. In the second quarter, we forecast that Gulf of Mexico net production will average between 65,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance shut-ins at all [Technical Difficulty]. Planned 30-day shutdowns at Conger and Llano deferred to the third quarter. For the full year 2020, Gulf of Mexico net production is forecast to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent today. In the Gulf of Thailand, production in the first quarter was 58,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. During April, natural gas nominations were reduced due to slower economic activity associated with COVID-19. As a result, we [Technical Difficulty] second quarter net production to average approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and the full year 2020 to average approximately 50,000 barrels [Technical Difficulty] Now turning to Guyana. Our discoveries and developments on the Stabroek Block world-class in every respect, with some of the lowest [Technical Difficulty] industry. The adjustments we have made elsewhere in the portfolio [Technical Difficulty] the long-term value of this extraordinary asset. Production from Liza Phase one commenced in [Technical Difficulty] 2019 and in the first quarter averaged 58,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day or 15,000 barrels oil equivalent [indiscernible] net oil per day net to Hess. As of this week, gross [Technical Difficulty] to approximately 75,000 barrels of oil and is expected to reach its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day in June. Liza Phase two will utilize the Liza Unity FPSO [Technical Difficulty] to produce up to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. Despite some pandemic-related delays, the project is progressing to plan, with about 70% of the overall work completed and first oil remains on track for 2022. [Technical Difficulty] ExxonMobil, some activities for the planned Payara development are being deferred, pending government approval, creating a potential delay in production start-up of six to 12 months. As a result of pandemic-related travel restrictions in Guyana, ExxonMobil has temporarily idled two drillships, Stena Carron and the Noble Tom Madden. These vessels are expected to resume work by June. Development activities are continuing with the Noble Don Taylor and Noble Bob Douglas drillships. The [Technical Difficulty] partnership has deferred the addition of a fifth drillship [Technical Difficulty] Guyana. The deferral of Payara and the reduced drilling activities due to COVID-19 travel restrictions has resulted in reduction to our 2020 Guyana capital and exploratory budget of approximately $200 million. In closing, the team once again [Technical Difficulty] execution and delivery across our asset base under very challenging conditions. I'd like to personally thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication. [Technical Difficulty] actions to ensure the health and safety of our workforce and to ensure that our company is well positioned for this historic downturn and [Technical Difficulty] that is sure to come. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will discuss our ongoing efforts to preserve cash in this low price environment, review our first quarter financial results and update our 2020 guidance. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.1 billion, and our total liquidity was $5.9 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion. Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is committed through May 2023. We have taken prudent steps to improve our liquidity and reduce costs. As John mentioned, we have cut our 2020 E&P capital guidance another $300 million to $1.9 billion, which is $1.1 billion below our initial guidance from the beginning of the year. On March 16, 2020, we entered into a $1 billion three year term loan agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank. Aside from the term loan, which matures in March 2023, we have no other near-term debt maturities. We also have more than 80% of our remaining 2020 oil production hedged with $55 WTI put options for 130,000 barrels of oil per day and $60 Brent put options for 20,000 barrels of oil per day. At April 30, 2020, realized settlements to date were approximately $300 million, plus the unrealized fair value of open contracts of $1.05 billion, results in a total realized and unrealized value of approximately $1.350 billion before considering premiums paid. Finally, in response to the current low oil price environment, we have actively cut costs to align with our lower planned activity levels and to remove discretionary spend, which has contributed to a decrease in our projected full year 2020 E&P cash operating costs of approximately $225 million. We are continuing to look for further capital and operating cost reductions. Now turning to results. We incurred a net loss of $2.433 billion in the first quarter of 2020, including noncash impairment and other after-tax charges of $2.251 billion, resulting from the low price environment compared to a net loss of $222 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we incurred a net loss of $182 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to an adjusted loss of $180 million in the previous quarter. Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $120 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to a net loss of $124 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the first quarter of 2020 and fourth quarter of 2019 were as follows : lower realized selling prices reduced results by $147 million. Higher sales volumes improved results by $22 million. Lower cash costs improved results by $78 million, lower exploration expenses improved results by $66 million. All other items reduced results by $15 million. Overall increase in first quarter results of $4 million. Turning to Midstream. On an adjusted basis, the Midstream segment had net income of $61 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $49 million in the previous quarter, reflecting higher throughput volumes. Midstream EBITDA on an adjusted basis and before noncontrolling interest amounted to $193 million in the first quarter 2020, compared to $157 million in the previous quarter. Turning to corporate. On an adjusted basis, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $123 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $105 million in the previous quarter, which included capitalized interest expense of $11 million of Liza Field. Capitalized interest for the Liza Field ceased upon first production in December 2019. First quarter 2010 corporate expenses included a nonrecurring charge of $7 million for legal costs related to former downstream businesses. Now turning to guidance. For E&P, as previously mentioned, our second quarter net production is estimated to be in the range of 310,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With the unprecedented reduction in oil demand due to COVID-19, U.S. commercial storage is approaching capacity, resulting in a sharp decline in oil prices. To maximize the value of our production, we have chartered three VLCCs and plan to store two million [Technical Difficulty] each of May, June and July Bakken crude oil production on the VLCCs and sell these barrels in the fourth quarter. We have hedged the contango in the forward Brent curve for these barrels. We do not expect to shut in any of our operated production due to our marketing arrangements and our VLCC storage. From an accounting standpoint, sales volumes will be underlifted by approximately four million barrels of oil in the second quarter and two million barrels of oil in the third quarter as a result of using the VLCCs. While we will receive cash for settlement gains as the put option contracts mature, the net realized gain on contracts associated with the six million barrels of underlifted oil comprised of the cash settlement less the associated amortization of premiums paid will be deferred until the volume stored in the VLCCs are sold. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $10 to $10.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter and for the full year of 2020, down from previous full year guidance of $11.50 to $12.50 per barrel oil equivalent primarily due to cost reduction efforts. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $14 to $15 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter and $15 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2020, down from previous full year guidance of $16.50 to $17.50 per barrel of oil equivalent as a result of the asset impairment charges. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $24 to $25.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter and $25 to $26.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2020. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million in the second quarter, with the full year 2020 guidance now expected to be $145 million to $155 million, down from previous full year guidance of $210 million to $220 million. The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $215 million to $230 million in the second quarter and full year 2020 guidance in the range of $905 million to $930 million, down from previous full year guidance of $940 million to $965 million. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million for the second quarter and in the range of $20 million to $30 million for the full year of 2020, down from previous full year guidance of $80 million to $90 million. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million in the second quarter and full year 2020 guidance in the range of $185 million to $195 million, down from previous full year guidance of $205 million to $215 million. For corporate. Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million in the second quarter and full year 2020 guidance in the range of $115 million to $125 million is unchanged. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the second quarter, with the full year 2020 guidance expected to be $375 million to $385 million, up from previous full year guidance of $350 million to $360 million due to the new term loan. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Ryan Todd, Simmons Energy. Your line is now open. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe if I could start with the Bakken. Obviously, very strong first quarter production. You gave some guidance around the rest of the year. I think some of the numbers cut out as Greg was talking, could you maybe get some clarity around what completion activity looks like. With the one rig running, will you be building ducts you're completing through? And maybe if you can repeat what the one rig CapEx number looks like in 2021? John Hess : Yes, Greg, why don't you give it a try and just maybe we speak just a little slower to let the phones catch up. And if we don't get it, John Rielly will follow up. Greg Hill : Okay. So Ryan, let me start with the capital for the year. The capital for the year in the Bakken will be $740 million. And in that $740 million, we expect to drill approximately 70 Bakken wells and bring 110 new wells online, and we do not plan to build any ducts. We plan to drill and complete all wells that we drill throughout the year and into next year. Ryan Todd : Great. And maybe if I could, on the maybe for you, John Rielly or either one, could you provide some color on the decision to charter the VLCCs in terms of how you view the relative pluses and minuses of storing the barrels on the ground versus on the VLCC? And what sort of pricing or is there a price signal that you need to sell the barrels into the fourth quarter? Or is that all already set up and contracted? John Rielly : So the contango of the difference of the current months in Brent and the future months in Brent, let's say, out to December is already hedged. So we've locked that in. But to maximize the value of our Bakken production and preserve our cash flow for this year, we were able to use our marketing capabilities and our firm transportation to U.S. Gulf Coast to charter three VLCCs to load, store and export two million barrels per month of Bakken crude oil in May, June and July. And basically, that spread has been fixed in Brent. On top of it, it is Brent-based pricing, which obviously provides some advantage instead of WTI, and we plan to market the oil in Asia. In Asia, demand for oil is already improving. So it is possible that we sell the oil before, depending upon before the fourth quarter, depending upon market conditions. But the point is we've hedged it, we've locked it in and, basically, the contango in the market and the fact that we used Brent-based pricing offsets the cost of the charters. There're three different charters, different terms, different rates, but the contango in the market that we've hedged and the fact that it's Brent-based pricing, not TI, more than offsets the cost of the charters. Ryan Todd : Thanks, I appreciate the color there. Operator : Next question, Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Doug Leggate : Thank you everybody. I hope everybody is doing well out there. I guess, my first question would be for Greg, probably. Greg, the resilience of the Bakken has obviously left you with your guidance unchanged. But what does that look like going into 2021 in terms of the underlying production capacity decline rate with the 1-rig program? And I've got a follow-up for Mr. Rielly, please. Greg Hill : Yes. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, if you keep the rig program through 2021, it's about a 10% decline rate for the Bakken. Doug Leggate : No, I apologize, I think I missed that. So let me take a second pop at it then, if I may. If the capacity was already north of 200,000 barrels a day, and you hadn't extended that growth through the back end of this year, does that say the trajectory through the back end of 2020 into 2021 as the exit rate is risked higher? Greg Hill : Yes. Well, the exit rate, we're projecting at the end of the year, 5,000 barrels a day, Doug. So the behavior of it this year is relatively flat because, of course, we built quite a backlog with the six rigs. And we're going to go ahead and complete those wells this year. John Hess : Repeat that number, Greg, it got muffled again. Greg Hill : Okay, John. John Hess : Your exit rate. Greg Hill : Again, the exit rate is going to be 175,000 barrels a day. And the reason it's relatively high is because, with the six rigs, we built a fair number of wells to complete. And our plan, of course, is to complete those. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the color. I know it's tricky in the mountains, Greg. So I'll move on to Mr. Rielly, if that's OK. John, the you were very early to lock in the hedges for this year, and it's obviously paying huge dividends at this point. But as you look into 2021, at the current strip price, it would still have you with a bit of a cash burn if you maintain the current level of spending. So can you walk us through what your flexibility is in the event that the current strip turned out to be right, obviously, we all hope it isn't. But where else do you are you able to do things around because the cash burn could be quite meaningful. John Rielly : So let me first start with, you're right, we've got a great hedge position this year, and we'll continue to monitor the market as we go through the year, and we'll clearly look to put on hedges for 2021 as we get closer to the end of the year. Hopefully, price is way better, and then we can get hedges on. But let me then follow your question along, should prices stay lower. So everything we've done and the plans we put in place is set up for a two year low price scenario. With the term loan, with the hedges this year, with the reductions in capital that we've made this year. And if we were looking at strip prices going these prices, you said, going into next year, our production I mean, sorry, our capital spend should be flat to potentially down a little and it's due to with the one rig in the Bakken, as Greg mentioned, it's $740 million this year, go down to $300 million with the 1-rig program or somewhere around $300 million next year. And then obviously, it will be offset by some increase in Guyana capital spend. So one, looking for capital to remain flat, but we'll be looking at capital reductions, further capital reductions, further operating cost reductions as we move through this year and into 2021, especially if prices stay low. And then obviously, we do have the one rig. It's not something we want to do as you move into 2021. However, if prices did stay low, it's something that we could reduce down to 0, at least for a period of time and bring back on. As Greg had mentioned, we've spent a lot of time building up this lean manufacturing capability. So we really don't want to do that, but it's clearly a lever that we can look at as we move into 2021. So I think that's what we we are constantly looking for other things that we can do. But I also would tell you is the plans we put in place are set for this low price environment to get us all the way through 2021, without incurring any additional debt through the end of that year and then being in a place where phase two starts up right there in 2022, and we're getting an additional, say, 65,000 barrels of Brent-based oil from Liza Phase two. And the hope would be, by 2022, you're getting a bit better prices there. So we really have put this plan in place in everything we're doing, even though we're continuing to fine-tune and try to cut costs but to get us through this two year low price environment. Doug Leggate : John, if I just may tag on very quickly to that. And it's maybe one for John Hess, actually. One of your peers this morning or last night, I should say, talked about their dividend and suspended their dividend. I think there's semantics between suspending and canceling because we know the cash flow capacity for Hess is about to inflect significantly higher. But in a scenario where we [indiscernible] extended period of depressed prices, is the dividend an option in terms of at least temporarily a source of incremental cash? How are you thinking about that? And I'll leave it there. John Hess : Yes. Doug, I believe the company you're talking about is in a much different financial position than we are. So I wouldn't want to try to compare us to anybody else. But having said that, look, if oil prices are severely depressed for a long enough period of time, all options would be on the table. Having said that, we think we've taken the steps to put ourselves in a strong financial position, as John said, and we are committed to our dividend and certainly are not contemplating a cut in it at this time. Doug Leggate : I appreciate the color. Thanks a lot. Operator : Next in line is Devin McDermott, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Devin McDermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask the first one on the Bakken and clarifying some of the remarks, I think, Greg made during his opening remarks here, and that's on just the point at which you'd start to bring back activity in the Bakken. And Greg, I think you said that it was around $50 WTI, where you would begin to add from the current 1-rig cadence that you're at right now. I was wondering if you just would clarify if I heard that correctly. And then two, a bit more detail on how you think about the economics and decision-making behind beginning to increase CapEx to the extent we see higher prices in the future. Greg Hill : Yes. So I switched phones. So hopefully, everybody can hear me much better. So yes, what we'd have to see is what we say is a strong stable $50 oil price before we'd add a rig back in the Bakken. And obviously, when we got to that point, we would decide at what pace and what cadence we would add those back. So we would similar to what we did last time during the downturn where we dropped down to two rigs, we slowly added those rigs back in order to maintain that lean manufacturing edge and not have our cost rate or whatever. So as John said in his opening remarks, that is one of our key strategies this year, is to be able to maintain that capability so that we can smoothly ramp the Bakken, hopefully in the future. Devin McDermott : Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And my follow-up relates to the Bakken and all the rest of the portfolio. How should we think about the level of spending required to hold production flat. In the Bakken, how do you think about that activity level now going from the efficiency gains and overall cost deflation that you've seen? And then for the rest of the portfolio, ex Guyana, just an update on what that maintenance level of spending is. John Hess : John, why don't you take that one? Greg Hill : Yes, John? John Rielly : Sure. So to get to, let's call it, the flat production level now at the lower, and it's somewhere around, let's say, call it, three rigs, and it will be right around that level. And you can always kind of, as a rule of thumb, put $200 million per rig. So you're talking about $600 million then maybe to get it back and keep it at a flat level where we're at right now. Once you go back to, say, four rigs, we could start to grow it from this level, again. And you saw the capability that we have in the Bakken in that first quarter to deliver when, obviously, weather was good, but just our operations just ran at a really high level. And so if you started going back to four rigs, you could begin to grow this again. But again, as Greg said, getting a solid $50 WTI price in place if we start putting it back, three rigs, we could sustainably hold the level, and then we can decide from there whether to grow. Devin McDermott : Great. And the rest of the portfolio in terms of holding everything else flat? How should we think about that maintenance CapEx level of spending? John Rielly : So let's just talk JDA and North Malay Basin first. Under normal operations there, we've always talked about somewhere with that $150 million to $200 million that can come in bunch as the capital because you're putting wellhead platforms there, but you can pretty much hold that flat at that 60,000 to 65,000 barrels a day for a number of years, basically out through the end of the PSCs with that type of capital levels. The GOM is the interesting one because, again, what we had been saying is we need to do some tieback wells over time, and we could hold it flat, let's say, for three to five years, if we were putting in these tieback wells like Esox, the successful Esox well, we could hold that Gulf of Mexico flat now in that 65,000-type level for a number of years. Now as Greg said on his opening remarks, we're not drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. We're not doing tieback wells, and we're not there's no plan for us right now in 2021 in this low price environment to put a tieback well in. So with the additions we've done this year, you won't get as much of a decline. Next year, you're still going to get some declines, you could get somewhere in I'm going to call an approximate 10% decline for the Gulf of Mexico going into 2021. And then if we don't put further wells in there, the Gulf of Mexico will continue to decline. So our original goal and we'll see when the prices get back to more appropriate levels is to get those tieback wells in. Greg mentioned, we have the exploration well. The Galapagos deep well that we're drilling a well that BP is drilling. We're a partner in. So we do have a very exciting Gulf of Mexico lease portfolio that we would like to get some exploration wells in over the next couple of years as prices get better. And then we do think we can grow the Gulf of Mexico production. And then Guyana you obviously know, we're going to be in a growth mode there. Phase two coming online early 2022, all on track for that. Then we've got the delay, six to 12 months delay in Payara. But as John Hess said in his remarks, growing at 750,000 barrels a day gross by 2026. So look, we've got a nice balance of the portfolio. So we're not just tied to the shale production. So obviously, we're reducing our rigs there, but we have the offsetting growth here coming in Guyana. And Southeast Asia can stay relatively flat with limited capital. And then the Gulf of Mexico will be a [indiscernible]. As we see prices improve, we'll get back to work there. Great. Devin McDermott : All right, Thanks for taking the question. Operator : Next question is from the line of Paul Cheng, Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Paul Cheng : Hi guys. I have a couple. First, clarification. For John Rielly that, the Guyana production number that you guys show in the press release, is that including the tax barrel gross up? John Rielly : So Paul, I don't know if you remember, at the end of last year, we put up some deferred tax assets with the start of first production, essentially NOLs. So there were a lot of expenses incurred in Guyana. So we've built up this NOL here at the start. So there, we'll be utilizing that NOL and do not expect any gross up tax barrels in 2020. Paul Cheng : Okay. And going forward, should we assume there's a gross up tax barrel? And at that time, are you going to provide a number that in both what is the adjusted net to you and what is the report? John Rielly : Yes, yes. We will get that number. So and again, we'll be disclosing the current taxes that are there in Guyana, along with that revenue adjustment. And yes, that will be something that will be available, and you will be able to see and model. Paul Cheng : Okay. And on the I have to apologize that the mechanic on the VLCC storage, so we're going to have the underlift in the second and third quarter. So we will assume that the entire six million barrels, based on the current plan, is going to be an overlift in the fourth quarter? That what's the price that we should assume? I'm trying to understand how we expect that. And also in the second and third quarter, you actually already have the cash coming in because of the settlement, right? So is that going to show up in the working capital? Or is going to show up in the other line? John Rielly : Correct. So let me start with the hedges. The cash, we will be receiving the cash from there, and that will show up in the working capital line. Then in the fourth quarter, when it is recognized because we'll defer the gain on that, that's when it will then come back out of working capital at that point. And to your question, again, yes, it's right. So we will have the underlift in the second and third, and you should assume in the fourth quarter that we will have the overlift of the six million barrels coming in the fourth quarter. And just so you know also, just going through the accounting. In the second and third quarters, we will have all you will see the production cost and the DD&A associated with the production of the six million barrels, that will be there. Then what we do is put it into inventory on the balance sheet and put a credit through our marketing line. So you will get to see the actual costs associated with it. Then when we lift in the fourth quarter, we'll remove the inventory and the cost of those barrels will go through the marketing line, and that's when we pick up the revenue as well. Paul Cheng : I see. Thank you. John Rielly : You're welcome Operator : Next is Roger Read from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Roger Read : Yes. Thank you and good morning. John Hess : Good morning. Roger Read : Yes hopefully everybody. I just was curious if we could get into the impacts of the deferrals done in Guyana thinking, first off, the near-term issues would be deferrals on the rigs, how that affects kind of overall economics of the wells. And the June start date, how good does that look at this point? Is there something specific we're waiting to see that, that is a good day to use, or are we at risk of further delays there? John Hess : Greg, why don't you grab that? Greg Hill : So Roger, in my opening remarks, I talked about that's solely COVID-19 related that those rigs have been idled, and that's purely to do with crew changes. And so in order to protect those crews, they're quarantining people for 14 days. So if you kind of run through all the math on that, ExxonMobil made the decision really to hot stack. We are on track to get both of those rigs running again by June. So we're in good shape, no worries there. In terms of the wells, really no impact on the economics of the wells, right? I mean really what has been deferred is the start of Phase two drilling. And of course, the exploration that we want to get done as well. And so as we look forward now with four rigs going by June forward, there's really three objectives that we're trying to do. One is to finish the Phase one Yellowtail. Two is get two to three more exploration wells in the ground, including a couple that have tailed to go down and test the deeper or penetrate the deeper Santonian. And then the third objective is to continue drilling on Phase one and get started on Phase 2, producer drilling. So that's how the program is going to kind of layout between now and the end of the year. Roger Read : Okay. Great. And then question, going back to the VLCC play here. I just want to make sure I understand what the ongoing risk reward is here? Or is everything, in the way you're thinking about the price realization when you actually physically deliver the barrels in the fourth quarter is already set? I guess what I'm trying is the volatility we've seen in the market, forward curve looks good today, but who knows when we get there, better or worse. And so I'm just trying to understand, again, are the barrels only weighing on physical delivery and the price is all set? Or are we still looking at additional price volatility as a reward or as a risk here? John Hess : No, it's a great question. Basically, look at it this way. We have our oil hedged already in the $55 and $60 range that I talked about. You add the contango. It is Brent based, and you get an advantage uptick for TI, and this would be originally TI based. And then you take off the VLCC charter. And when you do that, the price is set and you're actually getting a value uptick because of moving it out of the United States where oil is locked up into a market that will take it. So it's really to deal with the physical risk and the financial risk has pretty much been laid off. Roger Read : All right, great. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Arun Jayaram, JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Arun Jayaram : Good morning. Team. John, I was wondering if you could provide maybe a little bit of perspective on where we're at in terms of the Guyana election and perhaps provide some details on how you and Exxon are adjusting your longer-term development exploration activities for a phase beyond pending governor's approvals, COVID-19. And specifically, I was wondering how is this impacting, how you're thinking about the [indiscernible] timing on the FPSOs as well as the longer-term thoughts versus exploration versus development spend? John Hess : Yes. No. Thanks, Arun, for that question. In terms of Guyana, and the political landscape, the recount for the Guyana national election actually resumed yesterday. And United States and international observers have encouraged this process to go to completion. So it will reflect the will of the Guyanese people. And we expect a transparent election results in the weeks ahead. And at that time, when there is a new sitting government, a newly elected sitting government, we would assume the first, second and third priority for us in Exxon and CNOOC is to move the approval for the Payara development forward, working with the government. And so that pretty much explains the six to 12-month delay on Payara. And then a combination of the COVID-initiated delays in staffing the rigs has made us have a slowdown for a few months. But as Greg said, we should be going back to a 4-rig program in June. The first, second and third priority will be development wells, but then we'll start feathering in exploration wells and appraisal wells as well. So a temporary interruption, yes, but not a major one. And then we would move forward with our exploration and appraisal activities and development activities accordingly. On top of that, that six to 12-month delay in Payara will affect start-up of the fourth and fifth ship as we currently have it contemplated, such that we will have the we plan now on having the five ships and at least 750,000 barrels a day of oil production online in 2026 instead of 2025. So a delay, yes, but not a major one. And it certainly still is our top investment priority and the top priority for Exxon to move forward with the plans that we've outlined in the past, some minor delays but not major delays. Arun Jayaram : Great. And just a quickie for Greg. You see a big size Bakken beat in 1Q. Could you just give us maybe the drivers of the beat relative to your guidance? I know weather was pretty benign, but maybe thoughts on weather as well as the well productivity that you saw in the quarter? Greg Hill : Yes. So there was really two major things. One was the weather, which we had. So mother nature was kind to us in the first quarter, which is, as we all know, has a big impact sometimes in the Bakken. So we built some of that into our contingency, in our forecast for the first quarter. But even more important is the wells that we brought on in the fourth quarter just behaved really well. And so we had planned to convert those to rod pump during the first quarter. And in fact, we didn't need to because the wells still were flowing well through the first quarter. So we got a really nice production bump from the wells that were turned online in the fourth quarter, but also in the first quarter. So it was a combination of those two things that where they outperformed. Arun Jayaram : Great, thanks for thank you. Operator : We have our next question from Pavel Molchanov, Raymond James. Your line is now open. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, most of your CapEx cuts pertain to your domestic operations, and I suppose, Guyana as well. What about exploration? I'm particularly thinking Suriname, which was supposed to be kind of a late 2020 or early 2021 story. Have you changed any of the medium-term plans for beginning drilling there? John Hess : Greg? Greg Hill : Yes, sure. No, our plans are still to drill that well in 2021 in Suriname. Pavel Molchanov : Got it. Okay. Is that contingent on level of commodity prices? Greg Hill : No, I think that's the operator is in control of that and Kosmos, but the latest discussions we've had with them, we are still planning the well for 2021. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. I appreciate it guys. Operator : Next in line is Brian Singer, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. John Hess : Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer : On Guyana, looking beyond phase 2, I realized that there are some understandable delays and phase three cuts. I wonder if there's any benefit that you could see or are seeing on the cost front. Can you talk to the cost environment that you're seeing for sanctioning longer-term deepwater offshore projects and whether you see any adjustments to that just as a result of the environment that we're at? John Hess : Yes. Greg, do you want to take that, please? Greg Hill : Sure. Yes. So Brian, as you know, the majority of services have been contracted, certainly for Phase two and also Phase 3. Now later on in time, as you get into other phases, there could be depending on commodity prices, obviously, there could be concessions there. But a large part of the contracts are already under way for, certainly, the activity in Guyana that we're doing now. Now as I look across our portfolio and kind of what we're seeing and we're in the midst of this, working with all of our contract partners now, suppliers to adjust to the activity, but also keep continuity of the crews and brings more costs out, we're seeing kind of on the order of 10% to 15%, and that is both in the offshore and the onshore parts of our business. So I think that's a reasonable number because as you know, those companies were potentially already distressed. So they don't have as much to give maybe as they did in the last downturn. So 10% to 15% is what we're seeing. Brian Singer : Great. And then my follow-up is with regards to the Malaysia annual gas demand. Highlighted some of the weakness that you're seeing here near term. Do you or do you get any sense as to whether there are secular impact here to demand and ultimately to production versus just these being cyclical on a sign of the current environment? John Hess : Yes, we definitely think it's one-off, and we already see demand recovering. But John Rielly, you want to elaborate? John Rielly : Sure. No. That's what we are seeing. Obviously, Malaysia, they had their shelter-in-place, they call that MCO, the movement control order. They actually did lift it a little earlier than the original plan. So again, we do see this from a cyclical just standpoint here, kind of one-off. So you see the Q2 number, we are forecasting at 35%, almost kind of equal production out of NMB and JDA. And then we have a slow ramp forecasted for the rest of the year. And again, we just going back to the uncertainty around COVID-19 and the resulting business activity. But we are seeing some green shoots here. So we just do think it's more of a one-off. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Latif. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today\u2019s conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess\u2019 annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today\u2019s conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. On the line with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. As we did last quarter, in case there are any audio issues, we will be posting transcripts of each speakers prepared remarks on www.hess.com following the presentation. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. We hope you and your families are all staying well during these challenging times. Today, I will discuss the steps we are taking to manage through a sustained period of low oil prices. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations, and John Rielly will review our financial results. In response to the pandemic\u2019s severe impact on oil prices, our priorities are to preserve cash, preserve capability and preserve the long term value of our assets. In terms of preserving cash, we came into 2020 with approximately 80% of our oil production hedged with put options for 130,000 barrels per day at $55 per barrel West Texas Intermediate and 20,000 barrels per day at $60 per barrel Brent. To maximize the value of our production, in March and April, when U.S. oil storage was at tank tops, we used our marketing capabilities, our Hess Midstream infrastructure, and our firm transportation arrangements to the U.S. Gulf Coast to charter three very large crude carriers or VLCCs to store 2 million barrels each of May, June and July Bakken crude oil production. The first VLCC cargo of 2 million barrels has been sold at a premium to Brent for delivery in China in September. The other two VLCC cargos are expected to be sold in Asia in the fourth quarter. We further strengthened the company\u2019s cash position and liquidity through a $1 billion three year term loan underwritten by JPMorgan Chase. This loan was successfully syndicated during the second quarter. At the end of June, we had $1.6 billion of cash, a $3.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility and no debt maturities until the term loan comes due in 2023. We made major reductions in our capital and exploratory budget for 2020, reducing it 37% from our original budget of $3 billion, down to $1.9 billion. The majority of this reduction comes from dropping from a six rig program to one rig in the Bakken, which we completed in May. We also made significant cuts in our 2020 companywide cash costs. On our first quarter call, we announced a reduction of $225 million. During the second quarter, we identified an additional $40 million with further reductions anticipated. A key for us to preserve capability is continuing to operate one rig in the Bakken. Greg Hill and our Bakken team have made tremendous progress over the years in Lean manufacturing, which has delivered significant cost efficiencies and productivity improvements that we want to preserve for the future. In terms of preserving the long term value of our assets, our top priority is Guyana, an extraordinary, world class asset. On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is operator, we have made 16 significant discoveries on the block since 2015. The current estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the block stands at more than 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent, with multi billion barrels of exploration potential remaining. In June, we resumed a four rig drilling operation, with two of the rigs focused on development wells and two on exploration and appraisal activities. The Liza Phase one development, which has an estimated breakeven price of $35 per barrel Brent, achieved first production in December and is now expected to reach its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day in August. The Liza Phase two development with an estimated breakeven price of $25 per barrel Brent and production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, remains on track for an early 2022 start-up. The development of the Payara field with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day has potentially been deferred six to 12 months, pending government approval to proceed. Planning for the fourth and fifth FPSOs is underway, which will be further optimized by this year's exploration and appraisal drilling results. Our strategy is guided by our company's long-standing commitment to sustainability, which creates value for all our stakeholders. Earlier this month, we announced publication of our 23rd Annual Sustainability Report, which details our environmental, social and governance or ESG strategy and performance. In terms of safety, since 2014, we have reduced our severe safety incident rate by 36% and achieved a 67% reduction in process safety incidents. In the critical area of climate change, we have reduced scope one and scope two equity greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 60% over the past 12 years. We also are contributing to groundbreaking work by the Salk Institute to develop plants with larger root systems that are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere. We continue to be recognized as an industry leader for the quality of our ESG performance and disclosure. And in May we're named to the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the 12th consecutive year, earning the number one ranking for an oil and gas company and ranking number nine on the list overall. In summary, our long-term strategy has enabled us to build a high-quality and diversified portfolio that is resilient in a low price environment and puts us in a strong position to prosper when oil prices recover. Our portfolio provides long-term resource growth with multiple phases of low-cost Guyana oil developments that are expected to drive industry-leading cash flow growth over the course of the decade. As our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will prioritize debt reduction and increasing cash returns to shareholders. Finally, we want to thank our employees for their continued commitment to operating safely and reliably during this pandemic. The safety of our workforce and the communities where we operate will remain our top priority. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. In the second quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance across our portfolio. Company-wide net production averaged 334,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was above the top end of our guidance of 310,000 to 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was driven both by strong results in the Bakken, where advantaged infrastructure position enabled us to avoid shedding in production and by higher nominations in Southeast Asia, where demand is increasing as the economy recovers. In the third quarter, we expect company-wide net production to be in the range of 320,000 to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. This reduction from the second quarter reflects planned downtime in the Gulf of Mexico. Our production guidance for full year 2020 is now approximately 330,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, up from our previous guidance of approximately 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Bakken, we've been operating one rig since May, down from six rigs earlier in the year. Operating one rig allows us to maintain key operating capabilities that we have worked hard to build over the years both within Hess and among our primary drilling and completion contractors. In the second quarter, our Bakken team once again delivered strong results, capitalizing on the success of our plug and perf completion design and mild weather conditions. Second quarter Bakken net production averaged 194,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 39% from the year ago quarter and above our guidance of approximately 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Following our successful transition to plug and perf completions, further efficiency gains combined with cost reductions across our supply chain allowed us to achieve an average drilling and completion cost per well of approximately $6 million in the second quarter. We believe that through the application of technology and lean manufacturing techniques that we can continue to push our D&C costs even lower. For the third quarter, our guidance for Bakken net production is approximately 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As announced by Hess Midstream earlier this month, the planned maintenance turnaround at Tioga Gas Plant originally scheduled for the third quarter of 2020 will now be deferred until 2021 to ensure safe and timely execution in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Tioga Gas Plant expansion project is well advanced and is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. The resulting incremental gas processing capacity will be available in 2021 upon completion of the turnaround. For the full year 2020, our guidance for Bakken net production is approximately 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from our previous guidance of 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, second quarter net production averaged 68,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Esox-1 well, which came online in February is expected to reach its gross peak rate of approximately 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Hess in the third quarter, and to average approximately 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Hess in 2020. No other production wells are planned to be drilled in 2020 in the Gulf of Mexico. However, we are participating in the BP-operated Galapagos deep exploration well with a 25% working interest in this hub-class cretaceous-aged opportunity in the Mississippi Canyon area, the well spud in May and is still drilling. In the third quarter, our guidance for Gulf of Mexico net production is expected to be between 50,000 and 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day reflecting planned maintenance of third-party-operated facilities that will shut in Conger and Llano for approximately 40 days beginning August 1 as well as a planned nine-day maintenance shutdown at the Shenzi field. For the full year 2020, our guidance for Gulf of Mexico net production is approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Gulf of Thailand, production in the second quarter was 44,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day above our guidance of approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. During April, natural gas nominations reflected slower economic activity associated with COVID-19, but nominations began to rebound in the second half of the quarter as the restrictions on movement were lifted and economy began to recover. Our guidance for our third quarter and full year 2020 net production is between 50,000 and 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now turning to Guyana. Production from Liza Phase 1 commenced in December 2019 and in the second quarter averaged 86,000 gross barrels of oil per day or 22,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess. Further work to commission water injection and increased gas injection is underway that should enable Liza Destiny FPSO to reach its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day in August. The Liza Phase 2 development will utilize the Liza Unity FPSO with a capacity to produce 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. The project is progressing to plan with approximately 75% of the overall work completed and first oil remains on track for early 2022. As previously announced, some activities for the planned Payara development have been deferred pending government approval, creating a potential delay in production start-up of six to 12 months. The Stena Carron and the Noble Tom Madden drillships resumed work in late May and early June respectively. The Stena Carron rig recently completed appraisal drilling at Yellowtail-2 located one mile southeast of Yellowtail-1. The well identified two additional high quality reservoirs, one adjacent to and the other below the Yellowtail field further demonstrating the world-class quality of this basin. This additional resource is currently being evaluated and will help form the basis for a potential future development. The Stena Carron will next move to the Kaieteur Block in which Hess holds a 15% working interest to spud the Tanager-1 well, which is located 46 miles northwest of Liza. The Noble Don Taylor spudded the Redtail exploration well located approximately 1.4 mile northwest of Yellowtail-1 on July 13. The well will target similar stratigraphic intervals as Yellowtail and will consist of an original hole and side track and will include an option to conduct the drill stem test in the future. Results of Redtail-1 and Yellowtail-2 will be incorporated into our evaluation of the Yellowtail area. In closing we continue to focus on strong execution across our portfolio while ensuring the safety of our workforce and the communities where we operate in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have taken significant steps in response to the low oil price environment that positioned us to successfully navigate these challenging times and to prosper when oil prices recover. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2020 to the first quarter. We incurred a net loss of $320 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to an adjusted net loss of $182 million in the first quarter. For E&P, E&P incurred a net loss of $249 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to an adjusted net loss of $120 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the second quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2020 were as follows : lower realized selling prices reduced results by $115 million. Lower sales volumes reduced results by $128 million. Lower DD&A expense improved results by $53 million. Lower cash costs improved results by $38 million. Lower midstream tariffs improved results by $16 million. All other items improved results by $7 million for an overall decrease in second quarter results of $129 million. For the second quarter, sales volumes were underlifted compared with production by approximately 3.9 million barrels of oil of which 3.7 million barrels of oil was associated with our previously announced VLCC strategy which was implemented to enhance 2020 cash flow and the value of our Bakken production. As part of this strategy an additional 2.3 million barrels of Bakken crude will be loaded on VLCC tankers in the third quarter. At June 30 the VLCC volumes had total cost of $113 million included in inventory on the balance sheet and a corresponding reduction to marketing expenses on the income statement. In addition at June 30, we deferred $85 million of realized gains on derivative contracts associated with these volumes. The first VLCC cargo of approximately 2 million barrels of oil has been sold for delivery in China in September at a premium to Brent prices. As a result income from the sale will be reflected in the third quarter and cash proceeds will be received in the fourth quarter. The remaining 2 VLCC cargoes containing approximately 4 million barrels of oil are expected to be sold in Asia in the fourth quarter. Now turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $51 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $61 million in the previous quarter reflecting lower throughput volumes. Midstream EBITDA on an adjusted basis and before non-controlling interest amounted to $172 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $193 million in the previous quarter. Turning to corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $122 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $123 million in the previous quarter. Now turning to our financial position, at quarter end excluding Midstream cash and cash equivalents were $1.64 billion and our total liquidity was $5.3 billion including available committed credit facilities while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion. Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is committed through May 2023. During the second quarter we successfully syndicated our $1 billion term loan with a maturity date in March 2023. We have no near-term debt maturities aside from the new term loan. We have hedged over 80% of our remaining crude oil production for 2020. At June 30, the fair value of open hedge contracts was approximately $450 million while realized settlements on closed contracts during the first six months of the year were approximately $500 million. Now turning to guidance, our E&P cash costs were $8.81 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $8.64 per barrel of oil equivalent excluding Libya in the second quarter. We project E&P cash costs excluding Libya to be in the -- to be in the range of $10 to $10.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter which reflects the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico and higher production taxes in North Dakota on increasing oil prices. Full year guidance is expected to be in the range of $9.50 to $10 per barrel of oil equivalent which is down from previous guidance of $10 to $10.50 per barrel of oil equivalent reflecting the increased production guidance and further reductions to cost. This brings total cost savings to approximately $265 million for 2020 and we continue to look for further cost reduction opportunities. DD&A expense was $15.45 per barrel of oil equivalent including and excluding Libya in the second quarter. DD&A expense excluding Libya is forecast to be in the range of $16 to $17 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter due to a combination of planned maintenance shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico, higher third quarter production from North Malay Basin and additional Bakken production related to the deferral of the turnaround at the Tioga Gas Plant to next year. For the full year, DD&A expense is projected to be in the range of $16 to $17 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is up from prior full year guidance of $15 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs excluding Libya to be in the range of $26 to $27.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $25.50 to $27 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year. Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs are expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million in the third quarter and $140 million to $150 million for the full year, which is down from previous guidance of $145 million to $155 million. The midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $220 million to $230 million in the third quarter and $905 million to $930 million for the full year, which is unchanged from previous guidance. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million for the third quarter and $20 million to $30 million for the full year, which is unchanged from previous guidance. Our crude oil hedge positions remain unchanged. We expect option premium amortization will be approximately $70 million for the third quarter and approximately $280 million for the full year which is unchanged from previous guidance. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million in the third quarter and $195 million to $205 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $185 million to $195 million due to the deferral of planned third quarter maintenance turnaround at the Tioga Gas Plant to 2021. For corporate. Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the third quarter and unchanged for the full year in the range of $115 million to $125 million. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the third quarter and $375 million to $380 million for the full year, which is at the lower end of our previous guidance of $375 million to $385 million. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate of Bank of America. Your question, please. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I hope everybody is doing well out there. I guess, my first question is on the Bakken, my second one on Guyana. So Greg, first on the Bakken. Can you give us -- with the revised guidance, give us an update on how you see the exit rate and the decline on a 1-rig program going into 2021? Greg Hill : Yes. Doug, this is Greg. So the exit rate is going to be somewhere in the range of 170 to 175. And the reason is because we're projecting a little bit lower POP volumes in the fourth quarter with seasonal NGL prices coming up. So 170 to 175. As far as 2021, we're still in the throes of developing our plans for next year. So we'll give you guidance on that in January as always. What I will say though is we believe that we can hold production relatively flat if -- with a 2-rig program we could hold it relatively flat. So there will be some decline on a one year -- with a 1-rig program but we will give you that guidance in January. Doug Leggate : Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. My follow-up if I may is on Guyana and I've just got a couple of things related I guess. First of all, Greg obviously the election hasn't been resolved yet. I don't know if John wants to handle this one. But my understanding was that ISS-ESG was still not done with their evaluation the Payara FPSO is already -- the hull is already complete. I think it's 14 months for the top side installation. In other words it was already running ahead of schedule. So I'm just wondering if you can put some context around the 6 month to 12 month delay? Because there seems to be some speculation out there that Payara has been pushed out much later, which was not my understanding. That's I guess is part one. And if I may squeeze a part two, it's really just if you could speak to the plateau implications of the deeper resource exploration success you've had on the early, let's say the first two, three, four FPSOs because it seems to me those plateaus are going to be a bit longer than perhaps you originally had planned for? And I'll leave it there. Thank you. John Hess : Doug, great questions. Hope you and your family are well as well. Look, the Court of Appeal in Guyana is expected to issue a ruling tomorrow, and we hope the ruling will provide further clarity on the election outcome. Ultimately, we expect the will of the Guyanese people will be expressed in this final results. I think, it's really important to know. The leadership of both major political parties has stated support for the Stabroek production sharing contract. And in terms of Payara and moving the development forward, the joint venture is ready to move forward as expeditiously as possible as soon as the government is ready to do so. So I think that's the clarity there. And what the potential impact is on the ultimate development timing and production timing of Payara will be a function of us working forward with the government. So I wouldn't want to speculate more than that, but we're ready to move forward as soon as the government is ready to move forward. In terms of the exploration success that we've had, the 16 discoveries, six of which these exploration wells were spud in 2019 most recently. They have \u2013 actually during this time some of the drilling delays have enabled us to optimize the resource to be developed for ships four and ships five, and ultimately lowering the cost per barrel and increasing the NPV of these discoveries. So just these six recent exploration discoveries that were spud in 2019 were \u2013 is going to bring value forward. You're making a good point, which is I think a second point which is a number of these appraisals that we're drilling will be tiebacks, which will be value enhancers and extend the plateau. You're absolutely right on that. So I think it's both points optimizing ship four and five, just because of our recent exploration and appraisal activities, but also building our inventory of tiebacks will also bring value forward. And then the third point, I'd say is that, we have a really exciting world-class inventory of feasible drillable prospects both in the Campanian where most of our discoveries have been made where the developments are currently moving forward, but also deeper horizons. Greg talked about one in Yellowtail and also the deeper Santonian. And this will really underpin low-cost barrel developments for many years to come, sustaining our trajectory of industry-leading cash flow growth from Guyana through the decade. So I think, hopefully, that provides some context for you in terms of how we think about the exploration potential, development potential, production potential of the world-class asset that we have in Guyana. Doug Leggate : That's terrific. Thanks for the detail answer guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram of JPMorgan. Your question please. Arun Jayaram : Good morning. Thus far you have three penetrations in the early cretaceous at Liza Deep, Tripletail deep and now Yellowtail deep. Gregory, I was wondering, if you could discuss some of the key conclusions thus far in the Santonian and just broader thoughts on Yellowtail moving into the development queue and perhaps you could also just kind of set the stage for Redtail? John Hess : Yeah. Greg, why don't you go ahead on the early returns on some of the deeper opportunities on how we feel about the prospectivity overall as Arun is asking? Greg Hill : Yeah, you bet. So Arun as you mentioned, we have several penetrations in the Stabroek Block, and then of course on the neighboring block in Suriname with Apache, we have penetrations there as well. So, we obviously remain \u2013 are very excited about the potential of the Santonian. As I've mentioned previously, it's just an older river system that looks very similar on seismic to the Liza-type deltaic environment. Now obviously, it's early days. So we've got to get a lot more penetrations in the Santonian to understand it. And that will be the big \u2013 will be a big part of the exploration and appraisal program going forward in the next couple of years, but we remain very excited. Now, if we turn to Yellowtail and kind of the Redtail areas, I mentioned in my remarks that Redtail is going to target basically the same stratigraphic intervals as Yellowtail. And the combination of Yellowtail-1 Yellowtail-2 and Redtail is really going to form the basis of another FPSO development. The partnership is looking at all the cadence and the development of \u2013 which is going to be Phase 4, and which is going to be Phase 5 Yellowtail is looking very promising. And of course, it's got some higher value than Hammerhead, because it's got a higher quality oil. So the potential for it jumping the queue and being much earlier in the queue is certainly a lot higher given what we've seen in Yellowtail-2 and what we expect to see in Redtail as well? Arun Jayaram : Could it support the larger ship size call it 220? \u2026 Greg Hill : Yeah. Arun Jayaram : Or is it too early to say? Greg Hill : Yes, it could. Arun Jayaram : Okay. Great and just my follow-up is just on Liza 1, you guys talked about getting to call it that 120, sometime in August. Could you discuss the potential of the facility to run above nameplate? And I also wanted to bring John Rielly in the discussion if he could discuss. We did observe a weaker realization in the quarter for the Liza crude. And just thoughts on how do you expect oil pricing in Guyana to trend relative to Brent? John Hess : Yeah. Greg, why don't you take the first one? And John Rielly will take the second one. \u2026 Greg Hill : Sure. John Hess : Thanks Arun. Greg Hill : Yeah. Thanks, Arun. So currently the focus remains on the commissioning work that I talked about in my opening remarks. So that's getting further in gas injection capacity and also water injection capacity. That work is ongoing. And we expect that we can ramp to full capacity, during the month of August of the 120,000 barrels a day or so. Beyond that, the operator is evaluating de-bottlenecking options. We don't know exactly how much additional capacity that's going to add yet, because the studies are ongoing. But what I will say is that that de-bottlenecking work will most likely occur in the first half of 2021. So we hope that, in the first half that we'll be able to get more capacity out of Liza Phase 1. But we'll quantify that amount in the future once, we've chosen an option. Arun Jayaram : Great. John Hess : And then, Arun on pricing for Liza crude, Liza crude was pricing at Brent. And we continue to guide that it will be pricing at parity to Brent. So what you saw in the second quarter was that, we had two liftings, but both of those priced and delivered early in the quarter when Brent prices were very low. So when you're going to see our third quarter realizations, we'll reflect the quarter-on-quarter improvement in Brent prices. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thank you, John. John Hess : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng of Scotiabank. Your line is open. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning guys. John Hess : Good morning. Paul Cheng : I know this is a bit early. Maybe that -- John can you maybe at least from a direction standpoint on 2021 CapEx versus 2020, we expect to be up, down or roughly the same? John Hess : Sure, Paul. I mean, as you said it is early, and we will discuss our guidance as usual, in January. But where we are right now, we expect our 2021 capital spend to be flat to down, compared to 2020. And the big moving parts is we'll have lower spend in the Bakken, continuing with the one rig and then that will be offset by higher spend in Guyana. Paul Cheng : Okay. And secondly that, on the VLCC, can you tell us that what is the storage shipping and interest expense costs related to that six million barrel? I mean, we know that you get a better price realization, when you sold it in Asia. But what is the incremental cost to get there? John Hess : So for -- as you said, so we have the first cargo and it was sold in China, as I mentioned at a premium to November, Brent prices. And I think I mentioned this last quarter, but we locked in the contango in the Brent market by obviously capturing the difference between the near month prices and prices at the expected sales date. And then now as I mentioned, plus we are receiving an uplift in price differential of selling at a premium to Brent in the Asian market versus a significant discount that we would have had to WTI in the second quarter. So basically the combination of those two benefits more than offsets the cost of storing and transporting those volumes to the Asian market.  So again, we're not being specific. Each VLCC is different but, the way we locked it in and the contango. And then obviously picking up the better differential is making it a very profitable trade for our Bakken crude. Paul Cheng : John you -- maybe that you don't want to share because of commercial reasons, what's the actual cost? Can you tell us that what is the net improvement you expect, from those six million barrel, comparing to you sell it down in the Gulf Coast? John Hess : Yeah. So, let me put it this way, because it gets to a hypothetical calculation. Because as you know Paul trying to move and sell barrels in the second quarter especially in May, we don't even know if we could have sold those barrels. And if we did sell those barrels would it have been even more than a discount we were seeing in the market. So I think the best way to look at it, is as I said the move from WTI to Brent and locking in that Brent contango took care of all of the cost. You probably saw in May the differentials on WTI down at Gulf Coast say, $14 to $15 under WTI. And now we're picking up a premium to Brent. So you can apply the difference in that discount plus the premium to all those barrels. So you can see for us it if one, -- as we talked about, we didn't want to shut in production. This allows us to sell these barrels in the same year versus if you shut in production you never would have gotten those barrels sold and got that cash flow plus it allowed us to enhance the value of the Bakken crude. Paul Cheng : Okay. And on the gas plant turnaround, I'm actually a little bit surprised that you guys decided to delay it given the demand is relatively weak this year and hopefully next year will be better and the prices still hopefully next year will be better. Other than say maybe a cash flow issue, is there any reason that we really want to delay the Tioga plant turnaround? John Hess : Greg will answer this, but it's all about safety and the welfare of our employees and contractors of the community where we do business. So it was a safety decision a precaution and we absolutely know we did the right thing there. But Greg do you want to elaborate at all? And then John can talk about any other financial impacts. Greg Hill : No. I think John you pretty much answered it. I mean, we saw a spike in Tioga that was not only some local workers, but also some of the people that we were going to bring in from the Gulf Coast for the turnaround. There were spikes going on in that part of Texas as well. So we just made a conscious decision that for the safety of our employees and for the safety of our community up there in Tioga that we did not want to introduce the potential for additional COVID cases. So again it was purely a safety based decision. John Rielly : And then from a financial standpoint, obviously, we're picking up on an annual basis about 5,000 barrels a day of added production from it mostly natural gas and NGLs, actually all of the natural gas and NGLs from that. And then we'll have, obviously, less cost in the third quarter associated with the maintenance. So all that is moved to next year. But again Paul as Gregory said this was related to COVID and the safety of the employer\u2019s, employees, contractors in the local community. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Singer : I wanted to go back to Guyana if I can and go back to the Yellowtail reservoirs. Can you add any additional color on what's defining the high quality reservoirs from a thickness oil quality perspective? And you added some takeaways on more of the deeper reservoirs given multiple penetrations from industry and yourselves. Can you add any more color on the implications of the adjacent reservoirs? And then in earlier question you mentioned -- earlier response you mentioned that you're optimizing the resource development for ships four and five lowering the cost per barrel and increasing the present value, is that a function of the better quality reservoirs that you're seeing, or is there something that you're doing with regards to the underlying cost structure for future development? Thank you. John Hess : Yeah. Greg will pick up on this. Great question Brian. Drilling and evaluation is still underway in Yellowtail. So some of the specificity you're asking for we can just talk contextually not specifically, but happy to do that and Greg will also shed some light in terms of the prospectivity that it's a higher quality oil more like Liza and the aerial extent and connectivity looks very encouraging for a bigger ship. So Greg do you want to elaborate? Greg Hill : Yeah sure. So Brian I mean pretty much what we saw was the same quality of reservoirs that were in Yellowtail-1. And as John mentioned, those reservoirs are very much Liza like, so very high quality oil, very high quality reservoir. And then as we went over to Yellowtail-2 as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we saw continuity with an existing very large aerial extent in Yellowtail, and then also a lower lobe if you will, but also had very high quality pay and very high quality oil in it. So the result of that is the Yellowtail complex is just getting much bigger. And given the quality of the oil and the quality of the reservoir, it makes a lot of sense to move that development forward, a, because it's higher capacity. And again it's got a much higher quality both crude oil and reservoir than say hammerhead, right. And, of course, Redtail moving over again it's 1.25 miles away, we expect that that would further extend the aerial extent of those reservoirs. And so far looks like good continuity between everything. So that just bodes well for an extremely good development again at that higher capacity. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you. And then my follow-up John. You started the call talking about positioning the company to perform well in a sustained low oil price environment. And I wondered whether the free cash flow as future phases of Guyana ramp up if that is sufficient to meet your cash preservation goals, or if you see the need for asset sales or equity-linked issuance to reduce leverage? John Rielly : Thanks Brian. No what we are planning -- the plan first of all that we put in place as John said that preserve cash, preserve capability and preserve long-term value is in this low price environment we wanted to get all the way through to Phase 2 in Guyana and be in a position then picking up, I'm just going to say approximately 60,000 barrels a day of Brent-based production coming into the portfolio. So once we can get to that Phase 2 and then obviously Payara comes on in Phase 4, we believe we can fund our way through that cycle and fund our investments in Guyana with our current positions that we have. Now obviously, we have tremendous liquidity as I mentioned earlier, but what we are looking at right now that even with the low oil price environment that we're not going to add debt to our balance sheet during this period. And again, we think we put a plan in place that gets us through to that Phase 2. John Hess : Yes. And specifically, we have no plans to issue equity Brian. And we're always looking to optimize our portfolio. And if there are some noncore assets that we can monetize to bring some of that cash forward, you can assume that we'll do that as we've done in the past. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai of Barclays. Your question please. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning, everyone. John Rielly : Good morning. John Hess : Good morning. Jeanine Wai : My questions are kind of regulatory and policy related. I guess the first one, in terms of federal exposure a potential risk with the November election in the coast of Mexico, can you discuss what optionality you have with permits? For example, how many do you have in hand? And what optionality you might have with leases? I know there wasn't any wells planned anyway for next year in the region, but we're just trying to understand what potential you have there as some kind of chance next year? John Hess : Yes. No fair question, Jeanine. I think two points I'd like to make there. First, we have less than 2.5% of our acreage in North Dakota on federal lands and with significantly reduced Gulf of Mexico activity through 2021. We don't anticipate any significant near impacts to Hess from any potential regulatory changes from a new administration. But I think the second point which is a very important one is that 23% of U.S. productions on -- of oil is on federal lands about two-thirds of that oil production is offshore Gulf of Mexico. And any proposals that would restrict our country's ability to explore, develop and produce that oil is going to be very bad for U.S. jobs, very bad for the U.S. economy and very bad for our national security. So we hope when people are thinking about future policy, when it comes to federal lands reason prevails, which would be in the interest of all U.S. taxpayers and consumers. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. Thank you very much for that answer. Also I guess my second question would be on DAPL sticking to North Dakota there. On the potential shutdown of the pipeline. Can you discuss how much capacity you have to move DAPL barrels by other transport means? And I know Hess is advantaged with the fact that you have several railcars that you own and optionality there. But can you address your capacity to move per DAPL barrels by other means? And if there are any specific logistical issues associated with getting that production to rail or whatever other options you have? John Hess : Yes, sure. Excellent question. Look the status of DAPL, we continue to transport volumes on DAPL while we wait for a decision on the stay from the District Court of Appeals. We have 55,000 barrels a day from transportation on DAPL. If DAPL is shut in, we have the capacity to move all of our Bakken production because of the flexibility provided by our marketing capability, our Hess Midstream infrastructure and our long-term commitments to multiple markets. And specifically, if DAPL were interrupted, rail would feature plus other pipeline systems that we move oil on currently would feature. So it would not have a major impact on moving all of our production, if DAPL were shut in and the cost to us would be a few dollars per barrel. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. John Hess : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger Read : Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. John Hess : Good morning. John Rielly : Good morning. Roger Read : I guess a couple of questions get into one kind of tying back to maybe Brian's question earlier about leverage and all that. How do you think about the hedging, which is obviously a big success this year as you look into 2021? Would you want to hedge again -- I can't get quite the prices we had this year. So on the forward curve, maybe it's not attractive enough right now. But I'm just curious how you're thinking about that and the overall managing of cash flow and CapEx? John Rielly : Yes, Roger. That's clearly part of our plan to hedge in 2021. Because as we were talking about earlier, we know we are bridging to that Phase 2 in Guyana. And obviously, we've done the reduction in our capital spend. We've got the term loan. We did as you said have a strong position -- hedge position here for 2020. So as we move through the year, we like to keep with our strategy of using put options. So you can expect us to put options in the fourth quarter. Like you said, right now, from just the volatility and the time value of the put options, putting them on right now would be too expensive. However, as we get into the fourth quarter and get closer to 2021, you should expect us to put on hedges and to put on a significant hedge position, similar to what we did in 2020. Roger Read : Okay. Thanks. And then my other question, more operational. We know about the issues that you had on the surface equipment at Liza. And I was just curious, how the wells have been performing or what you can give us there? I mean, obviously, talk about how good Yellowtail is from a reservoir standpoint, similar to Liza. And I was just curious, have you seen enough at this point where you would say, the expectations are being met by reality here? John Hess : Yes. Greg\u2026. Greg Hill : Yes. John Hess : Yellowtail performance, Liza. Greg Hill : Absolutely. I mean, the wells are -- these are amazing wells, or awesome wells and they're meeting or beating all of our expectations. So, great wells, no issue with wells whatsoever. Roger Read : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Brackett of Bernstein Research. Your question, please. Bob Brackett : Good morning. I had a question around Guyana and I'm curious about where the Hoss-1 [ph] prospect has fallen out. It looks to be the largest, at least, area under closure prospect remaining in the inventory. But I thought it was going to be drilled at some point this year. Could I get an update on that? John Hess : Yes, Greg? Greg Hill : Yes, Bob. So the plan is that we do hope to spud that well before the end of the year. It's the next in queue on the exploration order. So, hopefully, the Noble Don Taylor will be able to spud that well before the end of the year. It's working right -- it's going -- obviously, even Redtail and it's going to do some phase two producers and then we'll go to Hoss [ph] after that. So depending on how long all that takes, we should get it spud by the end of the year. Bob Brackett : Okay. Thanks for that. Greg Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum of Cowen. Your line is open. David Deckelbaum : Good morning. Thanks for the time today. John Hess : Thank you. David Deckelbaum : Just a question. You talked about before, requiring two rigs to hold the Bakken flat. I know the intention is to spend less next year overall assuming a one-rig program. Is there a move in commodities that would cause you to look at maintaining Bakken volumes, or is the strategy now to just accrete that cash to the balance sheet to maximize liquidity? John Hess : Yes. No, we would want WTI to be in the range of $50 for us to consider to bring that rig back. And our focus is to maximize cash flow generation for sure and that's going to be a dynamic between price -- the outlook for prices and keeping our liquidity strong. So again when we get to the end of the year, we'll be able to give more clarity on what our plans for the Bakken are. Right now, it's one rig. And as we go into next year, we'll make the decision according to where the market outlook is. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate that. And then, just the last one for me. Just -- I know, just kind of trying to put a bow around Payara. When you originally guided the six to 12-month potential deferral, I guess, how is the political process lining up with your expectations? And, I guess, what do we need to see happen in order to be able to adhere to that same guidance? John Hess : Yes. Newly elected government needs to be put in place. And as soon as it is, our joint venture will work closely with the government to move the development forward. Just for conservatism, we're talking about a six to 12-month delay. As a function of how it works out with this newly elected government, we'll be able to be more specific on the exact timing once we get the development approved, which we anticipate getting eventually. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate that as well. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question from Jeffrey Campbell of Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open. Jeffrey Campbell : Thank you and good morning. First, I want to ask why you chose to invest in the BP Gulf of Mexico well rather than exploring your own tie-in targets of which Esox-1 was such a great success? John Hess : Greg you want to talk about our exploration strategy. And we have a position in the cretaceous and joint venturing and sharing risk with BP was the appropriate thing to do. It's not just that it's BP, it's also Hess. But anyway, Greg, why don't you provide some perspective on our activities in the Gulf? Greg Hill : Yes, you bet. So, again, the Gulf of Mexico is a key part land for us, great cash engine, plus we have the proven capability, not only on the exploration side, but also on the project delivery, which includes drilling and development of topside. So obviously, it remains a key for us. And in the last five years, we've acquired 60 leases in the Gulf of Mexico for a grand total of $120 million. So very good price for all those leases. And it's really composed of three things : a ILX kind of near infrastructure opportunities; b Miocene greenfield hub opportunities; and then thirdly, the cretaceous play which really get derisked by the Norphlet, right? Because everyone thought the Norphlet was going to be tombstone and of course Shell and Chevron found not only very high-quality sands, but very thick sands and the cretaceous sandwich between the Miocene and the Norphlet.  So obviously in order for crude to make it from the source rock all the way to Miocene that had to pass through both Norphlet and cretaceous. So the prospects that are in the cretaceous which we got a good position as John said, we also have a position that has partners. So we derisk it. But these are very large hub-class opportunities. So BP had Galapagos in the queue in 2020 given it's a large prospect. Again sandwiched between the Norphlet and the Miocene and the Mississippi Canyon area we said we will go ahead and drill it. So it's purely just a matter of where it came in the queue because again, we like all three opportunity sets that we have ILX, Miocene and this cretaceous play. Obviously as crude prices move up, we'll want to get back to work in the Gulf of Mexico on our own things. And first in the queue is going to be some of those ILX opportunities like a second well at Esox. But again, we need to see a little bit higher crude price before we do that so we did Galapagos because the opportunity was now. A \u2013 John Hess : Yes, on the BP Galapagos prospect it was purely a time issue. And when we say preserve cash preserve capability, preserve long-term value of assets obviously Galapagos fits in that latter category but there was a time constraint there. At the same time in this pricing environment, we're going to focus on preserving the cash. And our activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico are not anticipated to be very high until we get more visibility on oil prices and the oil markets stabilizing and strengthening. Q \u2013 Jeffrey Campbell : Okay. Great. That was a very helpful explanation. I appreciate it. And then my other question was just on the subject of asset sales. With Yellowtail expanding and seemingly exceeding expectations and jumping ahead of Hammerhead in the queue could this support selling down an interest in lower quality Guyana assets if the price is right, or is there no such thing as a Guyana asset that's going to be for sale? A \u2013 John Hess : Well our company is always looking to optimize the value of our portfolio, but one of the lowest cost highest return investments in the industry is our position in Guyana. We see a lot more running room there and it's actually something if we could get more of it, we'd like more of it. So no, we don't have any interest in selling down. So high returns and low cost. Nothing competes with it in the industry. Q \u2013 Jeffrey Campbell : Great. Thank you. Appreciated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Todd of Simmons Energy. Your question, please? Ryan Todd : Good. Thanks. Maybe just a couple of quick numbers related to ones. Firstly, on CapEx. Second quarter CapEx is a little bit lower versus guidance despite a pretty solid number of well completions in the Bakken. What are you seeing on leading edge during the completion costs in the Bakken versus what you anticipated in your full year budget? A \u2013 John Hess : Greg, do you want me to take that? A \u2013 Greg Hill : Yes. Sure, John. Yes. A \u2013 John Hess : Okay. So from a well cost standpoint if you saw we did -- the D&C, we did drop our D&C cost to $6 million in the quarter. That was our goal to get there by the end of the year. So we did achieve that a bit earlier. So we are getting some nice reductions there in the Bakken from that standpoint. Outside of that, I think it's just the normal efficiencies. Greg and his team are continuing to drive that down. Yes, Bakken from within our original $1.9 billion and what we guided from the last quarter is down a bit more from the last quarter because of the efficiencies there. But overall with the portfolio of $1.9 billion we're seeing a little bit more now with the rigs back operating in Guyana just a little bit more in the Guyana. So it's a nice offset and keeps a set our $1.9 billion capital spend. Ryan Todd : And then maybe just a quick one on -- I mean you mentioned and you provided guidance on cash OpEx really strong in the quarter. Is this -- is this primarily just a mix or a volume beat issue, or are there some -- is there some underlying downward pressure that you're seeing on cash costs? A \u2013 John Hess : Well so for the Q2, I mean production did come in approximately 20,000 barrels a day above guidance, so we had a really good performance across the portfolio from a production standpoint. And our cost on an absolute basis came in 10% lower than guidance and that was across the portfolio. So nothing in particular, but look in this environment day in and day out, we're looking to take more and more costs out. And like we said earlier, we're continuing to look for further cost reductions and look to add to that $265 million that I mentioned earlier. Ryan Todd : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. Devin McDermott : Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. John Hess : No, Devin, thanks a lot. Devin McDermott : I just had a quick one to follow-up actually on the last point. It relates to some of the Bakken well cost reductions and looking at the $6 million that you achieved the quarter-over-quarter change is more on the completion side. But the question specifically is when you look at the driver of that reduction and meeting your year-end target early. Is that more supply chain deflation driven based on what's going on in the industry, or are there true structural improvements and efficiencies that you're finding and driving into the cost structure earlier than expected? I'm trying to get to what's structural change in the cost versus what might be? John Hess : Yes Greg? Greg Hill : Yes sure. So getting down to that $6 million, two-thirds of that was supply chain and one-third is efficiencies -- further efficiencies. Now as we look forward, there's probably going to be minimal supply chain concession. So, most of that we've already realized. But as we look forward through further lean manufacturing applications and also technology we think we can get that cost down lower. So we think next year there will be a five and in the number versus a six. Devin McDermott : Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. I just want to thanks so much. Hope you all well. John Hess : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov of Raymond James. Your line is open. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for taking the question. Just one question for me a bit high level though. You talked about kind of avoiding moving some personnel from Texas to North Dakota as a precautionary measure. More broadly though, can you just paint the visual picture of what you've been doing to enforce social distancing at your Bakken assets as well as in the Gulf of Mexico, obviously, two different facets of the portfolio? John Hess : Yes. There's significant protocols that are in place and we're very proud of our team to be operating safely and reliably during the COVID outbreak. But Greg, you want to talk about the steps we've taken? Greg Hill : Yes sure. So certainly in the -- Bakken has the advantage of being very spread out, right? But certainly we limit the size that people are allowed to gather in the same room. And then when we're doing work so for example on the Tioga expansion, when we're doing work we're confining the work to pods of workers that are typically anywhere from six to 10 people, and those people stay together. And so we keep social distance between pods and organize the work such that you don't expose large numbers of the people right to each other. So that's the way that we've approached the work. That's worked very effectively and very well. And the one little spike that we did see in Tioga was one pod and it was confined completely to that pod, because of the practices that we used. On the Gulf of Mexico, we require testing, and then of course, extended hitches offshore again to minimize exposure, and also our crew changes are kind of blitz, they used to be staggered, but now there's one single crew change. So that way you minimize exposure as well. So as a result of the measures we've taken, I mean, all of our field operations are continuing to produce with the appropriate safeguards. So, so far so good. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks very much. John Hess : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today\u2019s conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today\u2019s conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. As usual, with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I hope you and your families are well and staying healthy during these challenging times. Today, I will provide an update on our progress in executing our strategy in the current low oil price environment, then Greg Hill will discuss our operations and John Rielly will review our financial results. Before we address this quarter, I would like to talk briefly about the macro outlook for oil and how it informs our strategy. The International Energy Agency just published its 2020 World Energy Outlook that provides an aggressive Sustainable Development Scenario in which, if all the pledges of the Paris Climate Agreement were met, oil and gas would still be 46% of the energy mix in 2040. The energy transition will take time and major breakthroughs in technology will be needed. While we need policies to encourage renewable energy to battle climate change, oil and gas will be needed for many decades to come and will continue to be fundamental to world economic growth and human prosperity. The key for our company is to have a low cost of supply in any price environment. By investing only in high return, low cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated portfolio of assets that we believe will provide industry leading cash flow growth over the course of the decade, which is superior to our peers and to most companies in the S&P 500. Our portfolio is underpinned by significant cash engines in the Bakken, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia as well as multiple phases of low cost Guyana oil developments, which we believe will drive our company\u2019s breakeven price to under $40 per barrel Brent by mid-decade. To realize our long-term strategy, we must manage the short-term challenges facing our industry. Our priorities during this low price environment are to preserve cash, preserve capability, and preserve the long-term value of our assets. In terms of preserving cash, we came into 2020 with approximately 80% of our oil production hedged with put options for 130,000 barrels per day at $55 per barrel West Texas Intermediate and 20,000 barrels per day at $60 per barrel Brent. To enhance cash flow and maximize the value of our production, in March and April, when U.S. oil storage was near capacity, we chartered three very large crude carriers or VLCCs to store 2 million barrels each of May, June, and July Bakken crude oil production. The first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels was sold in China at a premium to Brent in September. The second and third VLCC cargos are expected to be sold in Asia by the end of the year. We have also reduced our 2020 capital and exploratory budget by 40% from $3 billion to our current guidance of $1.8 billion, primarily by reducing our Bakken rig count from six to one; and we reduced our full year 2020 cash operating costs by $275 million. At the end of September, we had $1.28 billion of cash, a $3.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility, and no debt maturities until the term loan comes due in 2023. In terms of preserving capability, we have been operating one rig in the Bakken since May, down from six rigs at the beginning of the year to maintain the Lean manufacturing capabilities and innovative practices that Greg and his team have built over more than 10 years. Our plan is to remain at one rig until oil prices approach $50 per barrel WTI. Before reducing the rig count, we achieved our goal of 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day six months ahead of schedule. In addition, our Bakken team has cut our average drilling and completion costs below $6 million per well and we continue to see further opportunities for cost reductions. In terms of preserving the long-term value of our assets, Guyana, with its low cost of supply and industry leading financial returns, remains our top priority. We are very pleased that on September 30th, the government of Guyana approved the development plan for the Payara Field, the third oil development on the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is operator. Payara is targeted for first oil in 2024, and we expect to have at least five FPSOs on the block producing more than 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day by 2026. The three sanctioned oil developments; Liza 1, which is producing, and Liza 2 and Payara, which are in construction, have breakeven Brent oil prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel, which are world class by any measure. On September 8th, we also announced the Redtail and Yellowtail-2 discoveries, bringing total discoveries on the block to 18. Incorporating the current assessment of additional volumes from the Redtail, Yellowtail-2, and Uaru discoveries, we are increasing the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources for the Stabroek Block to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We also now see potential for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base. We announced on October 5th an agreement to sell our 28% working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to BHP Billiton, the field\u2019s operator, for a total consideration of $505 million at an effective date of July 1st, 2020. This transaction brings value forward in the low price environment and further strengthens our cash and liquidity position until the Liza Phase 2 development in Guyana comes online in early 2022. We expect to close the transaction before the end of the year. Our strategy will continue to be guided by our company\u2019s longstanding commitment to sustainability, which we believe creates value for all our stakeholders. Earlier this month, the Transition Pathway Initiative or TPI published its 2020 report on the progress of 163 energy companies in transitioning to a low carbon economy and supporting efforts to mitigate climate change in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures or TCFD recommendations. In TPI\u2019s 2020 report, Hess is the only U.S. oil and gas company to achieve a Level 4 Star rating, which is only awarded to companies that demonstrably manage climate-related risks and opportunities from a governance, operational and strategic perspective and satisfy all TPI Management Quality criteria. In summary, we continue to execute our long-term strategy, delivering strong operational performance while prioritizing the preservation of cash, capability, and the long-term value of our assets during this low price environment. As a result, Hess is uniquely positioned to deliver industry leading cash flow growth and financial returns over the decade. As our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will prioritize debt reduction and increasing cash returns to shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks John. In the third quarter, we once again delivered strong operational performance. Companywide net production averaged 321,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was within our guidance range of 320,000 to 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Bakken net production averaged 198,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up 21% from the prior year quarter and above our guidance of approximately 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our strong Bakken performance offset hurricane-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, where production for the quarter averaged 49,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, just below our guidance range of 50,000 to 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the fourth quarter, we expect companywide net production to be approximately 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This guidance assumes that the Shenzi sale closes December 1st, and that transitory hurricane-related impacts in the Gulf of Mexico will reduce production in the fourth quarter by approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We anticipate all hurricane recovery work to be completed before the end of the year, which will allow our shut-in Gulf of Mexico production to be fully restored. For the full year 2020, our net production guidance is approximately 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, compared to our previous guidance of 330,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moving to the Bakken, in the third quarter we drilled six wells and brought 22 new wells online. For the fourth quarter, we expect to drill six wells and bring 11 new wells online and for the full year 2020, we still expect to drill 70 wells and bring 110 new wells online. In the third quarter, efficiency gains enabled us to further reduce our average drilling and completion cost per well to $5.9 million, which we believe is top quartile for the Bakken. Through the continued application of technology and Lean manufacturing techniques, we expect to reduce our D&C costs even further. For the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken net production to average between 180,000 and 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2020, we now expect Bakken net production to average approximately 190,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from our previous guidance of 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Although we have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate good financial returns at current prices, to preserve capital discipline and keep the asset free cash flow positive, we plan to maintain a one rig program until oil prices approach $50 per barrel WTI. Operating a single rig allows us to preserve our Lean manufacturing capability that we have worked hard to build over the years, both within Hess and among our primary drilling and completion contractors. Moving to the offshore, the Gulf of Mexico has felt the effects of seven named storms this season including Hurricane Zeta, which is currently in the Gulf that have disrupted operations across the industry. Production from the Conger and Llano Fields is expected to remain shut in for approximately 40 and 75 days, respectively, during the fourth quarter due to hurricane recovery work, and the Penn State 6 well will remain shut-in until a workover can be completed in December. In the fourth quarter, Gulf of Mexico net production is expected to average approximately 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and for the full year 2020, we expect net production to be in the range of 55,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down from our previous guidance of 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Again, we expect all hurricane-impacted production to be fully restored before the end of the year. Also in the gulf in September, the Esox-1 well reached a gross peak rate of approximately 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net to Hess. The BP-operated Galapagos Deep exploration well, in which Hess held a 25% working interest, was not a commercial success. The data from this first well in the play will be incorporated into the continued assessment of our acreage position in the Cretaceous, which remains highly prospective. Moving to the Gulf of Thailand, net production in the third quarter increased to an average of 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to 44,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter as a result of higher nominations. We expect fourth quarter net production to be flat with the third quarter at approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting continued COVID uncertainties. Our guidance for full year 2020 net production is now approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our previous guidance range of 50,000 to 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now turning to Guyana, in the third quarter, gross production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 63,000 barrels of oil per day or 19,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess. Ongoing work to complete commissioning of the natural gas injection system continues, and once complete will enable the Liza Destiny floating production, storage and offloading vessel or FPSO to reach its nameplate capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day in December. It is important to note that the delays in commissioning the gas injection system are mechanical in nature, and the reservoirs and wells continue to deliver at, or above, expectations. The design one, build many concept for the FPSOs allows the learnings to be captured and applied to future projects. Production from the vessel has been averaging approximately 105,000 barrels of oil per day for the last few weeks. The Liza Phase 2 development is progressing to plan with approximately 80% of the overall top side haul and subsea work completed. The project will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and remains on track for first oil by early 2022. In September, we announced the final investment decision to proceed with development of the Payara Field. Payara will utilize the Prosperity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day and will initially target a resource base of about 600 million barrels of oil. First oil is expected in 2024. 10 drill centers are planned with a total of 41 wells, including 20 production wells and 21 injection wells. Also in December [ph], we announced the 17th and 18th discoveries on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. The Yellowtail-2 well encountered 69 feet of high quality, oil bearing reservoir, adjacent to and below the Yellowtail-1 discovery. In addition, the Redtail-1 well encountered approximately 232 feet of high quality oil bearing reservoir. The well is located approximately 1.5 miles northwest of the Yellowtail discovery. A drill stem test is planned at Redtail in the fourth quarter. These discoveries further demonstrate the significant exploration potential of the block and contribute to the discovered recoverable resource estimate increasing to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent and will likely form the basis of our fourth development on the block. In terms of exploration, the Stena Carron drillship is currently drilling the Tanager-1 well on the Kaieteur Block, approximately 46 miles northwest of Liza. This well, which is the deepest well drilled offshore Guyana, is designed to penetrate multiple geologic intervals, including the Campanian, Santonian, and Turonian. The next exploration well on the Stabroek Block will be Hassa-1, which will target Campanian aged reservoirs approximately 30 miles east of the Liza Field. This well should spud near the end of the year and we expect results during the first quarter. Before I leave Guyana, I think that it is important to remind you of what makes the Stabroek Block so unique. First, its size and scale. The block is 6.6 million acres, which is equivalent in size to 1,150 Gulf of Mexico blocks. So far, we have drilled 20 prospects and have made 18 discoveries that contain approximately 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas resources, with multi billion barrels of exploration potential remaining. Secondly, world-class reservoir quality with exceptional permeability and porosity that results in high flow rate wells and high recovery factors. Third, the reservoirs are shallow and there is no salt that allows us to drill wells in a fraction of the time and cost of other deepwater basins. Fourth, there is a Production Sharing Contract with a competitive cost recovery mechanism. Fifth, development is occurring at the bottom of the offshore cost cycle. Excess capacity throughout the offshore supply chain greatly reduces the risk of project delays and cost overruns. Sixth, ExxonMobil is arguably the best project manager in the world for this type of development and their operatorship greatly reduces execution risk. And finally, its low cost of supply, the first three developments have industry leading Brent breakeven prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel. For all these reasons, Guyana will create extraordinary long-term value for our shareholders and for the citizens of Guyana. In closing, I\u2019d like to recognize our team for delivering strong results across our portfolio, while ensuring the safety of our workforce and communities in the midst of a pandemic and a challenging hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2020 to the second quarter of 2020. We incurred a net loss of $243 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared with a net loss of $320 million in the second quarter. Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we incurred an adjusted net loss of $216 million in the third quarter. Turning to E&P, on an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $156 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to a net loss of $249 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the third quarter of 2020 and the second quarter of 2020 were as follows. Higher realized selling prices improved results by $134 million. Higher sales volumes improve results by $33 million. Higher exploration expenses reduce results by $40 million. Higher cash costs driven by production taxes reduced results by $23 million. Higher DD&A expense reduced results by $6 million. All other items reduce results by $5 million for an overall increase in third quarter results of $93 million. As John mentioned earlier, we sanctioned the Payara Field development in September. The corporation\u2019s net share of development costs excluding pre-sanction costs and FPSO purchase cost is forecast to be approximately $1.8 billion, which is consistent with the projections from our December 2018 Investor Day presentation. The timing of the FPSO purchase is being evaluated. Our net share of development costs is forecast to be approximately $250 million in 2021, $450 million in 2022, $500 million in 2023, $300 million in 2024, and $225 million in 2025. Now turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $56 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $51 million in the previous quarter, reflecting higher throughput volumes. Midstream EBITDA, before non-controlling interests, amounted to $180 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $172 million in the previous quarter. For corporate, on an adjusted basis, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $116 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $122 million in the previous quarter. Turning to our financial position, at quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.3 billion and our total liquidity was $4.8 billion including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion. Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is committed through May 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $468 million in the third quarter compared with $301 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to higher realized selling prices. In the third quarter, net cash provided from operating activities after changes in working capital was $136 million compared with $266 million in the prior quarter. Changes in working capital during the third quarter decreased cash flow from operating activities by $332 million, primarily due to a reduction in payables, reflecting reduced operating activity levels, and the temporary increase in accounts receivable and inventory resulting from our VLCC transactions which will reverse over the next two quarters. We have hedged over 80% of our remaining crude oil production for 2020. At September 30th, 2020, the fair value of open hedge contracts was approximately $205 million while realized settlements on closed contracts during the first nine months of the year were approximately $700 million. Proceeds from the sale of the first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels of oil were received in October and proceeds from the sale of the second and third VLCC cargos totaling 4.2 million barrels of oil are expected to be received in the first quarter of 2021. During the fourth quarter, we expect to close on the sale of our working interest in the Shenzi Field for total consideration of $505 million with an effective date of July 1st, 2020. The proceeds from the Shenzi sale will allow us to fund our Guyana investment program in a $40 oil price environment through the startup of Liza Phase 2 with cash flow from operations and cash on hand. As Phase 2 comes online, our operations in Guyana will begin to generate free cash flow for the corporation, even in a $40 oil price environment and depending on commodity prices at that time, the corporation will begin generating free cash flow between 2022 and 2024. As we generate free cash flow, we plan to first reduce debt and then increase returns to shareholders. Now turning to guidance. First for E&P. Our E&P cash costs were $9.86 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya and $9.69 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya in the third quarter. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $11.00 to $11.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter, which reflects the impact of hurricane-related shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico. Full year guidance is unchanged at $9.50 to $10 per barrel of oil equivalent. DD&A expense was $16.16 per barrel of oil equivalent in the third quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $15.50 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and in the range of $16 to $16.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year, which is in the lower end of our previous guidance range. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $26.50 to $27.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and $25.50 to $26.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $135 million for the full year, which is down from previous guidance of $140 million to $150 million. We expect to recognize an additional $7 million of dry hole costs associated with the Galapagos Deep well in the fourth quarter. The midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $240 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $945 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $905 million to $930 million. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million for the fourth quarter and $25 million to $30 million for the full year. Our crude oil hedge positions remain unchanged. We expect that non-cash option premium amortization will be approximately $95 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $280 million for the full year. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $1.8 billion for the full year, which is down from previous guidance of approximately $1.9 billion, primarily from Guyana spend coming in under budget. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $55 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $220 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $195 million to $205 million. For corporate, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the fourth quarter and $115 million to $120 million for the full year, which is in the lower end of our previous guidance range. Interest expense is estimated to be approximately $95 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $375 million for the full year, which is the lower end of our previous guidance range. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning everybody. I hope everyone's doing well out there. John Hess : Good morning Doug. Yes, thank you. You too. Doug Leggate : John Rielly probably is my first question. John, I'd like to ask you about the cash burn in the core for pre and post-working capital. And how you think about the trajectory of balance sheet surety if you like going through the end of the year, because there's obviously a lot of moving parts with Shenzi and the VLCC sales. So, just how are you going to manage the balance sheet through the next phase of development in Guyana, given what looks like you know, continued worsening in oil prices? John Rielly : Sure Doug thanks for the question. I guess what I want to start with is, is our cash position. So, if you look at September 30th, we have approximately $1.3 billion of cash. And as we mentioned, we have this Shenzi sale closing in the fourth quarter. So, let me just use round numbers. If you take that $1.3 billion and yet the Shenzi sale $500 million to it, on a pro forma basis, it gets you up to about $1.8 billion of cash. The next thing above and beyond what our cash flow from operations will be generating over the over the next couple of quarters is the VLCC transactions. So, we have not received any of that cash right now. And so we have over 6 million barrels that we will be receiving cash for as these VLCC transactions close. One we've already closed. So, we have that cash in October for that. The other two, as we said, closed around the end of the year. So, we'll probably get that early next year. But if you take that 6 million barrels times current prices, I'll just round it down even and say its $200 million. Therefore, you go from the $1.3 billion plus the $500 million of Shenzi, plus that $200 million, we essentially have $2 billion on a pro forma basis of cash. So, that's the first thing I think to start with. We've really put ourselves in a position with that Shenzi sale and the VLCC transactions actually act as a hedge here as we move into this next year with this low price environment. So, starting with that $2 billion, the next thing, as you mentioned, was just a look at our quarter and our cash flow. So, after working capital, we had that reduction from working capital $332 million and if I can just again use round numbers, about half of that is due to the VLCC transactions, we've got receivable on the books, plus the inventory built from the crude oil going on the ships, that's just going to reverse naturally, as I said over the next two quarters. The other thing that we have in there is a reduction of payables. And it's really just reducing operating activity levels. CapEx is coming down; all their costs are coming down as we reduce activity and now we're getting to a point where it's stabilizing, right, our capital levels you saw for the quarter down to $331 million in the third quarter. So, we'll be stabilizing. So, we won't be having those pulls. And if prices do come back at some point and activity levels, which they will increase at that point, we'll actually get some inflow from working capital. It's just how it works. When that activity levels come down, you get a pull and when activity levels go up, you begin to get an inflow. So, if you actually looked at our cash flow from operations, we had $468 million there and on a cash flow statement, you see the outflow for capital was $426 million. So, except for that temporary increase from the working capital, we actually exceeded our cash flow, exceeded our capital, and basically, if you didn't have that working capital pull, we'd be kind of on a cash flow breakeven for the quarter. So, again, as we move forward, we're continuing to focus on reducing capital and reducing costs and doing everything we can and getting our cash balance to a point that we can withstand this low prices. And like I said, we're in a position even in this low price environment to fund all the way through to Phase 2 when we get 60,000 barrels a day approximately of Brent-base production, coming into and generating cash flow for the corporation. Doug Leggate : That's a really thorough explanation, $2 billion number; I think is what I was really looking at. So, thank you for that. My follow-up is John -- this John Hess, this is probably a bit of a curveball, really, but one of your competitor companies the other day, when announcing their acquisition, Pioneer, talked about a handful of investable E&P and I'm glad to see that you were cited as one of them on a go forward basis. But my question is, when you look at consolidation across the sector, and clearly Hess doesn't need to do anything given Guyana, but from the point of view of lowering the cost base for the broader industry, I'm just curious what your view is on Hess' participation in potentially one way or the other in the current consolidation we seem to be onto undergoing right now. I'll leave it there. Thanks. John Hess : Yes, Doug, obviously our first, second, and third priority is to remain focused on executing our strategy, which we believe will maximize value for our shareholders. We have built a high quality and differentiated portfolio that provides a long-term resource growth with a low cost of supply. So, we already are on that trajectory for that low cost of supply. We don't need M&A to get there. And it's underpinned obviously, by multiple phases of Guyana oil developments. And all of this together will position our company to deliver industry leading cash flow growth over the course of the decades. Obviously, we're giving some guidance now of increasing our resource estimate in Guyana, and Stabroek Blok to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent with a potential for 10 ships, not just five ships. Obviously, a lot of work needs to be done to bring those forward. So, we have a great hand to provide industry leading cash flow growth and at the same time go down the cost curve, which will generate industry leading free cash flow with a passage of time. So, we're always looking to optimize our portfolio, but we see nothing in the M&A market that will compete for capital against our existing portfolio of high return opportunities. Doug Leggate : Great. Thanks again, guys. Appreciate you taking my questions. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Arun Jayaram : Yes, good morning Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. My first question really revolves around Payara. Greg, the F&D cost came in a bit higher than buy side expectations. I was wondering if you can maybe put the budget in the context around contingencies and any implications for Phase 4 or Phase 5, F&D or capital efficiency in Guyana. Greg Hill : Yes, in terms of that guidance, I suggest John Riley address that. John Rielly : Sure. So, Arun, as you know, as I said, the net development costs for Hess is $1.8 billion. So, when you gross that up, it's approximately $6 billion. We do have contingencies in our numbers for that it's set especially fairly high contingencies early in the process. And it comes to that $6 billion on a gross up basis and the one thing you also have to add when you're doing the F&D is the ultimate purchase costs from the FPSO. We did not include that in our numbers, because that's still -- the timing of that is being evaluated and the cost gets lower as you move out in time. So, we don't know what that is. Exxon, in its Phase 2 release had the FPSO at approximately $1.6 billion, that's what they disclose for Phase 2, we expect it to be lower with synergies. So, if I round that it's $1.5 billion. So, you get about $7.5 billion there. And then we do have some pre-sanction costs to add and I know Exxon has got some additional contingencies beyond that, but Exxon is -- we're really happy with them as an operator, they've been performing great. And as part of that performance, they have been coming in under budget. So, what I was saying from that the other thing that I want to add with Payara is all the costs and the contingencies that we have in our numbers and the pre-sanction costs and the expected FPSO cost is in that calculation for the $32 Brent breakeven. So, this truly is a world-class asset and adds to obviously, there will be the third project in Guyana. And we're looking forward to doing the next project after that, well looks like it's going to be the greater Yellowtail area and based on early drilling size that we see there, we actually expect those costs to be lower than Payara and probably the breakeven, therefore will come between $25 and $32 for the for the greater Yellowtail area. Arun Jayaram : Great, that's great color. My follow-up, John is if he could give us some color -- you touched upon this in your prepared remarks on the FPSO related CapEx. I believe the consortium did lease the destiny for 10 years -- with the 10-year option. But you do have a purchase option, which I believe lasts for up to two years. So, I was wondering if you could provide the current thoughts on exercising the option and are you anticipating some of the FPSO-related CapEx to be incurred in 2021? John Rielly : Okay, so at our -- at the current date right now, and Exxon on behalf of the of the group is discussing with SBM, the date -- the timing of purchasing all the FPSOs and that would be Liza Phase 1, Phase 1 and Payara. So, as of right now, we do not expect any cost for purchase cost for Liza Phase 1 in 2021. But again, the timing -- unfortunately, I can't really go much beyond that, that timing is still being discussed. And part of the discussion is moving out some of the timing of the purchase of those FPSOs. But nothing has been decided at this point. But right now for 2021, it is not expected to have any purchase costs in it. Arun Jayaram : And is it fair to say that the net to Hess that the purchase cost on the destiny would be around $250 million, just net to the Hess? John Rielly : Okay, so depending on timing, it can vary. The earlier on, it could be somewhere closer to $300 million -- still under $300 million and then it will decrease as you move out in time. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. John Rielly : You're welcome. John Hess : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : Thank you. Good morning. John Hess : Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer : My first topic is Guyana with regards to the 9 billion Boe approximate estimate for discovered resource. And then also I think you mentioned you would believe that that can support up to 10 FPSO. So, just a couple of questions there. Number one, given that there's no longer the greater than or the plus sign there, can you just remind us what's in that and not in that relative to the recent discoveries? You made some comments that seems like Yellowtail and Redtail have been updated? But is there anything that's not in that? And have there been any downward revisions to any of the any of the past discoveries within approximately 9 billion Boe number? And then as it relates to the -- up to 10 FPSOs, how should we think about a peak oil production number? Is it as easy as 180 times one plus up to 220 times nine, or when you expect some FPSOs to be in decline when later developments are brought online? John Hess : Fair enough. Greg, do you want to tackle the resource number and what really was behind that? Greg Hill : Sure. Yeah, so the upgrade from the greater to eight -- greater than eight to nine really reflected the results of the drilling remember in Uaru, Yellowtail-2 and Redtail-1. So, a good portion of the results of that were included in that billion barrel call at resource upgrade. So that brings us close to being up-to-date. There is obviously some additional upside to that number that we'll figure out with further testing and potential appraisal in and around that area. So, there is more upside coming on top of that number, but that really reflects the results of those three wells. And to your question on the 10 FPSOs, again, as John said in his opening remarks that we still have to do a lot of engineering work on those 10 FPSOs, but I think this regular cadence of one a year you could assume -- and then, obviously as you get further out in time, some of those earlier FPSOs could be in decline. However, remember, we still have multi-billion barrels of upside that hasn't been explored or appraised. So, how all that kind of works out and works all age fillers, new hubs, is yet to be determined and I think furthermore, Brian, if you think about the Santonian, remember the Santonian is 3000 feet deeper than the Campanian, they currently represents that 9 billion barrels. And if you look at it on seismic, the extent of the channel systems is as extensive or more extensive than the Campanian. And the industry has got five penetrations in it, two on Stabroek and three in Suriname obviously on Apache's block. So that will be a subject of a lot of exploration and appraisal drilling over the next couple of years and depending on how that turns out, the Santonian also as well as multi-billion barrels of remaining upside in the Campanian, all of that could be used as both all age fillers and new hub class developments. So, I would like to say Guyana is a story that's going to go on more than 10 years because of that multi-billion barrels of upside and we haven't even scratched the surface of the Santonian yet and we're in the early innings in the Campanian still. John Rielly : And obviously, Greg gave great context and Brian, obviously we wanted our investors to know, there is still tremendous potential here as Greg is talking about, but a lot more work needs to be done in terms of exploration and appraisal to inform the specifics of the size of the ships, the timing of the ships, but generally speaking, one a year is a good estimate to think about, but the most important thing is we need to work with the government, and we need to work with our partners. So, it's still early days, but we want people to realize in 2018, I think the resource estimate was 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent and that's when we talked at least 5 ships and at least 750,000 barrels a day. So, we wanted investors to get an update of what the potential number of ships could be based upon the resource upgrade that we're giving. So a lot more work needs to be done, but it's obviously very exciting. Brian Singer : That's great. Thank you for that color. My follow-up is on more of the financial side, can you just talk about any updates to how you're thinking about either maintenance capital or 2021 capital plans and then in the context of some of the balance sheet, questions and free cash flow discussion earlier, how you think about hedging versus not hedging into next year. John Rielly : Sure. So, let me start with the capital. What we see now. I mean, obviously, we're still going through our budget process and we'll give our final guidance on our January call, but we see 2021 capital being comparable to 2020 as we move forward and basically, you have Bakken because we went from six rigs to one, their capital coming down and then with our Payara sanction adding some additional rigs next year for development and exploration that Guyana's capital is going up. So, those are the two big movements, but we see it as being comparable and Brian, I get asked a lot on with the lower capital, 40% down this year, these maintenance capital levels and it is not actually because what happens from our standpoint, if we stay at one rig, there will be some declines in the Bakken and if we don't do you tieback wells in the Gulf of Mexico, we will get some decline there. But this is the uniqueness of Guyana, right. When we bring on Phase 2, it's again approximately 60,000 barrels a day Brent equivalent type pricing for that production. So, we're picking up 60,000 barrels a day there that offsets the declines in Bakken and Gulf of Mexico. Then you have Payara 2024 and then as both John and Greg, we're saying we're kind of on pace for one a year, as you go after that. So, we can continue to actually grow at these lower capital levels. If Southeast Asia stays flat at that $150 million to $200 million type level of capital. So, we can have that about 65,000 barrels a day. So, actually our maintenance capital levels would be a good bit lower than where we are at this lower level. So, again, its uniqueness we can grow and it's just because Guyana's returns and the profile of it are so good that we can grow and generate free cash flow, because of the low-cost nature of these developments, the low breakeven. Sorry, I think you did -- you had one other question about hedging, so just to get to your hedging question. So, obviously, we continue to have the 130,000 barrels a day of put options at 55 WTI for the remainder of 2020 and we have 20,000 barrels a day of our Brent put options at $60, remainder of 2020. So, as we move into 2021, we clearly would like to put on a hedge, put some insurance to put a floor on for next year because we are still investing with this Guyana Phase 2 coming on in early 2022. So, we'd like to put a floor on. Now, the great hedge position that we have for this year, the Shenzi sale, the VLCC that I told you, have put us in a good position going into it. So, there is no rush for us to have to get hedges on right now. We'd like to use put options to get the full insurance, which obviously paid off this year. Put options are expensive due to the time value of money, if you're further away from the period you want to hedge and then obviously you know where volatility is right now in the market. So, you will see us hedge, it could be later this year, it could be early in 2021, but you should look for us to put on a significant, again, insurance position for a floor for us next year. Brian Singer : Great. Thank you for that detail. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. This is Jeanine Wai. John Rielly : Morning Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : Good morning. Greg Hill : Hi, Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : In terms of Guyana that's what my question is on, in terms of the Payara development cost, I know you've touched on this already. We know that the aerial extent, it's a little larger than the prior developments, which is contributing to the cost, but Payara also has more resource and I think I heard you mentioned earlier in the Q&A that the next phase is likely to be lower on the breakeven. So, I was just wondering can you provide a little more color on this lower breakeven, maybe in terms of all the different moving pieces. Can you discuss how the Payara development could compare to future development phases in terms of size and probably scope? John Rielly : Yes, I think Greg just hitting Yellowtail, both in terms of the thickness aerial extent than what we've seen with Redtail as well. Just to give the context, we can't be more specific than that now. We still got the DST to go on Redtail, but we're relatively optimistic about the economic attractiveness of that being the next development. Greg Hill : Sure. I think what the Yellowtail and the Redtail wells both showed -- remember Redtail is only a mile and a half from the Yellowtail well, is that the reservoir extent is very large. It's larger than we thought, just based on the results of the Yellowtail-1. So, there is a huge resource base there. We know that the reservoir quality is very similar to, I'll say, Liza-2 and also the crude quality is Liza-like and so very -- bigger tanks, bigger reservoirs in and around that greater Yellowtail area and that's why John had mentioned it will likely have a lower development cost. It looks like you will probably need fewer wells to get the same amount of resource. However, I will say, we've still got engineering work to do, we've got to get through our various gates and our development process to be further definitive about that, but also because of the nature of the PSC, you'll have more barrels on, which affects the rate of cost recovery, which will also tend to drive that breakeven lower. But I think as you look at the reservoir of Yellowtail versus Payara, it's big, it's very big. Jeanine Wai : Okay, great. Thank you very much and I hope everyone is doing well out there. Greg Hill : Thank you. You too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Ryan Todd : Great, thanks. Maybe if we start out in the Bakken. In the Bakken, production continues to exceed expectations and congrats on hitting the 200,000 barrels a day target early. I know you've said the one rig isn't enough to hold production flat, you know how it declines, but given the continued outperformance, can you give us an idea of how you think about maybe an update of that idea? How you think about extra rate declines, 2021 versus 2020, or going forward from here? John Rielly : Yes, Greg? Greg Hill : Yes, we're still -- we're in the throes of our development plan right now for next year. So, I want to give you guidance in January, like we always do on the Bakken. I think that'd be more appropriate, well, I think the development as we speak. Ryan Todd : Maybe. With that, do you still have DUC to work down? Or will till then wells drilled be at a similar level next year? Greg Hill : No, we don't really -- we don't carry a large DUC inventory, particularly with one rig. We did in the first part of the year, because remember, we had six rigs that built-in inventory, that will effectively be worked off during the fourth quarter. And it will be -- then it will just be normal work in process, right? So there won't be a DUC inventory, so to speak, other than, well is just waiting on a completion crew. John Hess : Yes. And Greg, maybe just to provide some context for Ryan, you might remind everyone what the role of the Bakken is in the portfolio and that takes precedent over what the rig rate is or what the production rate is and that sort of thing. And then also it takes about two to keep production flat. You might just remind people of that. Greg Hill : Sure. Yes. John Hess : Even though we're working on final guidance for a quarter from now. Greg Hill : It would take, as John mentioned, let me start with what it would take to hold the Bakken flat. Take two rigs to hold it flat; broadly in the 180,000 barrel a day range with two rigs we could hold it at that level. But I think, as John mentioned important context for the Bakken, the role of the Bakken in the portfolio now is to be a cash generator and so the rig count will be a function of obviously oil price, but also corporate cash flow needs. That is what will govern the rate at which we develop the Bakken. Now in order to maintain that magnificent cash firepower that the Bakken has, obviously we would like to at least hold it flat, right? So it doesn't decline away and you lose some of that cash firepower capability. As we -- as I said in my opening remarks though, we won't consider adding that second rig to hold it flat until WTI prices approach $50. At that point, we would look at where we are and we'd make an informed decision on whether to add that second rig. But the Bakken, again, it's primary role is cash. It's not the growth engine. Guyana is the growth engine. It will be the cash engine and of course, we could grow it as oil prices improve. Ryan Todd : Thanks. John I guess maybe, is that the natural follow up -- transition to follow up on the Gulf of Mexico, which I think is -- generally plays a similar role in the portfolio as a cash-cow underpinning the under-developments, can you maybe talk a little bit more about the decision to sell your stake in the Shenzi Field? Is that just opportunistically helping you to bridge the -- pull forward that cash flow to bridge the gap to Payara or to start off the Phase 2 start-up? Greg Hill : Yes. John any -- Ryan Todd : Or has -- any change, I guess, in how you think about the use of that asset, going forward? John Hess : No, no. To be clear, the Gulf of Mexico is a core focus area for the company, and it will be for the future. But we did have a unique opportunity to monetize Shenzi; John Rielly can provide some background. John Rielly : Sure. So just to reiterate, our Gulf of Mexico strategy has not changed with the Shenzi sale. John said, it's a core part of our portfolio, we plan to pursue both infill and tie back opportunities to our existing hubs, as well as hub class exploration, you know, as oil prices recover. So again, you know, it really does remain unchanged. With this Shenzi sale with BHP being the operator, we're able to get a price for Shenzi that met our value expectations. So therefore, the sale fit well with our strategy to preserve cash and the long term value of our assets in this current low oil price environment. And then as I mentioned, you know, the proceeds there add to our kind of $1.3 billion dollars. So we already have on the balance sheet, and we can use it to fund our investment opportunities in Guyana. And we will use our cash on hand and cash flow from operations to fund Guyana all the way through to Phase 2, where we get a step up in cash flow when Phase 2 comes online. Ryan Todd : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Hi, good morning. A number of my questions have been asked already. So I'll just throw one out around Libya. We're seeing the country as a whole get back to export in volumes. What do you think about that in terms of the Hess portfolio? John Hess : Well, Bob, you know, the Libya is a cash engine when it's producing. Given that the NOC has just lifted the force majeure restrictions and the country has agreed to a ceasefire. The SE report has now reopened and initial liftings have started. But it still remains to be seen what a normalized level of production in Libya is going to be given the uncertainties and continued political unrest. So, you know, obviously, when we get cash from it, we're happy to do that. But at the same time, it's not at the point where it's stabilized what it can be in our numbers on an ongoing basis. Bob Brackett : Great. Thank you for that. John Hess : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotia Bank. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Good morning. John Hess : Good morning. Paul Cheng : The first question is actually I think either for John or Greg, maybe both. I'm trying to have a better understanding if I look at Liza 2 if my recollection, correct. The total development cost is about $6 billion, that's including the FPSO 1.6. So call it $4.4 billion, and the total capacity is 220 for FPSO. So, in Payara, we also looking for 220. So one would have thought the costs will be lower than Liza 2, as you get more experience in developing this. Greg and John, can you help me understand a little bit, what -- how the design may have changed? And why instead of having a lower cost is actually become higher? Greg Hill : Yes. Go ahead, John. John Hess : Sure. So let me just start with that like each development is unique Paul. So like as I mentioned, the Greater Yellowtail area, we see that with lower development costs and a breakeven that drops between $25 and $32 at that point, with Payara being at $32. So the difference, we are getting synergies like you said from the building of the FPSO, because we do expect that to come in at a lower cost. So with Payara as compared to Liza Phase 2 and I always have to remind everybody, and I know I'm not objective Paul, when I say this. But Liza Phase 2 with the Brent breakeven of $25 is arguably the best project that is out there in the E&P industry. So we are comparing things to this really top project and Payara is world-class. So it does cost more and why -- what happens is Payara has a greater number of distinct reservoirs and therefore also a greater aerial extent. So it was always, as we said, it was back in our December 2018 Investor Presentation it was always going to have a higher cost than Liza Phase 2. So those costs now came exactly in with what we were expecting, just the aerial extent in the reservoirs caused more wells to be there, some more flow lines to be there. And that's what causes that cost to be there and the Brent breakeven going to $32 versus the $25. Now, again Yellowtail, we expect that to be lower, because I think the reservoirs, the individual reservoir as Greg had mentioned, have a great aerial extent on its own. Therefore, we believe the cost will be lower in the Brent breakeven between $25 and $32. Paul Cheng : Thank you. And Greg, that when earlier you're talking about the gas injection system as a mechanical issue. You said that the site problem or that what's causing that mechanical problem? Greg Hill : Yes, there were two issues, Paul. So first was the cooling fan blades on the big gas compressors and that was a design issue for sure. Those were re-engineered, new fan blades installed, and both of those compressors are currently operating. And that's why our production now is averaged about 105,000 barrels a day for the last couple weeks. So things are things are back on track for the main gas compressors. The last piece is a flash gas compressor. And there was a failure in the lube oil system. That is a design related issue. And that compressor is back in Germany, being retrofitted as we speak. And the plan is to get it out to the platform or the FPSO during the month of November, and then begin to ramp-up to the full nameplate in December. So both were design issues. I think, you know, as I've said before, Paul, the silver lining and all this to me is in this design, one build many strategy. All of the learning\u2019s that are coming out of this are being incorporated into future phases. So that will over time just continue to increase the reliability and ability to bring these on these vessels on flawlessly. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you. And that's just a quick one. Gulf of Mexico in the third quarter, how much is the hurricane impact and also John the international OpEx, the unit cost why is so high in the third quarter? John Rielly : Sure. So let me start with the Gulf of Mexico in the -- in the third quarter. So between maintenance shutdowns that we already had were undergoing at Llano and Conger, Shell is working on the Enchilada and Auger platforms. So with that maintenance shutdowns and the hurricane downtime, it was approximately 19,000 barrels a day of an impact in the third quarter. And then you heard from as in Greg script there that, the fourth quarter is going to be about 25,000. So, what's really happening again is Llano and Conger continuing now with the shutdown, due to the hurricane and damage that was incurred. The biggest difference then between the third and fourth quarter, though, is that Penn State well that Greg mentioned. So that is going to be down for basically most of the quarter not coming back till the end of December. So that's what takes the 19 to 25 in Q4. And then the international costs that you saw, what you have to do is take out $8 million associated with the severance charge. So of that $27 million special severance charge, $8 million of it was over on the international side. Paul Cheng : Thank you. John Rielly : You're welcome. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Energy. David Heikkinen : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple of quick questions. First of all, Kaieteur, what do you expect the dry hole costs to be? John Hess : John? John Rielly : So this one -- this well, as Greg has mentioned, is -- is going to be more expensive than our typical wells that we've been drilling from an exploration stain standpoint on Stabroek. So because it is one going deeper, we are using managed pressure drilling on this just to be you know, careful as we drill all the way down to the deeper section. As Greg mentioned, going Santonian and Turonian. So Exxon has not put out an estimate on this right now. But it will take longer, and it's going to generally cost a bit more. And just remember that we do have a lesser though working interest in Kaieteur than we do in Stabroek. David Heikkinen : Okay. And then given all the recovery of volumes in the Gulf of Mexico, do you have a feel for a run rate going into 2021? With all the moving pieces, the 19 back plus, I guess, Penn State? It's your back to your earlier this year, right? Well, I guess your volumes up? John Rielly : Yes. Sure. So I mean, basically what we in the Gulf of Mexico full year, we incorporate shutdowns and things like that is approximately we were saying 65,000 barrels a day. I mean, it can be higher than that when you don't have shutdowns and quarters. So we will get back on that run rate except for the Shenzi sale, right. So you had 11,000 barrels being sold. So, you know, basically take it down to approximately 55,000 barrels a day, then, on a run rate when everything we coming back starting in January 1. David Heikkinen : Perfect. And with the design one build many concepts; it looks like you've ordered the same, basic compressor kit that you'll just put side by side on the additional FPSO, all the chinks that you're working out with Phase 1 really do, hopefully will be avoided, at least with the same kit. Is that is that correct or --? Greg Hill : Yes, absolutely, David, in fact, if you look at the part numbers and this is extreme standardization, if you look at the part numbers, I think it something like 85% of the part numbers on the top side are the same in Phase 2 as Phase 1. So that's what I think the real advantage of the standardization is, is you can just quickly roll learnings, into future phases and really, really drive very high reliability in these vessels as a result of that. David Heikkinen : Yes. So a lot of learnings in this first six months that'll stabilize things and less downtime as you move forward. That's helpful. Cool. Greg Hill : Exactly. David Heikkinen : Thank you. Greg Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. Thanks. Good morning. John Hess : Good morning. Roger Read : I'm just curious kind of your opening comments where you said, you expect to get to sub $40 in terms of total development as you get to the middle of the decade. Does that solely rely on what you're going to do in Guyana? Or is that also envisioning some additional asset sales down the road thinking, the opportunity obviously popped up on Shenzi. But if there's anything else planned in there? John Hess : No. There's nothing else planned in there with our current portfolio. And it really is, is these FPSO in Guyana, come online as we spoke about, phase 2 being a $25, breakeven Payara 32, Yellowtail being 25 and 32. As these FPSOs get brought online, it drives down our overall breakeven in the portfolio to below $40. Roger Read : Okay. The other question to follow-up on as you think about 2021, you talk about running the one rig in the Bakken you mentioned well costs have gone under 6 million there. Any thoughts on inflation, deflation, as you look at activity in the pocket in 2021, as you're thinking about your CapEx budget? John Hess : Greg? Greg Hill : No, I think we're not really assuming any -- any inflation whatsoever next year at the Bakken, things are still well over supplied. We already have contracts locked in with their strategic suppliers for that. Now, they do have some market based adjustments, if the market doesn't prove, but I think the important thing is through technology and innovation will still drive that costs lower no matter what. Roger Read : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the light of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks for taking the question. Both of my questions are related to COVID. The first one, Malaysia, is having a very serious outbreak that just emerged in the last 30 days since you're one of the few international operators there. I thought, I would ask what the -- what the statuses and how you're coping with that sudden, outbreak? John Hess : Yes, Greg, you might talk about the field as well as the offshore. Greg Hill : Yes. So remember, during the first outbreak of COVID. There were essentially no impacts to the operation side. Logistically, you had to get people quarantined and tested and all that, but we worked all that out. So we really didn't skip a beat, on the operating side. And remember, Malaysia is a very active area for us, we have ongoing drilling programs, ongoing projects, so very active, and we saw no impact as a result of the COVID based on the protocols that we developed. If you look at the office, again, during the first outbreak, everyone was working remotely. We got up to about 80% complement back in our office. And now we've taken that back down again. So people would just go back to working remotely. I think it always -- we've seen no impact to the operations or to our ability to work in Malaysia. It has resulted in lower nominations, which is why we kept our guidance for the fourth quarter for Malaysia 50,000 barrels equivalent just because of those COVID uncertainties in the second outbreak. Pavel Molchanov : Okay. Similar question about Guyana originally that timetable for reaching full capacity or plateau was August now you're an Exxon, of course, talking about December, how much have kind of social distancing restrictions or labor availability related to COVID have had with that four month delay? John Hess : Obviously, it impacted repairs, but go ahead. Greg Hill : Yes. No, I think it's on the margins, I would say, I mean, really the design issues that I talked about, were the primary reason. However, as Exxon has very strict protocols, which I think, are absolutely appropriate. So anyone before they go offshore has to self-quarantine in country for 14 days and be tested. So, obviously, any special work that needs to be done, it's going to take a little bit longer, but I will compliment Exxon Mobil profusely because they've had some 2,500 crew change events. And so far touchwood they've had no COVID cases offshore. So I think what's going on down there is absolutely remarkable. In terms of how well all that's being executed amidst a pandemic. Pavel Molchanov : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

My name is Andrew and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning everyone, and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our Web site, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our Web site. As we have done in recent quarters, we will be posting transcripts of each speakers prepared remarks on our Web site following the presentations. As usual, online with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. I would like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. I hope you and your families are well and staying healthy during these challenging times. Today, I will review our continued progress and executing our strategy. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations, and John Rielly will review our financial performance. Our strategy has been and continues to be to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth. Our differentiated portfolio is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets with our focus on the best rocks for the best returns. The Bakken, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and Southeast Asia are our cash engines, and Guyana is our growth engine. Guyana becomes a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low cost oil developments come online which we believe will drive our company's breakeven price to under $40 per barrel Brent and provide industry-leading cash flow growth over the course of the decade. As our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction, and then increase cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. Turning to 2020, we achieved strong operating results overcoming difficult market conditions and the challenges of working safely in the pandemic. I am extremely proud of our workforce for delivering production in line with our original guidance despite a 40% reduction in our capital and exploratory expenditures. In response to the pandemic's severe impact on oil prices, our priorities have been to preserve cash, preserve our operating capability and to preserve the long-term value of our assets. In terms of preserving cash, we came into 2020 with approximately 80% of our oil production hedged with PUD options for 130,000 barrels per day at $55 per barrel West Texas Intermediate and 20,000 barrels per day at $60 per barrel Brent. To enhance cash flow and maximize the value of our production, last March and April, when U.S. oil storage was near capacity, we chartered three very large crude carriers or VLCCs to store approximately 2 million barrels each of May, June and July Bakken crude oil production. The first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels was sold in China at a premium to Brent in September. And the second and third VLCC cargos have been sold at a premium to Brent for delivery in the first quarter of 2021. We reduced our capital and exploratory spend for 2020 by 40% from our original budget of $3 billion down to $1.8 billion. The majority of this reduction came from dropping from a six rig program in the Bakken to one rig. We also reduced our 2020 cash operating cost by $275 million. In 2020, we strengthened the company's cash and liquidity position through a $1 billion three-year term loan initially underwritten by JPMorgan Chase. In addition, we have an undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and no material debt maturities until 2023. During the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale of our 28% interest in the Shenzi field in the Gulf of Mexico for a total consideration of $505 million, bringing value forward in the low-price environment. In terms of preserving capability, a key for us in 2020 was continuing to operate one rig in the Bakken. Greg Hill and our Bakken team have made tremendous progress over the past 10 years in lean manufacturing capabilities and innovative practices which have delivered significant cost efficiencies and productivity improvements that we want to preserve for the future. In terms of preserving the long-term value of our assets, Guyana, with its low cost of supply and industry-leading financial returns remains our top priority. On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, 2020 was another outstanding year. Three oil discoveries during the year, at Uaru, Redtail-1 and Yellowtail-2 brought total discoveries on the Stabroek Block to 18. The estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources on the block was increased to approximately $9 billion barrels of oil equivalent and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. In December, production from Liza Phase 1 reached its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day. The Liza Phase 2 development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022 with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. Another key 2020 milestone was the sanctioning of our third oil development on the Stabroek Block in September at the Payara field. Payara will have a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day and is expected to achieve first oil in 2024. Turning to our plans for 2021, to protect our cash flows, we have hedged 120,000 barrels per day with $45 per barrel WTI PUD options and 20,000 barrels per day with $50 per barrel Brent PUD options. Our 2021 capital and exploratory budget is $1.9 billion, of which more than 80% will be allocated to Guyana and the Bakken. Our three sanctioned oil developments on the Stabroek Block have break-even Brent oil prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel; world class by any measure. Front-end engineering and design work for a fourth development at the Yellowtail area is underway, and we hope to submit the development plan to the government for approval before year-end. We continue to see the potential for at least five FPSOs to produce more than 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day by 2026, and longer term for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base. We will continue to invest in an active exploration and appraisal program in Guyana in 2021 with 12 to 15 wells planned for the block. The Hassa-1 exploration well recently encountered approximately 50 feet of oil-bearing reservoir in deeper geologic internals. Although the well did not find oil in primary shallower target areas, the Hassa well results confirm a working petroleum system and provide valuable information about the future exploration prospectively for this part of the block. In the Bakken, we plan to add a second rig during the first quarter, which will allow us to sustain production in the range of 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for several years and protect the long-term cash flow generation from this important asset. As we continue to execute our strategy, our Board, our leadership team, and our employees will be guided by our longstanding commitment to sustainability and the Hess values. We are proud to have been recognized throughout 2020 by a number of third-party organizations for the quality of our environmental, social, and governance performance and disclosure. In December, we achieved leadership status in CDP's Annual Global Climate Analysis for the 12th consecutive year, and earned a place on the Dow Jones sustainability index for North America for the 11th consecutive year. In summary, our priorities will remain to preserve cash, preserve capability, and preserve the long term value of our assets. By investing only in high a return low cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated portfolio of assets that we believe will provide industry leading cash flow growth for over the course of the decade. As our free cash flow grows, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then return of capital to shareholders, both in terms of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. I also hope that everyone on the call is well and staying safe. 2020 marked another year of strong performance and strategic execution for Hess despite the challenging conditions on many fronts. In particular, I would like to call out several operational highlights from the year. First, across our company we have implemented comprehensive COVID-19 health and safety measures including health screenings and testing, extended work schedules at offshore platforms, and social distancing initiatives. All based on government and public health agency's guidance. I am truly grateful to our Hess response team and our global workforce for their commitment to keeping their colleagues and our community safe during the pandemic. Second, in the Bakken despite dropping from six rigs to one in May, our full-year net production came in well above our original guidance for the year, and 27% above that of 2019. These results reflect the strong performance of our plug and perf completions, increased natural gas capture, and the quality of our anchorage position. Third, in Guyana, we made significant advances on all three of our sanctioned developments on the Stabroek block with Liza Phase 1 reaching its full production capacity in December. Liza Phase 2 remaining on track for first oil early next year. And Payara sanctioned in September with first oil expected in 2024. Continued exploration and appraisal success increased the gross recoverable resource estimate for the block to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Now turning to our operations, proved reserves the end of 2020 stood at 1.17 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Net proved reserve additions in 2020 totaled 170 million barrels of oil equivalent including negative net price revisions of 79 million barrels of oil equivalent, which resulted in overall 2020 production replacement ratio of 95% and a finding and development cost of $15.25 per barrel of oil equivalent. Excluding price related revisions, our production replacement ratio was 158% with an F&D cost of $9.10 per barrel of oil equivalent. Turning to production, in the fourth quarter of 2020, company wide net production averaged 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, above our guidance of approximately 300,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by higher natural gas capture in the Bakken and higher natural gas nominations in Southeast Asia. For the full-year 2021, we forecast net production to average approximately 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya. For the first quarter of 2021, we forecast net production to average approximately 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. In the Bakken, fourth quarter net production averaged 189,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of approximately 9% above the year-ago quarter and above our guidance of 180,000 to 185,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full-year 2020, Bakken net production averaged 193,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of approximately 27% compared to 2019 and well above our original full-year guidance of 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day despite dropping from six rigs to one in May. We have a robust inventory of more than 1,800 drilling locations in the Bakken that can generate attractive returns at current oil prices, representing approximately 60 rig years of activity. With WTI prices now in the range of $50 per barrel, we will add a second operated drilling rig during the first quarter. A two rig program will enable us to hold net production flat at approximately 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and will sustain strong long-term cash generation from this important asset. In 2020, our drilling and completion costs per Bakken well averaged $6.2 million which was $600,000 or 9% lower than 2019. In 2021, we expect D&C costs average below $6 million per well. Over the full-year, we expect to drill 55 gross operated wells and bring approximately 45 new wells online. This compares to 71 wells drilled and 111 wells brought online in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect to drill approximately 10 wells and bring four new wells online. Bakken net production is forecast to average approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for both the first quarter and for the full-year 2021. Our four-year forecasts reflects the impact of a planned 45-day shut down for the type of gas plant in the third quarter, which is expected to reduce full-year net production by approximately 7,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, predominantly affecting natural gas production. During the shutdown, we will perform a turnaround and time the planned expansion project completed in 2020, which will then increase capacity to 400 million cubic feet per day from the plants current 250 million cubic feet per day capacity. Now moving to the offshore, in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, and 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full-year 2020, fourth quarter net production came in below our guidance of 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to the early closing of the Shenzi sale and extended hurricane recovery downtime, at two third-party operated production platforms. In 2021, no new wells are planned in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and we forecast net production from our assets to average approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns in both the second and third quarters. The Deepwater Gulf of Mexico remains a very important cash engine for the company, as well as a platform for future growth. In Malaysia and the joint development area and the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess has a 50% interest, net production average 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full-year 2020. Fourth quarter production was above our guidance at 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day because of higher natural gas nominations. For the full-year 2021, net production for Malaysia and the JDA is forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Turning to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator. In 2020, we announced three new discoveries bringing the total number of discoveries to 18 and increasing our estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent and we continue to see multi-billion barrels of exploration upside on the Stabroek Block and we are planning an active exploration program in 2021. In March, the operator will bring a fifth drillship, the Stena Drillmax into theater and in April six drillship, The Noble Sam Croft. We plan to drill 12 to 15 exploration and appraisal wells in 2021 that will target a variety of prospects and play types. These will include lower risk wells near existing discoveries, higher risk step outs, and several penetrations that will test deeper lower Campanian and Santonian intervals. This ramped up program will allow us to accelerate exploration of the block and enable optimum sequencing of future developments. In addition, the emerging deep play, which we believe to have significant potential needs further drilling to determine its commerciality and ultimate value. Over the next several months, we will participate in two exploration wells and two appraisal wells on the Stabroek Block. The next exploration well to be drilled is [Koebi-1] [Ph], which is located approximately 16 miles Northeast of Liza. This well will target Liza type Campanian aged reservoirs, and is expected to spud in February using The Stena Carron drillship. In March, we expect to spud the Longtail-3 appraisal well, which will provide additional data in the Turbot, Longtail area and we will drill a deeper section that will target lower Campanian and Santonian geologic intervals, the Stena DrillMAX were drilled as well. Moving to April, we expect to spud the Yellowtail-2 appraisal well utilizing the Noble Don Taylor drillship, success here and at Mako-2, which will be drilled later this year, could move the Mako Uaru area forward in the development queue. Then in May, we plan to spud the Redtail-1 one exploration well located approximately 12 miles east of Liza. This well will test Campanian and Santonian aged reservoirs and will be drilled by the Stena DrillMAX. Turning now to our Guyana developments, in mid-December, the Liza Destiny floating production storage and offloading vessel achieved its nameplate capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day. And since then has been operating at that level are higher. During 2021, the operator intends to evaluate and pursue options to increase nameplate capacity. For 2021, we forecast net production from Guyana will average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day with planned maintenance and optimization downtime being broadly offset by an increase in nameplate capacity. The Liza Phase 2 development remains on track for first oil in early 2022. The overall project, including the FPSO drilling and subsea infrastructure is approximately 85% complete. We anticipate that the Liza Unity FPSO, which will have a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day to sale from the Keppel shipyard in Singapore to Guyana by mid-year. Payara, our third sanction development on the Stabroek Block will utilize an FPSO with a gross production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day with first oil expected in 2024. The hole for the prosperity FPSO is complete, top site construction activities are underway, and we expect integration of the hole and top sites to begin at the Keppel yard in Singapore by year-end. Front-end engineering and design work is ongoing for our fourth development at Yellowtail. This work will continue through 2021, and we anticipate being ready to submit a plan of development to the Government of Guyana for approval in the fourth quarter. In closing, our execution continues to be strong. The Bakken and our offshore assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are performing well, and continue to generate significant cash flow, and Guyana continues to get bigger and better. All of which positions us to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth and significant shareholder value over the course of the next decade. I will now turn the call over to John Riley. John Rielly : Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020, and provide guidance for 2021. We incurred a net loss of $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with a net loss of $243 million in the third quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we incurred a net loss of $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a net loss of $216 million in the previous quarter. Fourth quarter results including after-tax gain of $79 million from the sale of our interests in the Shenzi Field. Turning to E&P, on an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $118 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a net loss of $156 million in the previous quarter. The after-tax changes and adjusted E&P results between the fourth quarter and third quarter were as follows : higher realized selling prices improve results by $18 million, higher sales volumes improve results by $11 million, lower DD&A expense improve results by $40 million, lower exploration expenses improve results by $12 million, higher cash costs driven by workovers and hurricane-related maintenance costs in the Gulf of Mexico reduced results by $41 million, all other items reduced results by $2 million for an overall increase in fourth quarter results of $38 billion. Our E&P operations were overlifted compared with production in the fourth quarter by approximately 1.6 million barrels resulting in an increased after-tax income of approximately $15 million. Turning to Midstream, the Midstream segment had net income of $62 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to net income of $56 million in the previous quarter. Midstream EBITDA before non-controlling interests amounted to $198 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $180 million in the previous quarter. Turning to corporate, after-tax corporate and interest expenses were $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to an adjusted after-tax expense of $116 million in the previous quarter. Turning to our financial position, at quarter-end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.74 billion, and our total liquidity was $5.4 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion. Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is committed through May 2023. In November 2020, we completed the previously-announced sale of our 28% working interest in the Shenzi Field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $482 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $532 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with $468 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to higher crude oil sales volumes. In the fourth quarter, net cash provided from operating activities after changes in working capital was $486 million compared with $136 million in the prior quarter. Proceeds from the September sale of the first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels of oil were received in October. We've entered into agreements to sell the second and third VLCC cargos totaling 4.2 million barrels of oil in the first quarter of 2021. We expect to recognize net income of approximately $60 million in the first quarter from these sales, including associated hedging gains and costs. First quarter of 2021 net cash provided by operating activities after changes in working capital is expected to include approximately $115 million of cash flow from these sales. For calendar year of 2021, we have purchased WTI PUD options for 100,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly floor price of $45 per barrel and Brent PUD options for 20,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly floor price of $50 per barrel. Now, turning to guidance, first, for EMP, we project EMP cash cost excluding Libya to be in the range of $10.50 to $11.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full-year 2021. DD&A expense, excluding Libya is forecast to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full-year 2021. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $22.50 to $24.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full-year 2021. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter and $170 million to $180 million for the full-year 2021. The midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million in the first quarter, and $1.09 billion to $1.12 billion for the full-year 2021. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the first quarter and $80 million to $90 million for the full-year 2021. As highlighted earlier, we have purchased crude oil hedge positions for calendar year 2021. We expect non-cash option premium amortization which will be reflected in our realized selling prices to reduce our results by approximately $37 million per quarter. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $425 million in the first quarter and approximately $1.9 billion for the full-year 2021. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million in the first quarter and $280 million to $290 million for the full-year 2021. Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the first quarter, and $130 million to $140 million for the full-year 2021. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the first quarter, and $380 million to $390 million for the full-year 2021. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. John Hess : Good morning. Jeanine Wai : Good morning. Greg Hill : Good morning. Jeanine Wai : My questions are on Guyana. My first one is the Stena Carron drillship completed appraisal work at the Redtail well. Do you have any color on the appraisal results? And I think it was supposed to include a drill stem test, but I'm not sure on the status of that. John Hess : Yes, Greg? Greg Hill : Yes. Thank you, Jeanine. First of all, the results of the Redtail well in the past were very positive. And so, what it does is it really confirms our excitement about the large volume of very high quality reservoir and reservoir fluids in and around what I call the greater -- Yellowtail area. And that's a big reason why Yellowtail now is going to be the focus of the fourth development, which we said in our remarks we hope to submit a plan of development to the Guyanese government by the fourth quarter of this year. So, very exciting results and very exciting development coming forward. Jeanine Wai : Okay, great. Thank you. And my follow-up is also on Guyana. I loved all the details about where you're going for exploration and appraisal this year. You mentioned the results -- depending on results of the appraisal at Mako that that could get moved up in the queue. And I was just wondering what you're seeing at Mako that puts it ahead of maybe some of the other potential development areas? Thank you. John Hess : Yes, Greg? Greg Hill : Yes, sure Jeanine. So, what we said was that assuming good results at Mako and Uaru-2, that remember is very close to Liza-2 and it's kind of in between Yellowtail and Liza-2. So, we know that the reservoir quality and the crude quality is going to be very high in that region. So, that's why it will move up further in the queue because if it's what we think it is, that will be very high value barrels that we'll want to move forward. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Thank you for taking my question. John Hess : Thank you. And that could potentially be the first ship basically. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning. Happy New Year, guys. I appreciate you taking my questions. Greg, let me start with Hassa and the somewhat quick description John gave of the deeper horizons. You talked about the possibility of the Santonian and a number of other tests extending the life of some of the early stages. So, I'm just wondering is this a continuation of that Santonian trend that we saw in Hassa, and if so, why would you describe it as -- I guess how would you describe it, as a successful well, as an unsuccessful well? How have you reported it to the government? Greg Hill : Well, I think -- look, well, the Hassa well one didn't encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in the primary campaign objective as we mentioned Doug in our opener, it did encounter approximately 50 net feet of pay in the deeper Santonian section. So, further evaluation of those deep results are going to be incorporated in our future ex-pricing development plans for the area and will provide some very useful calibration for prospects and developments in the surrounding areas. So, the petroleum system is working. We found 50 net feet of good oil in the Santonian. So, now we need to process on what that means, but I think it's a very positive sign for the Santonian. Doug Leggate : So, would that be reported as a discovery then? Greg Hill : No, because the well is still under evaluation. Doug Leggate : Okay, alright. My follow-up John Rielly, you've obviously involved in some protection, can you talk about the -- I don't know if you [indiscernible] your prepared remarks about the amortization schedule. What's really behind my question is at which [indiscernible] you're going to be pretty close to cash breakeven including dividend this year, how would you characterize that statement? Does that sound reasonable to you with what we know today? And if so, what is the incremental priority for free cash in terms of where you want the balance sheet to be? So, basically it's a free cash flow question and a balance sheet question for 2021. John Hess : Go ahead, John. John Rielly : Sure. So, I think first you were saying for the hedges themselves for our 100,000 of barrels a day of WTI PUD options that we have at $45 and then the 20,000 barrels a day for Brent production that we have at $50. The amortization of that is going to be $37 million per quarter. So, we like it. We've got nice protection on the down side because obviously again, this is a big year for us just to kind of complete the development of Liza phase 2 and as you know when Liza phase 2 comes on, it gets approximately 60,000 barrels a day of Brent based production. The cash cost of that Liza phase 2 is going to be more around $10 pre any purchase of the FPSO versus the first one being at $12 just from the economies of scale. So, you can put any type of Brent price in there and take out the $10 cash cost, and you can see there is going to be a significant inflection for us on cash flow once Phase 2 comes on. So, for this year, Doug, from a cash flow standpoint what we were looking to do? So, the first thing we were looking to do was to get the hedges placed. So, we have insurance on the downside. Coming into the year effectively, as I mentioned, we have $1.74 billion of cash at year-end, and as I said in my remarks, we are going to complete the sales of the two VLCCs, and it's going to give us cash flow of approximately $150 million in the first quarter. So, on a pro forma basis, we basically have $1.9 billion of cash going into the year. So I want to say, I mean I don't want to guess on oil prices, but we have got the downside protected, we are coming in with a very strong cash balance here from that standpoint, and therefore at these higher prices, obviously this helps with our funding program here for Guyana. So when Phase 2 comes on depending on what prices are, with our insurance now, we know we are going to have a nice cash cushion at that point. And then, we are going to be in this significant inflection point of getting much higher cash flow. And depending on prices there, the portfolio can just continue to generate free cash flow. Or, for some reason prices go back down in that period, as I said Guyana will still be generating free cash flow even at very low prices once Phase 2 comes on like $40 type prices. And then when Payara comes on, if it was really low prices would still be generating free cash flow. So, we put ourselves in a good position with a very strong cash position, hedges protection, should be nice year with prices at this level, and then a big inflection when Phase 2 starts. John Hess : And to complement what John is saying. The priority, once we get to that free cash flow inflection, is to pay down our term loan. And then after that, the majority of the free cash flow will increase cash returns to our shareholders prioritizing the dividend first. Doug Leggate : So, John, not to deliver the question, so you are happy with about a $5 billion debt balance is that the implication? John Rielly : When we pay down that term loan debt? Doug Leggate : Yes. John Rielly : Yes. So as we pay down that term loan, our debt to EBITDA when the Guyana FPSOs keep coming on, we are going to drive under our two times target fairly quickly. So, yes, that's where we would like to be, right there. Get that term loan paid off. And then as John said, then start increasing dividend and opportunistic share repurchases. Doug Leggate : That's sustaining. Thanks again guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Yes. Good morning, gents. John Hess : Good morning, Arun. Arun Jayaram : Yes, John, I want to start off with your thoughts on the evolving regulatory landscape post the election. And maybe, get your perspective on potential implications to Hess from the anticipated executive order later today on canceling lease sales. And if the government takes a more restrictive stance on permits post the 60-day moratorium? And perhaps as well to John Rielly, thoughts on IDCs and how -- I know you have material NOL balances, but just thoughts on risk to IDCs as well. John Hess : Yes. No, Arun, great question. Obviously, we also understand the President will make an announcement later today on Federal lands and also some points I think about climate. I think it's important for everyone to realize that only about 2% of our Bakken acreage is on Federal land. So, this pronouncement will not have an impact on our Bakken activities. And in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as I heard Greg say earlier that we have no drilling plan for this year in the deepwater Gulf, and it remains to be seen what he is going to say about existing acreage and drilling permits for the deepwater, but we have no drilling plan this year. I think the most important point here is that the administration as it makes these decisions to address climate change that they have to be not only climate literate but energy literate. And they have to realize that oil & gas are strategic engine for the U.S. economy, especially at a time that we are trying to recover the economy from COVID. And that importance in jobs, we have over 12 million direct and indirect jobs. In terms of low energy cost for our working class families, our power cost in large part because of shale gas are half what they are in Europe. And in terms of national security, where we are energy independent, in large part because of shale oil and shale gas, so it's just a question of finding the balance here. And hopefully, as the administration moves forward, they will extend the hand as well, we define common ground to make sure we do everything we can to address climate change, but also that oil and gas play a key role in the economy's recovery. And John, you want to talk about the IDCs? John Rielly : Sure, so yes, you are right, Arun for us obviously, they change what they're doing with the IDC, there will be an alternative period of recovery; I don't know over how many years EOP or a different year term. For us, though, while it's negative for U.S. oil supply in general, it's not going to have a material impact to us, due to our NOL position, we do have a significant net operating loss position here. So, for us paying cash taxes, anything in the near-term regarding to the IDC, that will not change our profile. Arun Jayaram : Great. And my follow-up is, John Rielly, the cash costs guide was a little bit lower this year than our model. So I was wondering if you could maybe get us oriented on how or where your expectations are for Liza 1, kind of cash operating costs. I think you still are paying the rental fee on the FPSO. So would love to hear what those costs are and any expectations around Liza 2 with the bigger boat? John Rielly : Yes, so for Liza Phase 1 it's $12 per barrel, basically. And now we're at full capacity here. That's the cash cost per barrel while we're in the rental period. And you're correct, we have it in our numbers for the whole year, post an FPSO purchase, it'll drop down into the $8 to $9 type range for Liza Phase 1. As I mentioned, Liza Phase 2 actually, the cash cost will be approximately $10 per barrel while the FPSO is being leased. And then it's going to drop to $7 to $8 per barrel post the purchase of the FPSO. So, again for us, every time you know an FPSO comes online, it's going to help our cash costs. And it's also by the way, going to help our DD&A rates, so right now, Liza Phase 1 is the current DD&A rate is below our portfolio average, again due to the low F&D costs, so when Liza Phase 2 comes on, ultimately when it's up full and running here, and you get to the full scale, again, that F&D is very low. And that's going to continue to drive our DD&A down. So again, we look forward for every FPSO to come on in Guyana. Arun Jayaram : Thanks. John Rielly : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Brian Singer : Thank you, good morning. John Rielly : Good morning, Brian. Brian Singer : I want to start on the Bakken. You've highlighted at the beat on production on a BOE per day basis has come from in part from GAAP capture, and then some of the impacts of pricing on NGL contracts and percent of proceeds contracts, on a forward-looking basis, I wondered if you could provide some color on what you expect the oil production outlook to be in the first quarter and the full-year? Where you stand in terms of gas flaring? And what the upside could be from further gas capturing? John Hess : Greg? Greg Hill : Yes, so let me start with flaring Brian. So we're well below the 9% required by the state in 2020, we achieved that in particular in the fourth quarter, and that's why our gas capture volumes increased. This year, we plan to gather more gas and get our flaring down even lower. So as part of our continued focus on sustainability, we want to drive that gas flaring as low as possible, obviously. So you'll see us continue to add infrastructure with our partner in the midstream to gather as much gas as we possibly can. Now if we talk about the oil, so the decline in oil is purely related to the wells online. So in Q3, we had 22 wells online. In Q4, we hit 12 wells online. And in Q1, we only added in Q1 of this year, we will only put four wells online. So naturally, you're going to get some oil decline associated with that, however, as that second rig kicks in, which we really see the effects of in the second-half of the year, that's when oil will begin to stabilize and be flat from then on, with that second rig. So again, it's really just a mix issue of gas that changes your percentage on a total company basis and then the oil is purely a function of the wells online, but that will stabilize - the company will stabilize the 175,000 barrels a day flat for a number of years. Brian Singer : Great, thanks. And then second question goes back to Guyana. Now that you've gotten Phase 1 ramped up to the 120,000 barrels a day and it seemed like you're hinting that that capacity could actually be raised this year. Can you talk about how you're planning Phase 2 and the potential speed at which that could be ramped up to a full capacity, knowing some of the lessons of 2020 in terms of gas capture et cetera? John Hess : Great. Yes, Brian, thanks for that. Certainly, I would expect the ramp up of Phase 2 to go faster because as you say all of those learnings have been incorporated into the ramp of into Phase 2. So I would expect it to go much smoother because remember all of our issues were associated with the gas system and those have been fixed in Phase 2. Brian Singer : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Silverstein with Wolfe Research. Josh Silverstein : Hi, good morning, guys. Just to ask a follow-up question\u2026 John Hess : Good morning. Josh Silverstein : Good morning. Just to ask a follow-up question to talk, I'm sorry if I just missed this, but when you guys start to stabilize around the 175,000 range around there, what does the production mix look like? Or does it still kind of change on a quarterly basis just based on some of the wall timing? John Hess : Greg? Greg Hill : Yes. So, of course, you will always get -- there's two factors going on. One, which I mentioned, which is yes it is a function of when wells come online, so you get some minor changes associated with that. But then, of course, the bigger thing when I'm talking about total production on a barrel equivalent basis is really all the gas are gathering, including third party volumes, which remember a portion of that is subject to a percent of proceeds contracts. So a lot of times when you see those numbers moving around, particularly on the percentage of oil versus gas, it's all related to that gas gathering, including third party and NGL prices, which affect your pop contracts, but oil will be flat with a two rig program. And then for the whole company, the 175,000 barrels a day equivalent would be flat with the two rigs. Josh Silverstein : Got it, understood, thanks for that. And then I'm just curious on the balance sheet and asset sales, obviously you sold Shenzi late last quarter to help support the cash balance there in Guyana development. I know some of this will be opportunistic, but these are cash flowing engines of the company. And I'm just wondering how much of the remaining portfolio you guys may wanted to divest or maybe market right now I know in the past Denmark had be looked at as an asset for sale. So I am just curious there will be some ongoing divestiture program as Guyana wants some. John Hess : Yes, obviously in the normal course of business as we've shown, we always look to optimize our portfolio where we see value opportunities where there are opportunities to sell assets that meet our value expectations. Obviously that was the case in Shenzi. And there are maybe a few cases where there are some assets, other assets, as you mentioned that may meet that criteria as well. So, if they meet our criteria for value expectations, we'll move forward, but commenting more than that would be inappropriate. Josh Silverstein : Got it, understood. Thanks, guys. John Hess : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Ryan Todd : Good. Thanks. Maybe one follow-up on the Bakken discovery, can you provide any additional color on the expected trajectory at least in general of production in the Bakken over the course of the year? And should we expect some amount of modest decline during the first-half before the second rig stabilizes production and then an exit rate that's closer to the 175,000 barrel a day long-term target? John Hess : Yes, Greg. Greg Hill : Yes. I think that's fair. Yes, because really the impact of the second rig does not kick in until the second-half of the year. So, you will have some very moderate decline in oil. And then as I mentioned before, on a total production basis will be a function of NGL prices, right? We fully expect NGL prices to normalize in the second quarter, so we get some pickup in the second, third, and fourth quarter as NGL prices normalize. Ryan Todd : Okay. Thanks. And then maybe one in Guyana, I know it may be early, but given the differences in both development plan and capital budgets for Phase 2 and Phase 3 developments in Guyana, can you talk a little bit about expectations for FPSO 4, whether resource density and our infrastructure requirements would kind of lean more one way or the other in terms of implications for the CapEx budget going forward? John Hess : Yes, Greg, you might talk about the reservoir and oil quality there. Greg Hill : Sure. John Hess : And the attractiveness of the economics. Greg Hill : Yes. So, and then I'll give the capital to John Riley, but Yellowtail, again very high quality reservoir. And we would expect it to be between Liza 2 and Payara in terms of -- it's breakeven oil price, right, so, somewhere between at $25 and $32 breakeven is where we anticipate Yellowtail will come across, because again, this is an extremely high quality reservoir and very high quality fluid. So, that's one of the reasons it's jumping forward, in the queue and really being kind of the next cab off the rank if you will, because it's very high value development. Ryan, I wanted to add one thing to my Bakken comment last time. Also remember in the third quarter we had the Tioga gas plant turnaround. So, you will see a dip in production in the third quarter, but that's all gas, primarily oil is going to be rocking along just fine. Ryan Todd : Okay, perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. Thank you. Good morning. John Hess : Good morning. Roger Read : Just wanted to ask one question on Guyana in reference to the expectation that Phase 1 can maybe move above nameplate, I know earlier in 2020 there were some surface issues, and so, as you look at the ability to go above, can you kind of give us an idea of how much of this is subsurface outperformance, how much of it is surface debottlenecking, and maybe just a more broad sort of understanding of how the wells themselves have been performing? John Hess : Greg? Greg Hill : Yes. Yes, thanks for the question. First of all, the wells are performing extremely well. I mean these reservoirs are some of the best in the world. The wells continue to do as good or better than we thought. So, any constraints if you will that have occurred in 2020 had purely been as a results of the top sites. Now, for the last week, we've been operating around 127,000 barrels a day pretty steady in Phase 1. And as you mentioned, the operator now is conducting the studies to put project in place to further increase on that capacity, plans or to do that in the third quarter. So, we'll have a shutdown period to be able to do that. That's going to be piping changes and basically just kind of debottlenecking, some tight spots that you might have in the facility. So, that's why our forecasted volumes for the year 2021, our 30,000 barrels of oil met us, because you get some pickup from that optimization that the operator is planning to do, offset a little bit by the shutdown time required to do it, but this vessel will definitely have higher throughput next year. Roger Read : Okay, great. Thank you. John Hess : Meaning this year and next year, right Greg? Greg Hill : Yes, sorry, '21. Sorry, John. You got me again. John Hess : Okay, fine. Greg Hill : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Hi, thank you. Good morning, guys. John Hess : Hey, good morning, Paul. Paul Cheng : Thank you. Talking about the Yellowtail, you guys had a good quarter. I know that's wonderful. Can you make some preliminary expectation, what is the unit development cost, is that comparable to Liza 2 or more like Payara? John Hess : No. As I said, Paul, I think this development is probably going to fall between Payara and Phase 2. So, somewhere closer to, we believe we'd be closer to Phase 2. And so, you could assume development costs be very similar somewhere between Phase 2 in Payara. These are very good reservoirs, very high deliverability, very high quality crude oil. That's why that breakeven is in between the two, it really comes down to just how much infrastructure will you need, but won't need to much Payara, may little need a little bit more than Phase 2. Paul Cheng : Okay. You mentioned about a two-week Bakken program, two question on there, first, what is the oil production that you will be able to do based on that? I mean, we understand the gas will swing due to the capture way, but you're saying that oil will be priced? That is so what that number that you expect? And whether that based on what you see today? We need that the program that you expect for the next several years, that even with a change in the commodity prices how that impact that program? John Hess : Well, let me start with your second question first, Paul. As we've said, our plan is to hold two rigs through 2021. Now, assuming oil prices improve in the future, what we'd like to do is eventually get the rig count to four in the Bakken. By getting the rig count to four will not only generate significant amount of cash flow, but we'll also be able to hold production in the Bakken broadly flat at around 200,000 barrels a day, equivalent for almost 10 years. Why would we want to do that because we have 1,800 well locations left that at current prices generate very high returns? Now if I look at this year's program, in particular, remember, I'm going to bring 45 wells online this year, the program is very similar to last year in that the IP-180 will be the same as last year, 120,000 barrels of oil IP-180 very good wells and add current returns, if you look at the IRR of that program, this year of those 45 wells, it's 95% rate of return. And so, I've got another after this year, I'll have another 1750 wells that are in those very high returns that of course I want to get, I'd like to develop. But I think it was we've said before Paul, the role of the Bakken in the portfolio is to be a cash generator. So the rate at which we invest in the Bakken will be a function of corporate cash flow needs. But you can see the pent-up potential on the Bakken is very large with some very good return opportunities. John Rielly : And to be clear to everyone following, the oil cut at the wellhead really not has not changed, the oil changes is downstream. How much gas we capture, how many wells we're bringing online, and what the NGL prices are? So the quality of oil at the wellhead is the same, that percent hasn't changed. Now, what changes in the corporate accounting is due to what happens downstream as I mentioned. Paul Cheng : Hey, so what is that oil production that you expect that two rig program can do? John Hess : Well, I think broadly, what once this level is out, I think broadly you can expect oil around 90,000 barrels a day in the third and fourth quarter. Paul Cheng : Okay. And the next one is for John Rielly, John your DD&A expectation for the year is really low comparing to your fourth quarter and your fourth quarter [indiscernible] probably do close to $16, and you're expecting you're going to be at $12 to $13 for the first quarter as well as for the full-year. So, where are we seeing that picture in your unit DD&A? John Hess : John? John Rielly : Sure, Paul. Yes, thanks John. The driver of this is the increase in our year-end 2020 proved develop reserves. So, you saw our reserve replacement, but I guess another aspect of this is that our proved develop reserves are up to about 70% of our proved reserves. So, it's up 13% over year-on-year, excluding the asset sales. So, you've got -- Bakken obviously proved developed reserves adds still net even after price revisions, you have Guyana again picking up proved developed reserves here as more and more wells and the performance from Phase 2. And then you've got some good amount of transfers from PUDs that moved into proved developed reserves, approximately 100 million barrels there, and it's offset obviously by current production. So, it's really the driver of proved developed reserves increasing significantly from last year. And then you have a combination of a year-over-year production mix. So, as I mentioned, Guyana right now it is below our portfolio average. And so, Guyana's production is increasing. So that's going to overall drive down the DD&A rates. And again, Bakken's DD&A rate while still higher is coming down from 2020 just due to the proved develop adds. So, again a good year for reserve ads. Paul Cheng : My final question on the Gulf of Mexico, how many permits that you have currently in hand, if you have any? John Hess : Paul, we don't need any permits this year at all. We're not\u2026 Paul Cheng : I understand\u2026 John Hess : We're not planning any\u2026 Paul Cheng : I understand that you are not going to drill anything, but I just want to see that if you have any permit that in hand, given that the permit can last for two years, and then possible that for extension. John Hess : Let's see where the President comes out on what his drilling regulations are. And then, right now we don't have any permits in hand because we don't have any need for the next year, right. Paul Cheng : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Good morning, all. John Hess : Good morning, Bob. Bob Brackett : I'll risk a bit of a long-winded question, so the lean of the FPSO destiny had a mid-year 2019 departure from Singapore and a single installation campaign, which resulted in first oil on December 20th of 2019, the same year. You've mentioned that Liza unity FPSO has a mid-year 2021 departure from Singapore, and it has two installation campaigns and obviously more risers and umbilicals. How should I contrast the timeline of hookup integration commissioning, and then ultimately the shape of the production ramp for unity versus destiny? John Hess : Go ahead, Greg. Greg Hill : Yes. So, Bob, you're right, I mean there's two installation programs. That's why officially first oil is early 2022. Now because of those two programs, there are still some contingency in the projects. So, if everything goes right, you could maybe get that best launch just a little bit earlier, right? So, all going very well, as I said in my remarks, project is 85% complete, vessel due to sail away early in the summer, get it on location and then do that very active hookup program that'll put a square little bit first oil in the early part of 2022. Now the ramp, as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate that ramp will go much smoother. Of course in Phase 1, and that's because all of the learnings which were in the gas system, remember all of the learnings have been applied to the gas system on Phase 2, because it was very similar equipment as in Phase 1. So very much expect the ramp, broadly would occur over, say, a three-month period because you're going to -- you bring things on and you measure dynamics, you've got vibration sensors everywhere. That's a pretty normal cadence to bring something like that on as over three-month period. Bob Brackett : Great, thanks for that. Greg Hill : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

My name is Catherine, and I\u2019ll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Catherine. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today\u2019s conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess\u2019 annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today\u2019s conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. As we have done in recent quarters, we will be posting transcripts of each speaker\u2019s prepared remarks on our website following their presentations. On the line with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. We hope you and your families are all well. Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations, and John Rielly will review our financial performance. Let\u2019s begin with our strategy, which has been and continues to be to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth. By investing only in high return, low cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated portfolio that is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets, with Guyana as our growth engine and the Bakken, Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia as our cash engines. Guyana is positioned to become a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low cost oil developments come on line, which we expect will drive our portfolio breakeven Brent oil price below $40 per barrel by the middle of the decade. As our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. Even as we have seen oil prices recover since the beginning of this year, our priorities continue to be to preserve cash, preserve our operating capability and preserve the long-term value of our assets. In terms of preserving cash, at the end of March, we had $1.86 billion of cash on the balance sheet, a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which is undrawn and was recently extended by one year to 2024, and no debt maturities until 2023. We have maintained a disciplined capital and exploratory budget for 2021 of $1.9 billion. More than 80% of this year\u2019s capital spend is allocated to Guyana, where our three sanctioned oil developments have a breakeven oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel, and to the Bakken, where we have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI. To manage downside risks, in 2021 we have hedged 120,000 barrels of oil per day with $55 per barrel WTI put options and 30,000 barrels of oil per day with $60 per barrel Brent put options. To further optimize our portfolio and strengthen our cash and liquidity position, we recently announced two asset sales. In March, we entered into an agreement to sell our oil and gas interests in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million, effective January 1, 2021. This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. On April 8th, we announced the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interests in the Bakken for a total consideration of $312 million, effective March 1, 2021. This acreage is located in the southernmost portion of our Bakken position and is not connected to Hess Midstream infrastructure. The sale of this acreage, most of which we were not planning to drill before 2026, brings material value forward. This transaction is expected to close within the next few weeks. During the quarter, we also received $70 million in net proceeds from the public offering of a small portion of our Class A shares in Hess Midstream LP. The Bakken remains a core part of our portfolio. In February, as WTI oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, we added a second rig, which will allow us to sustain production and strong cash flow generation from our largest operated asset. In terms of preserving the long-term value of our assets, Guyana, with its low cost of supply and industry-leading financial returns, remains a top priority. On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we have made 18 significant discoveries to date with gross discovered recoverable resources of approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. We have an active exploration and appraisal program this year on the Stabroek Block. Yesterday we announced a discovery at the Uaru-2 well with encouraging results that further define the large areal extent of this accumulation, underpinning a potential future oil development. In addition, drilling activities are underway for appraisal at the Longtail-3 well and for exploration at the Koebi-1 prospect. Production from Liza Phase 1 ran at its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day during the first quarter. In mid-April, production was curtailed for several days after a minor leak was detected in the flash gas compressor discharge silencer. Production has since ramped back up and is expected to remain in the range of 100,000 to 110,000 gross barrels of oil per day until repairs to the discharge silencer are completed in approximately three months. Following this repair, production is expected to return to or above Liza Destiny\u2019s nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. The Liza Phase 2 development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022 with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. Our third oil development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara Field is expected to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. Engineering work for Yellowtail, a fourth development on the Stabroek Block, is underway with anticipated startup in 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning. We continue to see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs on the block by 2027, and longer term for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. As we execute our Company\u2019s strategy, we will continue to be guided by our longstanding commitment to sustainability and are proud to be an industry leader in this area. We support the aim of the Paris Agreement and also a global ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. As part of our sustainability commitment, our Board and our senior leadership have set aggressive targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. In 2020, we significantly surpassed our five-year emissions reduction targets, reducing operated Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 40% and flaring intensity by approximately 60% compared to 2014 levels. We recently announced our new five-year emissions reduction targets for 2025, which are to reduce operated Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 44% and methane emissions intensity by approximately 50% from 2017 levels. In addition, we are investing in technological and scientific advances designed to reduce, capture and store carbon emissions, including groundbreaking work being conducted by the Salk Institute to develop plants with larger root systems that according to the Salk Institute are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere. In summary, our Company is executing our strategy that will deliver increasing financial returns, visible and low risk production growth and accelerating cash flow growth well into this decade. As we generate increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then the return of capital to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. Overall, in the first quarter, we demonstrated strong execution and delivery across our portfolio. Company-wide net production averaged 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was in line with our guidance. The Bakken experienced extreme weather conditions and higher NGL prices during the quarter, both of which led to lower volumes. However, the higher NGL prices resulted in significantly higher net income and cash flows. Bakken net production in the first quarter averaged 158,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Of this shortfall, approximately 8,000 barrels per day was due to the significant increase in NGL prices in the quarter. Much of our third-party gas processing from our operated production is done under Percent of Proceeds, or POP contracts, where we charge a fixed fee for processing wet gas but take NGL barrels as payment instead of cash. POP volumes from these contracts get reported as Hess net production. When NGL prices increase, as they did in the first quarter, it takes fewer barrels to cover our gas processing fees. Hence our reported NGL production was reduced. But again, the higher NGL prices resulted in significantly higher earnings and cash flow. The other factor that affected Bakken production in the quarter was related to winter storm Uri, which brought power outages and average wind chill temperatures of minus 34 degrees Fahrenheit for two weeks in February. These extreme temperatures were below safe operating conditions for our crews and led to higher non-productive time on our drilling rigs, significantly higher workover backlogs and lower non-operated production. As discussed in our January earnings call, we added a second rig in the Bakken in February. In the first quarter, we drilled 11 wells and brought four new wells on line. In the second quarter, we expect to drill approximately 15 wells and to bring approximately 10 new wells on line, and for the full year 2021, we expect to drill approximately 55 wells and bring approximately 45 new wells on line. Thanks to the continued application of Lean and technology, our drilling and completion costs are expected to average approximately $5.8 million per well in 2021, which represents a 6.5% reduction from $6.2 million in 2020 and a 15% reduction from $6.8 million in 2019. For the second quarter, we forecast that our Bakken net production will average approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and for the full year 2021, between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This forecast reflects the residual weather impacts, higher NGL strip prices, the sale of our non-strategic Bakken acreage, and the planned turnaround of the Tioga Gas Plant in the third quarter. We expect net production to build in the second half of the year and forecast a 2021 exit rate of between 170,000 and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, first quarter net production averaged 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong operations following hurricane recovery in late 2020. In the second quarter, we forecast that Gulf of Mexico net production will average approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2021, we maintain our guidance for Gulf of Mexico net production to average approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime and natural field declines. In the Gulf of Thailand, net production in the first quarter was 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, as natural gas nominations continued to increase due to strong economic growth. Second quarter and full year 2021 net production are forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now turning to Guyana. Our discoveries and developments on the Stabroek Block are world class in every respect, and with Brent breakeven oil prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel, represent some of the lowest project breakeven oil prices in the industry. Production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 121,000 gross barrels of oil per day, or 31,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess in the first quarter. As John mentioned, production at the Liza Destiny was curtailed for several days following the detection of a minor gas leak in the flash gas compressor\u2019s discharge silencer on April 11th. Production is currently averaging between 110,000 and 100,000 gross barrels of oil per day and is expected to stay in that range while repairs are made to the silencer. Upon reinstallation and restart of the flash gas compression system, expected in approximately three months, production is expected to return to or above nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. For the second quarter, we now forecast net production to average between 20,000 and 25,000 barrels of oil per day and our full year 2021 net production to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day. SBM Offshore has placed an order for an upgraded flash gas compression system, which is expected to be installed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Production optimization work is now planned in the fourth quarter which will further increase the Liza Destiny\u2019s production capacity. I think, it is important to note that the overall performance of the subsurface in Liza 1 has been outstanding. We have seen very strong reservoir and well performance that has met or exceeded our expectations. Once the flash gas compressor is replaced, we are confident that we will see a significant improvement in uptime reliability. At Liza Phase 2, the project is progressing to plan, with about 90% of the overall work completed, and first oil remains on track for early 2022. The Liza Unity FPSO, with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, is preparing to sail from the Keppel yard in Singapore to Guyana midyear. Our third development, Payara, is also progressing to plan, with about 38% of the overall work completed. The project will utilize the Liza Prosperity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. The FPSO hull is complete and topsides construction activities have commenced in Singapore. First oil remains on track for 2024. Front-end engineering and design work continues for the fourth development on the Stabroek Block at Yellowtail. The operator expects to submit a plan of development to the government of Guyana in the second half of this year. Pending government approval and project sanctioning, the Yellowtail project is expected to achieve first oil in 2025. The Stabroek Block exploration program for the remainder of the year will focus on both Campanian, Liza-type reservoirs and on the deeper Santonian reservoirs. In addition, key appraisal activities will be targeted in the southeast portion of the Stabroek Block to inform future developments. In terms of drilling activity, as announced yesterday, the Uaru-2 well successfully appraised the Uaru-1 discovery and also made an incremental discovery in deeper intervals. The well encountered approximately 120 feet of high quality, oil bearing sandstone reservoir and was drilled 6.8 miles from the discovery well, implying a potentially large areal extent. The Stena DrillMax is currently appraising the Longtail discovery. Additional appraisal is planned at Mako and in the Turbot area, which will help define our fifth and sixth developments on the block. The Stena Carron has commenced exploration drilling at the Koebi-1 well, and an exploration well at Whiptail is planned to spud in May. Further exploration and appraisal activities are planned for the second half of 2021 with a total of approximately 12 wells to be drilled this year. The Noble Tom Madden, the Noble Bob Douglas and the Noble Sam Croft, which recently joined the fleet, will be primarily focused on development drilling. Now, shifting back to production, companywide second quarter net production is forecast to average between 290,000 and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Full year 2021 net production is now also expected to average between 290,000 and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to our previous forecast of approximately 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This reduction reflects the following : Approximately 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to lower entitlements resulting from the increase in NGL strip prices, again, this will be accretive overall to earnings and cash flow; second factor is, approximately 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day related to the sale of our interests in Denmark and non-strategic acreage in North Dakota, for which we brought forward full value forward; the balance primarily reflects short term weather impacts in the Bakken, from which we expect to catch back up over the course of the year and again forecast a 2021 Bakken exit rate of between 170,000 and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In closing, our team once again demonstrated strong execution and delivery across our asset base under challenging conditions. Our distinctive capabilities and world class portfolio will enable us to deliver industry-leading performance and value to our shareholders for many years to come. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2020. We had net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to an adjusted net loss of $176 million, which excluded an after tax gain of $79 million from an asset sale in the fourth quarter of 2020. Turning to E&P. E&P had net income of $308 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to an adjusted net loss of $118 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the first quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2020 were as follows : Higher realized crude oil, NGL, and natural gas selling prices increased earnings by $192 million; Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $99 million; Lower DD&A expense increased earnings by $88 million; Lower cash costs increased earnings by $39 million; All other items increased earnings by $8 million, for an overall increase in first quarter earnings of $426 million. Excluding the two VLCC cargo sales, our E&P sales volumes were overlifted compared with production by approximately 300,000 barrels, which improved after-tax results by approximately $10 million. The sales from the two VLCC cargos increased net income by approximately $70 million in the quarter. The impact of higher NGL prices improved first quarter earnings by approximately $55 million and reduced Bakken NGL volumes received under percentage of proceeds or POP contracts by 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $75 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $62 million in the prior quarter. Midstream EBITDA, before non-controlling interests, amounted to $225 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $198 million in the previous quarter. In March, Hess received net proceeds of $70 million from the public offering of 3,450,000 Hess-owned Class A shares in Hess Midstream. Now, turning to our financial position. At quarter-end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.86 billion, and our total liquidity was $5.5 billion including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion. Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is now committed through May 2024, following the amendment executed earlier this month to extend the maturity date by one year. In the first quarter of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $815 million compared with $532 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher realized selling prices. In the first quarter, net cash provided from operating activities after changes in working capital was $591 million compared with $486 million in the prior quarter. The sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage in the Bakken for total consideration of $312 million is expected to close within the next few weeks and the sale of our interests in Denmark for total consideration of $150 million is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. Now, turning to guidance. Our E&P cash costs were $9.81 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya and $10.21 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya in the first quarter of 2021. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of maintenance and workover spend. Full year E&P cash costs are expected to be in the range of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is up from previous full year guidance of $10.50 to $11.50 per barrel of oil equivalent due to the impact of updated production guidance. DD&A expense was $11.83 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya and $12.36 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya in the first quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $11.50 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter and full year guidance of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent is unchanged. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $23.50 to $25.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter and $23 to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the second quarter and full year guidance of $170 million to $180 million is unchanged. The midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million for the second quarter and full year guidance of $1,090 million to $1,115 million is unchanged. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the second quarter and $105 million to $115 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $80 million to $90 million due to higher commodity prices. We expect non-cash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the second quarter and approximately $245 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $205 million, reflecting additional premiums paid to increase the strike price on our crude oil hedging contracts. In the second quarter, we expect to sell two 1 million barrel cargos from Guyana whereas we sold three 1 million barrel cargos in the first quarter and we expect to sell five 1 million barrel cargos over the second half of the year. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million in the second quarter and the full year guidance of approximately $1.9 billion remains unchanged.  For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million for the second quarter and the full year guidance of $280 million to $290 million remains unchanged. For Corporate. Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the second quarter and full year guidance of $130 million to $140 million is unchanged. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the second quarter and full year guidance of $380 million to $390 million is unchanged. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Congrats on a good quarter. John, you talked about accelerating returns back to shareholders when you get net debt-to-EBITDA sub 2 times. It seems like between Liza-2 and the forward curve, you\u2019re going to get there inside of one year. So, how do you think about what to do with the excess cash and the optimal allocation of that to shareholders? Greg Hill : Thanks, Neil. Yes. Now, we\u2019ve had a strong first quarter and we\u2019re seeing market conditions favorable for oil right now. It is still our plan, our strategy, as Phase 2 comes on, and it\u2019s a 220,000 barrel a day ship. So, we\u2019ll get -- our entitlement there will significantly drive our cash flow inflection for us next year. And therefore, our debt-to-EBITDA will begin to get under 2, as we take that excess cash flow, then we have and pay down the term loan. So, the first thing that we\u2019re going to do with excess cash flow is pay down the $1 billion term loan. Once we have that paid off and that increased EBITDA from Phase 2, we will be under 2 times debt-to-EBITDA for our balance sheet. And then, we\u2019ll be in that position to start increasing returns to shareholders. And, we\u2019ve been consistent about it. What the first thing we\u2019ll do is increase our dividend. We\u2019ll start to increase the dividends. And then, as our cash flow continues to grow, with Payara coming on and then Yellowtail, and as like we said, we expect now up to 10 FPSOs, we\u2019ll have a significant cash flow growth, we\u2019ll begin to do opportunistic share repurchases after the dividend increase. Neil Mehta : And the follow-up is just about the long-term value of the Guyana resource. So much has been said about long-term risk to oil demand. And I\u2019m just curious how do you think about the value of some of the projects and the FPSOs that come in post 2026 as electric vehicles start to accelerate and some of the competitive threats start to be there for traditional transportation demand. And does that change in any way the way you think about prosecuting this project, including the potential to monetize some of the acreage earlier in order to pull forward the value to mitigate some of the long-term demand risks. John Hess : Yes. Great question, Neil. Thank you. A couple of points we\u2019d like to make. Look, the world has two future challenges. One is how do we provide more energy supply, 20% more energy supply by 2040? And how do we get to net zero emissions by 2050? I think, the best resource to provide insights into these challenges is the world energy outlook of the International Energy Agency. And under their sustainable development scenario, which says that even if all the pledges of the Paris Climate Accord were met, oil and gas would still be 46% of the energy mix in 2040. So, it\u2019s not just about climate literacy, it\u2019s also about energy literacy. Oil and gas is still going to be needed 20 years out. The key to all of this, because none of us can call an oil price, there\u2019s always going to be volatility, and some of the pressures you\u2019re talking about obviously are going to be a factor in that, the key will be having a low-cost of supply. And we believe that we\u2019re uniquely positioned in that regard with a growing resource, a low cost of supply, that positions our Company with a differentiated portfolio of assets that we have, with a growing resource at low cost of supply, to deliver sustainable and industry-leading cash flow growth and financial returns for our shareholders. And when you talk about the longer term, I think it\u2019s important to realize that Guyana isn\u2019t as longer term. We\u2019re bringing it forward almost every year. First in 2022 with Liza-2, then in 2024 with Payara, then Yellowtail in 2025. The payouts are very quick and the returns are very high. So, we are going to be bringing value forward, and you can look at a cadence most likely of bringing on one of these low-cost developments about every year thereafter. So, we are bringing the value forward. And with low cost of supply, we think we\u2019re going to be uniquely positioned to provide sustainable and industry-leading cash flow growth. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan. Arun Jayaram : Greg, I was wondering if you could provide an update on the debottlenecking project at Liza Phase 1 and maybe discuss how the repair activities on the flash gas compressor impact the timing of that project. And also, I wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more color. You mentioned that SBM may be replacing the flash gas compressor. So, maybe a little bit more color around that. Greg Hill : Yes. Sure. So, let me take it in two pieces. So first, let\u2019s talk about the flash gas compressor. As John and I both mentioned in our opening remarks, we had a couple of days of downtime associated with that where production was curtailed for a couple of days. That flash gas compressor is now back in Houston, being torn down, looked at, with the expectation that it will be restored within the next three months, right? So, once that happens, then we\u2019ll get back to that 120,000 barrels a day plus. So, say that\u2019s July. Then, the next increment, as you mentioned, is the debottlenecking project, which now is going to occur in the fourth quarter. And that will take Liza Phase 1 up another incremental production. Now, they\u2019re still in final engineering phase of that. So, I can\u2019t give you an exact number as to what that\u2019s going to be. But that will come in the fourth quarter. Also, in the fourth quarter, Exxon is going to replace the existing flash gas compressor with some of the components that have been redesigned. So, that shutdown in the fourth quarter, about 14 days, will accomplish those two things. It will be the debottlenecking and also the installation of a new redesigned flash gas compressor for Phase 1. Arun Jayaram : Great. And my follow-up is perhaps for John Rielly. John, how does the improvement in oil prices impact yours and Exxon\u2019s thinking on the purchase versus lease decision on the FPSO from a timing perspective? John Rielly : Right now, Exxon is in discussions with SBM. They\u2019re having commercial discussions on the purchases of that. So, it is ongoing. The oil price itself doesn\u2019t really have a factor in there, but they\u2019re just -- they\u2019re going through these discussions. We expect to have that information later in the year, and we\u2019ll provide the guidance on the timing of the FPSO purchases when we get that information. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : So, Greg, Payara, 38% complete as at least on the hull SCM is telling us 12 to 14 months is the standard sort of topside installation for these standardized units, which would put you middle of next year for a completed FPSO. Can you walk me through how you get from the middle of 2022 to 2024 for first oil when the boats are ready middle of next year? Greg Hill : Well, I mean, Doug, as you know, Payara does have a very extensive drilling and SURF program. In particular, the SURF requires three open water seasons, if you will, to get all that subsea kit in. So look, Payara is going well. There is still contingency built into the project, which I think is prudent at this point, given that significant amount of SURF work that has to be done. But ExxonMobil is executing extremely well. Hopefully, Payara will come on earlier in 2024. But, we\u2019ll see, Doug. There\u2019s a lot of work left to do yet. Doug Leggate : Okay. We got to get an in-person dinner, Greg. I\u2019ll take a small bet with you that we see a [indiscernible] at some point. Okay. My follow-up is on the exit rate in the Bakken. How have you been able to lose 7,000, 8,000 barrels a day of NGLs in the POP contracts. But on the fourth quarter, you also guided to an exit rate of about 175 has been reasonable even with the second rig. So, can you just walk us through what\u2019s going better there to allow you to stick with the same guidance? I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Greg Hill : John, do you want to answer the POP contract question, John Rielly? John Rielly : Yes. Sure. So first, I can just start with the way the POP contracts work. The amount for the full year in our guidance, you saw that it\u2019s about a 7,000-barrel a day reduction from original guidance. Now, it\u2019s a little higher in the first, second and third and a little bit lower in the fourth. So, we\u2019re not hit with this high number on that POP in the fourth quarter. But yet, there is still impact on that. And originally, we were guiding at that 175. Now with the 170 to 175, that POP does have impact to it. And I\u2019ll start with Greg. But, the well performance is good. The wells that we\u2019re bringing on, we\u2019re seeing very good initial production. We\u2019re seeing better than expectations. Now, you got to remember, we had 12 on in the fourth quarter, only four in the first. We\u2019re just beginning now to pick up from the second rig, and that will really pick up in the third and fourth quarter. So, we see the performance from those wells will pick that up and give us that ability to get back to that exit rate of 170 to 175. Greg, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything you want to add. Greg Hill : No. I think you nailed it, John. Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : My first question is on Guyana. The latest well, the Uaru-2, you indicated it encountered newly identified intervals below the original discovery well. Can you provide just any color on the commerciality of those zones? And have you seen them elsewhere on the block? And do you plan to test them elsewhere this year? John Hess : Go ahead, Greg. Greg Hill : Yes. Thanks, Jeanine. So, again, Uaru-2 was a great result, right? We had high-quality oil sands, 120 feet. I think, the most significant part about Uaru was that it was 6.8 miles from Uaru-1, which demonstrates a very large areal extent for the Uaru reservoir itself. And as you said, we did discover a deeper zone. It\u2019s in the lower part of the Campanian. And that does have read-through to other parts of the block. But certainly, the reason we didn\u2019t call it the 19th discovery is in this particular location. It\u2019s clearly not as significant as the other 18, right? But, it does have some read-through to other parts of the block. John Hess : The key is that the appraisal is very encouraging results. You have excellent reservoir characteristics. You have high-quality oil. And given that Uaru-1 versus Uaru-2 is 6.8 miles away, it shows the potential for large aerial extent of a highly-prolific high-quality reservoir. Jeanine Wai : Okay. Got you. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. My second question is maybe just going back to the debottlenecking discussion and Arun\u2019s question. Liza 1 capacity going up in Q4, we\u2019ll find out what to level later. But in terms of future potential opportunities, are there debottlenecking opportunities built into the 220 nameplate capacities for the upcoming ships? It just seems like that\u2019s pretty standard for a lot of these major capital projects, including FPSOs. And at least when we do the math, if you do any kind of moderate debottlenecking, it really pulls forward a lot of NAV there. So, just wondering kind of the potential for that for the 220 ships. John Hess : Greg? Greg Hill : Yes. Jeanine, I think you could assume that there would be debottlenecking potential on all those ships. What typically happens is, you\u2019ll bring these facilities up to their nameplate. And then, you gather a lot of dynamic data and you really need that data. So, you need fluids running through the facility at full capacity to determine where are my pinch points, where are my bottlenecks, and what can I do to increase that capacity? And that\u2019s why you typically see these debottlenecking projects occur a year after that operating experience on the vessel, because the key piece of data that you have to have is the dynamic data of how is that vessel really operating under dynamic conditions, so. But, I think you can expect, every one of those will get debottlenecked above their nameplate in the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : I think, several questions. First, John, the net debt-to-EBITDA less than 2. And at $60 plus, that doesn\u2019t seem to be a very conservative number. I presume it\u2019s just a near term. So, what is the longer term expectation? I mean that the EBITDA changed a lot due to the commodity prices. John Rielly : Yes. You\u2019re right. I mean, let alone our EBITDA is going to change, one from commodity prices, and two, as each FPSO comes on in Guyana, obviously, our EBITDA is going to jump with each ship coming on line. So, for us, what we did was set that 2 as kind of a max. And once we got to that net debt-to-EBITDA being under 2, that\u2019s when we would start with the returns to shareholders. Now, we have no intention of increasing debt during that future time period, because now we\u2019ll be generating free cash flow. So, what we will have with each ship coming on is the EBITDA goes up, debt to EBITDA is going to drive down and is going to drive under 1. So look, we\u2019re going to have a very strong balance sheet and obviously be in a position beginning to increase dividends first, and then because of that free cash flow position, doing opportunistic share repurchases. Paul Cheng : Do you have a net debt target at all? John Rielly : So, really short term, as we said, it is that 2 times. And then after that, it\u2019s just going to be a function of our free cash flow driving it. So quite frankly, I\u2019d love to have that, keep it underneath 1. And we have the portfolio to do it. We\u2019re just unique. Each FPSO coming on, I mean, I\u2019ll let you put your own Brent assumptions in there, but for the amount of production that we get all Brent-based production, we\u2019re just going to have significant EBITDA growth. And therefore, that\u2019s going to put our balance sheet in a very strong position. And so, we\u2019d like to keep that debt-to-EBITDA very low from that standpoint. And what we do with that excess cash, as John said earlier, is we\u2019ll return it to shareholders through dividend increases and share buybacks. Paul Cheng : John, the first quarter working capital was a big use of cash. And in the second quarter, any kind of guidance that you can provide? John Rielly : So, let me just do the first quarter first, and I\u2019m going to give the normal recurring. And there were two nonrecurring things that offset each other. So, the basic driver of the $220 million draw was an increase in receivables of $150 million, which we\u2019re happy to have. Obviously, oil prices going up. So, our receivables went up from that standpoint. And then, we did have -- you saw the lower cash cost, the lower capital numbers. So, we did have a reduction in payables of $70 million. So, that $150 million and $70 million was the draw in working capital. We did have two nonrecurring items. One was the -- as we increased the strike prices on our hedges, so we had premiums paid there, but we also had the reduction in inventory from our VLCC sales. So, they net against each other. So, as you move into the second quarter with receivables that should balance out now with the prices, now if prices continue to go up, you\u2019ll still see that potential increase in receivables. And then, we should be building, as we mentioned in our guidance, on capital. So, I would expect the payables to be, let\u2019s just call, flat. So, not forecasting a draw per se in the second quarter. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you. Greg, if I could have a quick question on Bakken. I think, in the past that the expectation is that you will get to about 200,000 barrels per day and sort of total that for a number of years. So, is that still the medium-term objective for Bakken? And then, finally, on Liza, on the debottleneck. Can you tell us where\u2019s the critical path or that what is the unit that in the Liza 1 you debottleneck allow you to get a higher production capacity from that ship? Greg Hill : So, let me take the second one first. So again, Paul, the engineering is still underway on Liza Phase 1 optimization project or debottlenecking. There\u2019s nothing remarkable on it. It\u2019s piping changes, et cetera, just to eliminate, reduce the friction basically flowing through the facility on the top sides. So, we can give more color as the engineering of that project gets done. Now, regarding the Bakken, again, the primary role of the Bakken in our portfolio is to be a cash engine. And so, as such, the decision to add any rigs in the Bakken is going to be driven by corporate returns and corporate cash flow needs. Now, if prices remain strong in the second half of this year, we\u2019re considering the addition of a third rig in the fourth quarter of 2021. And then, as you indicated, our medium-term or long-term objective, again going to be driven by returns and driven by corporate cash flow, would be to get the Bakken back to 200,000 barrels a day. That would probably require a fourth rig. And by doing so, at $60 WTI, the Bakken would be $1 billion a year free cash flow generator at 200,000 barrels a day. The other nice thing about the 200,000 barrels a day is it optimizes efficient use of the infrastructure that we have built up there. So, it\u2019s sort of the ultimate sweet spot for the Bakken. But again, whether we add that fourth rig or the third rig is going to be driven by returns and corporate cash flow needs, because the role of the Bakken is to be a cash engine. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy. Ryan Todd : Maybe a quick one on Guyana. As you think about your drilling program over the rest of the year and maybe into the first half of next year, what are the key issues that you\u2019re looking to address or the key questions that you\u2019re looking to answer over the next 6 to 12 months? John Hess : Greg? Greg Hill : Sure, Ryan. So, there\u2019s really three objectives of the exploration appraisal program this year with the three drilling rigs. The first one is to appraise existing discoveries, and that\u2019s really to underpin the fifth and the sixth ship in Guyana. So, Uaru was first cab off the rank, if you will; Longtail\u2019s next; Turbot will be after that. We\u2019ll also do Mako as well. So, we want to get those understood with appraisal wells and some DSTs to really inform where ship 5 and where ship 6 is going to go since Yellowtail is number 4. The second objective is to continue to explore the Campanian, to really fill out that patchwork quilt of prospectivity, if you will, between Turbot and Liza. And you\u2019ll see in our investor pack, there was a number of polygons there that we\u2019d like to get drilled this year as well. And then, the third objective was -- is, can we get some deeper penetrations in the Santonian. Certainly, the Santonian has the potential to be a very large addition to the recoverable resources in Guyana. And I\u2019ll remind everyone, we\u2019ve had four penetrations, coupled with Apache\u2019s results, we see that as very positive. But, we\u2019ve got a lot more drilling to do to understand it. And that is another key objective this year, to get some more penetrations in that so we can begin to piece the puzzle together on the Santonian. Ryan Todd : Thanks, Greg. That was really helpful. And maybe, John, one for you on a higher level issue. As we -- Hess has always been active on the ESG-related front, including efforts, as you talked about earlier to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions. I guess, as you step back and consider the ongoing energy transition and look a little further down the line, are there other roles in which you think Hess may be able to participate, or is the best use of your time and capital are really just going to be bringing on low cost of supply barrels? John Hess : Yes. No, our strategy remains to be focused on growing our resource. The oil resource is going to be needed in the next 20 years. Key is having a low cost of supply. And putting ourselves in a position to generate sustainable and industry-leading cash flow growth. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to make -- maximize returns and value for our shareholders. Having said that, climate change is real, the greatest scientific challenge of the 21st century. I\u2019d recommend everybody to read Bill Gates\u2019 book, how do we avoid a climate disaster, because it really talks about the technological challenges ahead of us, the innovation needed. There are no easy answers. The energy transition is going to take a long time, costs a lot of money and need technological breakthroughs to be able to provide more energy to the world, as I talked about before, but also get on a track to net zero emissions, greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. And one way that we are going to lead in that and be part of that is obviously get our own carbon footprint down for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. The targets that we\u2019ve set for 2025 actually get us on a trajectory better and superior to the OGCI or the oil industry standards that have been set, number one. And number two, we are looking at groundbreaking research, and we think nature offers that opportunity to really make a difference and the work we\u2019re doing at Salk Institute, we\u2019re very enthusiastic about where most people don\u2019t realize, but there\u2019s more carbon in the soil than there is in the atmosphere. And if we can figure out by supporting the great research at the Salk Institute to capture and store carbon in the soil at a much higher rate and a much higher density than currently is being done, that could be a potential game changer and contribute to getting us to net zero carbon emissions. So, we\u2019re trying to play our role, but the first, second and third priority is to maximize value for our shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. David Deckelbaum : I just wanted to just follow up on some of the Bakken conversations. You had a really attractive disposition earlier in the quarter. I think some of the ideology behind that was -- the production wasn\u2019t hooked up to some of the Hess Midstream. Are there still remaining assets out there that fit similar profiles that would be amenable to pruning right now? John Hess : No. The majority of our inventory, very high-return locations, really underpinning, if you assumed a four-rig program, a 15-year drilling inventory. That\u2019s intact. This is the southern most part that, quite frankly, the returns there weren\u2019t as attractive as our current inventory. It wasn\u2019t accretive and strategic to Hess Midstream. So, I would say that was more of a one-off unique opportunity where we brought value forward. The rest of our acreage, we\u2019re very excited to have. And again, as Greg said before, the key role of the Bakken is to generate cash flow and free cash flow for the Company. And we\u2019re going to be guided by returns in terms of what our rig program is. David Deckelbaum : I appreciate that. And just a follow-up for me is just, you talked earlier about sort of the optimal level of Bakken production and really how it becomes like a cash cow now, and that\u2019s really its role in the portfolio. How do you think about the Gulf of Mexico along the same vein as it relates to sort of maintaining volumes? Are there attractive exploration targets there or tiebacks that you\u2019re looking at beyond \u201821 that sort of make sense here, or how does the gum fit in right now? John Hess : Yes. Greg, I think it would be great if you would just talk about the role that the deepwater Gulf plays in terms of being a cash engine as well, but it does have some growth opportunities. Greg Hill : Absolutely. So, the Gulf of Mexico is like the Bakken, remains an important cash engine and a platform for higher return opportunities for Hess. So, our minimum objective is to hold it flat. And we have an inventory of tieback opportunities that we believe we can hold it flat in the short term, three to four years probably, once we get back to work with some of the tieback opportunities. First, these high-return opportunities, Llano-6, which we\u2019re currently evaluating with Shell, and if we sanction that, it could quickly add production, with expected first oil four months from the spud. And then, we also have a large number of exploration blocks. So, during the downturn, as you recall, when everybody was focused on the Permian, we stayed focused on the offshore, and we acquired 60 new leases in the Gulf, existing leases, so they won\u2019t be affected by the Biden moratorium potentially on new leases. And in that, we see some very good hub class opportunities as well, both in the Miocene and the emerging Cretaceous per foot [ph] play. So, we\u2019d like to get back to work on a hub class opportunity. The first one is likely going to be a well called Heron, [ph] which is a very large Miocene opportunity. So, we\u2019ve got the inventory to, as a minimum, hold it flat and then potentially even grow it. But like the Bakken, investment in the Gulf of Mexico is going to be a function of returns and cash flow needs of the corporation. But, we certainly got the inventory to do it and would like to get back to work as soon as we can. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Just two things, I guess, to follow up on kind of on the smaller side of things, at least the first one. But, as you talked about the improvement in CapEx per well in the Bakken, I was just curious over the \u201819, \u201820, \u201821 period, is that truly apples-to-apples with the wells? In other words, kind of similar completion methods and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of production per well? In other words, is there an efficiency above and beyond what you\u2019re seeing on the CapEx side? And then, my other question was going to be on NOLs and the possibility of a changed tax rate, how you think about that affecting utilization of those over time? John Hess : Yes. Greg, first and then John. Greg Hill : Yes, sure. So, on the Bakken, no, those wells -- let\u2019s say, the last three years, we\u2019ve been drilling the same types of wells really for the past three years. So, there\u2019s no differences in, say, like shorter laterals or anything like that, so that the trajectory of well costs coming down is purely lean manufacturing and technology gains along the way. And so, the wells that we are drilling this year have been the same. They\u2019ve been 1.2 million barrel recoverable IP 180s of about 120, which was the same as last year. And I think importantly, IRRs averaging nearly 90% at current oil prices. So, again, a great inventory. Got a lot of confidence on my team, just as we showed with plug and perf or sliding sleeve, we\u2019re doing the same with plug and perf. Through lean manufacturing and technology, we just continue to drive those well costs down and improve productivity as well. John Rielly : Then Roger, on the tax policy. So, it\u2019s a little early for me to be able to comment on them because what -- from what\u2019s been released, there\u2019s more headlines and there\u2019s just not that much detail on these areas. Now, to your point, we do have a significant net operating loss carryforward, which will mitigate the effects of increased tax rates or changes in depreciation method. So, we\u2019ll just have to wait for more detail. Operator : Our next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : I had a question, as you return to the southeast part of the block and explore, sounds like the targets are going to be those deeper penetrations in the Santonian. Can you talk about, one, is there a double opportunity there? Are there still ways to drill wells to hit Campanian plus Santonian? And maybe a broader question about the future of exploration. Are there big perhaps riskier prospects that you could target in future years that could be somewhat game changers that could move up the queue in terms of the development plan? John Hess : Yes. Thanks, Bob. Greg? Greg Hill : Yes. So, Bob, look, no, the Santonian really underlies the entire Liza complex. So, I don\u2019t want to imply that that the southeast portion of the block is the best area for the Santonian. It really underlies all of the Campanian. Now, having said that, we need more penetrations to understand it. And we\u2019ll get a number of penetrations this year through both ways that you suggested. One is through deepening deeper tails on Campanian exploration wells, but also some standalone Santonian penetrations as well. So, we\u2019ll get a good sense, with the four that we have under our belt, coupled with Apache\u2019s results, we\u2019re pretty excited about the Santonian. But, we\u2019ve just got more drilling to do. But again, the areal extent of the Santonian reservoir system is as big or bigger than the Liza complex. So, they\u2019re -- I wouldn\u2019t pick any area as being particularly the sweet spot yet. John Hess : Yes. And Bob, to your other point, we still see significant exploration prospectivity on this block as we drill more and get more seismic definition on drilling opportunities. Some of it\u2019s going to be Campanian, some of it\u2019s going to be Santonian, some of it\u2019s going to be further out. Obviously, we have this aggressive and active program this year, there\u2019s more to come. And our partner, ExxonMobil, I think, in their investor day, made it pretty clear that there\u2019s potential to double the discovered resource on the block, and we would stand by that in terms of the exploration upside that still remains. Operator : Our next question comes from Vin Lovaglio with Mizuho. Vin Lovaglio : First one on cash return. Different operators have kind of laid out different strategies I think based on business mix, but mainly centered around percentage of operating cash flow or percentage of excess cash flow generated back to shareholders. You guys are in a unique spot with Guyana. Just wondering if the asset kind of pushes you in one direction or the other as far as percentage of operating cash flow, a percentage of free cash flow back to shareholders or maybe something entirely different. Thanks. John Hess : Yes. Those formulas are mainly for shale producers, that\u2019s more an assembly line of cash flow generation. We have sustainable and industry-leading cash flow growth. So percentages I don\u2019t think are as relevant to us. But what we\u2019ve been very clear on, as we generate free cash, as John Rielly said, the first priority is to pay down the term loan. And then after that, the majority of our free cash flow will go back as cash returns to shareholders first, increasing the dividend and then opportunistic share repurchases. So, the word majority is the keyword there. Vin Lovaglio : Great. Thanks. And maybe just to Guyana quickly. You had outlined basically a one FPSO per year, kind of starting with Payara in 2024. In the release, you did mention at least six FPSOs by 2027. I\u2019m maybe reading a little bit too deep into it here. But, just wondering if there\u2019s any hurdles, factors or variables that we should be considering or that you guys are considering that could potentially accelerate the FPSO deployment schedule longer term? John Hess : Yes. Look, our exploration appraisal program this year is to really help define what the fifth ship will be and potentially the sixth ship in terms of development. And I think the cadence of about 1 ship a year is the one we\u2019re aiming at in terms of design one, build many, being capital disciplined, bringing value forward. ExxonMobil, as Greg said before, is doing an outstanding job of project management on building these ships and bringing them into theater. Obviously debugging Liza 1, but we\u2019ll benefit for Liza 2 in terms of that. And it\u2019s basically this cadence of about one ship a year and the exploration appraisal program is to give definition to those future developments. Operator : Our next question comes from Monroe Helm with Barrow Hanley. Monroe Helm : Thank you very much for getting me in the queue. Congratulations on continuing to execute on your game plan, which is differentiated asset base and the market is starting to recognize it. Really had my questions kind of follow-on to the questions on the Santonian. Greg, can you be more specific about which well -- any of the wells that you\u2019ve identified to drill in the first half of the year targeting the Santonian kind of as well along that line is whether or not what the long-held sidetracks about. Greg Hill : Yes. So, there will be -- Monroe, certainly in the early first part of the year, first half of the year, Longtail-3 will have a tail on it. That will dip down into the Santonian, and Whiptail will as well. So, recall Whiptail is kind of the next Campanian on exploration prospect in the queue right after Koebi. So, both of those will have Santonian tails on them. And then, there will be other ones in the second half of the year. We\u2019re still trying to define the exact drilling order in the second half of the year. But, those are to be the first -- the next two. Monroe Helm : And I think you said that there will be specific Santonian test. Is that correct? Greg Hill : There will be, yes, at least one, that will be aimed at the Santonian itself. Monroe Helm : My second question is, Exxon says that there\u2019s -- double the reserves for the exploration program. Does that include Santonian? John Hess : Yes. Monroe Helm : Okay. Thank you very much. John Hess : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day. John Hess : Thank you.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Liz. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. On the line with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. In case of any audio issues, we will be posting transcripts of each speakers prepared remarks on www.hess.com following the presentation. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Good morning everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy and our longstanding commitment to sustainability. Greg Hill will then discuss our operations, and John Rielly will cover our financial results. Our strategy is to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustained cash flow growth. Executing this strategy has positioned our company to deliver industry leading cash flow growth over the next decade and has made our portfolio increasingly resilient in a low oil price environment. Our strategy aligns with the world\u2019s growing need for affordable, reliable and cleaner energy that is necessary for human prosperity and global economic development. We recognize that climate change is the greatest scientific challenge of the 21st century and support the aim of the Paris Agreement and a global ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The world faces a dual challenge of needing 20% more energy by 2040 and reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. In the International Energy Agency\u2019s rigorous Sustainable Development Scenario, which assumes that all pledges of the Paris Agreement are met, oil and gas will be 46% of the energy mix in 2040 compared with approximately 53% today. In the IEA\u2019s newest Net Zero Scenario, oil and gas will still be 29% of the energy mix in 2040. In either scenario, oil and gas will be needed for decades to come and will require significantly more global investment over the next 10 years on an annual basis than the $300 billion spent last year. The key for our company is to have a low cost of supply. By investing only in high return, low cost opportunities; the best rocks for the best returns; we have built a differentiated and focused portfolio that is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets. Guyana is our growth engine and the Bakken, Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are our cash engines. Guyana is positioned to become a significant cash engine in the coming years as multiple phases of low cost oil developments come online, which we expect will drive our portfolio breakeven Brent oil price below $40 per barrel by the middle of the decade. Based on the most recent third-party estimates, our cash flow is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2023, which is 75% above our peers and puts us in the top 5% of the S&P 500. With a line of sight for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources in Guyana, this industry leading cash flow growth rate is expected to continue through the end of the decade. Investors want durability and growth in cash flow, we have both. We are pleased to announce today that in July, we paid down $500 million of our $1 billion term loan maturing in March 2023. Depending upon market conditions, we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022. This debt reduction combined with the start up of Liza Phase 2 early next year is expected to drive our debt to EBITDAX ratio under 2 next year. Once this debt is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we plan to return the majority to our shareholders -- first through dividend increases and then opportunistic share repurchases. In addition, we announced this morning that Hess Midstream will buy back $750 million of its Class B units from its sponsors, Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners, to be completed in the third quarter. We expect to receive approximately $375 million in proceeds and our ownership in Hess Midstream on a consolidated basis will be approximately 45%, compared with 46% prior to the transaction. On April 30th, we completed the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek non-strategic acreage interests in the Bakken for a total consideration of $312 million, effective March 1, 2021. This acreage, most of which we were not planning to drill before 2026 was located in the southernmost portion of our Bakken position and was not connected to Hess Midstream infrastructure. The midstream transaction and the sale of the Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage bring material value forward and further strengthen our cash and liquidity position. The Bakken remains a core part of our portfolio and our largest operated asset. We have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI. In February, when WTI oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, we added a second rig. Given the continued strength in oil prices, we are now planning to add a third rig in the Bakken in September, which is expected to strengthen free cash flow generation in the years ahead. Key to our long-term strategy is Guyana, with its low cost of supply and industry leading financial returns. We have an active exploration and appraisal program this year on the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator. We see the potential for at least six FPSOs on the block by 2027 and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. And we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. Earlier today, we announced a significant new oil discovery at Whiptail. The Whiptail-1 well encountered 246 feet of net pay and the Whiptail-2 well, which is located 3 miles northeast of Whiptail-1, encountered 167 feet of net 3 pay in high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoirs. Drilling continues at both wells to test deeper targets. The Whiptail discovery could form the basis for a future oil development in the southeast area of Stabroek Block and will add to the previous recoverable resource estimate of approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In June, we also announced a discovery at the Longtail-3 well, which encountered approximately 230 feet of net pay including newly identified, high quality hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs below the original Longtail-1 discovery intervals. In addition, the successful Mako-2 well together with the Uaru-2 well which encountered approximately 120 feet of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir will potentially underpin a fifth oil development in the area east of the Liza complex. In terms of Guyana developments, the Liza Unity FPSO, with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, is expected to sail from Singapore to Guyana in late August and the Liza-2 development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022. Our third oil development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara Field is expected to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day. Engineering work for a fourth development on the Stabroek Block at Yellowtail is underway with preliminary plans for gross capacity in the range of 220,000 to 250,000 barrels of oil per day and anticipated startup in 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning. Our three sanctioned oil developments have a Brent breakeven oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. And according to a recent data from Wood Mackenzie -- our Guyana developments are the highest margin, lowest carbon intensity oil and gas assets globally. Last week, we announced publication of our 24th annual sustainability report, which details our environmental, social and governance or ESG strategy and performance. In 2020, we significantly surpassed our five-year emissions reduction targets reducing Scope 1 and 2 operated greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 46% and flaring intensity by 59%, compared to 2014 levels. Our five-year operated emissions reduction targets for 2025, which are detailed in the sustainability report, exceed the 22% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 in the International Energy Agency\u2019s Sustainable Development Scenario, which is consistent with the Paris Agreement\u2019s ambition to hold the rise in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C. We are also contributing to groundbreaking research being done by the Salk Institute to develop plants with larger root systems that are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere. We continue to be recognized as an industry leader for the quality of our ESG performance and disclosure. In May, Hess was named to the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the 14th consecutive year based up on an independent assessment by ISS-ESG and we were the only oil and gas company to earn a place on the 2021 list. In summary, oil and gas are going to be needed for decades to come. By continuing to successfully execute our strategy and achieve strong operational performance, our company is uniquely positioned to deliver industry leading cash flow growth over the next decade. As our term loan is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, the majority will be returned to our shareholders, first through dividend increases and then opportunistic share repurchases. I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. In the second quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance. Companywide net production averaged 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, above our guidance of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day driven by good performance across the portfolio. In the third quarter, we expect companywide net production to average approximately 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which reflects the Tioga gas plant turnaround in the Bakken and planned maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. For full year 2021, we now forecast net production to average approximately 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, compared to our previous forecast of between 290,000 and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, so we are now forecasting at the top of the range. Turning to the Bakken, second quarter net production averaged 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was above our guidance of approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily reflecting increased gas capture which has allowed us to drive flaring to under 5%, well below the state\u2019s 9% limit. For the third quarter, we expect Bakken net production to average approximately 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which reflects the planned 45-day maintenance turnaround and expansion tie-in at the Tioga Gas Plant. For the full year 2021, we maintain our Bakken net production forecast of 155,000 to 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the second quarter, we drilled 17 wells and brought 9 new wells online. In the third quarter, we expect to drill approximately 15 wells and to bring approximately 20 new wells online, and for the full year 2021, we now expect to drill approximately 65 wells and to bring approximately 50 new wells online. In terms of drilling and completion costs, although we have experienced some cost inflation, we are confident that we can offset the increases through technology and Lean Manufacturing efficiency gains and are therefore maintaining our full-year average forecast of $5.8 million per well in 2021. We have been operating two rigs since February but given the improvement in oil prices and our robust inventory of high return drilling locations, we plan to add a third rig in September. Moving to a three rig program will allow us to grow cash flow and production, better optimize our in-basin infrastructure and drive further reductions in our unit cash costs. Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, second quarter net production averaged 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to our guidance of approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the third quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average between 35,000 and 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime as well as some hurricane contingency. For the full year 2021, our forecast for Gulf of Mexico net production remains approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Southeast Asia, net production in the second quarter were 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, above our guidance of approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Third quarter net production is forecast to average between 50,000 and 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance at North Malay Basin and the JDA as well as Phase 3 installation work at North Malay Basin. Full year 2021 net production is forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now turning to Guyana. In the second quarter, gross production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 101 thousand barrels of oil per day or 26,000 barrels of oil per day, net to Hess. The repaired flash gas compression system has been installed on the Liza Destiny FPSO and is under test. The Operator is evaluating test data to optimize performance and is safely managing production in the range of 120,000 to 125,000 barrels of oil per day. Replacement of the flash gas compression system with a modified design and production optimization work are planned for the fourth quarter which will result in higher production capacity and reliability. Net production from Liza Phase 1 is forecast to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter and for the full year 2021. The Liza Phase 2 development will utilize the 220,000 barrels of oil per day Unity FPSO, which is scheduled to sail away from Singapore at the end of August and first oil remains on track for early 2022. Turning to our third development at Payara, the Prosperity FPSO hull is complete and will enter the Keppel Yard in Singapore following the sail away of the Liza Unity. Topsides fabrication has commenced at Dyna-Mac and development drilling began in June. The overall project is approximately 45% completed. The Prosperity will have a gross production capacity of 220 thousand barrels of oil per day and is on track to achieve first oil in 2024. As for our fourth development at Yellowtail, the joint venture anticipates submitting the plan of development to the Government of Guyana in the fourth quarter, with first oil targeted for 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning. During the second quarter, the Mako-2 appraisal well on the Stabroek Block confirmed the quality, thickness and areal extent of the reservoir. When integrated with the previously announced discovery at Uaru-2, the data supports a potential fifth development in the area east of the Liza complex. As John mentioned, this morning we announced a discovery at Whiptail, located approximately 4 miles southeast of Uaru-1. Drilling continues at both wells to test deeper targets. In terms of other drilling activity in the second half of 2021, after Whiptail-2, the Noble Don Taylor will drill the Pinktail-1 exploration well, which is located 5 miles southeast of Yellowtail-1, followed by the Tripletail2 appraisal well, located 5 miles south of Tripletail-1. The Noble Tom Madden will spud the Cataback-1 exploration well, located 4.5 miles southeast of the Turbot-1 discovery, in early August. Then in the fourth quarter, we will drill our first dedicated test of the deep potential at the Fangtooth prospect, located 9 miles northwest of Liza-1. In the third quarter, the Noble Sam Croft will drill the Turbot-2 appraisal well, then transition to development drilling operations for the remainder of the year. The Stena Carron will conduct a series of appraisal drill stem tests at Uaru-1, then Mako-2 and then Longtail-2. In closing, we continue to deliver strong operational performance across our portfolio. Our offshore assets are generating strong free cash flow. The Bakken is on a capital efficient growth trajectory and Guyana keeps getting bigger and better, all of which positions us to deliver industry leading returns, material free cash flow generation and significant shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income was $74 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of 252 million in the first quarter of 2021. Turning to E&P. E&P adjusted net income was $122 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of 308 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after tax components of adjusted E&P results between the second quarter and first quarter of 2021 were as follows; lower sales volumes reduced earnings by $126 million, higher cash costs reduced earnings by $48 million, higher exploration expenses reduced earnings by $10 million all other items reduced earnings by $2 million for an overall decrease in second quarter earnings of $186 million. Second quarter sales volumes were lower primarily due to Guyana having two one-million barrel liftings of oil compared with three one-million barrel liftings in the first quarter and first quarter sales volumes included non-recurring sales of two VLCC cargos totaling 4.2 million barrels of Bakken crude oil which contributed approximately $70 million of net income. In the second quarter, our E&P sales volumes were underlifted compared with production by approximately 785,000 barrels, which reduced our after-tax results by approximately $18 million. Cash costs for the second quarter came in at the lower end of guidance and reflect higher planned maintenance and workover activity than the first quarter. In June 2021, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the bankruptcy plan for Fieldwood Energy which includes transferring abandonment obligations of Fieldwood to predecessors in title of certain of its assets, who are jointly and severally liable for the obligations. As a result of the bankruptcy, Hess as one of the predecessors in title in seven shallow water West Delta 79/86 leases held by Fieldwood is responsible for the abandonment of the facilities on the leases. Second quarter E&P results include an after-tax charge of $147 million representing the estimated gross abandonment obligation for West Delta 79/86 without taking into account potential recoveries from other previous owners. Within the next nine months, we expect to receive an order from the regulator requiring us, along with other predecessors in title, to decommission the facilities. The timing of these decommissioning activities will be discussed and agreed upon with the regulator and we anticipate the costs will be incurred over the next several years. Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $76 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $75 million in the prior quarter. Midstream EBITDA, before noncontrolling interests, amounted to $229 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $225 million in the previous quarter. Now turning to our financial Position, at quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.42 billion, which includes receipt of net proceeds of $297 million from the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage in the Bakken. Total liquidity was $6.1 billion including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion. Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is committed through May 2024 and we have no material near-term debt maturities aside from the $1.0 billion term loan which matures in March 2023. In July, we repaid $500 million of the term loan. Earlier today, Hess Midstream announced an agreement to repurchase approximately 31 million Class B units of Hess Midstream held by GIP and us for approximately $750 million. We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $375 million from the sale in the third quarter. In addition, we expect to receive proceeds in the third quarter from the sale of our interests in Denmark for total consideration of $150 million with an effective date of January 1, 2021. In the second quarter of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $659 million compared with $815 million in the first quarter primarily due to lower sales volumes. In the second quarter, net cash provided by operating activities after changes in working capital was $785 million compared with $591 million in the first quarter. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the second quarter of 2021 increased cash flow from operating activities by $126 million primarily driven by an increase in payables that we expect to reverse in the third quarter. Now turning to guidance. First for E&P, our E&P cash costs were $11.63 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya and $12.16 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya in the second quarter of 2021. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $13.00 to $14.00 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter, which reflects the impact of lower production volumes resulting from the Tioga gas plant turnaround. Full year cash costs guidance of $11.00 to $12.00 per barrel of oil equivalent remains unchanged. DD&A expense was $11.55 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya and $12.13 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya in the second quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $12.00 to $13.00 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and full year guidance of $12.00 to $13.00 per barrel of oil equivalent remains unchanged. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $25.00 to $27.00 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $23.00 to $25.00 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the third quarter and full year guidance is expected to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million, which is down from previous guidance of $170 million to $180 million. The midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is projected to be in the range of $1,080 million to $1,100 million, which is down from the previous guidance of $1,090 million to $1,115 million. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million, which is updated from the previous guidance of $105 million to $115 million reflecting higher commodity prices. We expect non-cash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of approximately $245 million remains unchanged. During the third quarter, we expect to sell three one-million barrel cargos of oil from Guyana. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $575 million in the third quarter. Full year guidance, which now includes increasing drilling rigs in the Bakken to three from two in September, remains unchanged from prior guidance at approximately $1.9 billion. Turning to midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is projected to be in the range of $275 million to $285 million, which is down from the previous guidance of $280 million to $290 million. Turning to Corporate, Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of $130 million to $140 million remains unchanged. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the third quarter and approximately $380 million for the full year, which is at the lower end of our previous guidance of $380 million to $390 million, reflecting the $500 million reduction in the term loan. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe starting off on Whiptail. Congratulations on the great results of both Whiptail-1 and 2. How do you think -- maybe it's a little early to say but how do you think about ultimate potential resource size reservoir and oil quality? And how it maybe stacks up against other future resource to be developed and where it can land in the queue? John Hess : Yes, it's a great question, Ryan, and thank you. Look, Whiptail drilling activities are still underway. We're going to be drilling in both wells to some deeper targets, Whiptail adds to our queue of high value potential oil developments in Guyana, Uaru and Mako, as Greg talked about, have the potential to be our fifth FPSO. Whiptail has a potential to be another oil development. And since evaluations work is still going underway, it's a little premature to talk about resource size. But definitely what we're seeing is a foundation for potentially another oil development with Whiptail. And then to remind everybody, we still have a very active exploration appraisal program on the Stabroek Block, the remainder of this year, which should provide even more definition for future development investment opportunities. So the queue of high value potential oil developments is growing. And we're going to optimize it as we continue to get more data and well results to further get clarity on what the queue will be. Greg Hill : And Ryan, the quality of the reservoirs in Whiptail are outstanding. Ryan Todd : All right, thanks. Thanks, John and Greg. Maybe a follow up on CapEx, prior guidance for 2021 Balkan CapEx is $450 million. Is that still the same with the addition of a third rig in September? Or was the possibility of a third rig already built in there? And you've been running low on CapEx, obviously in the first half of the year, but activities accelerated in the second half. Is there a potential for maybe downward pressure on CapEx on a full year basis? Or is the kind of the trend upward in the second half likely to or I guess things trending line with where you would have expected? John Rielly : Yes. So from the Bakken standpoint, no, we did not have third rig in our initial guidance of the 450 million for the year. So that third rig is adding to the Bakken capital, so we'll go up from that 450. But like you've been saying we have been running under for the first half and where it is primarily right now, we're under spending in Ghana. So that pretty much the add from September to December for the one rig in the Bakken is being offset by a little lower spend in Ghana. As for the 1.9 billion we do as you said expect the ramp up it's normal for us in the Bakken. When you get into the summer season building infrastructure pads, things like that. So we do get a pickup on capital there. Same thing for our work in Southeast Asia is more ramping up, Greg mentioned the phase three installation that\u2019s going on. So I do expect to be spending right around that 1.9 billion, and we'll get that pickup. But again, we have been a little bit lower. And that's why we can add that Bakken rig and stay at 1.9 billion. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Yes. Good morning. My first question is on Liza Phase 2. I know the design is 220 KBD. But I was wondering if the Hess Exxon consortium is applying some of the learnings from the Liza Phase 1 debottlenecking project on this ship and where could initial predictive capacity be? As well as I wanted to get your timeline to maybe a first oil if the boat is sailing from Singapore at the end of August? John Hess : Thanks, Arun. Greg? Greg Hill : Yes, sure, Arun. So we are on track for first oil in early 2022. So no change that first oil date that we talked about before. In regards to debottlenecking, look, my experience with these FPSOs is yes, there will be some additional capacity that can be wrung out of the vessel. The sequence is important, though. So the first thing you do is, you get it out there, spin it out, run it at full operating conditions, then and only then after you get that dynamic data, can you understand where your potential pinch points are or bottlenecks are. And so that's why typically, these optimization projects don't come until I'll say, the first year of operation. But I think, 15% to 20% is not a typical, it will vary boat by boat, depending on the dynamic conditions. But I would think that you could get some additional upside from Phase 2 and Phase 3 and beyond. Arun Jayaram : Great. My follow up is for John Hess. John, I wanted to see if you could help us think about the order of operations here regarding additional cash return to shareholders and maybe outline, paying off the term loan, maybe the timing of step two of the strip holds and when we could see it in the board kind of move on the dividend. John Hess : Yes. Look once we pay the $500 million off, which we're intending to do a next year from the term loan, thereafter, as a function of oil price, and we get visibility on free cash flow generation, the next priority is going to be returning the majority of that free cash flow to our shareholders, and the first priority, and that will be to increase our base dividend. So this is something we've talked about with our board. We're very watchful about it, but we got to take it a step at a time. But that will be the sequence of events pay the other $500 million off, we're estimating to do that next year, depending upon market conditions. And then once after that, once we start have visibility on free cash flow and market conditions for oil and the financial markets are supportive. The next step will be strengthening our base dividends. Operator : Your next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. David Deckelbaum : I just wanted to just touch on the Bakken again, with the addition of the third rig, could you perhaps revisit guidance for where an exit rate should be at the end of this year? And then, should we be thinking about the addition of a fourth rig? I just wanted that in the context of what the current in house view is of the truly optimized program there in terms of activity. John Hess : John, you want to take the exit rate and then Greg, any color you'd like to provide as well. John Rielly : Sure. So from the Bakken exit rate standpoint, the addition of the third rig when we're starting in September really is not going to add any wells in for production this year. And what we had said in the prior quarter was that we were exiting somewhere at the 170 to 175 type level as we ended the year. Now what we are seeing is higher propane prices than we saw back in April. So which we like right that -- what we see from the NGL price is actually increase our cash flow in that third quarter, maybe $35 million to $40 million based on these higher propane prices. But with those higher propane prices, if you remember, that means we get less volumes under our percentage of proceeds contracts or our pop contracts. So right now based on what we're seeing on the propane prices, I'd say the exit rate overall will be in the 165 to 170 range. And then, Greg, I'll hand it over to you for the fourth rig. Greg Hill : Yes. So I think just one couple more comments on the third rig. So with that third rig, we'll drill 10 more wells. So that's why we increased, our drilling well count from 55 to 65. And then, we'll also bring five more wells online with that third rig. So that's why we raised the wells online count from 45 to 50. But as John said, those wells come on right at the end of the year. So the impact of that will be seen in 2022 volumes. The fourth rig, as we've always talked about, the primary role of the Bakken in our portfolio is to be a cash engine. So that's its number one role. So any decision they add any rigs in the Bakken is going to be driven by returns and corporate cash flow needs. Now, having said that, assuming oil prices stay high, in the next year, then we'd consider adding a fourth rig at the end of next year. Why is it at the end because you build all your locations in the summertime. And then by doing so, that would allow us to take Bakken production up to around 200,000 barrels a day and that level, really optimizes our in basin infrastructure. But again, that's going to be a function of oil price, the function of corporate cash flow needs, how much cash do we need the Bakken to deliver for the corporation, that's going to be the primary driver of whether or not we have that fourth rig or not. I will say, the fourth rig would be the last rig. So the highest we would go is four rigs. And we could maintain that 200,000 barrels a day with four rigs for nearly a decade, given the extensive inventory of high return wells that we have. David Deckelbaum : Thank you, guys, you seem well prepared for that question. Appreciate the color. My follow up is just on -- quickly on Libya. You've seen obviously, the end of the force majeure, you've seen production kind of pick up there. I know you guys guide ex-Libya. But can you kind of revisit the productive capacity of that asset and your view kind of the rest of the year? And then, just broadly speaking, where that sits in your portfolio? John Hess : Yes. Libya, obviously, it generates some cash for us. It has been running at fairly stable levels, and we would estimate those levels would continue at the current rate. And it really is a function of political security stability in the country, which is increased. And so we would intend that Libya would continue at the pace of cash generation that it's at now in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Just one question to follow up on just from the comments earlier about, well costing flat in the Bakken. But as you step back and look at cost inflation almost anywhere, I know, you're relatively silent in the Gulf of Mexico today, but the expectations for next year. And then as we think about building the FPSOs, or any sort of, I guess, supply chain issues that may be affecting anything as we think about the next like, it's FPSO and FPSO 2 and FPSO 3, as we think about the timing in Indiana. John Hess : Yes, Greg, why don\u2019t you please handle it, the cost inflation question that he's asking one, maybe we cover the onshore focusing on the Bakken and two the offshore? Greg Hill : Yes, sure. So, let's talk about the onshore first because it's easiest. Yes, as I said in my opening remarks, we are seeing some minor inflation in the Bakken. The first half of the year was all tubulars. However, we recall, we pre-bought all of our tubulars for the program this year. So we're covered on that. Commodity base chemicals obviously have gone up. But it really doesn't matter because we're able to cover that through technology and lean manufacturing gains and that's why we held our well cost forecast for the year still at five eight, even though we're feeling some, single-digit kind of levels of inflation. Now, if I turn to the offshore, yes, industry seeing cost increases there as well. Day rates on deepwater rigs are out modestly. They're nowhere near what they were in the halcyon day say five years ago. But remember, almost all of our offshore investment is in Guyana. And we operate under EPC contracts there. So that largely insulates us from cost increases after the contract sign. And then I've got to say, Exxon Mobil is doing an extraordinary job of utilizing this design one build many strategy to deliver large amount of efficiencies from that project. So certainly now and in the very near term, I wouldn't expect any cost issues there. And of course, because the PSC, if your costs do creep up, that's all covered under cost recovery. Roger Read : That's helpful. Thanks. And then congratulations on the discovery, certainly that have been announced today. And recently, I was just curious, some of the other exploration opportunities you have out there as we think about other blocks inside of Guyana, but also over in Surinam, any updates there? JohnHess: Well, the majority of our drilling is going to be on this Stabroek Block. And I think Greg gave pretty good roadmap for what our drilling the rest of the year is going to be, it's going to be a comment of exploration and appraisal. I think, Greg, the only other thing to talk about his Surinam probably Block 42 because we do have some drilling planned there next year. Greg Hill : Yes, we do. So planning is underway on Block 42 for a second exploration well, in the first half of 2022. Obviously, the Apache wells are encouraging for our acreage there, that's adjacent 42. And we see the acreage is a potential play extension, also from the Stabroek Block. So we're the ones that have access to not only the Stabroek data, but also the data in Surinam. And so we can couple those two together, and really understand how the geology lays out there. And that's what makes us excited about, Block 42. We also have an interest in Block 59, as you know, [just out] [ph]of Block 42, Exxon Mobil is completed the 2D seismic survey on the block there, the data has been analyzed. And it's fast. And so the joint venture is now planning a very targeted 3D survey over some interesting prospects we see on that as well but drilling there would not begin to occur until probably \u201823 at the earliest. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotia Bank. Paul Cheng : John, you guys are going to generate a fair amount of free cash, and you're going to pay down the term debt next year, but long-term, do you have a net debt target? How much debt you really want to be sitting on your budget at all? John Rielly : So our target and what I always say it's a maximum target is a two times debt to EBITDAX targets. So as you said is, when we pay off this term loan next year, and we have phase two coming online, we're going to drive under that two times. And what I expect here, because I think, we mentioned earlier, we really don't have any material near term debt maturity. So what we'll do is, we'll pay off that term loan. We have small amounts in 2024 and it's not till 2027 that we have our next big maturity. So we'll just pay off the small maturities as we have and we'll continue to let our EBITDAX grow basically, you're going to get Phase 2, then Payara, then Yellowtail, then Uaru-2, so we're going to have to significant growth in EBITDA, and our balance sheet is just going to get stronger and stronger from that standpoint. So what I would say is we hold that absolute debt level, flat and decrease it for the maturities that that come about. And then, as John mentioned, we're going to start driving, significant free cash flow generation and once that term loans paid off, we'll start with dividend increases, and then we'll move on to the opportunistic share repurchases. Paul Cheng : Hey, John, some of your peers that when they are talking about say, two times, yes, EBITDA or that one time or less than one time, they also identify or that was the parameter that what -- under what commodity price they are using, not necessarily using the current price. So do you guys just looked at the -- what is the current price, your EBITDA or you also target at a lower price, the maximum two times. John Rielly : No. We look at even lower prices, what I would say that target is there for us no matter what the commodity price is. And look, we always say this as the additional FPSOs come on, chance of these very low cost developments come on, our margins and our cash flow just continues to improve. So, even at lower commodity prices, when we start getting Payara, Yellowtail, Uaru, Mako online, we're going to have significant free cash flow and the balance sheet is going to be very strong. So our target doesn't vary based on commodity prices. And we'd like to say that, with these episodes coming on, we can win in any commodity price environment. Paul Cheng : And, John, I think John Hess has said that the first priority of the excess free cash after the term loan payoff is increasing the dividend, is there any kind of parameter you can share in terms of -- you will set dividend longer term based on say, 10% of a certain cash flow from operation based on certain advice or any kind of parameters that you can share matrix, you can share -- so we can have some better understanding of what is the trajectory? John Rielly : Sure. What we've been saying right now, and look, we'll give guidance, as we get into this free cash flow generation is that we want to have a dividend that's better than the S&P 500 like yield. And why because obviously, the oil and gas business is a little riskier and more volatile due to commodity prices. So we want to set that at a level, that gives us a better yield. And we're going to be in a position again, as I mentioned, with these FPSOs coming on, that we can set that have a better yield and withstand lower commodity prices. So we'll test it at lower commodity prices, but again, due to the uniqueness of the Guyana cash flows that will be coming in, we can do that. So that's the initial guidance I would look at is, we're going to have our yield better than that S&P 500. Paul Cheng : Final question. I think this is for Greg. Greg, when we look at your full year production guidance, which imply the second half is about 280 and you say the third quarter is about 265. So that means that the fourth quarter is about 300. Is that a bit conservative on that number? Greg Hill : Well, first of all, Paul, it's still early in the year. So we've got a lot of activity going on, we've got good turnaround, maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico, maintenance in Southeast Asia and also some shutdowns for Phase 3 in North Malay Basin. And plus, we did dial in fair amount of hurricane contingency this year in the Gulf, just based upon last year's experience, but also what the weather forecasters are saying this year. So, we'll be able to update that on the quarterly call next time. I hope you're right. I hope it is conservative. But again, we have a fair amount of contingency in there for the work that we are doing and the hurricanes that are anticipated in the Gulf. So let's just see how it plays out. Paul Cheng : Maybe, let me ask it in this way, Greg. Yes, in the fourth quarter, do you have any meaningful turnaround or maintenance shutdown activities? Greg Hill : We do have some in the fourth quarter, yes. And some of those are in Southeast Asia. And we also have a turnaround in Baldpate, in the Gulf of Mexico during the fourth quarter as well. But the hurricane contingency really rolls through both quarters. So -- Operator : Your next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : I'll just stick to two questions if that's okay. But let me see if I can get them both in. Greg, I'm going to try another go at Whiptail. I seem to recall in our prior conversations that, build up quite a picture of how to launch this prospect could be, now you've got two of the biggest sands three miles apart. I'm out of trying to saying that this could be more than one development phase on Whiptail. John Hess : Go ahead, Greg. Greg Hill : Look, I think it's early days to be to be saying that, Doug. One of the reasons we drilled the wells concurrently is because we did have good seismic response as you intimated on Whiptail, we were well calibrated with that because of course it was a sandwich between Yellowtail and Uaru. And so by drilling both of these wells concurrently, obviously we accelerated the evaluation and appraisal of this highly perspective area. We've got more appraisal work to do and some deepening to do in and around this area. But we're very pleased with the results. But I think it's just too early to speculate on, is this big enough standalone by itself? Or what? So just give us some time to evaluate the well, results. John Hess : Yes, Doug. Great question. We're still drilling, still evaluating the results. But certainly, we're very encouraged that this could underpin on its own future oil development, the foundations there more work needs to be done to get that definition, but it certainly has the potential to provide a foundation for future oil development. And, you also got to remember in Yellowtail as we got more evaluation work in. That obviously turned out to be a much bigger resource, which is why the ship for Yellowtail is being sized between 220,000 and 250,000 barrels a day, which is bigger than the two ships that preceded it at 220,000 barrels a day. So, let's get more drilling. Let's get more evaluation. But obviously, initial results are very encouraging. Greg Hill : Yes, very pleased. Doug Leggate : Thank you for that note. Greg, maybe I will do a Part 1a of the third one to John, just when you think about these hub sizes, what are you thinking about the platform levels of production nowadays? Are we thinking about one on top of the other or early phases declining? How are you thinking of that I've given the scale of the resource you have right now, just so we can calibrate everybody's adoption expectations over time? Greg Hill : No, again, Doug. You and I've talked about this before, I think these hubs, all hubs, frankly will have a long plateau and longer than would be typical in a deepwater environment. And that's simply because of the resource density of how much is in the Guyana space, in and around these existing hubs. So not only is there additional tie back opportunity in the Campanian, i.e., Liza, Liza, class reservoirs. But as we go deeper in the Santonian, let's say that works out is a technical commercial success, then you can see where you could tie back Santonian into some existing Campanian hubs. So if you step back and look at all the prospectivity in the Campanian, all the prospectivity in the Santonian. And it's pretty easy to see that these hubs will be full for a long time. Doug Leggate : Thank you. My follow up hopefully is a quick one, John Rielly, I don't want to press too much on this debt issue. But two things, EBITDA is different number of 50 than it is 70. So I just wonder if I could ask you what your thinking is on the absolute level of debt that you want to get to because if Guyana is self-funding from next year, which I believe it is, these two, the potential to generate a ton of free cash flows, obviously, they are giving their unhedged on the upside. So just give us an idea where you want the absolute balance sheet to be and I'll leave it there. Thanks. John Rielly : Really, as John has said earlier, once we pay off the 500 million on the term loan, we have to debt at the level we want it to be, as I said, there's a small maturity of 2024. And no really big maturities out until 2027. So that the debt is at that level. And we wouldn't be looking to reduce it any further at that point. And again, as we add the EBITDA from each FPSO, we will quickly drive under two times. And then, quite frankly, go below one as we continue to add these FPSOs. Doug Leggate : All right. And Guyana is self funding next year? John Rielly : Guyana is -- so once Phase 2 comes on, Guyana is self-funding. Operator : Your next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : I'll be quick here. But two related questions. The first is for you, John, which is you always have a great perspective on the oil macro. And there's a lot of uncertainty as we go into 2022. Let's so maybe on the demand side, although we can debate that more on supply in terms of OPEC behavior, and as barrels come back into the market will the market get over supplied or will inventory stay in deficit? So I loved your perspective, especially given that you spend a lot of time with market participants there. And then, the related question is just on Hesse's hedging strategy for 2022. It doesn't make sense to cost average in to the forward curve here, or would you like to stay more open to participate in potential upside? So two related questions? John Hess : Neil, good morning. Thanks for the questions. The oil market is definitely rebalancing. Three factors, demand supply inventories. We think demand is running right now at about 98 million barrels a day remember pre-COVID. Globally, it was running 100 million barrels a day. I think demand is well supported with the people getting back to work, mobility data in the United States, certainly jet fuel is almost at pre-COVID levels of demand. Obviously, international travel is still down. gasoline in the United States, demand as well as gas oil demand is back at pre-COVID levels. So demand is pretty strong. I think the financial stimulus programs of the U.S. government, other governments across the world, as well as accommodative monetary policies with the central banks are really turbocharging the consumer, turbocharging the economy and supporting oil demand. So we see demand growth continuing into next year, we think we will get by the end of the year, about 100 million barrels a day of global oil demand. We see that being stronger going into next year. So I think that's a key part that you have to get grounded in. To answer your question, what's the demand assumption where we take the over the demand is going to continue to be strong going into next year through the year. Supply, you look at shale, shale is no longer the swing supplier, it's gone from business that's focused on production growth to one that's focused on return of capital, financial discipline appropriately. So if you can grow a little bit, but generate free cash, according to the oil environment, that's what the investor discipline wants. That's what the company discipline wants. So we see the rig count, maybe it gets up to 500 in the United States, but shale will not be growing at the level that it was growing at the last five years for what it's going to be growing in the next three or four years. I think U.S. production in the range of crude for, let's say 11 million barrels a day, it's going to be hard to getting to pre-COVID levels of 13 million barrels a day, probably for the next three or four years. So shale will play a role, but it's going to have a backseat in terms of being the swing supplier, the swing supplier going forward. And really the federal reserve of oil prices is going to be OPEC led by our OPEC plus led by Saudi Arabia, Russia and the other members. And I think they've been very disciplined, very wise and being very tempered about bringing their spare capacity back. They just made -- I think, a very historic agreement that says we'll bring on 400,000 barrels a day, month by month, we'll look at it, if something happens in the very end, something happens with Iran coming on, we may curtail that, but basically that 5.8 million barrels a day of excess capacity will be whittled down 400 a day, each month as it goes out, though, need every month to check on that. But basically, that will be sort of that cushion, that you need to keep supply up with demand. But in that scenario, the markets in deficit, so that should keep prices well supported. And the other key point is, I'd say we're at pre-COVID inventory levels now, where the glut of 1.2 billion barrels of oil excess supply a year ago, April now has been whittled down to where the markets really back in balance at pre-COVID levels. So looking forward, the macro, I think is very supportive, demand growing faster than supply, inventory at pre-COVID levels, and the oil price should be well supported in that environment. Neil Mehta : Tie that back into -- that might be a question for John Rielly tied into hedging strategy. John Rielly : Right. So Neil, what our strategy is going to continue to be to use put options, right, we want to get the full insurance on the downside and leave the upside for investors. So obviously, we've been watching the market in the front has been performing very well and it is a bit backward dated as you go into 2022. And so with the put options, we typically put them on, September to December towards the end of the year, time value, gets the cost fee options a little bit lower, we'll see where volatility is, as we move getting closer to 2022. Now, you should expect us to put on a significant hedge position again, like we had this year and you should expect to see it as we move into the fourth quarter us begin to add those hedges. John Hess : To be clear, that will be put base strategy. Neil Mehta : Makes a ton of sense. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Paul Sankey : A lot of my questions have been answered around the balance sheet. But I was just wondering if we could get a sense for the potential for acceleration on any of the moving parts here. The first would be, would debt pay down potentially be accelerated even faster than what you've talked about with the term loan? If not, would we potentially see faster cash return to shareholders? So the quicker decision to raise the dividend is that a potential? Or I guess the alternative would be that you just increase cash on the balance sheet. And then, operationally, I guess it's a little bit longer term but could the pace of Guyana development be accelerated do you think? Or is it a fairly set and predictable path here? And what I'm really wondering is, as you mentioned, the Exxon Mobil buy one -- build one, design many -- design one, build many strategy, I wonder if that has the potential to accelerate, if we look forward, two to three to five to seven years. And finally, whether or not you would increase spending in a very strong story that you have here in the Bakken or the deepwater Gulf of Mexico or anywhere else, if that was another potential outlet for the success you're enjoying? Thanks. John Hess : Yes, Paul. Hi, good to hear your voice. Look, we've laid out our plan, we're going to be very disciplined about executing the plan. There is always potential to accelerate. It's a function of market conditions, obviously. But I think the key thing is, we do want to keep a strong cash position, as a cushion for downturns in the oil market, it certainly served us well last year and it's serving as well, this year, obviously, very different markets, between last year and this year. And in terms of, what our assumptions are going forward, we want to keep that strong cash position. And with current prices, where they are, we think it's prudent to go into next year with a strong cash position. So we can fund the high value projects that we have in Guyana in the Bakken and obviously, in our other two asset areas. So, I think it's good planning assumption to assume that it will be given market conditions, we would pay that $500 million off next year, always have the flexibility to move it forward. But we want to keep the strong cash position. And we just think that's a financial prudent strategy. In terms of Guyana, Exxon is doing, as Greg said, a great job managing a world-class project, both in terms of costs and in terms of timing and this idea of design one, build many and pretty much getting in a cadence of one of these major FPSOs is being built one a year, come on one a year, that cadence is probably as aggressive as any ever done in the industry. And Exxon Mobil often talks about leakage meaning capital inefficiency, this pace of bringing on one ship a year is probably as accelerated as you want to get and it's a pretty darn good one. Paul Sankey : Got it. And then the potential for greater spending more growth, is that -- would it be -- I assume you'd be more focused on cash return ultimately, because of the -- John Hess : Yes. We're going to stay very financially disciplined. John talks about adding a third rig and then Greg will talk potentially a fourth rig, those can certainly be folded in. And actually, that increases our free cash flow generation in the years I had. So it actually strengthens our free cash flow, even though in the year of the investment, you go up a notch. But the Bakken\u2019s becoming a major free cash flow generator on its way, let's say to 200,000 barrels a day equivalent, and plateauing. So there'll be obviously increase with rigs, John talks about it in the range of about 200 million per rig. And then, you have the different developments that we have, but we're going to stay very focused on keeping a tight string on our capital investments. So we can grow the free cash flow wedge and really compound that free cash flow wedge over the next five to six years. Paul Sankey : Thank you. Could I just ask a color question on the midstream? What was the strategic, could you add any strategic color about the moves you made in the midstream and I'll leave it there. Thank you. John Rielly : Sure, at a high level strategic standpoint, the midstream continues to add differentiated value to our E&P assets. So it allows us to maintain operational and marketing control. It provides the takeaway optionality to multiple high value markets. And also it's driving our ability to increase our gas capture and drive down our greenhouse gas intensity. So just starting, Paul, at the high level, both GIP and us remain committed to the long-term value. And so with this transaction like pro forma for the transaction, has midstream maintains a strong credit position, it's 3x debt to EBITDA. And then, it has continuing free cash flow after distributions as it moves forward. So that debt to EBITDA will come back down from three. So it's going to have sustained, low leverage and ample balance sheet capacity. So they really did this to optimize its capital structure. And then with this ample balance sheet capacity can support future growth or incremental return to shareholders, including Hess and that can be this type of buyback or increased distribution. John Hess : So another way of saying, Midstream becomes a free cash flow engine for Hess as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : I had a question about Fangtooth. If I heard Greg right. You said it was nine miles northwest of Liza-1. If I look at a seismic section that the operator Exxon Mobil had in their Investor Day, they show us a very large, deep seismic signature that seems to correspond to where you're drilling, Fangtooth, am I over reading that? Or is this a fairly large structure that you're going to drill? Greg Hill : Yes, it is a very large structure that will be dedicated to the deeper stratigraphy, call it lower Campanian, Santonian. So that will be our first standalone well, targeting those deeper intervals, Bob as you know, the rest have all been deep tails. But this will be a standalone and yes, it is a very large structure. Operator : Your next question comes from Noel Parks with Touhy Brothers. Noel Parks : Just a different sort of continue on from that last question. Could you just sort of maybe walk us through where things stand on as far as main targets in Guyana versus deeper potential targets? Sort of the just kind of what you pretty much have established beyond the primary targets? And sort of what's still to come? Greg Hill : You bet. So when I talk about deeper plays, I'm really talking about the bottom of the Campanian and lower Campanian and then down into the Santonian. And then, as I said before, these have the potential to be a very large addition to the recoverable resource base in Guyana. And if successful, as I mentioned previously, they could be exploited to a combination of tie backs to existing hubs, and or stand standalone developments if they're big enough. So we've had eight penetrations to-date in the deeper plays. And then, if you couple that with the success in Surinam, which is we understand the better part over there, again, don't have the data. But this is just what we're hearing from others in the industry appears to be kind of the lower Campanian Santonian intervals as well. So there's been a number of penetrations, so that's why we're encouraged. Now, we've got a lot more drilling to do, to fully understand that potential of this play. So in the second half, we've got several more deep targets that are planned. Three will be what I call deepenings. So there'll be deep tails on Campanian targets, two of which John mentioned in his script, which are Whiptail. So both Whiptail-1 and Whiptail-2 will be deep and down into the Santonian. The next one after that is Cataback, and then also Pinktail will have a deep tail on it as well. And then as I just discussed with Mr. Brackett, there will be a deep standalone called Fangtooth. So just on the Stabroek Block, by the end of the year, we'll have 13 total penetrations in the deeper stratigraphy. So we'll begin to now understand better how it's all put together, where we think the hydrocarbons are et cetera, et cetera. So keep watching this space evolving story. But very exciting but again, need more drilling to figure out where and what we have. Noel Parks : Great. And just to sort of extend in the other dimension. I seem to remember that the report you had last quarter, three months ago, has some implications for areal extent. And in this -- in the wells on the horizon, your second half of the year, are there any of those that will be particularly informative about the sort of areal extent of the deeper zones? Greg Hill : Well, yes, it's a mosaic, it's a picture that we're trying to put together. So yes, I mean, we mentioned Fangtooth, for example, being a very large structure stratigraphic feature, I should say. Obviously, if that, if the results of that are very positive, then we will probably want to follow up with an appraisal well, or a second well in that, given that the structure is quite large. But some of these tails will also inform the size of some of these as well, because of course, you're going after seismic features that you see on seismic that are of various sizes, some are big, and some are smaller. So by definition, we'll get a better understanding of that. John Hess : And, Greg, that's great perspective on some of the exploration potential, some of the appraisal potential, but you also might point out that we have a pretty active testing program, between now and the end of the year. And to address the areal extent and productivity of potential developments, you might talk about that. Greg Hill : Absolutely. So remember, we'll be doing drill stem tests at Uaru, at Mako, and then also Longtail before the end of the year. So that'll give us really key data that understand the size of those reservoirs in particular so -- John Hess : And ultimately, that helps us define the value of our -- upgrade the value of our development queue for projects going forward. So very active program for the rest of the year, new targets, appraising current targets, and also testing them, so we can upgrade the development queue of future oil projects. Greg Hill : And I would anticipate on those lines that eventually we'll do a [BSP] [ph] at Whiptail as well. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2021 Hess Corporation Conference Call. My name is Josh, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Josh. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today\u2019s conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess\u2019 annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today\u2019s conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. On the line with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. In case there are any audio issues, we will be posting transcripts of each speaker\u2019s prepared remarks on our website following the presentation. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy. Greg Hill then will discuss our operations, and John Rielly will cover our financial results. With COP26 beginning this Sunday, it is appropriate to address the energy transition. Climate change is the greatest scientific undertaking of the 21st century. The world has two challenges : to grow our global energy supply by about 20% in the next 20 years; and to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The International Energy Agency published its latest World Energy Outlook earlier this month, which provides four scenarios to shed light on these challenges. It is important to remember that these are scenarios, not forecasts, to help guide policymakers and business leaders in their decision making. In all four scenarios, oil and gas will still be needed in the decades to come. Significantly more investment will be required to meet the world\u2019s growing energy needs, much more in renewables and much more in oil and gas. A reasonable estimate for global oil and gas investment from these IEA scenarios is at least $400 billion each year over the next 10 years. Last year, that number was $300 billion. This year\u2019s estimate is $340 billion. To ensure a successful and orderly energy transition, we need to have climate literacy, energy literacy and economic literacy. Our strategy is to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth, while delivering industry leading environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. By investing only in high return, low cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated and focused portfolio that is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets. Our cash engines are the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia, where we have competitively advantaged assets and operating capabilities. Guyana is our growth engine and is on track to become a significant cash engine in the coming years as multiple phases of low cost oil developments come on line. Also, by adding a third rig in the Bakken in September and completing the turnaround and expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant, the Bakken is expected to generate significant free cash flow in the years ahead. By successfully executing our strategy, our Company is positioned to deliver strong and durable cash flow growth through the end of the decade. Based upon the most recent sell side consensus estimates, our cash flow is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2023, which is 50% above our peers and puts us in the top 5% of the S&P 500. As our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. We have continued to maintain financial strength as well as managing for risk. As of September 30th, we had $2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet. In July, we prepaid half of our $1 billion term loan maturing in March 2023, and we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022. This debt reduction combined with the startup of Liza Phase 2 early next year is expected to drive our debt to EBITDAX ratio under 2 and also enable us to consider increasing cash returns to shareholders. In August, we completed the sale of our interests in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million, effective January 1, 2021 and received $375 million in proceeds from Hess Midstream\u2019s buyback of Class B units from its sponsors, Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners. Earlier this month, our company also received net proceeds of $108 million from the public offering of Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream. The Denmark sale and these midstream monetizations brought material value forward and further strengthened our cash and liquidity position. Key to our long-term strategy is Guyana, one of the industry\u2019s best investments. On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we announced the 19th and 20th significant discoveries during the third quarter at Whiptail and Pinktail, and on October 7th we announced the 21st significant discovery on the block at Cataback. These discoveries will underpin our queue of future low cost oil developments. We see the potential for at least six FPSOs on the Stabroek Block producing more than 1 million gross barrels of oil per day in 2027, and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. On October 7th, we increased the gross discovered recoverable resource estimate for the block to approximately 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up from the previous estimate of more than 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. In terms of our current Guyana developments, gross production from the Liza Phase 1 complex averaged 124,000 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter. The Liza Phase 2 development is on track for startup in early 2022 with a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, and the Liza Unity FPSO arrived in Guyana on Monday. Our third development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara Field is on track to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day. Our three sanctioned oil developments have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. The Plan of Development for our fourth development on the block at Yellowtail was recently submitted to the Government of Guyana for approval. Pending government approvals, the project is envisioned to have a gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day with first oil in 2025. Turning to sustainability, we are proud to be recognized as an industry leader in our environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. Earlier this month, our Company received a triple-A rating in the MSCI ESG ratings for 2021 after earning double-A ratings for the previous 10 consecutive years. The triple-A rating designates Hess as a leader in managing industry specific ESG risks relative to peers and reflects our strong management practices to reduce carbon emissions as well as our top quartile performance in areas such as biodiversity and land use, reduction of air and water emissions and waste, and making a positive impact on the communities where we operate. In summary, we remain focused on executing our strategy and achieving strong operational and ESG performance. Our Company is uniquely positioned to deliver cash flow growth over the next decade that is not only industry-leading but which we believe will rank among the best in the S&P 500. After our term loan is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will prioritize return of capital to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance, meeting our production targets despite extended hurricane related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and safely executing a major turnaround at our Tioga Gas Plant in North Dakota. Companywide net production averaged 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, in line with our guidance. In the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021, we expect companywide net production to average approximately 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Turning to the Bakken, third quarter net production averaged 148,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was above our guidance of approximately 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and primarily reflected strong execution of the Tioga Gas Plant turnaround and expansion, no small task in a COVID environment that required strict adherence to extensive safety protocols to keep more than 650 workers safe. For the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken net production to average between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2021, we forecast our Bakken net production to average approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to our previous guidance range of 155,000 to 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This guidance reflects an increase in NGL prices, which reduces volumes under our percentage of proceeds contracts, but significantly increases this year\u2019s earnings and cash flow. In the third quarter, we drilled 18 wells and brought 19 new wells on line. In the fourth quarter, we expect to drill approximately 19 wells and to bring approximately 18 new wells on line. And for the full year 2021, we continue to expect to drill approximately 65 wells and to bring approximately 50 new wells on line. In terms of drilling and completion costs, although we have experienced some cost inflation, we are maintaining our full-year average forecast of $5.8 million per well in 2021. Since February, we had been operating two rigs, but given the improvement in oil prices and our robust inventory of high-return drilling locations, we added a third rig in September. Moving to a three-rig program will allow us to grow cash flow and production, better optimize our in-basin infrastructure and drive further reductions in our unit cash costs. Now, moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, third quarter net production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared to our guidance range of 35,000 to 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our results reflected an extended period of recovery following Hurricane Ida, which caused power outages at transportation and processing facilities downstream of our platforms. Production was restored at all of our facilities by the end of September. In the fourth quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average between 40,000 and 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2021, our forecast for Gulf of Mexico net production remains approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Southeast Asia, net production in the third quarter was 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, in line with our guidance of 50,000 to 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns and lower nominations due to COVID. Fourth quarter net production is forecast to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and our full year 2021 net production forecast remains at approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now, turning to Guyana. In the third quarter, gross production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 124,000 barrels of oil per day or 32,000 barrels of oil per day, net to Hess. Replacement of the flash gas compression system on the Liza Destiny with a modified design is planned for the fourth quarter and production optimization work is now planned to take place in the first quarter of 2022. These two projects are expected to result in higher production capacity and reliability. Net production from Liza Phase 1 is forecast to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021. The Liza Phase 2 development will utilize the 220,000 barrels of oil per day Unity FPSO, which arrived in Guyana Monday evening. Next steps will be mooring line installation and umbilical and riser hook up. First oil remains on track for first quarter 2022. Turning to our third development at Payara, the Prosperity FPSO hull entered the Keppel Yard in Singapore on August 1st. Topsides fabrication at Dyna-Mac and development drilling are underway. The overall project is approximately 60% complete. The Prosperity will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and is on track to achieve first oil in 2024. As for our fourth development at Yellowtail, earlier this month the joint venture submitted the plan of development to the Government of Guyana. Pending government approvals and project sanctioning, the Yellowtail project will utilize an FPSO with a gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day. First oil is targeted for 2025. As John mentioned, we announced three discoveries since July. In July, we announced that the Whiptail1 and 2 wells encountered 246 feet and 167 feet of high quality, oil bearing sandstone reservoirs, respectively. This discovery is located approximately 4 miles southeast of Uaru-1 and 3 miles west of Yellowtail. In September, we announced that the Pinktail-1 well, located approximately 22 miles southeast of Liza-1, encountered 220 feet of high quality, oil bearing sandstone reservoirs. And finally, earlier this month, we announced a discovery at Cataback, located approximately 4 miles east of Turbot-1. The well encountered 243 feet of high quality hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs, of which approximately 102 feet was oil bearing. These discoveries further underpin future developments and contributed to the increase of estimated gross discovered recoverable resources on the Stabroek Block to approximately 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Exploration and appraisal activities in the fourth quarter will include drilling the Fangtooth-1 exploration well, located approximately 11 miles northwest of Liza-1. This well is a significant step-out test that will target deeper Campanian and Santonian aged reservoirs. Appraisal activities will include Drill Stem Tests at Longtail-2 and Whiptail-2, as well as drilling the Tripletail-2 well. In closing, we have once again demonstrated strong execution and delivery, and are well positioned to deliver significant value to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2021. We had net income of $115 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with a net loss of $73 million in the second quarter of 2021. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we had net income of $86 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $74 million in the second quarter of 2021. Third quarter earnings include an after-tax gain of $29 million from the sale of our interests in Denmark. Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P had net income of $149 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $122 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the third quarter and second quarter of 2021 were as follows : Higher realized crude oil, NGL and natural gas selling prices increased earnings by $110 million; lower sales volumes reduced earnings by $147 million; lower DD&A expense increased earnings by $37 million; lower cash costs increased earnings by $14 million; lower exploration expenses increased earnings by $10 million; all other items increased earnings by $3 million for an overall increase in third quarter earnings of $27 million. Sales volumes in the third quarter were lower than the second quarter, primarily due to hurricane-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, planned maintenance downtime and lower nominations in Malaysia, and lower sales in the Bakken, resulting from the planned Tioga Gas Plant maintenance turnaround. In Guyana, we sold three 1 million barrel cargos of oil in the third quarter, up from two 1 million barrel cargos of oil sold in the second quarter. For the third quarter, our E&P sales volumes were underlifted compared with production by approximately 175,000 barrels, which had an insignificant impact on our after-tax results for the quarter. Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $61 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $76 million in the prior quarter. Third quarter results included costs related to the Tioga Gas Plant maintenance turnaround that was safely and successfully completed. Midstream EBITDA, before non-controlling interests, amounted to $203 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $229 million in the previous quarter. Turning to our financial position. At quarter-end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.41 billion, and total liquidity was $6 billion including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.1 billion. During the third quarter we received net proceeds of $375 million from the sale of 15.6 million Hess-owned Class B units of Hess Midstream and proceeds of approximately $130 million from the sale of our interests in Denmark. In July, we prepaid $500 million of our $1 billion term loan and we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022. In October, we received net proceeds of approximately $108 million from the public offering of 4.3 million Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream. Our ownership in Hess Midstream on a consolidated basis is approximately 44%, compared with 46% prior to these two recent transactions. In the third quarter, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $631 million compared with $659 million in the second quarter. In the third quarter, net cash provided by operating activities after changes in operating assets and liabilities was $615 million compared with $785 million in the second quarter. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the third quarter decreased net cash provided by operating activities by $16 million compared with an increase of $126 million in the second quarter. Now, turning to guidance, first for E&P. Our E&P cash costs were $12.76 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $13.45 per barrel of oil equivalent excluding Libya in the third quarter of 2021. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya to be in the range of $12 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter, and $11.75 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year, compared to previous full year guidance of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent. The updated guidance reflects the impact of higher realized selling prices in 2021, which significantly improved cash flow, but reduced volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts and increased production taxes in the Bakken. DD&A expense was $11.77 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya and $12.38 per barrel of oil equivalent excluding Libya in the third quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $13 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $12.50 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $25 to $26 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and $24.25 to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $160 million for the full year, which is at the lower end of our previous full year guidance of $160 million to $170 million. The midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $295 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $1,095 million for the full year. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million, which is up from previous guidance of $125 million to $135 million, reflecting higher commodity prices. We expect non-cash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the fourth quarter. For the year 2022, we have purchased WTI collars for 90,000 barrels of oil per day barrels of oil per day with a floor price of $60 per barrel and a ceiling price of $90 per barrel. We have also entered into Brent collars for 60,000 barrels of oil per day with a floor price of $65 per barrel and a ceiling price of $95 per barrel. The cost of this 2022 hedge program is $161 million, which will be amortized ratably over 2022. During the fourth quarter, we expect to sell two 1 million barrel cargos of oil from Guyana. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $650 million in the fourth quarter. Full year guidance remains unchanged at approximately $1.9 billion. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $70 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is projected to be approximately $280 million, which is the midpoint of our previous guidance of $275 million to $285 million. Turning to corporate. Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $130 million, which is down from our previous guidance of $130 million to $140 million. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $375 million to $380 million, compared to our previous guidance of approximately $380 million. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan. Arun Jayaram : Good morning. Greg, I wanted to maybe start with you on Liza Phase 2. You mentioned that the ship got to the Stabroek block on Monday. But just using Liza Phase 1 as a guide, can you give us a sense around how many days, months do you think you could be the first oil? Greg Hill : Yes, sure. So, thanks for the question, Arun. Remember now that it\u2019s arrived in water, the first thing that we have to do is more to the seafloor. And then obviously, there\u2019s a lot of flow lines and risers and umbilicals to get hooked up to the vessel. So, what I would say is we are firmly on track for an early 2022 start-up, and don\u2019t think I could be more definitive than that, but early 2022 looks like very possible. Arun Jayaram : Great, great. And then, my follow-up, Greg, maybe for you as well. One of the questions from the buy side is just around overall inflation, and just how to think about some of the inflationary pressures, raw materials, et cetera, on future phases of the project. I know that you\u2019re in the market now with Exxon on Yellowtail. And then one of your key subsea provider did put some color around the subsea kit that they expect around Yellowtail and Uaru. They cited maybe a $500 million to $1 billion range for Yellowtail and a little bit over $1 billion for Uaru. So, just maybe you could just help us think about inflationary pressures, Greg? Greg Hill : Sure. I think first of all, yes, there is inflation going on. I think there\u2019s a couple of things we have to remember. First of all, for the first three phases, which you mentioned, those are under existing EPC contracts. So, we\u2019re basically insulated from cost increases on those EPC contracts? And then, ExxonMobil is doing an extraordinary job I think of utilizing this design one, build many strategy, to deliver efficiencies. Now, on the Yellowtail, we still don\u2019t have the final numbers. So, once that project is sanctioned, we\u2019ll give the market color on what the costs are. I do think it\u2019s important to remember the nature of the PSC though. So by the time you get the Yellowtail, the efficiency of the PSC is so rapid that any cost increases rapidly get recovered. So, the impact on overall project return is not very much at all, right, because of that superefficient PSC. And the breakevens for Yellowtail, we project even with some cost increases, we\u2019ll be in the -- firmly in the $25 to $32 barrel range. So, one of the best projects on the planet, even with some potential cost increases. Great project. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Guys, I know you haven\u2019t given a 2022 outlook yet. But, given the oil price recovery that we\u2019ve seen and the very smart hedges, I think you guys have put in place. I go back to the CapEx guidance that you gave in 2018 at your Strategy Day. And I wonder if I could just ask you to give us a kind of framework as to how we should think about the spending trajectory? And if I may, embedded in that question, be blunt with you that I think there\u2019s some concern over the cost, the sticker shock on Yellowtail. So, if I threw out a number and said where we should be thinking something in the $12 billion type of range, would that be off the mark? John Rielly : Doug, let me start with just giving some color on our capital for 2022. Now, you know, obviously, we will finalize that and we\u2019ll give our full guidance in January. But from a directional standpoint, let\u2019s start with the Bakken. We\u2019ve added a rig there. Rule of thumb, when we add a rig, it\u2019s approximately $200 million when we add a rig in the Bakken. We\u2019re also -- to your point, with the higher prices, we\u2019re seeing more ballots for non-operated wells. So, for that, we could see an increase of approximately $50 million in our non-op JV wells next year. So, if you\u2019re looking at Bakken, approximately $250 million of a capital increase as we look at next year, obviously, with a pickup in production and an increasing cash flow that will also as well coming from Bakken. In Guyana, we expect our development spend. So, we went into the year with the guide with $780 million for our development spend in Guyana. We\u2019re going to come in under that. And so, let me just say we\u2019ll probably be approximately $750 million on our Guyana development spend this year. So, with Liza Phase 2 and a continued development on Payara, and we\u2019ll begin spending on Yellowtail, we think it\u2019s approximately $1 billion will be the Guyana capital for the developments next year. So approximately, again, another $250 million there. The other areas then are Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. So, on the Gulf of Mexico, we\u2019re basically not spending much money at all this year in the Gulf of Mexico. And we typically spend $150 million to $200 million. And we do plan to drill a tieback well and one exploration well next year. And in Southeast Asia, we\u2019re looking to complete our Phase 3 and Phase 4 developments in North Malay Basin. So, we\u2019ll have some increase there. So, I\u2019d say combined, those will be about $200 million. So I\u2019ve got $500 million from Bakken and Guyana, $200 million Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. But I have to remind everyone, we\u2019ll have Liza Phase 2 coming on line. And so, I\u2019ll just do -- I always do that simple math, when Liza Phase 2 comes on in full and we have our share of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, we\u2019re basically -- and I\u2019m just going to use a $60 Brent price and about a $10 cash cost. We pick up $1 billion of additional cash flow from Liza Phase 2 alone when that comes on. And then, obviously, you have Payara and Yellowtail. So, we\u2019ll get much more cash flow as each FPSO comes on. So, that\u2019s a directional. We\u2019ll update in January. John, do you want to talk on Yellowtail? John Hess : Yes. And Doug on Yellowtail well, the FTP has been submitted to the government, and it is higher cost. I think everybody needs to realize that this FPSO is going to have capacity approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day on a gross basis. It will be our largest oil development to date in Guyana. And while its cost will be higher, the resource we are developing is significantly higher. And this development has simply outstanding financial returns, some of the best in the industry, as Greg mentioned, and a breakeven cost between $25 and $32 per barrel Brent. So, it\u2019s outstanding economics. Yes, the costs are higher, but the resource we\u2019re recovering is much higher, and these are some of the best economics in the industry. Doug Leggate : So, I wouldn\u2019t [Technical Difficulty] anyone at $12 billion\u2026 John Hess : I won\u2019t comment on that. Let\u2019s let the FTP be approved, and then we\u2019ll announce the official number. Doug Leggate : Thanks. My follow-up, hopefully a quick one. And that really is on Yellowtail. You mentioned the 250,000 is now being confirmed in the release, EIX, it\u2019s still 220,000, 250,000. Greg, I just want to just check in with you on how should we think about production optimization on all of these FPSOs? Is it 10% to 15%, in other words, above the nameplate? Greg Hill : Yes, Doug. So, I think based on -- again, this is just my experience being in this business 38 years. I would think that for developments of these sizes and everyone will be bespoke, so everyone will be a little bit different. But I think a range of 10% to 20% capacity for debottlenecking or capacity increases. This is a reasonable expectation. Again, everyone will be a little bit bespoke. You\u2019ll wait and get some dynamic data to see where the bottlenecks are. But, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an unreasonable expectation for future vessels. And I think the second point is, remember, these increases in capacity are typically achieved for very low investment. And obviously, with PSC, the rapid cost recovery, these are very profitable things to do. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : I think previously that the expectation of the debottleneck in Liza-1 will be doing at the same time as the turnaround, and now, it\u2019s being separate and push it to the first quarter. Is there any particular reason for that decision? John Hess : Greg? Greg Hill : Yes. So, Paul, as you said, the optimization work on Destiny is now planned for the first quarter. This was simply deferred to allow other planned maintenance and inspection work to be done concurrently, which is much more efficient. So, the operator just pushed it to get some efficiencies and completing a bunch of other work at the same time while they had the vessel down, which we fully support. Paul Cheng : Would that be more efficient that when the vessel is done, then you do the optimization? I mean, I\u2019m actually surprised you say it will be more efficient to separate into two events. John Hess : No, it won\u2019t. That\u2019s what I meant, Paul, is that when we take it down to do the optimization, ExxonMobil wanted to do some other work while the vessel was down. So, pulling some work forward, some maintenance work that was scheduled for later in the year, by doing that all at the same time concurrently, it\u2019s just much more efficient. And so, they needed parts and pieces and et cetera and that\u2019s why it got pushed to the first quarter. Paul Cheng : And Greg, I think originally, when you signed the agreement with the Guyana government, at some point that you guys are supposed to develop the gas resource there. I mean, now that I think up to Yellowtail, it doesn\u2019t seem so you guys are going to do it. So, any game plan when that the gas will need to be developed or that means time line still subject to the negotiation with the government? John Hess : Greg? Greg Hill : Yes. So, I think there\u2019s two pieces, Paul. So, the first piece is the gas to energy project, right? It\u2019s going to be a slip stream of gas, if you will, 50 million to 100 million cubic feet a day pipeline to shore that is -- would supply gas in onshore power plant to generate lower cost, cleaner, more reliable energy for the benefit of the people on it. That project is in the design phase right now. And once it\u2019s done, then we\u2019ll share the details of the project after a sanction. Regarding the long-term gas solution, which is what I think you were referring to, there are studies out today, but it\u2019s way out in the future, Paul. So, it\u2019s not anything certainly we need to worry about the next five years, potentially even well beyond that, so. But, there are studies going on. Because remember, the highest value of the gas is pressure maintenance of these reservoirs significantly increase recovery. And the other unique part about the gas is it\u2019s miscible. So, there will be an enhanced oil recovery effect as a result of putting that gas back in the reservoir. So, the highest and most beneficial use, if you will, of that gas is actually reinjection. Paul Cheng : And the final question for me, I think, it\u2019s for John. John, I think you mentioned that once that your net debt to EBITDA get to say below 2 times, you will consider increasing the cash return to shareholders. And at that point that how should we look at it? I mean, is there ways you\u2019re targeting that the incremental cash flow, say 50% still going to the balance sheet and 50% for incremental cash return to shareholder, or any kind of estimate that you can share? And also, at that point, should we assume that the main vehicle is going to be buyback, or it\u2019s just going to be increasing the common dividend, or that is the variable dividend? How should we be looking at those? John Hess : Sure. So, our strategy remains the same, and you said it, basically would get Phase 2 on line, we pay off the remaining part of the term loan. And our debt to EBITDAX will be below 2 at that point, and we\u2019ll begin increasing returns to shareholders. What we\u2019re going to do first with the returns is increase our dividend. We\u2019ll start there. And then, obviously, as each FPSO comes on, we get significant -- as I mentioned earlier, another $1 billion with IR, another $1 billion with Yellowtail, will have an increasing free cash flow. We\u2019ll still progressively increase the dividend. But when we have that free cash flow, the majority of that will go back to shareholders. And that point, we\u2019ll be looking at opportunistic share repurchases. Paul Cheng : John, when you\u2019re talking about that once you drop below 2 times, I suppose that your ultimate target will be much below 2 times EBITDA ratio. So, what is that ultimate ratio you want? Is it less than 1-time or less than half a multiple point? John Hess : Yes. I\u2019m going to answer it two ways. So, once we do get under 2, we are comfortable with our absolute debt levels. We have -- our liquidity is very good. We have a 300 maturity -- $300 million maturity coming in 2024. Our next maturity is into 2027. So, we\u2019ll continue. We can pay off the maturity as they come due. And then, what will happen is because the EBITDA just increases so much with each FPSO, will drive under 1 time fairly quickly actually when these FPSOs come on line. So yes, we do want to be below 1. And look, we can do that at various commodity prices, just again due to the great returns that we have in Guyana. Operator : And your next question comes from Phillips Johnston with Capital One. Phillips Johnston : Just one for me. I guess, on last quarter\u2019s call, we did touch on your strategic thoughts around test Hess Midstream, but I just wanted to follow up on the topic, just given the size of that asset. It seems like you guys obviously want to get your Bakken volumes up to that optimal level of 200,000 a day before plateauing at that level. Once that occurs and once operational and marketing control of Midstream is perhaps less critical, would you think it makes sense to harvest that asset just by selling it to a third party and freeing up capital in the process just to potentially return that to shareholders? Greg Hill : Phillips, I mean, we are very happy with our midstream investment and GIP is two. So, the midstream continues to add what we believe is differentiated value to our E&P assets. Like you said, being able to get it up to 200,000 barrels a day, also with that maintaining the operational and marketing control, it provides takeaway optionality for us to high-value markets. And as John mentioned earlier, we\u2019re very focused on minimizing our mission. So, it gives us the ability to increase our gas capture and drive down flaring. So, both GIP and Hess remain committed to maximizing the long-term value of Hess Midstream. So, the offerings we did, we had the secondary in Q1 and earlier this month, they were designed to increase the float, as Midstream get their liquidity up there. And the Q3 buyback actually helped Hess Midstream optimize its capital structure, getting to that 3 times leverage position. So, pro forma for these transactions, Hess Midstream, it maintains a strong credit position and it has continuing free cash flow after distributions. So, it will continue to have that low leverage and ample balance sheet capacity because with the free cash flow, we\u2019ll continue to drive that leverage down. So, that can support future growth there on the Midstream side or incremental return of capital to its shareholders, including Hess. So basically, what we\u2019re talking about is continuing what we\u2019ve been doing here with Hess Midstream. John Hess : And to be clear, our objective is to maximize the value of Hess Midstream to Hess and also maximize the value of Hess Midstream to its unitholders and GIP as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Kickoff question is on hedging. And you made some progress in terms of 2022 and implemented this collar strategy. Can you just talk high level why you thought that was the appropriate way to attack hedging? And it does appear to still leave you a lot of optionality on the upside while protecting your downside, but maybe kick off there. John Rielly : Sure. So, I mean, our hedge strategy, I mean, this is for 2022. It\u2019s consistent with our past strategy. We look to provide significant downside protection to put -- do this while also giving the majority of upside to our shareholders. And we\u2019re looking for that price protection as we continue to fund our world class investment opportunity in Guyana. So, with it, as I mentioned, we have the collars, 90,000 barrels of oil per day of WTI puts at a floor of $60 and the ceiling at $90 and the 60,000 barrels of oil per day Brent puts floor at $65 and the ceiling at $95. We use those high ceiling collars to reduce the cost of the program, just to be more efficient with our hedging program. But also, as you mentioned, we retain the exposure to greater than $2 billion in additional cash flow. In the case of high oil prices above those hedge floor prices. So, in addition, we have not hedged any of our natural gas, obviously, no NGL productions hedged, and we haven\u2019t hedged all of our oil production either. So, we continue to be in a good position to be able to accrete up value with higher oil prices. But again, we\u2019ve got that significant price protection on the downside to continue the investment. Neil Mehta : Great, guys. And then, the follow-up is just on the Bakken. Can you spend some time just talking about your development strategy there. What would it take with oil prices up here for you guys to pursue a growth strategy as opposed to a free cash flow strategy in the Bakken? John Hess : Greg? Greg Hill : Yes, sure. So remember, the primary role of the Bakken in our portfolio is to be a cash engine. So, that\u2019s the first thing. And as such, any decision to add rigs in the Bakken is going to be driven by returns in our corporate cash flow position. Now having said that at $60 WTI, we have 2,200 future locations, which, assuming you would go up to 4 rigs over 50 rig years of inventory. Our ultimate objective is we\u2019d like to get the Bakken back to 200,000 barrels a day. Why? Because that optimizes -- maximizes the free cash flow generation of the Bakken. We can do that by adding a fourth rig. And depending on market conditions next year, we would consider adding that fourth rig at the end of next year. And I think the other thing that\u2019s important to remember is 4 rigs, the maximum we will run in the Bakken. That\u2019s sort of the efficient frontier, if you will, to just take the Bakken to 200,000 barrels a day, plus or minus, and then just hold it with that inventory we have for nearly a decade at 200,000 barrels a day. And at that point, depending on oil price, it generates between $750 million and $1 billion of free cash flow. So, it just becomes this massive cash annuity for a very long time. And that is the strategy. Get it up to that level and just hold that cash annuity position with our inventory as long as we can. Operator : Our next question comes from Noel Parks with Touhy Brothers. Noel Parks : I was wondering if you could maybe walk through some of the components of the resource estimate increase. You took it from 9 billion barrels to 10 billion barrels for the project. And just particularly interested, at the announcement, you said that some of that came from new discoveries, like Cataback. But I\u2019m just wondering the degree -- well, two things, the degree that maybe derisking from the most recent drilling help contribute to the incremental increase. And also, maybe you could drill down a little bit on sand quality in the most recent discovery. The porosity is the consistent -- consistent with your predrill analysis, et cetera? John Hess : Yes, Greg. Greg Hill : Sorry. I was on mute for a second. Look, I think the resource estimate was a combination of a lot of things. Obviously, the big things were Whiptail-1 and Whiptail-2 and Pinktail and Cataback. So, those were the primary drivers of taking that number from the greater than 9 billion to approximately 10 billion. So, that was the majority of the change, that move. I think it\u2019s important to also remember that in spite of that, there\u2019s still multibillion barrels of additional upside above and beyond this 10 billion barrels already. Regarding sand quality, it\u2019s all very good. I mean, everything we\u2019ve discovered this year has extraordinary sand quality. As we mentioned, the Cataback well, the last well that we announced, had 102 feet of oil-bearing sand, but 243 feet of hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs. And also, Whiptail-1 was 246 feet, Whiptail-2 167 feet. So, these are very large, very high quality reservoirs in all three of those discoveries. So, there\u2019s no issues with sand quality or reservoir quality in any of those wells. Noel Parks : I\u2019m just wondering, in the more recent discoveries, anything you can -- you have been able to extrapolate, I guess, maybe just from the consistency among the findings? Does that help inform your optimism for future drilling and as you step out further? Greg Hill : Sure. I think, what it confirms is that that entire eastern seaboard is what I like to call it from Turbot all the way to Liza and further north is just great reservoir rock. And so, part of our strategy going forward in 2022 will be to continue to build out the prospectivity that we see and continue to explore in those very high-quality upper Campanian reservoirs that I just talked about. The second objective we will have in 2022 is to get more penetrations in the deep. That\u2019s the one with the most uncertainty now. As we mentioned in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll drill a well called Fangtooth that\u2019s specifically aimed at the deep stratigraphy. And when I say deep, it\u2019s lower Campanian, upper Santonian, which is about 3,000 feet deeper than those upper Campanion reservoirs. And then the third objective of our 2022 exploration and appraisal program is continue to appraise all these outstanding discoveries that we\u2019ve made, right? So, appraise, explore upper Campanion, explore the deeper reservoirs. Those are our three primary objectives next year. Operator : Our next question comes from David Heikkinen with Pickering Energy. David Heikkinen : I just wanted to check a couple of things on Yellowtail. Have you guys finalized, is it 45 or 55 wells with the 8 different subsea sites? Just again, trying to narrow down on what the total cost is going to be as we\u2019re putting estimates together? Greg Hill : Yes. No, that\u2019s still under discussion with the partnership exactly what that configuration will be. And as we said, when we take final sanction, we\u2019ll be able to share all those details as to what the final project actually looks like. John Hess : And to follow up on the point that Greg was making, Yellowtail has world-class economics and returns because we\u2019re covering a lot larger resource. So, while people are talking -- focused on cost, they should be focused on the resource, which is a lot higher. Once we get the FTP, we can give granularity on that. And again, the breakeven is going to be between $25 and $32 per barrel Brent. David Heikkinen : Yes, it\u2019s a much bigger barrel extent, it looks like. John Hess : Exactly. David Heikkinen : A huge area of being developed with that versus Payara, even. And then it was very helpful to put together the kind of incremental capital year-over-year. I did my math right, is that roughly $2.5 billion before exploration expense? John Rielly : No, that increase that I gave before. So, it was 500 combined Bakken and Guyana and then 200 with Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. So, 700 from our 1.9, and that includes exploration. David Heikkinen : Okay. I thought\u2026 John Rielly : Yes, no problem. And then, obviously, I just always have to point out what Phase 2 comes on, we\u2019re picking up that at $60 Brent, $1 billion of additional cash flow there, so. And then, Bakken, obviously, we\u2019re going to pick up some additional cash flow as well from the higher production. David Heikkinen : And that\u2019s before a potential fourth rig in the Bakken that would get you upto 200,000 barrels equivalent a day? John Rielly : That\u2019s correct. David Heikkinen : Perfect. I\u2019ve got my numbers right, now. Thanks, guys. John Hess : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Josh. Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today\u2019s conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess\u2019 annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today\u2019s conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. On the call with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. In case of any audio issues, we will be posting transcripts of each speaker\u2019s prepared remarks on www.hess.com following the presentation. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Hess. John B. Hess: Thank you Jay. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I hope all of you and your families are well and staying healthy. Today I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy and provide a look at the year ahead. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations and John Rielly will cover our financial results. 2022 marks an inflection point in the execution of our strategy as we go from investment mode to return of capital mode while still being able to invest to grow our business. Our strategy has been and continues to be to deliver high return resource growth, deliver a low cost to supply, and deliver industry leading cash flow growth while at the same time maintain our industry leadership in environmental, social, and governance consensus disclosure. In terms of resource growth, we have been disciplined in allocating capital to the best stocks for the best returns and it builds the differentiated portfolio focused on the Bakken, Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Southeast Asia, and Guyana with its multiple phases of low cost oil developments. We expect all four of these assets to be free cash flow generative in 2022.  In terms of the low cost of supply, because of the investments we are making, our cash cost by 2026 are forecast to decline approximately 25% to $9 per barrel of oil equivalent versus 2021. And our portfolio breakeven is positioned to be one of the lowest in the industry in 2026 decreasing to $45 per barrel of Brent. In terms of cash flow growth, we have an industry leading rate of change and durability story. We are positioned to grow our cash flow at a compound rate of 25% per year out to 2026 based upon a Brent price of $65 per barrel and any business that can grow its cash flow at twice the rate of its topline is a business you want to have in your investment portfolio.  Our company has been in the investment mode for the last several years, building on our portfolio to where it can deliver durable cash flow growth. The Liza Phase 2 project, which is on track for first oil this quarter, will add $1 billion of net operating cash flow annually at $65 Brent. Following project start up, we plan to repay the remaining $500 million of our term loan and to increase our base dividend. As our portfolio becomes increasingly free cash flow positive in the coming years, our top priority will be both to grow the base dividend and also accelerate our share repurchases. Key to our strategy is Guyana, the industry\u2019s largest new oil province discovered in the last decade, which is positioned to be one of the highest margin, lowest carbon intensity oil developments globally according to a study by Wood Mackenzie. The world will need these low cost, high value resources to meet growing energy demand, particularly given underinvestment by our industry in recent years. The International Energy Agency\u2019s latest World Energy Outlook provides multiple scenarios for addressing the dual challenge of growing the global energy supply by about 20% over the next 20 years and reaching net zero emissions by 2050. In all of the IEA scenarios, oil and gas will be needed for decades to come and significantly more investment will be required, much more in renewables and much more in oil and gas. A reasonable estimate for global oil and gas investment from these IEA scenarios is approximately $450 billion each year over the next 10 years. In 2020, that number was $300 billion. Last year\u2019s investment was $340 billion. So while investors and oil and gas companies need to remain capital disciplined, we also need to invest more in oil and gas than we are currently to ensure an affordable, just and secure energy transition. Turning to our plans for the year ahead, our 2022 capital and exploratory budget is $2.6 billion, of which approximately 80% will be allocated to Guyana and the Bakken. On the Stabroek Block in Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we continue to see the potential for at least six floating production storage and offloading vessels or FPSOs in 2027 with a production capacity of more than 1 million gross barrels of oil per day and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. Our three sanctioned oil developments on the block have a Brent breakeven oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. In terms of our Guyana oil developments, production capacity at the Liza Phase 1 development is expected to increase to more than 140,000 gross barrels of oil per day following production optimization work. The Liza Phase 2 development is on track for startup this quarter with a gross production capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day. Our third development on this Stabroek Block at the Payara Field is on track for production startup in 2024, also with a gross capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day. The Yellowtail development has world class economics and will be the largest to date on the Stabroek Block, developing nearly 1 billion barrels of oil, with a gross production capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day. The Yellowtail project continues to make progress, has the full support of the Government of Guyana, which is finalizing its third party review, and remains on track for production startup in 2025. We will continue to invest in an active exploration and appraisal program in Guyana in 2022, with approximately 12 wells planned for the Stabroek Block. Earlier this month, we announced two more significant discoveries on the block at the Fangtooth and Lau Lau wells. With these discoveries, the gross discovered recoverable resource estimate for the block is more than 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. Positive results at Fangtooth, our first standalone deep exploration prospect, confirm the deeper exploration potential of the block. Both discoveries further underpin our queue of future low cost development opportunities. In the Bakken, we plan to operate a three rig program in 2022, which will enable us to generate significant free cash flow, lower our unit cash costs, and further optimize our infrastructure. Greg and our Bakken team continue to do an outstanding job of applying lean manufacturing principles to keep driving down costs and building a culture of innovation and efficiency. We will also continue to invest in our operated cash engines offshore. In the Gulf of Mexico, we will drill the Huron-1 exploration well and also a tieback well at the Llano field, and in Southeast Asia, we will invest in drilling and facilities, some of which was previously deferred due to COVID and low commodity prices. We are proud of our workforce for living the Hess values by working safely and delivering strong operating results especially during the pandemic. As we continue to execute our strategy, our commitment to sustainability will remain a top priority. Our Board and senior leadership have set aggressive five year targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction for 2025. Most recently, we have endorsed the World Bank\u2019s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative and have set a target to eliminate routine flaring from our operations by the end of 2025. We are honored to have been recognized throughout 2021 as an industry leader in our environmental, social, and governance performance and disclosure. In December, we achieved leadership status in CDP\u2019s Annual Global Climate Analysis for the 13th consecutive year and in November earned a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the 12th consecutive year. In summary, 2022 marks an inflection point in the execution of our strategy. We have built a differentiated portfolio offering a unique value proposition, delivering durable cash flow growth that enables us to continue to invest in some of the highest return projects in the industry and also to start growing our cash returns to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Gregory P. Hill: Thanks, John. 2021 was another year of strong operating performance and strategic execution for Hess. Starting with reserves, proved reserves at the end of 2021 stood at 1.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Net proved reserve additions in 2021 totaled 348 million barrels of oil equivalent, including positive net price revisions of 107 million barrels of oil equivalent, resulting in an overall 2021 production replacement ratio of 295% and a finding and development cost of approximately $5.25 per barrel of oil equivalent. Now turning to production. In the fourth quarter and full year 2021, company-wide net production averaged 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya in line with our guidance. For the full year 2022, we forecast net production to increase by 12% to 15% and average between 330,000 and 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. For the first quarter of 2022, we forecast net production to average between 275,000 and 285,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. This forecast reflects the impacts of severe weather in the Bakken, remedial maintenance work at the Baldpate and Penn State fields in the Gulf of Mexico, and planned downtime on the Liza Destiny FPSO for production optimization work. Companywide net production is forecast to significantly increase over the course of the year driven both by Guyana and the Bakken, with the fourth quarter expected to average between 360,000 and 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  In the Bakken, both fourth quarter and full year 2021 net production were in line with our guidance, averaging 159,000 and 156,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day respectively. We have a robust inventory of approximately 2,100 drilling locations in the Bakken that can generate attractive returns at $60 WTI, representing approximately 70 rig years of activity. In 2022, we plan to operate three rigs and expect to drill approximately 90 gross operated wells and bring approximately 85 new wells online. In the first quarter of 2022, we plan to drill approximately 22 wells and bring 10 new wells online. For the balance of the year, we expect to bring online an average of 25 wells per quarter. In 2021, our drilling and completion cost per Bakken well averaged $5.8 million, which was $400,000 or 6% lower than 2020. In 2022, we expect to fully offset anticipated inflation through lean manufacturing and technology driven efficiency gains, and therefore D&C costs are expected to be flat with last year at approximately $5.8 million per well. For the full year 2022, we forecast Bakken net production to average between 165,000 and 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 6% to 9% increase over 2021. First quarter net production is forecast to average between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Beginning in the second quarter we expect to benefit from the addition of the third rig, which we added last September, and improving weather conditions. Net Bakken production is forecast to steadily ramp over the course of 2022 and to average between 175,000 and 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter. Moving to the offshore, in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2021, in line with our guidance. The Deepwater Gulf of Mexico remains an important cash engine for the company as well as a platform for growth. In 2022, we will resume drilling operations after a two-year hiatus, with one tieback well planned at the Shell-operated Llano Field, and one exploration well planned at the Hess-operated Huron prospect on Green Canyon Block 69. Over the last five years, we have focused our efforts on getting best in class imaging across our acreage position in Northern Green Canyon, where we believe there is high potential for multiple, high-return hub class Miocene opportunities. Huron is the first of these opportunities, which attracted interest from multiple parties during the farmout process.  We expect to spud Huron in the first quarter, with Hess having a 40% working interest as operator and Shell and Chevron at 30% each. As part of our agreements with Shell and Chevron, we have also accessed additional Miocene prospects across Green Canyon and are excited about further potential in the play. In February, Shell plans to spud the Llano-6 development well, in which Hess has a 50% working interest. The well will be tied back to Shell\u2019s Auger platform, with gross production from the well expected to build to a plateau rate of between 10,000 and 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of this year. For the full year 2022, we forecast net production in the Gulf of Mexico to average approximately 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. First quarter net production is forecast to average between 30,000 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Southeast Asia, net production from the Joint Development Area and North Malay Basin, where Hess has a 50% interest, averaged 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 61,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2021, in line with our guidance. For the full year 2022, we forecast net production in Southeast Asia to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the first quarter, we forecast net production to average between 60,000 and 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Turning to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator. We have continued our extraordinary run of exploration success and increased our estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources to more than 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Net production from Guyana averaged 31,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 30,000 barrels of oil per day for the full year 2021, in line with our guidance. For the full year 2022, we forecast net production in Guyana to average between 65,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil per day. In the first quarter we forecast net production from Guyana to average between 25,000 and 30,000 barrels of oil per day reflecting planned downtime on the Liza Destiny for production optimization as previously mentioned, and net production in the fourth quarter will increase to between 85,000 and 90,000 barrels of oil per day. Earlier this month we announced significant discoveries on the Stabroek Block at Fangtooth and Lau Lau. Positive results at Fangtooth, our first standalone deep exploration prospect, help confirm the deeper exploration potential of the Stabroek Block. In the coming months, we will complete the analysis of the exploration well results. Appraisal activities will then be conducted to determine the optimum development approach and timing. Lau Lau further underpins our queue of future low-cost development opportunities in the Southeastern portion of the Stabroek Block. This discovery will also require appraisal to determine the ultimate development approach and timing. We continue to see multi billion barrels of exploration potential on the Stabroek Block and in 2022, we plan to drill approximately 12 exploration and appraisal wells that will target a variety of prospects and play types. These will include lower risk wells near existing discoveries, higher risk step outs, and several penetrations that will test deeper Lower Campanian and Santonian intervals. Exploration wells planned for the first quarter of 2022 include; Barreleye-1, located approximately 20 miles Southeast of Liza. The primary target is lower Campanian with shallow and deeper secondary targets. The well spud on December 30th. Tarpon-1, located approximately 63 miles Northwest of Liza, will target lower Campanian clastics, plus a deeper Jurassic carbonate. The well will spud following completion of Fangtooth operations. Patwa-1 is near our Turbot area discoveries. The well is approximately 3 miles Northwest of the Cataback-1 discovery, with targets in upper Cretaceous clastic reservoirs. This well is anticipated to spud in March. Lukanani-1 is in the Southeastern part of the Stabroek Block, located approximately 2 miles west of Pluma and is anticipated to spud in March. The primary target is Maastrichtian age clastic reservoirs, with secondary objectives in lower Campanian reservoirs. The appraisal program in 2022 will be focused on delineating future developments. First quarter appraisal activities will include the Tilapia-2 appraisal well, located approximately 24 miles Southeast of Liza-1. The well will appraise the February 2019 Tilapia-1 discovery in the Turbot area and is anticipated to spud in March. In addition, we plan to conduct drill stem tests at Tilapia-1 and Pinktail-1. Turning now to our Guyana developments. Development activity this year will include drilling for both the Liza Phase 2 and Payara projects. Initial development drilling activities will also begin for the Yellowtail project following approval of the Field Development Plan by the government. A planned turnaround will be conducted in March on the Liza Destiny FPSO. Work activities will include production optimization work, designed to increase the vessel\u2019s production capacity. At Liza Phase 2, the Liza Unity FPSO vessel is undergoing final hookup and commissioning after arriving in Guyanese waters in October 2021. Unity is on track to start production in the first quarter of 2022 with a capacity of approximately 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. With regard to our third development, at Payara, the overall project is 66% complete. SURF activities are progressing ahead of plan and we are preparing for a 2022 installation campaign. The hull for the Prosperity FPSO vessel is complete, and topside construction activities are ongoing in Singapore for planned production start-up in 2024. The Field Development Plan and Environmental Impact Assessment for the fourth potential project, Yellowtail, have been submitted for government and regulatory review. The government is supportive of the project and startup remains on track for 2025. We look forward to continuing to work with the Government of Guyana and our partners to realize the extraordinary potential of this world class project. Moving to Suriname, planning is underway for our second exploration well on Block 42 at the Zanderij-1 prospect targeting the Santonian and Deep play potential. The operator, Shell, has indicated that they expect to drill the well around mid-year. We see the acreage as a potential play extension from the Stabroek Block, with similar play types and trap styles. Shell, Chevron and Hess each have a one third working interest in Block 42. In closing, our execution continues to be strong. The start-up of Liza Phase 2 and steadily increasing production in the Bakken are expected to drive an approximate 30% increase in net production between the first quarter and fourth quarter of 2022 along with a significant increase in operating cash flow, which will underpin our commitment to increase cash returns to shareholders. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John P. Rielly: Thanks Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the third quarter of 2021 and provide guidance for 2022. Turning to results, we had net income of $265 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with $115 million in the third quarter of 2021. On an adjusted basis, third quarter net income was $86 million which excludes an after-tax gain of $29 million from the sale of our interests in Denmark. Turning to E&P, E&P had net income of $309 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with adjusted net income of $149 million in the third quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the fourth and third quarter were as follows; higher sales volume increased earnings by $158 million. Higher realized selling prices increased earnings by $103 million. Higher DD&A expense decreased earnings by $44 million. Higher midstream tariff expense decreased earnings by $22 million. Higher cash costs decreased earnings by $21 million. Higher exploration expenses decreased earnings by $10 million. All other items decreased earnings by $4 million. For an overall increase in fourth quarter earnings of $160 million. For the fourth quarter, our E&P sales volumes were over lifted compared with production by approximately 690,000 barrels which increased after-tax income by approximately $17 million.  Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with $61 million in the prior quarter. Midstream EBITDA, before non-controlling interests, amounted to $246 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with $203 million in the previous quarter. Turning to our financial position, at quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.71 billion, and total liquidity was $6.3 billion including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.1 billion. In the fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $886 million compared with $631 million in the third quarter, primarily due to higher realized selling prices and sales volumes. In the fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities after changes in operating assets and liabilities was $899 million compared with $615 million in the third quarter. In October, we received net proceeds of $108 million from the public offering of 4.3 million Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream. In January 2022, we paid accrued Libyan income taxes and royalties of approximately $470 million related to operations for the period December 2020 through November 2021. Post the startup of the Liza Phase 2 development, we intend to pay off the remaining $500 million on our term loan and increase our dividend. With our strong cash and liquidity positions, and our industry leading cash flow growth, we are well positioned to significantly improve our credit metrics and increase cash returns to our shareholders in the coming years. We remain committed to returning the majority of our increasing free cash flow to shareholders through further dividend increases and share repurchases. Now turning to guidance. First for E&P, we project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $13.50 to $14.00 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter reflecting the impact of lower companywide production and higher initial per-unit costs for Liza Phase 2 during its production ramp following first oil. Cash costs, excluding Libya, for the full year 2022 are expected to be in the range of $11.50 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent as the low cost Guyana production reduces our unit cash costs in the second half of the year as Liza Phase 2 reaches capacity.  DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $11.50 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and $11.50 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $25 to $26 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and $23 to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year 2022. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the first quarter and $170 million to $180 million for the full year. The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $285 million to $295 million for the first quarter and $1,190 million to $1,215 million for the full year 2022. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million for the first quarter and $300 million to $310 million for the full year 2022. For calendar year 2022, we have purchased WTI collars for 90,000 barrels of oil per day with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $100 per barrel. We also have entered into Brent collars for 60,000 barrels of oil per day with an average monthly floor price of $65 per barrel and an average monthly ceiling price of $105 per barrel. We expect non-cash option premium amortization, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices, to reduce our results by approximately $55 million per quarter, or approximately $225 million for full year 2022. In the first quarter we expect to have three liftings from Guyana with two lifts coming from the Liza Destiny and our first lift from the Liza Unity expected to occur at the end of March. In the second quarter, we expect a total of five liftings. After the Liza Unity reaches full production, which is currently projected for the third quarter of this year, we expect to have eight liftings per quarter in Guyana from these two FPSOs. For the full year 2022, we expect 24 liftings in Guyana. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $650 million in the first quarter and approximately $2.6 billion for the full year 2022. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $65 million to $70 million for the first quarter and $275 million to $285 million for the full year 2022. For corporate, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the first quarter and $120 million to $130 million for the full year. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million for the first quarter and $350 million to $360 million for the full year 2022. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking questions. Good morning. Our first question is on cash return for John Hess. How are you thinking about the trajectory of the base dividend increases, in the past, you've commented that the majority of your shareholders think that the base dividend needs to be higher than the estimates, but any more color on where your target is on that? And then for the buybacks, you've been pretty clear that the base dividend is the first priority, but is the catalyst for more meaningful share repurchases, is that really Payara coming online in 2024, but you could maybe initiate them on an earlier but more modest level and then accelerate them? John B. Hess: Jeanine, thank you. In terms of our return of capital framework, once the lease of Phase 2 is up and producing oil, we will pay off the $500 million remaining on our term loan and we'll start to increase our base dividend. At that time, we'll also communicate our return of capital framework, not just where we want to take the dividend but also how we plan on returning our free cash flow. As a reminder, as you have said earlier, we've been consistent in saying that our cash flow compounding as it does, we intend to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders by further increasing our dividend and also accelerating share repurchases. And in terms of the dividend itself, the base dividend as our cash flow grows, we plan to have a dividend that will have a meaningful premium to the S&P 500 dividend yield. Jeanine Wai : Okay, great. Thank you for that color. Our second question maybe for John Rielly, it's on Libya, and just maybe a housekeeping clarification thing. The release indicated that in January Hess paid accrued Libyan income tax and royalties of 470 million, and that was related to operations from last year. Can you just provide a little bit of color on this and what if anything more we can expect for the rest of 2022? John P. Rielly: Sure, Jeanine. Basically, we had tax and royalties related to our production on the Waha concessions. And these taxes and royalties were held by Hess and our other Waha partners after receiving instructions from the Libyan authorities to withhold payment. Then, just recently the authorities instructed us to make those payments so we did release it. Hess and our partners released those taxes and royalties paid during January as it was mentioned in the release and I mentioned earlier in my discussion. Going forward, this is just normal taxes and royalties related to our production. It's typically paid monthly. We expect it to be paid monthly here in 2022. So that's what I would say the go forward is. And just so you know, I mean, all those things are just normal taxes and royalties, they were all accrued, all in earnings, all in cash flow from operations during 2021. John B. Hess: And, and as a reminder, Jeanine, Total recently announced the sale of our interests in Libya, to both Total and ConocoPhillips. And we are still awaiting final approval from the government on that sale. Jeanine Wai : Great, thank you. John B. Hess: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram with J.P. Morgan. Arun Jayaram : Yeah, good morning. John, for you as you talked about adopting a formal capital allocation returns framework kind of near-term. And I was wondering if you could give us maybe some insights on how you're thinking about this. Some of your E&P peers have a very formulaic approach to this, while some of your major peers are a little bit more flexible. So I was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit of thoughts on how are you and the Board are thinking about that? John B. Hess: Yeah, no. It is a great question. We will be coming out with a framework that will be pretty clear about how we allocate capital, but also how we intend and how much we intend of our free cash flow to return. It will have some flexibility in it. But it will be very clear of our commitment to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders. By further increasing the dividend they will have their first piece in the dividend, once lease of Phase 2 is up and running and producing oil. But then we will intend as our cash flow compounds, the majority of that free cash flow go back to our shareholders by further increasing the dividend and also accelerating the share repurchases. I think the return of capital framework when we announce it will be clear and help provide clarity to the question you're asking. Arun Jayaram : Great, and just my follow up is on Guyana. Greg, you mentioned that the Yellowtail project could include resources of a billion barrels. So I wonder if you could kind of compare how this development looks like relative to Payara. I think the subsea kits are a bit more to let bigger of an FPSO. So maybe give us some thoughts on how this could look like. And then as well as maybe provide some insights on the objectives of the 2022 exploration program in Ghana, it looks like you're maybe targeting some more elephants, but I wanted to get some thoughts on those two questions? Gregory P. Hill: Sure. So let me take your second question first Arun. So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the objectives of the program this year are twofold, like they always have been. The first one being to explore for new opportunities. So that includes things in the upper Campanian, but also more penetrations in the deeper section that we saw as Fangtooth, right. And so if you look at the 12 wells that we're going to do this year, about two thirds of those wells are exploration wells, and about one third is appraisal wells. So pretty active this year on the exploration side. And again, we're going to be testing deeper zones and also shallower zones with that exploration program, and I kind of lined out that the first quarter my opening remarks as to where we're headed with that. And then appraisal, of course, is about appraising the existing discovery so that we can figure out what that development cue is for the playout of the vessels, the up to 10 FPSOs that we've talked about. Now, if I get back to your question on Yellowtail so first of all, the Yellowtail developments, world class economics will be the largest to date on the Stabroek Block. It's as you mentioned, it's going to develop new nearly a billion barrels of oil, have a gross capacity of 250,000 barrels a day. So it's got a little bit bigger top sides and it's also got more wells. So Payara has 41 wells, whereas Yellowtail will have 51 wells. So it's just a bigger project, very large area of extent, very fantastic reservoir. So it's going to be one of the, again, the world class economics. John B. Hess: Yeah, some of the highest returns in the oil industry, comparing it to Shell or comparing it to offshore developments, and just going to have a breakeven cost that will be lower than Payara. Arun Jayaram : Great, thanks a lot gents. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I don't know if it's too late to say Happy New Year, but Happy New Year everybody. So, John or Greg, I'm not sure who wants to take this but I want to ask a portfolio question given you touched on the Libya news earlier. You have a very, very large footprint in the Gulf of Mexico. Obviously, you've taken advantage of [indiscernible] when no one else cared, and so on. But when I look at Payara, Yellowtail adding essentially five times the current production in the Gulf of Mexico, I got to ask if the Gulf of Mexico is a keeper longer term for the portfolio, given the effort that has to be put into maintaining the production and so on. So just long term thoughts on whether the Gulf stays in the portfolio? John B. Hess: Yeah, Greg. Gregory P. Hill: Yeah, sorry, took me a second to get off on mute. So Doug, as we talked before, the Gulf of Mexico remains an important cash engine and platform for growth for Hess. We have top quartile capability in both Deepwater drilling and project delivery in the Gulf. And so our objective is maintain that cash hub, sustained production and cash flow generation through both tie backs, and also selectively pursuing these high return hub glass exploration opportunities, hopefully, here on would be the first cap off the rank there. And as you said, we've been selectively rebuilding our Gulf of Mexico portfolio, acquire more than 60 lease blocks at that really low prices. And that's, again, that balance of high return tie back opportunities have class prospects, it remains a very important province for Hess, good returns in the Gulf of Mexico, and as I mentioned, we do have the capability to execute well, there. So it's a core hold for us. Doug Leggate : Okay, that's very clear. Appreciate the answer. My follow-up is actually a balance sheet question so it's probably John Rielly question. John, I'm just curious, when you think about the scale of the free cash flow that you're going to be able to generate, you still carry in absolute terms a sizable amount of debt. What do you see as the right level of debt, where does the priority sit in the cash return framework to actually bring that debt down to, let's say, sector leading levels like some of your peers, and they're talking about zero net debt, for example? John P. Rielly: Sure, Doug. So as you know, right, once we start up Liza Phase 2, we are going to pay off the remaining $500 million of that term loan. Then our next maturity because we've got a liquidity position is until 2024, and it's $300 million. We do intend, as you said with our rising free cash flow to pay off that maturity in 2024, and then we don't have really another debt maturity until 2027. So we're happy when we pay off that 2024 amount with the absolute level of debt that we have. And if we -- let me just say it like $65 Brent and we run this out, we bring Payara on and obviously other FPSOs, we're going to drive our leverage down to under 1 times debt to EBITDAX. That's gross, debt to EBITDAX. So we're going to have really a strong, low leverage position, improving credit metrics, as I mentioned earlier. So we are happy with that debt level, that absolute debt level as our EBITDAX grows from there. And so there's no real benefit. We've run NPVs on doing some things with either just doing paying off the debt at this point. But right now, with our low leverage, we are very comfortable with leaving the debt levels where they're at. And then like we said, with that balance sheet, so strong at that point and the rising free cash flow from Payara, from Yellowtail, from the development we will then increase returns to shareholders, obviously, with the rising free cash is more of that free cash flow return versus will be share repurchases, but we'll also be growing our dividend over the time too as well. So I think we're in a really good position for this with Guyana coming on these low-cost development, strong balance sheet, and increasing return of capital to shareholders. Doug Leggate : Great, appreciate the answer fellows. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Good morning team. A couple of questions here. Good morning John. Our first one is around Liza 2. We're weeks away here from start-up. How do you think about any gating issues around the start-up and just can you give a sense from an operational standpoint, how is it going around construction at Payara as well, so just any thoughts around the logistics of getting these assets turned on? John B. Hess: Yes, Greg, please. Gregory P. Hill: Yes, sure. So let me just talk about Phase 2 first. So we'll have 19 wells available at start-up. Those are all ready to go. All the risers have been recovered. So they're hooked up into their ports now. We've got a few left to commission so we've still got some commissioning of those risers. The FPSO topside readiness is nearly complete. So Neil, what that means is we are on track for that first quarter startup as we said in our opening remarks. And if you look at Payara, again, it's still relatively early in the project, but right now we're running slightly ahead of schedule in Payara. So I would say we're firmly on track for that 2024 startup. So the project is about 66% complete as we sit here today. So we're in good shape. But again, it's early days in Payara so I think the operator having some contingency in there is wise at this point, but on track for 2024 startup. Neil Mehta : Thanks Greg and the follow-up here is for John, and John on the hedging strategy here. So you did provide an update around the collars and increased the ceiling price there. Just talk about how you think about the optimal way to approach hedging is and John, if you don't mind, tying that into your own view of the oil macro as you've been constructive, you were near 90 Brent, is anything changing for the better or the worse relative to what you've talked about over the last couple of months? John P. Rielly: Sure, Niel. I'll start and then hand it over to John Hess. But our hedging strategy, it really is consistent with what we're doing with our past strategy. So as we continue to invest in our world-class opportunity in Guyana, we want to ensure that we have significant price protection, which we did in 2022. So just to reiterate, we have 90,000 barrels of oil per day with WTI puts at a floor of $60. And then we have 60,000 barrels a day of Brent puts at a floor of $65. Now this year, we did use high ceiling calls so we have a call at $100 for the WTI and $10 per Brent to reduce the cost of the program while retaining exposure basically to greater than $2 billion in additional cash flow in the case of higher oil prices above the hedged floor. So in addition, we haven't hedged all of our oil production and obviously, we have unhedged NGL and gas production as well that will benefit from higher prices. So when I say this is consistent with our strategy, we provide significant downside protection while also giving the majority of upside to our shareholders as we continue to invest the opportunity in Guyana. John B. Hess: Yes, Neil. And obviously, it does reflect a constructive view on the market and very consistent with our approach of protecting the downside and giving the majority of the upside to our shareholders. On the macro oil outlook, on the demand side, V-shaped recovery, temporary setback of about 1 million barrels a day globally because of Omicron, starting to see cases going down, thank God. We think we'll be back at pre-COVID global demand levels of 100 million barrels a day in the next month or so. And as the year unfolds, we see jet demand increasing as international travel increases and probably see a number of about 102 million barrels a day by the end of 2022. Supply side is different, it's a U-shape recovery, more sticky. Shale is growing but at a more tempered pace function of the rig count of about 604 U.S. rigs operating. We think that adds about 750,000 barrels a day over the year of increased oil production. Remember, U.S. production probably end up at the end of the year about 12.2 million barrels a day, that's still short of the 13 million barrels a day we had pre-COVID. So shale is on the recovery, but not at pre-COVID levels in terms of absolute U.S. oil production. OPEC sounds like they're going to stick to their 400,000 barrels a day increases each month as has been written by a number of commentators. A couple of countries are not meeting their quotas there. So again, I'd say, disciplined tempered recovery in OPEC plus, discipline tempered recovery in shale all of which adds up to global oil inventories, which had been a year and half ago, in April, $1.2 billion excess inventories globally. That's all been eaten up and now we see global oil inventories about 200 million barrels less than pre-COVID levels. So as you go through this year, with demand increasing, inventory is tight, not much spare capacity in OPEC plus, we're pretty constructive on the oil market. And really, the oil price is giving a signal that investment has to increase, which is why I referred to the World Energy Outlook earlier.  Depending upon what scenario you pick, any credible scenario from the International Energy Agency, more investment is going to be needed to grow oil and gas supply to meet global oil and gas demand. And currently, we're not investing enough as an industry to do that. So we're going to have to have the right balance of being capital disciplined, returning capital to shareholders, but at the same time grow the resource and grow the production capacity of the world. So that's the challenge that we have ahead. And I think that also really presents a constructive oil market as the year unfolds. Neil Mehta : Thanks John. John B. Hess: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. You may proceed with your question. Paul Cheng : Hey guys, good morning. I guess two questions, one for Greg and the other one is for John Rielly. Greg, when you're looking at Fangtooth and other that you also have penetrated the different formation, is there anything you can tell us that in terms of the oil and gas ratio, in terms of the permeability, oil quality comparing to the more shale formation, is there any significant differences that we see or any kind of conclusion that you can share? Gregory P. Hill: So Paul, I guess the first thing I'd say is the positive results at Fangtooth which was our first standalone deep exploration prospect and remember, it's up towards lease, so it's kind of in that country. So very good oil quality, and it confirms the deeper exploration potential of the Stabroek Block. So in the coming months, we're going to complete the analysis of that well, the Fangtooth well and then plan appraisal activities to really determine the best development approach. So generally, we see these deeper zones as being developed through a combination of standalone developments and tiebacks potentially to existing FPSOs. So very encouraged, very pleased by the results we saw at Fangtooth. Also remember, we had other penetrations prior to Fangtooth into those deeper zones that confirmed the same thing, good reservoir quality and good crude properties. So very excited. That's why we're going to drill a lot more wells in kind of the deeper prospectivity this year than years past. And so watch this space, but we're encouraged by the outcome in particular about Fangtooth. Paul Cheng : Well, we understand that it's good, but is there any contrast or comparison you can provide in terms of the gas oil ratio, the grade of the oil and the permeability and the kind of data that you can share? Gregory P. Hill: No, not at this point because again, we need to do some more analysis of the wells and do some more appraisal of particularly in the Fangtooth area. Paul Cheng : Okay. The second question is for John Rielly that, by the fourth quarter you indicated that your unit cost is going to come down a lot because Guyana these are two went to the full capacity and all that. So what's the contract unit cost that you have by the fourth quarter in Guyana? And also that have you looked at -- I know you guys talking about next year that you may start the buyback. But have you between the variable dividend and the buyback and that the plus and minuses that have you -- that why you decided that variable dividend is not a better tool then the buyback is the right tool for the company? I'm not saying that it should be variable dividend. Just curious how the internal debate that has been the case? John P. Rielly: Sure. So let me start with cash costs. So through the year, as I said and you mentioned, our unit costs will be dropping basically as Guyana Phase 2 comes online and it's lower cost. Let me just remind you where the costs are for Guyana. On Phase 1, obviously, it's a smaller boat and what we've been saying is that the cash cost per barrel there were $12. However, you did hear us mention that we're doing the production optimization work. So that 20 gross capacity is going up. So the cash cost per barrel for Phase 1 will be decreasing as that production optimization is completed. On Phase 2, the cash cost per barrel are $10 per barrel for Phase 2 when it is fully up and running. I also should mention that both of these is when we're leasing the FPSO. So Phase 2 will actually drop down to $7 to $8 post purchase of the FPSOs. But for this year around $10. So you have cash costs for Phase 2 $10 and you've got Phase 1 under $12. And what it does, along with increasing production in the Bakken is by the fourth quarter, our cash cost will drop to around $11 per barrel for the company in the fourth quarter. And then I'll pass it over to John. John B. Hess: Yes. Paul, is some -- is that you, Paul? Paul Cheng : Yes. Yes. John B. Hess: Okay. Yes. No, we were getting some feedback. In terms of the dividend, we've done studies. We don't think the variable dividend sustains the creation of long-term value. We believe strengthening the base dividend and consistent share repurchases are a better way to go. And in terms of the timing on that, as I said, once Liza Phase 2 is up and producing, we paid the $500 million of remaining debt off from our term loan. We will increase our base dividend. We will start the process of that increase. And then as you look forward in time, further dividend increases and accelerating share repurchases will be a function of market conditions and the growth in our cash flow. So the framework for that will be very clear and I think something that will be very competitive. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you John. John Rielly, can I go back into your -- when you're talking about the Guyana unit cost, wondering that what is the time line in terms of when do you -- the consortium we designed to buy back the FPSO or that I mean, for both Liza 1 and Liza 2? And secondly, that when you're talking about those number, $12 for Phase 1, $10 for Phase 2, are those that -- what is the denominator on that, is that based on, say, in Phase 2, 220,000 barrels per day but your actual reported in your financial statement will be different or that this is what you expect to report in your financial statement? John P. Rielly: Okay. So answering your last question first. Yes, that's what will be reported in our financial statements. So that's our, if you want to call it, our net cash cost on our entitlement production in Guyana. So those are those numbers. And as far as the FPSO purchases, the operator, ExxonMobil is still in discussions with SBN on the actual date of the purchases of the FPSOs. And we'll give you the specific timing of that when that is set. But having said that, as you noted, when our 2022 CAPEX release, we don't expect any purchases in 2022 or in 2023. Paul Cheng : Thank you. John P. Rielly: You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. David Deckelbaum : Thanks John. Thank you guys for squeezing me in here. I will try to make it quick. I had one question just on the reserve report. It looked like your net additions were organically at the drill bit, like $241 million, where you noted in the press release were primarily from the Bakken. Is that just reflecting increased gas capture or have there been some performance revisions there as well? John B. Hess: John... Gregory P. Hill: No, there have been -- go ahead. John B. Hess: Go ahead, Greg. You go first. Gregory P. Hill: Yes. So look, there were both performance additions in the Bakken plus we brought additional wells into our five-year plan due to price increase, which was 107. But then the other wells bringing in. So if you look at the Bakken, we had adds of about $209 million and then the price of about $119 million, specifically to Bakken, right? So both performance adds and also bringing additional wells into the five-year plan. David Deckelbaum : Great, thanks. Appreciate the color on that, Greg. And then maybe for John, just my last question. Just around -- you've laid out the time line for paying down the $500 million term loan. I noted the fact that you don't really have that many maturities beyond. As, I guess, the free cash profile ramps here, you talked about getting sub one times leverage which we have on our numbers at a run rate sort of in that 2Q, 3Q time frame, should we be thinking about investment grade sort of coinciding sort of with midyear? And how do you think about the tangible benefits from that outside of the obvious of refinancing some of that higher cost debt stack? John P. Rielly: So again, with our growing free cash flow and obviously, our growing cash flow and our growing free cash flow, our debt metrics are going to significantly improve as -- and basically, as each FPSOs comes on. And like I said, we are targeting to be on a gross debt to EBITDAX under one, and we will achieve that as the cash flow grows. Now I can't specifically say with the rating agencies on timing. Obviously, we are investment grade with two of them, and we're below on one, but have a positive outlook with the one. So I do expect, as our cash flow improves, that we'll become investment grade and actually we'll improve from where we are today as our cash flow grows. So what we try to do from our own strategy standpoint is we want to have a strong balance sheet, obviously, to fund the growing resource base that we have and also for further return to shareholders. So from our standpoint, that will be the outcome of our strategy of having a low leverage, strong liquidity position, which you mentioned as well. And then as each FPSO comes on, it will just continue to improve and it will improve our credit metrics as well as still providing increasing cash returns to shareholders. So the portfolio is set to be in a nice spot. As John has mentioned earlier, it is kind of the inflection year, and we'll expect to grow on it from here. David Deckelbaum : Appreciate the answers guys. John B. Hess: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Good, thanks. Maybe just a couple of quick ones. I know as we think about the medium-term outlook in the Bakken, I know you've talked about eventually wanted to get back to a four-rig program and a production plateau closer to 200,000 barrels a day. How much impact does the price of oil have on the timing of adding a fourth rig, is that something that would be possible by the end of this year, if prices stay high or is that further down the line? John B. Hess: Go ahead, Greg. Gregory P. Hill: Yes. Again, Ryan, I think as we've talked before, the role of the Bakken in the portfolio is to be a cash engine. So any decisions on pace or timing of addition of the fourth rig is going to depend upon corporate cash flow needs and also returns. Now having said that, assuming prices hold at this relatively high level, we would look to add that fourth rig next year. And by doing so, we could then take the Bakken to 200,000 barrels a day and with the inventory we have at four rigs, we could hold that flat at broadly that 200,000 barrels a day for almost a decade with that fourth rig. Now at 200,000 barrels a day, we really maximize utilization of the infrastructure. So that would be another objective to fill that infrastructure up and, of course, at these prices the Bakken becomes this massive cash generator. And at that 200,000 barrels a day, even at $60 to $65, it generates about $1 billion of free cash flow. So you can see the real cash firepower of the Bakken. Ryan Todd : Thanks Greg. And then maybe -- I appreciate the comments on cost inflation and well cost in the Bakken earlier. As you think about the rest of the portfolio, any comments on what you're seeing in terms of service or material cost in place in an offshore environment, particularly as we think about upcoming potential project sanctions? John B. Hess: Greg, please? Gregory P. Hill: Yes, sure. So like the onshore, we're also seeing some inflation in the offshore. However, recall the majority of our offshore portfolio right now is driven by Guyana. And of course, the projects currently in development are covered by EPC contracts that were largely insulated from cost increases in the offshore -- current cost increases in the offshore plus ExxonMobil with this design one build strategy is just doing an outstanding job of delivering efficiencies across that portfolio down there as well. If you look at our -- in the Gulf of Mexico, the rig that's going to drill the Heron well, $255,000 day rate. So I think that still reflects the low cost on a relative basis of the offshore drilling. Ryan Todd : Thanks for the help. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Bob Brackett : Good morning all. I had a question around Payara, and I'm going to try to type a date and a percent completion. So if I'm not incorrect, Payara was sanctioned maybe five quarters ago. First production is expected maybe eight-plus quarters from now, but at the same time, it's 66% complete. So if those numbers are right, can you talk about maybe the rate limiting steps for Payara and maybe for future developments? John B. Hess: Good morning Bob, great question. Greg, it's yours. Gregory P. Hill: Sure, yes. Bob, so Payara, I think, what's different about Payara is there are three offshore installation campaigns. So yes, the project is 66% complete. But because there are three installation campaigns, you will build a little bit more contingency into that project because while you don't have hurricane issues or anything down there, you do have some current issues, offshore currents during the installation campaign. So that's why there's still contingency in Payara. We agree with the operator that that's the appropriate thing to do at this stage of the project. And so we are firmly on track for a 2024 startup. A little ahead right now, but again, it's early days. Bob Brackett : Understood. Is there a good rule of thumb for the number of development wells, a drillship in Guyana can do in a year? Gregory P. Hill: You mean in terms of drilling? Bob Brackett : Yes. Gregory P. Hill: No Bob, it's really kind of bespoke. Some of these horizontals are longer than other ones, for example in some of these developments. So there's not a great rule of thumb that I would say because, again, each development is very bespoke on not only the length of the horizontals, but also what reservoirs they're tapping into as well. Bob Brackett : Okay, fair point. And thanks all. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Noel Parks with Tuohy Brothers. Noel Parks : Good morning. I just had a general question about the exploratory program this year. I was wondering what's the next most informative data point you're looking for out of the program because there's quite some large step-outs there so there's a possibility for aerial expansion. And then it also sounds like some of the particular formations you're going at are, I believe, the first time you're going to be tapping them in Guyana. And so I was wondering if any of these really opens up a lot of new doors, if it meets or surprises your expectations? John B. Hess: Yes. Greg? Gregory P. Hill: No, I think again, the objectives of this year's program is A) to continue to do kind of the upper Campanion expiration, but also most importantly is to get more penetrations in the deep. So the deep penetrations that we're going to be watching closely, and these are wells that we're going to spud in the first quarter are Barreleye 1 which is a lower Campanian primary target, but it's also got some shallower things as well. And then Tarpon 1 which is another lower Campanion well plus deeper Jurassic carbonate feature that we see. And then kind of in the upper Campanion space is Lukanani-1 but it also has some objectives in the lower Campanian reservoirs. And then finally, Patwa-1 which has got some targets in the upper cretaceous reservoir. So you can see it's a mixture play types. So I wouldn't want to call one out specifically and say, \"Oh, that's the most significant.\" They're all significant in this year's program. They're all very promising wells on seismic. Noel Parks : And then are most of those deeper targets then, things that you've identified largely through seismic or are any of them -- are your expectations informed any of them by actual analogies you have or have already seen? Gregory P. Hill: No, I think they're all -- they all have seismic features, right. So the primary driver down here is their seismic signature. Now obviously, as we've gotten more data in the deep, we're getting better at teasing out what that seismic is going to show us. And the additional data we pick up from these deeper wells will improve that even more kind of as we go forward. Noel Parks : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from David Heikkinen with Pickering Energy. David Heikkinen : Good morning guys and really just making sure that I'm thinking about this correctly. You all continue to be cash taxpayers in the U.S. and Malaysia and then continue to build a cost pool at a faster pace given your spending in the ring fencing in Guyana for the next couple of years. Just thinking $80-plus oil 2022 and 2023 is, you got this, call it, the hug of higher oil prices but a bunch of higher cash taxes, but you're already essentially a full payer is the way we're thinking about it, is that correct? John P. Rielly: David, no. So for us, we are not cash taxpayers in the U.S. We have a net operating loss carryforward. And I would -- yes, I don't see us paying cash taxes even with these high prices, let's just say, for five years and beyond. So that's where we are in the U.S. The only place that we really are paying cash taxes is in Southeast Asia, and that's -- it's a small amount in the portfolio. David Heikkinen : I think I said that opposite. Sorry, I got a little brain... John P. Rielly: No, no. The only thing you would see is in our -- when you're looking at it because I always do it ex-Libya. Libya obviously has a 93.5% tax rate. So that's the one place that we are paying cash taxes. And then the Guyana taxes are actually within the PSC. So it's in the economics and in our net entitlement so we pay them there. David Heikkinen : Yes, you just keep building a cost pool for the next three years even at these prices. John P. Rielly: Correct. David Heikkinen : Yes. Okay, thanks guys. I think I said that opposite. My apologies. John B. Hess: No, no problem. David Heikkinen : You have answered my question. Thank you all. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Phillips Johnston with Capital One. Phillips Johnston : Hey guys, thanks. Just one question for Greg on the production outlook. You guys have a large ramp throughout the year, and I know you don't give specific guidance on oil production, but just wondering if you could help us with the oil mix in both the Bakken and the Gulf of Mexico and how those numbers should trend throughout the year? I realized the Bakken mix can fluctuate depending on gas capture and NGL prices, but just from a high-level perspective, should we stick with around 50% of the Bakken and around 65% or so for the Gulf of Mexico for the rest of the year? Gregory P. Hill: Yes. So let's address the Bakken first. So first of all, the mix at the wellhead is constant at around 65% and will be for the next several years for us in the Bakken. And that's because we still have a lot of undeveloped well locations. Now you're right, when you get to the corporate results, it goes to 50% and that's because of increased gas capture and our third-party volumes and our pup contracts and all that, that's how you get to the 50%. So at a corporate level, broadly, you could assume that that's going to be the same mix. And you're on target for the Gulf of Mexico kind of that 65% or so mix in the Gulf. Phillips Johnston : Okay, perfect. Thanks Greg. Gregory P. Hill: Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess' annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website.  On the line with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. In case there are audio issues, we will be posting transcripts of each speaker's prepared remarks on www.hess.com following the presentations. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Welcome, everyone, to our first quarter conference call. Today, I will review our continuing progress to execute our strategy. Greg Hill will then discuss our operations, and John Rielly will cover our financial results. With Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the spotlight has been put on energy security and the critical importance of oil and gas to the global economy. Energy security is essential for an orderly energy transition. Oil markets were tight even before the Russia-Ukraine conflict. We have now had 7 consecutive quarters of global oil inventory draws, and at the end of March, global oil inventories were estimated to be more than 400 million barrels less than pre-COVID levels. The world is facing a structural oil supply deficit, and the only way to address it is through more industry investment and that will take time to have an impact. According to the International Energy Agency, a reasonable estimate for global oil and gas investment is at least $450 billion each year over the next 10 years to meet demand. In 2020, that number was $300 billion and last year's investment was $340 billion. So to ensure an affordable, just and secure energy transition, we need to invest significantly more in oil and gas. And we also must have government policies that encourage investment rather than discourage it. In a world that will need reliable low-cost oil and gas resources now and for decades to come, Hess is in a very strong position, offering a differentiated value proposition. Our strategy is to deliver high-return resource growth, deliver a low cost of supply and deliver industry-leading cash flow growth, while at the same time, maintain our industry leadership in environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. Our successful execution of this strategy has uniquely positioned our company to deliver long-term value to our shareholders by both growing intrinsic value and growing cash returns. In terms of resource growth, we have built a balanced portfolio focused on the Bakken, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Southeast Asia and Guyana. With multiple phases of low-cost oil developments coming online in Guyana and our robust inventory of high-return drilling locations in the Bakken, we can deliver highly profitable production growth of more than 10% annually over the next 5 years. Our expanding high-quality resource base positions us to steadily move down the cost curve. Our 4 sanctioned oil developments in Guyana have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. And by 2026, our company portfolio breakeven is forecast to decrease to a Brent oil price of approximately $45 per barrel. In terms of cash flow growth, we have an industry-leading rate of change and durability story. Based upon a flat Brent oil price of $65 per barrel, our cash flow is forecast to increase by approximately 25% annually between 2021 and 2026, more than twice as fast as our top line growth. Our balance sheet will also continue to strengthen in the coming years with debt-to-EBITDAX expected to decline from less than 2x in 2022 to under 1x in 2024. Our financial priorities are : first, to have a disciplined capital allocation process so that we invest only in high-return, low-cost opportunities; second, to maintain our investment-grade credit rating and have a strong cash position and balance sheet to ensure that we can fund our world-class investment opportunities in Guyana; and third, to return up to 75% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders. With the successful start-up in February of the Liza Phase 2 oil development offshore Guyana, which at capacity will add $1 billion of net operating cash flow annually at a $65 Brent oil price. In late February, we repaid the remaining $500 million of our $1 billion term loan scheduled to mature in March 2023. And on March 1, we increased our regular quarterly dividend by 50%. In April, Hess received total net proceeds of $346 million from the secondary offering of Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream and the sale of Hess-owned Class B units to Hess Midstream. Post these transactions, Hess owns approximately 41% of Hess Midstream. To manage oil price volatility, we have hedged 150,000 barrels per day of oil production for 2022, 90,000 barrels of oil per day with $60 per barrel WTI put options and 60,000 barrels of oil per day with $65 per barrel Brent put options. Given the significant increase in volatility and liquidity risk in the oil markets following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in March, we removed the $100 WTI and $105 Brent call options that we previously had in place. Hess is now positioned to fully benefit on the upside while remaining protected on the downside. As our portfolio becomes increasingly free cash flow positive in the coming years, we commit to return up to 75% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders, with the remainder going to strengthen the balance sheet by increasing our cash position or further reducing our debt. We plan to continue increasing our regular dividend to a level that is attractive to income-oriented investors but sustainable in a low oil price environment. As our free cash flow generation steadily increases, share repurchases will represent a growing proportion of our return of capital. Key to our strategy is Guyana, the industry's largest oil province discovered in the last decade. According to a study by Wood Mackenzie, Guyana is one of the highest-margin, lowest carbon intensity oil developments globally. As discussed earlier, the world will need these low-cost oil resources for decades to come to meet future energy demand. On the Stabroek Block in Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, a number of important milestones were recently achieved. Current production at the Liza Phase 1 development is 130,000 barrels of oil per day, ahead of its original gross nameplate capacity. And following production optimization work on the Liza Destiny FPSO is expected to increase to more than 140,000 barrels of oil per day over the course of this quarter. The Liza Phase 2 development, which achieved first oil in February, is ramping up ahead of schedule and expected to reach its gross production capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day by the third quarter. Our third development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara field with a gross capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day is also ahead of schedule and is now expected to start up in late 2023. In early April, we announced the sanction of the Yellowtail development after receiving government and regulatory approvals. The Yellowtail development has world-class economics and will be the largest to date on the Stabroek Block. The project will develop an estimated resource base of approximately 925 million barrels of oil and have a gross production capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day, with first oil expected in 2025. Front-end engineering and design work for our fifth development at Uaru Meco is underway, and we anticipate that ExxonMobil will be in a position to submit a plan of development to the government by the year-end. We want to thank and congratulate ExxonMobil for their outstanding work as operator in delivering exceptional project management and execution. According to a Wood Mackenzie study, the production growth ramp for the Stabroek Block is the best in the industry compared with other major deepwater developments, which will benefit the people of Guyana and our shareholders. We continue to see the potential for at least 6 floating production storage and offloading vessels, or FPSOs, on the block in 2027 with a production capacity of more than 1 million gross barrels of oil per day and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. In terms of exploration and appraisal in Guyana, we continue to invest in an active exploration program with approximately 12 wells planned for the Stabroek Block in 2022. In January, we announced 2 more significant discoveries on the block at the Fangtooth and Lau Lau wells, which further underpin our of queue of future low-cost development opportunities. Yesterday, we announced 3 additional discoveries at Barreleye, Lukanani and Patwa, which further strengthens the development potential of the block. With these discoveries, the gross discovered recoverable resource estimate for the block has been increased to approximately 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up from the previous estimate of more than 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. Now turning to the Bakken, where we have an industry-leading position with approximately 460,000 net acres in the core of the play. We are currently operating a 3-rig program. Given the strength of the oil market and the world's need for more oil supply, we will give serious consideration to adding a fourth rig later this year, which would accelerate our production ramp-up to approximately 200,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, a level which will maximize free cash flow generation, lower our unit cash costs and optimize our infrastructure. As we continue to execute our strategy, our commitment to sustainability remain a top priority. We are honored to have been recognized as an industry leader in diversity, equity and inclusion in January with a top score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index for 2022, as well as earning a place on the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the third consecutive year. In summary, our differentiated portfolio is uniquely positioned to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth and financial returns in the coming years. As our portfolio becomes increasingly free cash flow positive, we commit to prioritizing the return of capital to our shareholders through further dividend increases and share repurchases.  I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. Let's begin with several positive developments on the Stabroek Block that have created significant long-term value for the people of Guyana and our shareholders. Current production on the Liza Destiny FPSO is 130,000 barrels of oil per day, ahead of its original base nameplate capacity and is expected to increase to more than 140,000 gross barrels of oil per day over the course of this quarter. Production on the Liza Unity FPSO is ramping up ahead of schedule and is expected to reach its gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day by the third quarter. The Payara development is also ahead of schedule and is now forecast to start up in late 2023 versus 2024 previously. Pulling forward production start-up reflects strong execution by the operator and significantly enhances the net present value of the project. The Payara development will utilize the Prosperity FPSO with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day. In April, we sanctioned the Yellowtail development. This project is designed to develop 925 million barrels of oil and will utilize the 1 Guyana FPSO with a gross capacity of 250,000 barrels of oil per day and first oil is planned in 2025. We have also made 5 additional discoveries this year, which have increased the estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources to approximately 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent. We have also faced some challenges this year in the form of transitory weather issues in the Bakken and cost inflation across our portfolio. In March, we revised our Bakken and company-wide first quarter and full year 2022 production guidance lower to reflect impacts from severe weather in North Dakota as well as higher NGL prices in the first quarter, which enhanced profitability but reduced production entitlements under our percentage of proceeds contracts. These weather conditions continued in April but are transitory, and we expect to recover and resume normal operations over the balance of the second quarter. Like our competitors, we are also seeing upward cost pressure across both our onshore and offshore business. We are mitigating many of the effects through lean manufacturing, strategic partnerships with key service providers and technology-driven cost efficiency gains. Nevertheless, we now expect additional cost inflation of approximately 3% to 4% on our 2022 capital program, including higher drilling and completion costs in the Bakken that we now expect to average approximately $6.2 million per well or 7% above last year. Of course, higher oil prices are also driving much higher earnings and cash flow. Now let's review our operating results and forecast. In the first quarter, company-wide net production averaged 276,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was above the high end of our revised guidance range of 270,000 to 275,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day that we provided in March. For the second quarter, we forecast that company-wide net production will average approximately 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is 12% above last quarter. For the full year 2022, we now forecast our company-wide net production to be at the low end of our 325,000 to 330,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day guidance range due to the previously mentioned weather impacts in the Bakken in April. In the Bakken, net production in the first quarter averaged 152,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our revised guidance of 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  In the first quarter, we drilled 19 wells and brought 13 new wells online. In the second quarter, we expect to drill approximately 22 wells and to bring approximately 18 new wells online. And for the full year 2022, we expect to drill approximately 90 gross operated wells and to bring approximately 85 new wells online. For the second quarter, we forecast that Bakken net production will average between 140,000 and 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and that our full year 2022 net Bakken production will be near the bottom of our previous guidance range of 160,000 to 165,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, again reflecting the severe weather impacts. Net production in the Bakken, however, is expected to build in the second half of the year, reaching 175,000 to 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, with more wells online and improving weather conditions. We plan to bring approximately 54 new wells online in the second half of this year compared with 31 wells in the first half. It's also important to note that well results have been strong with IP180s and EURs comparable to last year's results. As John mentioned, we're giving strong consideration to adding a fourth operated drilling rig later this year. Moving to the Gulf of Mexico. First quarter net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was within our guidance range of 30,000 to 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the second quarter, we expect to maintain net production of approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  And for the full year 2022, we forecast net production to average between 30,000 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting the addition of the Shell-operated Llano 6 well in which Hess has a 50% working interest late third quarter. The well will spud in May by Shell and will be tied back to Shell's Auger platform, with gross production from the well expected to build to a plateau rate of between 10,000 and 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of the year. The Gulf of Mexico is an important cash engine and a platform for growth for the company. We have multiple options for tiebacks to over -- to our 3 Gulf of Mexico hubs, including both infill and near-field exploration prospects. Recent acquisition and processing and proprietary ocean bottom node 3D seismic across all 3 areas has identified opportunities for drilling in 2023 and beyond. In terms of -- for Mexico exploration, we spud the Huron-1 well in February on Green Canyon Block 69, where we are targeting a hub class Miocene opportunity. Results are expected during the second quarter. Hess is the operator with a 40% working interest and Shell and Chevron each have a 30% interest. Moving to Southeast Asia. First quarter net production was 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, in line with guidance. Second quarter and full year 2022 net production are forecast to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now turning to Guyana. Our discoveries and developments on the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, are world-class in every respect with some of the lowest project breakeven oil prices in the industry. First quarter net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil per day, which was at the high end of our guidance range of 25,000 to 30,000 barrels of oil per day.  As a result of the Liza Phase 1 optimization work and the continued ramp-up of Liza Phase 2, we forecast second quarter net production from Guyana to average between 70,000 and 75,000 barrels of oil per day and to increase to 85,000 to 90,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter. Our full year 2022 net production guidance for Guyana remains unchanged at between 65,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil per day. Turning to exploration. In January, we announced significant discoveries on the Stabroek Block at Fangtooth and Lau Lau wells. Positive results at Fangtooth, our first stand-alone deep exploration prospect, will help confirm the deeper potential of the block. Lau Lau further underpins our queue of future low-cost development opportunities in the southeastern portion of the Stabroek Block. Yesterday, we announced discoveries at Barreleye, Lukanani and Patwa, all of which will require appraisal but will further underpin future developments on the block. Upcoming wells in the second quarter will include CBOB targeting Campanian reservoirs and located 10 miles south of Yellowtail; and Kiru targeting Campanian and Santonian reservoirs and located 3 miles southeast of Catabac. A Fangtooth appraisal well is also planned for the fourth quarter of this year. Moving to Suriname. Planning is underway on Block 42 for drilling the Zanderi-1 prospect around midyear. The well will target both Campanian and Santonian aged reservoirs. We see the acreage as a potential play extension from the Stabroek Block with similar play types and trap styles. Hess, Chevron and Shell, the operator, each have a 1/3 interest in the block. In closing, while we are managing some short-term issues with weather and cost inflation, our long-term outlook has never been brighter. Our distinctive strategy and world-class portfolio have positioned us to deliver differentiated value to our shareholders for many years to come.  I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2021. We had net income of $417 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared with $265 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. On an adjusted basis, first quarter net income was $404 million, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings of $13 million included in corporate interest and other. Turning to E&P. E&P had net income of $460 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared with $309 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The changes in the after-tax components of E&P earnings between the first quarter of 2022 and fourth quarter of 2021 were as follows : higher realized selling prices increased earnings by $227 million; lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $154 million; lower DD&A expense increased earnings by $62 million. All other items increased earnings by $16 million for an overall increase in first quarter earnings of $151 million. For the first quarter, our E&P sales volumes were underlifted compared with production by 945,000 barrels, which decreased our after-tax income by approximately $40 million. Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $72 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared with $74 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Midstream EBITDA before noncontrolling interest amounted to $241 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared with $246 million in the previous quarter. Turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $1.37 billion and total liquidity was $4.94 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $5.61 billion. In April, we received total net proceeds of $346 million from the public offering of approximately 5.1 million Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream and the sale of approximately 6.8 million Hess-owned Class B units to Hess Midstream. Pro forma for these 2 transactions, our cash balance at quarter end, excluding Midstream, was approximately $1.7 billion. In the first quarter of 2022, [indiscernible] provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $952 million compared with $886 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the first quarter of 2022 decreased cash flow from operating activities by $1.1 billion, reflecting payments made for previously accrued Libyan income tax and royalties of approximately $470 million for the period December 2020 through November 2021, premiums paid of $325 million to remove the ceiling price on outstanding WTI and Brent crude oil collars effective April 1, 2022, and an increase in accounts receivable due to higher crude oil prices. In the first quarter, capital expenditures for E&P and Midstream totaled $580 million. And in February, we repaid the remaining $500 million outstanding of our $1 billion term loan. With the payoff of the remaining balance on the term loan, our leverage stands at 1.6x E&P debt to EBITDAX. Our goal is to reduce our leverage to under 1x E&P debt to EBITDAX. Based on our projected cash flow growth at $65 Brent, we expect to achieve this target in 2024 while continuing to increase returns to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases. Turning to 2022. In the first quarter, we sold 2.3 million barrels of oil from Guyana and expect to have seven 1 million-barrel liftings in the second quarter and eight 1 million-barrel liftings in both the third and fourth quarters. This ramp in liftings from Guyana is expected to result in significant cash flow growth over the next 3 quarters. Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P. Our E&P cash costs were $13.79 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $14.54 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the first quarter of 2022. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $15 to $15.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter, reflecting planned maintenance and workover spend in the Gulf of Mexico and North Dakota and higher price-driven production taxes.  For the full year, cash costs, excluding Libya, are expected to be in the range of $13.50 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent compared with prior guidance of $12.50 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent, primarily due to the impact of price-driven production taxes and the expectation production comes in at the low end of our full year production guidance. DD&A expense was $10.96 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $11.54 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the first quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $12 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter and full year guidance of $11.50 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent is unchanged. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $27 to $28 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter, and $25 to $26.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year 2022. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million in the second quarter, and full year guidance of $170 million to $180 million is unchanged. The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $290 million to $300 million for the second quarter, and full year guidance of $1,190,000,000 to $1,215,000,000 is unchanged. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million for the second quarter and $460 million to $470 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $300 million to $310 million due to higher commodity prices. We expect noncash option premium amortization, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices, will be approximately $165 million for the second quarter and approximately $550 million for the full year, inclusive of the additional premiums paid to remove the previous ceiling price on outstanding crude oil hedging contracts for the remainder of this year. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $750 million in the second quarter. As Greg mentioned earlier, we are considering adding a fourth rig in the Bakken, which could add up to $100 million to our 2022 capital budget of $2.6 billion in the second half of the year. And we also expect industry cost inflation to potentially add another $80 million to $100 million for this year. We will provide an update on our capital spend during our second quarter conference call. Turning to Midstream. We anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million for the second quarter. And the full year is expected to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million, which is down from previous guidance of $275 million to $285 million, reflecting the impact of the Midstream capital transactions completed in April. Turning to corporate. Corporate expenses are estimated to be approximately $30 million for the second quarter, and full year guidance of $120 million to $130 million remains unchanged. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million for the second quarter and $345 million to $355 million for the full year, which is down from previous guidance of $350 million to $360 million due to the repayment of the remaining $500 million outstanding on our $1 billion term loan. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : I guess I've got 2 questions, if I may. So I mean, Guyana just continues to get better and better, obviously, with the accelerated timing on Payara perhaps. But my question is really about the line-of-sight you guys have through 2027, at least. You still talk about 6 FPSOs, 6 development phases, but your production guidance or outlook is still a little bit different from what the operator ExxonMobil is saying. So I'm curious if you can just help us close the gap. Is it plateau rates? Is it more conservative assumptions? What's the difference? Because clearly, it seems to us that your guidance is more realistic than what the operator is saying at this point. John Hess : Yes, Doug, great question. I think ExxonMobil will be addressing that on their call, I understand, but we're sticking to the guidance that we gave, which by 2026 will be -- '27 will be over 1 million barrels a day of capacity. And I'd say that's a conservative number. Doug Leggate : Concur completely. Thanks, John, for the clarification. My follow-up is related to the hedging buyout. And it's kind of an obtuse question, I guess. But the fact that you no longer have the upside cap on the hedges and the forward curve for both oil and gas is inflected in the way that it has, what does that do to the timing of your inflection to paying cash taxes in the U.S.? Has it changed any? John Rielly : No, Doug. It really has not changed. If you read our 10-K, so we do have a U.S. net operating loss in excess of $16 billion here for the U.S. So from a cash tax payment, the horizon really hasn't changed, so we do not anticipate paying cash taxes in the next 5 years or more. Doug Leggate : I was going to say if I said 10, would I be wrong? John Rielly : I don't want to go out that far, Doug, but yes, nothing in the near term. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : Couple of questions. And I think with Payara, the schedule is being pushed forward. John, you talked about the potential inflation impact for 2022 as well as the fourth rig that [indiscernible]. How about for the Payara? The good thing is that you accelerate the development. How about in terms of the budget impact? GregHill: So Paul, as you know, those contracts are EPC contracts, right? So a lot of those costs are locked in. There has been inflationary pressures on the tubulars, in the drilling side. But again, I want to complement ExxonMobil. They're doing a fantastic job of driving efficiencies to offset a large part of those cost gains. So we should be in good shape. John Rielly : Yes. And just to add to that, Paul, we don't have anything really right now from an add to our 2022 capital budget related to Payara. The Guyana developments are actually -- this is really just great execution by Exxon and SBM. So there's been no add to our budget for this acceleration of the Payara start-up. Paul Cheng : Yes. John, I think obviously that this is early to talk about, 2023 CapEx and activity level, but can you give us maybe some guidance in terms of direction and give your take that the CapEx directionally, how that is going to move? John Rielly : Yes, sure. So again, with this year, right, let's just do a reasonable approximation, as Greg mentioned, 3% to 4% inflation so that's $80 million to $100 million on this year, plus adding the fourth rig, which we're giving serious consideration to, up to $100 million. So look, let's talk this year with an approximation around $2.8 billion. And then I just have to remind everybody going back like to the Guyana lifts, with 2 lifts in the first quarter, 7 in the second, 8 in both the third and fourth, that we're -- even with any increase in our capital budget, we're going to have significant cash flow growth and significant free cash flow growth throughout this year. Then start talking about next year. Now with Payara coming forward, it obviously accelerates our cash flow growth from our previous profile. So again, this durability story on our cash flow growth really can -- goes out, as John was mentioning earlier, to 2027. So when you look at the capital increase for next year, so what that really means if we accelerate this fourth rig in, and if I can just round it to $100 million, typically adding a rig is $200 million, rule of thumb. So for a full year, you're going to add another $100 million then to -- from Bakken standpoint. Then Guyana, to your point, I just want to say you did say it's early so this is early, but clearly, there will be some increase in Guyana capital, nowhere near matching this increase in cash flow growth that will be happening because at that point, now you're going to have finishing up work on Phase 2 but then you're going to have Payara in full swing. You got Yellowtail and then really that fifth FPSO that we talked about. So we're going to have those 3 FPSOs in capital. So there will be an increase, can I say, several hundred million in that capital in Guyana as you move into next year. Should be some offsets then. Southeast Asia down a little bit from this year. But that's kind of a rule of thumb, I would say, Paul. But the biggest thing for us is we've got this just increase in cash flow starting really next quarter with Guyana and now with Payara coming next year. First, we have Phase 2 and Phase 1 operating at full capacity and then Payara coming in, so significant cash flow growth tied into some additional capital. Paul Cheng : John, should we assume next year, the inflation will add maybe another 5% to 10% to the core, so if this year is $2.8 billion, should we assume that inflation will add at least another $200 million? John Rielly : So the way I would look at it is we picked up this inflation for the second half of the year. It's really -- that's what's happening. A lot of it, we did have some tubular steel kind of locked up in the first half, and we're seeing some increases now going into the second half of the year. So we're picking it up for half the year. I don't necessarily think you then need to double this as you move forward. We'll see what happens with oil prices and basically industry investment, too, for next year. So at this point, I wouldn't want to guide to that kind of level, Paul. And again, we do everything we can with lean and with different technology as well as, again, a lot of these contracts for Guyana, as Greg mentioned, we've kind of fixed these prices that we have so far. So at this point, I think it's early for us to talk about what the inflation will be next year. Paul Cheng : Can I just sneak in a real short accounting question? John Rielly : Sure. Paul Cheng : So when are you guys going to start booking income tax in your U.S. operation, given the substantially higher commodity prices that we see? John Rielly : Okay. So as mentioned previously, from a cash tax standpoint, we will not be incurring cash taxes, let me just say, for 5 years or anything in the near term. To your point, what happens now with higher prices and more income here in the U.S., we have a full, what we call, sorry, this is going to be accounting technical, valuation allowance against that net operating loss. So there will come a point in time where we will release that valuation allowance, effectively book a big gain, increase equity. And then what would happen is, as you use the NOL, we would be recording deferred tax expense. The exact timing of that, Paul, I don't know at this point. But again, this would all be noncash from that standpoint. Operator : Your next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JP Morgan. Arun Jayaram : Yes. My first question goes back to the Yellowtail FID. Greg, you FID-ed that with Exxon at a gross cost of $10 billion, which is, call it, $1 billion more than Payara yet. You're doing a lot more wells, 51 versus 41, a lot more resource and we are in a more inflationary environment. So I was wondering if you could kind of walk through the cost numbers at Yellowtail, which was a little bit lower than we were thinking, just given some of the inflationary pressures. GregHill: So again, as when we announced Yellowtail, remember, it's got a $29 breakeven, so this project is world-class. And Arun, it is, it's exactly what you said. Costs are a little higher because, of course, it's a bigger ship. You've got 30,000 more capacity on the oil side and also on the injection and water side. So it's a much bigger boat to start with. As you mentioned, there's more wells. There's more subsea manifolds associated with those wells. So it's really all just that extra kit that has been the primary driver. Wasn't a whole lot of inflation that we saw coming through the Yellowtail line. It's more just scope and scale. Exciting it's on track for 2025 start-up. The hole is actually done. It's sitting in Indonesian waters, waiting to come into Singapore as soon as Payara is complete and it floats away. But again, it's a world-class project, $29 a barrel breakeven. And of course, remember, it's developing 925 million barrels of reserves versus Payara that was 600 million, right? So for all those reasons, a little bit higher cost but extraordinary world-class economics. Arun Jayaram : Great. And just my follow-up, Greg, I was wondering if you could just maybe give us a little bit more detail on some of the transitory weather issues in the Bakken. We're seeing, call it, gas flows are running, call it, 400 million a day in the basin versus 2.1 Bcf a day or so, which is more typical. So can you give us more details on the weather event and how this is impacting you and the rest of the industry in April and maybe any implications for the rest of the year? GregHill: Yes. Well, of course, that's why we lowered our guidance for the second quarter and also lowered our year-end to be more at the bottom end of our guidance of 160 to 165 in the Bakken. Hey, it's been a tough winter with record storms in March and April, and of course, that has impacted our production. But Arun, it's not our first weather rodeo in the Bakken. It's transitory. We'll fully recover over the course of the quarter and then really be back on track to deliver our Q4 production in the range of 175 to 180, and that's a 15% increase in Q1. So again, it's transitory. We've been through this before. Just take a little time but we're on our way back. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : Our first question is on cash returns, and our second, maybe we'll hit back on Guyana. On the cash terms, so you've committed to returning up to 75% of free cash flow through dividends and buybacks. You're already above the $1 billion reserve cash level. So can you talk about how you see the allocation between dividend increases and buybacks? And what are really the gating factors for starting the buyback? And I guess maybe on that, like how do you avoid the common investor concern that buybacks are cyclical? We've been hearing a lot more of that pushback recently. John Hess : Sure. No. Great question, Jeanine. I think a couple of perspectives on this. Obviously, we have a unique value proposition that we offer, which is industry-leading cash flow growth of compounding 25% a year each year out for the next 5 years based upon $65 Brent. So we certainly can see the visibility of our cash flow growth compounding and our free cash flow along with it. In terms of the timing of the share repurchases and commencing that, look, based upon market conditions and our significant cash flow growth that John Rielly was discussing earlier, we will give serious consideration to commencing our share repurchases this year. And as we look forward, we plan to continue increasing our regular dividend to a level that is attractive to income-oriented investors, as we said, but also sustainable in a low price environment. And as our free cash flow generation steadily increases, share repurchases will represent a growing proportion of our return of capital. We will try as best we can to be opportunistic in buying our stock, buying more on dips. But at the same time, we do have a commitment to, on an annual basis, to return 75% of our free cash flow annually. But as you look forward, we'll continue to grow our dividend and then the greater proportion of our return of capital will be share repurchases. And based upon the market and cash flow growth for this year, we'll give serious consideration to moving forward with our share repurchases this year. Jeanine Wai : Terrific. And then maybe going back to Guyana on the discoveries that you announced last night. Can you just maybe discuss how the results compare to your expectations, especially since 2 of those wells, they were pretty meaningful step-outs and we were also very interested in your commentary on the high-quality of oil versus just the hydrocarbon bearing oil or hydrochain reservoir feet? GregHill: Thank you for the question. We're very pleased with the results. As you mentioned, Barreleye, 230 feet of hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs and 52 feet of that was high-quality oil bearing. Lukanani, 115 feet of sandstone, 76 of which was high-quality oil-bearing, so very, very pleased. And as you mentioned, it does -- these are further step-outs. And I think what it does show is just how massive this accumulation is down in Guyana, and it just keeps getting bigger and better as we continue to grow. And then we talked about Patwa, 108 feet of hydrocarbon-bearing sandstone reservoirs. Now what do all 3 of these mean? Well, they basically have allowed us to increase expected gross recoverable hydrocarbons to approximately 11 billion barrels, including Fangtooth and Lau Lau that we announced earlier in the year. Now how and when these resources will get developed to be a function of appraisal drilling results and development studies, but we are very pleased with the results of all of the wells that we've seen this year, met or exceeded all of our expectations. Operator : Your next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : A lot of the questions have been asked already, so I'll do 2 quick ones here. The first is, as you think about taking up that fourth rig in the Bakken, any gating factors in terms of executing it? Certainly, the commodity price environment would suggest it could make sense, but just any questions around that -- comments around that. And the second is, John, any perspective on the relationship you have from a regulatory and a fiscal perspective in Guyana. It seems like that has been stable, but given it represents a disproportionate amount of the asset value, we always want to stay on top of any inflections that might be happening there. GregHill: Yes. Thanks for the question, Neil, about the fourth rig. So we don't anticipate any bottlenecks or issues in getting that rig going. We're in active discussions with our contractors and suppliers up there so we're in really good shape. So why would we want to add that fourth rig? Well, given the high prices and world demand for oil, the world needs the oil, plus as you and I have talked before, that fourth rig would allow us to optimize our in-basin infrastructure, increase production to about 200,000 barrels a day. And as you recall, with our extensive inventory of high-return wells, we could hold that plateau for almost a decade and generate significant free cash flow from the Bakken as a result. So that's the logic for the fourth rig. We do not see any issues getting that fourth rig started up with crews or availability equipment or anything. So we're in good shape. John Hess : Yes. And Neil, in terms of the Guyana government, our company and our joint venture have an excellent working relationship, a very constructive one with the government. Testament is the early April approval of Yellowtail. The government has been very clear with us that they would like us as a joint venture to accelerate the development of their oil resources to basically improve the prosperity and have shared prosperity for all Guyanese citizens. So it's a very constructive working relationship. It continues. We also want to help the government in social responsibility as well, trying to make a better future for all Guyanese. So it's an excellent relationship and we continue to work with them. And as I said before, ExxonMobil has done an outstanding job on project management and execution, bringing a lot of value forward for our joint venture, for the people of Guyana and for our shareholders in the excellent achievements they've had in terms of being really ahead of schedule now on Liza Phase 1, ahead of schedule on Liza Phase 2, ahead of schedule on Payara. And that track record is to the benefit of the Guyanese people as well as our shareholders. Operator : Your next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Seems like the Bakken fourth rig thing has been hit quite a bit, but I do have just 1 question on that. What, at this point, would be the reason for not pulling the trigger on that at some point this year? Meaning would it be hard to get a rig in the Bakken with crew and all the other associated items you need or is it just an internal decision on your part? GregHill: No. Really, it's related to operations because really the best time to build locations is after the ice-out is over. So we'll go in and build those locations, get some new pads ready for that rig to operate on. So we don't sit around with idle pads laying around. We like to do it just in time, so we'll build those pads and get going drilling as soon as we can. Roger Read : Okay. And then comments earlier about inflation at the CapEx side, which all makes sense. I was just curious and not trying to go against the guidance on the LOE side, but what should we think about in terms of inflationary pressures, if any, at the cash OpEx level? John Rielly : Roger, it was baked in there. We're not seeing as much there on the cash cost, cash operating costs, the capital. There's no question, there is some. It was in the number. But the biggest driver on that increase in the cash cost per BOE is the production taxes, which is driven by higher prices. So again, that helps our margins that way. So that -- when you're seeing that real increase there, it's really that increase in production taxes that's driving that higher cash cost. Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein. Bob Brackett : I had a question on that cash cost as a follow-up. The long-term guide was marching down towards, say, $9 BOE of cash costs. Much of that is mix shift as grows. Is any part of that also assuming deflation or operational improvements? John Rielly : No. Not really, Bob. Now look, we did set that out in a $65 world, that's for sure. That was how we set that up. All our forecasts going out is in a $65 world. So obviously, there can be impact. Again, like I just mentioned, with production taxes being higher from that standpoint. But you are correct that really what drives that down is Guyana. And in fact, if you look just at our numbers and the guide I gave and you just did the math on the second half of the year, second half of the year has to average about $12.60 on that cash cost to get to those numbers basically in the midpoint. And what's going to happen is third quarter will be a little bit higher, and then the fourth quarter is going to be lower than that $12.60. Why? Again, because Guyana continues to build up its production. So the more and more now that Payara is moving up early, and that it's -- to your point, it's that mix and having Guyana just drive down our cash costs, as well as Greg mentioned, getting that fourth rig on, we'll optimize our infrastructure and lower our unit cost in the Bakken as well. Bob Brackett : That's clear. And then a second question on Yellowtail, draining 925 million barrels, is that just from the Yellowtail Field or are some of those nearby fields being tied into that? GregHill: No. There's also a Redtail discovery that's being tied into that as well. Bob Brackett : Got it. GregHill: And then, Bob, I think also we -- as we've mentioned before, the plateau on all of these vessels, really, they're all going to be -- they'll all be bespoke, but I think you could assume extended plateaus on all the vessels as we go out in time, just because of resource density in and around these hubs. So they'll be longer than what a typical deepwater development would be. But again, they'll all be different. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors sections of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. On the line with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. In case there are any audio issues, we also will be posting transcripts of each speaker's prepared remarks on www.hess.com following the presentation. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. Today, I will provide first some comments on the oil markets and then review our progress in executing our strategy. Greg Hill will then discuss our operations, and John Rielly will review our financial results. In the last month, recessionary fears that have affected the financial markets have also been weighing on the oil markets. The price for Brent crude oil has gone from a peak of $120 per barrel to a low of $95 per barrel to approximately $105 per barrel today. However, the physical oil market remains tight. For example, to buy a physical Brent cargo, crude buyers today have to pay a cash premium of at least several dollars per barrel. We are in unprecedented times for the financial markets and for the oil markets. In both markets, we have experienced a demand shock and a supply shock. The global economy shut down in 2020 and it is taken approximately 2 years to recover. In terms of global oil demand, there has been a V-shaped recovery due to various government financial stimulus programs and accommodative monetary policies. Global oil demand has returned to pre-COVID levels of approximately 100 million barrels per day. On the other hand, global oil supply has seen more of a U-shaped recovery. Global oil supply has been struggling to keep up with demand, predominantly as a result of more than 5 years of industry under investment. As a consequence, we have seen 7 consecutive quarters of draws on global oil inventories so much so that global oil inventories today are approximately 400 million barrels less than pre-COVID levels. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect global oil demand to increase by 1 million to 1.5 million barrels per day as a result of China's economy reopening after COVID lockdowns and increasing air travel. In terms of global oil supply, while shale producers have enabled the U.S. to grow oil production by approximately 1 million barrels per day over the year -- in the last year, there is very little spare capacity left in the world. With demand growing, supply lagging and the potential for further sanctions on Russian oil exports, we expect a tight global oil market to get even tighter over the balance of the year. In a world that needs reliable, low-cost oil and gas resources now and for decades to come, Hess is in a very strong position offering a highly differentiated value proposition for investors. Our strategy is to continue delivering high resource growth, a low cost of supply and industry-leading cash flow growth while at the same time, maintaining our industry leadership in environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. Our successful execution of this strategy has uniquely positioned our company to deliver value to shareholders now and for years to come, both by growing intrinsic value and by growing cash returns. By investing only in high-return low-cost opportunities, the best rocks for the best returns, we have built a balanced portfolio focused on Guyana, the Bakken, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia with multiple phases of low-cost oil developments coming online in Guyana and our robust inventory of high-return drilling locations in the Bakken, we can deliver highly profitable production growth of more than 10% annually over the next 5 years. Through the continued development of our high-quality resource base, we are steadily moving down the cost curve. Our 4 sanctioned oil developments in Guyana have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. In terms of cash flow growth, we have an industry-leading rate of change and industry-leading durability story. Based upon a flat Brent oil price of $65 per barrel, our cash flow is forecast to increase by approximately 25% annually between 2021 and 2026, more than twice as fast as our top line growth. Our balance sheet will also continue to strengthen in the coming years, with debt-to-EBITDAX expected to decline from less than 2x in 2022 to under 1 time in 2024. As our portfolio becomes increasingly free cash flow positive in the coming years, we are committed to returning up to 75% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders with the remainder going to strengthen the balance sheet by increasing our cash position or further reducing our debt. Given our strong cash flow growth, we commenced a share repurchase program during the second quarter, repurchasing approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock for $190 million under our existing $650 million board authorization and we intend to opportunistically repurchase the remaining amount by year-end. Looking ahead, we plan to continue increasing our regular dividend to a level that is attractive to income-oriented investors, but sustainable in a low oil price environment. As our free cash flow generation steadily increases, share repurchases will represent a growing proportion of our return of capital. Key to our strategy is Guyana, the industry's largest oil province discovered in the last decade. On the Stabroek Block in Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we continue to see the potential for at least 6 floating production storage and offloading vessels, or FPSOs, in 2027 with a gross production capacity of more than 1 million barrels of oil per day and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. In terms of our sanctioned oil developments, production at the Liza Phase 1 development has reached its new production capacity of more than 140,000 gross barrels of oil per day in the second quarter following production optimization work on Liza Destiny FPSO. The Liza Phase 2 development, which achieved first oil in February, reached its gross production capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day earlier this month. Our third development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara field with a gross production capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day is on track for start-up in late 2023. In early April, we announced a sanction of Yellowtail, which will be the largest development to date on the Stabroek Block. The project will develop an estimated recoverable resource base of approximately 925 million barrels of oil and have a gross production capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day with first oil expected in 2025. Front-end engineering and design work for our fifth development in Uaru Meco is underway with a plan of development expected to be submitted to the government by year-end. In terms of exploration and appraisal in Guyana, we continue to invest in an active program with approximately 12 wells planned for the Stabroek Block in 2022. Yesterday, we announced 2 new discoveries on the block at the Seabob 1 and Kiru-Kiru 1 wells, bringing our total this year to 7. These discoveries will add to the previously announced gross recoverable resource estimate for the Stabroek Block of approximately 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. Now turning to the Bakken, our largest operated asset, we have an industry-leading position with approximately 460,000 net acres in the core of the play. Severe weather in April and May caused widespread power outages lasting 4 to 6 weeks and production shut-ins throughout North Dakota. Production recovery efforts took longer than expected for our company and the industry. Our Bakken operations are now recovering with approximately 50 new wells planned to be brought online in the second half of the year versus 32 in the first half. Given the strength of the oil market and the world's need for more oil supply, we added a fourth rig earlier this month, which will allow us to achieve net production of approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2024, a level which will maximize free cash flow generation, lower our unit cash cost and optimize our infrastructure. As we continue to execute our strategy, we are dedicated to maintaining our industry leadership in environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. On Monday, we announced publication of our 25th Annual Sustainability Report, demonstrating our long-standing commitment to sustainability and transparency. We continue to be recognized as an industry leader for the quality of our ESG performance and disclosure. In May, Hess was named to the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the 15th consecutive year based on an independent assessment by ISS ESG, and we were the only energy company to earn a place on the 2022 list. Social responsibility is a fundamental part of our sustainability commitment. Earlier this month, we announced a multiyear national health care initiative with the government of Guyana and the Mount Sinai Health System to provide access to affordable and high-quality health care which is central to the government's vision for long-term shared prosperity for the people of Guyana. In summary, we continue to successfully execute our strategy to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth and financial returns to our shareholders, while safely and responsibly producing oil and gas to help meet the world's growing energy needs. We increased our regular quarterly dividend by 50% in March and during the second quarter, commenced a share repurchase program, reflecting the financial strength of our business and our commitments to shareholders. As our portfolio becomes increasingly free cash flow positive, we will continue both to invest to grow our company's intrinsic value and to increase the return of capital to our shareholders through further dividend increases and share repurchases. I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. Although in the second quarter, we experienced continued weather impacts in the Bakken and a ramp up of Liza Phase 2 that was modestly slower than expected. Net production was up 10% from the first quarter and we anticipate company-wide net production to continue to build in the second half of the year as we bring more wells online in the Bakken, and Liza Phase 2 operates at nameplate capacity. In the second quarter, company-wide net production averaged 303,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. In the third quarter, we expect company-wide net production to increase by approximately 10% from the second quarter and to average between 330,000 and 335,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. In the fourth quarter, company-wide net production is expected to further increase to between 365,000 and 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. For the full year 2022, we now forecast net production to average approximately 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. Turning to the Bakken. Second quarter net production averaged 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was in line with our guidance and reflected the impact of severe weather in April and May. Production is now recovering and is expected to increase to between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast net production to further increase to between 160,000 and 165,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2022, we now forecast Bakken net production to average between 150,000 and 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This reflects a volume reduction of approximately 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day under our percentage of proceeds contracts as a result of higher NGL prices. Although NGL volume entitlements are lower, overall cash flow is substantially higher. In terms of drilling and completion costs, we are continuing to see upward pressure across our supply chains, particularly in oil country tubular goods. As a result, we have increased our full year average drilling and completion cost forecast by $100,000 per well to average $6.3 million per well in 2022. I am proud of our team's effectiveness in mitigating the impacts of inflation, tight supply chains largely through our distinctive lean culture. While we believe the industry is experiencing overall inflation of between 15% and 20%, our full year drilling and completion costs are forecast to increase by only about 8.5% year-over-year. In the second quarter, we drilled 20 wells and brought 19 new wells online. In the third quarter, we expect to drill approximately 25 wells and to bring approximately 20 new wells online. And for the full year 2022, we now expect to drill approximately 95 wells and to bring between 80 and 85 new wells online, which is slightly lower than previous guidance due to the second quarter weather-related delays in mobilizing equipment. Individual well results in terms of EURs and IP180s continue to meet or exceed expectations. Earlier this month, we added a fourth drilling rig in the Bakken. Through our strategic partnerships with Nabors and Halliburton we were able to secure a fully staffed, high spec class rig and a second completion crew. Moving to a 4-rig program will allow us to grow net production to approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2024, which will optimize our in-basin infrastructure and drive further reductions in our unit cash costs. Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, second quarter net production averaged 29,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our guidance of approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the third quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average between 25,000 and 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day reflecting planned downtime at Tubular Bells and a Penn State Well being shut in due to a mechanical issue. This downtime will be partially offset by the planned start-up of the Lano 6 tieback in August, which logged 123 feet of high-quality Miocene pay. For the full year 2022, our forecast for Gulf of Mexico net production is now approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In June, we completed drilling operations on the Huron prospect on Green Canyon Block 69 with encouraging results. Hess is the operator with a 40% working interest and Chevron and Shell each have 30%. The well encountered high-quality oil-bearing Miocene age reservoirs and established the existence of a working petroleum system. Well results are still being evaluated and an appraisal sidetrack is planned. In Southeast Asia, net production in the second quarter was 67,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our guidance of approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Phase 3 of the North Malay Basin development came online in June and is producing above expectations, and Phase 4 is on track to achieve first gas in early 2023. Third quarter net production is forecast to average approximately 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance at both JDA and North Malay Basin. Full year 2022 production is expected to average between 60,000 and 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now turning to Guyana. In the second quarter, net production averaged 67,000 barrels of oil per day, reflecting a modest delay in the ramp-up of Liza Phase 2. Overall, the start-up has been very successful. In July, Liza Phase 2 reached its nameplate capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day or about 56,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess. For Liza Phase 1 production optimization work was completed in the second quarter, and the FPSO is now operating at or above its new gross production capacity of 140,000 barrels of oil per day. Earlier this month, SBM Offshore also completed the replacement of the flash gas compressor, which has resulted in high reliability and 0 routine flaring. Third quarter net production from Guyana is forecast to increase to a range of 90,000 to 95,000 barrels of oil per day and average approximately 75,000 barrels of oil per day for the full year 2022. With regard to our third development of Payara, topside fabrication and installation on the Prosperity FPSO is well underway in Singapore and development drilling in Guyana continues at pace. The project, which will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day is now more than 80% complete and is well on track to achieve first oil in late 2023. In April, we sanctioned a fourth development at the Yellowtail, which will develop approximately 925 million barrels of oil and have a breakeven Brent oil price of approximately $29 per barrel. The project will have a gross production capacity of 250,000 barrels of oil per day and is on track to achieve first oil in 2025. As for our fifth development at Uaru Meco, the operator anticipates submitting the plan of development to the government of Guyana in the fourth quarter with first oil targeted for 2026, pending government approvals and project sanctioning. Turning to exploration. Yesterday, we announced 2 new discoveries on the Stabroek Block. The Seabob-1 well encountered 131 feet of high-quality oil-bearing upper campaign sandstone reservoirs. The well is located in the southeastern part of the block, approximately 12 miles southeast of the Yellowtail field. The Kiru-Kiru-1 well has also thus far encountered 98 feet of high-quality hydrocarbon-bearing upper campanion sandstone reservoirs. The well is currently drilling ahead to test deeper intervals and is located in the southeastern part of the block, approximately 3 miles southeast of the Cataback-1 discovery, both discoveries will add to the gross discovered recoverable resource estimate for the block of approximately 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In terms of future drilling activity on the Stabroek Block, next up in the queue are Yarrow and Banjo. The Yarrow-1 well will test stacked Upper Campanian targets, up-dip of discoveries at Whiptail and Tilapia. The well is located 19 miles south of the Yellowtail 1 discovery well. The Banjo-1 well will also target stacked Upper Campanian targets west of Barreleye and up-dip of Mako. The well is located 8 miles northwest of the Barreleye-1 discovery well. These wells will appraise the development potential of the inboard oil play in the southeast portion of the block. In addition, on Block 42 in Suriname, we will participate in the Zanderij-1 exploration well. The Shell operated well is expected to spud in late August and will test both Upper Campanian and deeper play stacked targets. Hess, Chevron and Shell each have a one third working interest. In closing, our Bakken assets are now recovering from the severe weather impacts experienced in the first half of the year and we expect to see steady production growth in the coming quarters, particularly with the addition of the fourth rig. We had positive drilling results in the Gulf of Mexico at both Llano 6 and Huron and have a robust inventory of both infrastructure led tie back opportunities and exploration prospects. Malaysia continues to generate steady production and cash flow, and our extraordinary success in Guyana continues on all fronts. Our distinctive, long-lived portfolio uniquely positions us to deliver material and accelerating production and free cash flow growth and significant value to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2022. We had net income of $667 million in the second quarter compared with $417 million in the first quarter or $404 million on an adjusted basis. Turning to E&P. E&P had net income of $723 million in the second quarter compared with $460 million in the first quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of E&P earnings between the second quarter and first quarter of 2022 were as follows : Higher realized selling prices increased earnings by $178 million; Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $170 million; Higher DD&A expense decreased earnings by $39 million; Higher cash costs decreased earnings by $39 million; All other items decreased earnings by $7 million for an overall increase in second quarter earnings of $263 million. For the second quarter, our E&P sales volumes were underlifted compared with production by approximately 500,000 barrels, which decreased our after-tax income by approximately $15 million. Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $65 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared with $72 million in the first quarter. Midstream EBITDA, before noncontrolling interest was $241 million in both the second quarter and first quarter of 2022. Turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.16 billion, and total liquidity was $5.73 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $5.61 billion. In April, we received total net proceeds of $346 million from the public offering of approximately 5.1 million Hess owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream and the sale of approximately 6.8 million Hess owned Class B units to Hess Midstream. In the second quarter, we commenced common stock share repurchases with the purchase of approximately 1.8 million shares for $190 million under our existing $650 million board-authorized stock repurchase program. We intend to utilize the remaining amount under the stock repurchase program by the end of this year. Total cash returned to shareholders in the second quarter amounted to $306 million, including dividends. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $1.46 billion in the second quarter compared with $952 million in the first quarter primarily due to higher realized selling prices and sales volumes. In the second quarter, we sold 61 million-barrel cargoes of crude oil in Guyana, up from sales of 2.3 million barrels of crude oil in the first quarter. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the second quarter of 2022, increased cash flow from operating activities by $46 million. E&P capital and exploratory expenditures were $622 million in the second quarter and $580 million in the first quarter. In June, Moody's Investors Service upgraded the senior unsecured ratings of Hess Corporation to BAA3 from BA1. All 3 major credit rating agencies now rate Hess as investment grade. In July, we replaced our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility expiring in May 2024 with a new $3.25 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2027. Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P. Beginning in the third quarter, we will use the remainder of the previously generated Guyana net operating loss carryforwards. As a result, we will start to incur a current income tax liability. Our third quarter Guyana net production guidance of 90,000 to 95,000 barrels of oil per day includes approximately 7,000 barrels of oil per day of tax barrels. Our full year 2022 Guyana net production guidance of approximately 75,000 barrels of oil per day includes approximately 6,000 barrels of oil per day of tax barrels. There were no tax barrels in the first or second quarters. In both the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year, we expect to sell 81 million-barrel liftings from Guyana. Our E&P cash costs in the second quarter of 2022 were $13.90 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $14.56 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $14 to $14.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and in the range of $13.50 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year, which is unchanged from previous guidance. DD&A expense was $11.79 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.34 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the second quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $13 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $12.50 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year, which is updated from the prior guidance of $11.50 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $27 to $28 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $26 to $27 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year 2022. Exploration expenses excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million in the third quarter and in the range of $160 million to $170 million for the full year, which is down from our previous guidance of $170 million to $180 million. The midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $305 million to $315 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of $1.190 billion to $1.215 billion remains unchanged. E&P income tax, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million for the third quarter and in the range of $540 million to $550 million for the full year, which is up from the previous guidance range of $460 million to $470 million, primarily due to higher commodity prices. We expect noncash option premium amortization, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices, will be approximately $165 million for both the third and fourth quarters. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $750 million in the third quarter and approximately $2.7 billion for the full year, which is down from previous guidance of $2.8 billion that I referenced in our last conference call. The reduction is due to the phasing of activities in the Bakken and efficiencies across the portfolio. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million for the third quarter. The full year guidance range of $265 million to $275 million remains unchanged. For corporate, corporate expenses are estimated to be approximately $40 million for the third quarter and in the range of $135 million to $145 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $120 million to $130 million due to higher legal and professional fees. Interest expense is estimated to be approximately $85 million for the third quarter and in the range of $345 million to $350 million for the full year, which is in the lower end of our previous guidance range. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : John, I wanted to start with cash return. This quarter, you returned about 20% of your CFO, including dividends and the buyback and you acknowledge your plan to go ahead and complete the remaining authorization, which would point to about $460 million of buybacks plus the dividend. I'm wondering as we think about your capital return framework, which includes the return of up to 75% of your free cash flow, how should we think about the pace of buybacks as we approach 2023? John Hess : Yes, John Reilly. John Rielly : Yes. Thanks, Arun. So just to remind you what our -- the capital return framework is our framework is set up on an annual basis. So we look at our annual free cash flow and we are planning to return -- and we are committed to return up to 75% of that free cash flow. And that free cash flow is reduced for debt reductions, which we did have that $500 million in the first quarter. So as we said, with our $650 million authorized in the $190 million done in the second quarter, you can expect the remainder to be done throughout the rest of this year, and it's actually going to be above the 75% framework because of where commodity prices are, our discussions with the Board, our favorable balance sheet position. And look with Guyana ramping up and Bakken ramping up our free cash flow is improving, as you see from our second quarter results, so that we can give more than 75% this year with this favorable commodity price environment. And so then coming to 2023, you really should think about, look, we just are starting capital return program. This is just the beginning, and we plan to continue it. So as we move into 2023, we are committed to that 75% framework. Again, if commodity prices are favorable, we can do more than that next year. But you should begin to think this is going to be a continued program. And just remember now with Bakken, as we said, that's going to 200,000 barrels a day. Guyana is going to be bringing on an FPSO almost once a year here for the coming years. So we're going to have a growing free cash flow. So that 5% is going to be going on a bigger and bigger number as we move out. So I think that's the strategic framework you should be thinking about. Arun Jayaram : Great. And maybe John Riley, a follow-up for you. $2.7 billion in CapEx update, a little bit lower than you told us last quarter. I was wondering if you could just provide us maybe some soft commentary around 2023 CapEx if you sustain 4 rigs in the Bakken and continue your E&D program in Guyana. John Rielly : Go ahead, John. Thank you for the soft guidance, Arun, because that's what we'll do. As usual, we'll provide the full guidance in January because we do have some moving parts like you said. But with the fourth rig in the Bakken and look, we did have some phasing of activities that are moving into 2023 you can at least expect an additional $150 million plus from the Bakken. And this is before inflation, which I'll talk about a little bit at the end. So the Bakken will be increasing with that fourth rig, some of the phasing as well. So you can think about that $150 million. In Guyana, as you know, we've got a lot of things going on. So I did say this in the first quarter, there's clearly going to be about 700 -- several hundred million more in Guyana because we'd be developing Payara, right? We're bringing that on in late 2023. We've got to develop with Yellowtail, the fifth FPSO, which Greg mentioned, Uaru and Meco, and we also have the gas to energy project going on in Guyana. So again, several hundred million more for Guyana, but we'll fine-tune that as we go through the year. Also, as you heard Greg mention, we had success at Huron well in the Gulf of Mexico. We'll be looking at what we're doing from an appraisal standpoint and what our Gulf of Mexico program, which typically, as we had mentioned, like to get some of these infrastructure-led tiebacks done as well as a greenfield. So we'll be having some increase in Gulf of Mexico for 2023. And then I mentioned it, of course, we're monitoring the industry inflation. We are seeing it. Greg mentioned what's happening with our D&C cost in Bakken. We are seeing it in rig rates, labor, steel costs. So we'll continue to be looking at that and we'll fine-tune it as we get to the end of the year. But kind of soft, those are the kind of numbers you can be looking at, Arun. Arun Jayaram : And what about the FPSO? Have you all made a determination with Exxon on buying those on your buy option? John Rielly : No. That has not been finally determined yet, Arun, on the timing. The guidance I would give you right now is not to expect just in 2023. So if you're putting in your models, you don't pull 1 in 2023. I would expect 1 in early 2024. But again, it's still early days. We do not have that finalized yet. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : I guess, could I go first to the Bakken on -- obviously, you've given a fairly thorough explanation as to what's been going on there with weather and power outages and so on. But I want to ask about any thoughts on the trajectory to 200,000 barrels a day. Is there any reason why we should be rethinking the time line of that? Are you still confident in that? And what is your updated thoughts on the trajectory together? John Hess : Yes, Greg. Greg Hill : No, Doug. I think we're back on track in the Bakken. We're back on that trajectory. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we expect the third quarter to be up 10%. The fourth quarter to be up 10% from that. And then you really see the fourth rig start to kick in because you'll start completing wells for from that fourth rig in 2023. So that's why we're saying we'll have the steady increase trajectory to 200,000 barrels a day, which we expect to hit in 2024. So it should be a smooth ramp from here. Doug Leggate : Okay. Greg, I just wanted to kind of address that upfront. My follow-up, I'll leave everyone else to ask on Guyana today. Greg, I want to ask you about Huron. This is perhaps a little bit more material news and perhaps your short comments might suggest. Can you give us a little bit more color on pre-drill scale? And if you're sidetracking, 1 assumes that you're pretty encouraged with what you're seeing. So what was the predrill target here? And what is this -- you've talked about 1 potential hub development exploration well per year going forward. Does this qualify as a potential hub development? Greg Hill : Well, let me talk about -- yes, let me talk about the well first. So it was drilled on Green Canyon Block 69 to a depth of 28,900 feet and the rig was released on June 14, 2022. So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the prospect targeted a new Miocene sub-salt fairway in Northern Green Canyon. Reason we're really encouraged by the results that we discovered good, high-quality oil in good quality Miocene sands. And we -- as I did mention, we're also planning an appraisal sidetrack up dip on that well. I think the second thing that's really exciting about it is a result of -- as a result of what we're seeing in Huron, we see additional prospectivity in that Northern Green Canyon area, and we have a very competitive leasehold position there. So 2 positive outcomes from Huron. Doug, we don't release predrill estimates, and the well is still under evaluation. So further information coming as we appraise that asset. John Hess : I would just add to that. I mean we're encouraged by the prospectivity in this area. The fact that there's a working petroleum system. So there's going to be further drilling and appraisal ahead of us, and we're encouraged by it. Doug Leggate : If I may very quickly, Greg, you say you're going to do an updip appraisal. Did you have an oil -- water contact? Greg Hill : Well, still under evaluation, Doug. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : First 1 is for John Rielly. John, with the rising fear on recession, how does it or does it have all impact on the thinking or in your decision process -- in you guys' decision ports and on the budget? John Hess : John? John Rielly : Sure. So that's one of the things I mentioned why, as Arun said, soft guidance and what our budget would be for next year. We are looking at that -- obviously, it's -- there's no change to our base program in the Bakken. We're going to have the 4 rigs. We're doing that. We want to optimize our infrastructure up there, lower our cash cost, and it's the best return way to develop the Bakken. So there won't be any change there. And so we'll continue to monitor the cost and update everyone on where the budget ends up with that. So on a go-forward basis, then Guyana, again, the plan is there unchanged. Obviously, just a phenomenal province for us for oil development, the returns there are excellent, and we will be trying to bring forward as much as we can to get this oil for the country of Guyana on as early as possible. So again, Payara, Yellowtail, getting the fifth ship in for FID, try to get the development plan into the government. So no change there. Again, with Exxon, has been doing an excellent job managing the cost there. But we are susceptible to that cost inflation that everybody else is seeing. So we'll update again where that number comes. But as I said, we have about $1 billion this year in our plan in our original budget, and we're not changing that in Guyana. So again, Exxon has done a really good job this year managing that inflation. And as I said, it will be several hundred million dollars more, but again, we'll see where the inflation ends up. And then kind of the new thing because we were just talking about a Gulf of Mexico and our program, we are looking at the rig rates and being able to get slots. So that's something, again, that we will be looking at managing, but we do want to do this appraisal that we talked about, and we'd like to do some of our infrastructure-led tiebacks. So -- again, those are extremely good returns even if the cost inflation is a little bit higher. So I think you can take that again as our soft guidance on what we're doing, and we keep practicing our lean culture and trying to get it as much as possible working with our strategic -- So again, Exxon has done a really good job this year managing that inflation. And as I said, it will be several hundred million dollars more. But again, we'll see where the inflation ends up. And then kind of the new thing because we were just talking about Gulf of Mexico and our program, we are looking at the rig rates and being able to get slots. So that's something, again, that we will be looking at. John Hess : Yes. And 1 other point, Paul. So -- and it's a great question. I think all companies are dealing with this recession risk, even though there's an economic slowdown now. We certainly see the market getting tighter for the reasons that I mentioned between now and the end of the year. Having said that, our Board will definitely stress test our budget for next year. Definitely, there will be a recession scenario in that, and we'll definitely be prepared should there be a recession to stay ahead of it to keep the balance sheet strong so we can still invest in our high-return opportunity in Guyana, and we'll also take steps as we normally do as we get to the end of the year to make sure we have some price protection on in terms of puts on the downside. So we'll be prepared in case a recession occurs. It's certainly going to be one of the scenarios that the Board has with our senior leadership to make sure we're financially disciplined going into next year. Paul Cheng : Great. And going back to John Rielly, you mentioned some activity has been pushed from this year to next year. Can you quantify roughly how much? John Rielly : Sure. So as Greg mentioned, right now with wells online, we're a little bit down. I would say wells online. We're only in, like, say, 5 range of wells online that are going to be moving to next year. Some of the wells drilled. So as Greg mentioned, there were 95 wells, that's actually up from our original guidance of 90, but that didn't include the fourth rig. So the fourth -- we should have gotten an additional, say, 14 to 15 wells drilled. And so we're only getting 5. So we've got additional wells that are moving that way. So you're looking at 9 or 10 wells to be drilled that are moving to next year, 5-ish kind of wells online moving to next year and just some other small infrastructure type things. So altogether, you're probably looking in that $40 million type range that got moved to next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Jeanine Wai : We'd like to follow up on the Gulf of Mexico from Doug's questions. There's been some headlines that some of your partners there are looking to monetize their interest in 1 of your fields. And it sounds like you're very positive on the goal for the near term. I know you just mentioned increasing activity in '23 and your side tracking well. Can you generally discuss what your medium-term plan is in terms of activity in the Gulf? And then our follow-up is what's your appetite to grow your position there? John Hess : Yes, Greg, Wai, we appreciate it if you just go over our strategy. The role of the Gulf in our portfolio, the exploration acreage that we have. And I can comment on M&A side, Jeanine, in the normal course of business, we always look to optimize our portfolio, but we have not seen anything in the market, be it in the Gulf for or elsewhere that makes sense for us to do an acquisition. We have better opportunities to invest in our portfolio of high return and low cost investments. So we're much more focused on getting return from the inventory of investment opportunities that we have then looking to the outside. We don't need M&A to grow the returns of our business and quite frankly, most of the stuff that we've seen would erode returns. We're going to do that. We're going to stay financially disciplined. But Greg, can you talk about the role of the Gulf in our portfolio. Greg Hill : Sure. Thanks, Jeanine. So the Gulf of Mexico for us, remains a very important part of the portfolio. It's an important cash engine, and it's a platform for growth for us. So -- our objective in the Gulf is to add a minimum sustained production cash flow through tieback opportunities and also selectively pursuing hub class exploration opportunities. If we can grow it, we want to. And as you recall, we've been selectively rebuilding our portfolio in the last 5 or 6 years, such that we acquired 60 new lease blocks in the Gulf we've got over 80 now in our portfolio, and that's really a balance of high-return tiebacks and also hub class new exploration prospects. So assuming those opportunities compete for capital, a good planning assumption for us going forward is that we would drill roughly 2 wells per year for the next several years that, again, is focused on both those tiebacks and new hub class opportunities with Huron being the first out of the gate, again, very encouraging results. And Huron, particularly for that Northern Green Canyon basin where we have a very competitive leasehold there. So we're pretty excited about that. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe just a couple of quick follow-ups on other questions. On the Gulf of Mexico, as you were talking about medium-term strategy, if you were to -- I know this varies on a lot of things, but if you were to do that plan a couple of wells a year, is the general outlook that you'd probably hold production flat there over the medium term in the Gulf of Mexico that you could drive modest growth? Or how do you think about as you look out over the next few years, the trajectory of production there in the Gulf of Mexico? John Hess : Greg? Greg Hill : Sure. I think for the next couple of years, you could assume our objective is really to hold it flat and we'll do that through these infills and ILX, infrastructure-led exploration wells that are quick tiebacks. Beyond that, we're also going to be doing some hub class exploration prospects, obviously those wouldn't feature those wouldn't come in as growth until later in that period. So short term, hold it flat as a minimum longer-term grow it, assuming success from some of these sub-class exploration prospects. Ryan Todd : Perfect. And then maybe a follow-up on an earlier comment. You talked a little bit about the dividend, the desire to grow it to a position of competitiveness. How would you define -- I mean, you've obviously increased it materially earlier this year, but how would you define a competitive dividend? What peer group are you looking at? And any thoughts on kind of the timetable of over which you'd like to grow that dividend to kind of a sustainable level where you'd like it to be? John Hess : Yes. I'm going to have John answer it, but I think the way to think about it is a sustainable and meaningful premium to the S&P dividend yield. That's what we're really looking at. We want to compete for the generalist investor, not just the oil and gas investor, but we want it to be something that also holds up under low oil prices. But John, why don't you elaborate a little bit what our plans are. John Rielly : Sure. So I mean John did give a good explanation on that, but that's clearly what we're looking to do, continual increases here. And John did mention it that we'd like to get our dividend to a level that is attractive to the income-oriented investors. So I think yield is an output, but you can think about the yield that the income-oriented investors are looking at. So with our ability here, again, as I mentioned, Bakken growing to 200,000 barrels a day and then Guyana, Payara coming in late 2023 and then almost an FPSO a year here as we move out the next couple of years, we're going to have a significant free cash flow that we're able to continue to increase the dividend and we can kind of move that dividend as our cash flow grows. But actually, the bigger part of our return will be share repurchases because that growing free cash flow when you put that 75% against that as we will grow that dividend, we want to make it sustainable in a low oil price environment, but the bigger portion ultimately will be share repurchases. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : I had a couple of questions on the macro. And the first is around price realizations, they were good in the quarter. And John, you had made the comment that what we see in the financial markets, it might be lower than what you're realizing in the physical market. So can you just talk about that divergence and whether you're able to realize something higher than the front price? John Hess : Yes. I mean obviously, this changes, as you know, Neil, it's a great question, every day. But what we've been seeing really for the last 2 months is buyers for physical Brent or physical Brent equivalents is several dollars a barrel premium over the screen or the futures market. There's strong buying that's out there. Obviously, not just because the world is short inventory and needs the current barrels. But obviously, what's going on in Russia and Europe, has tightened the market even more, which you're seeing more in the Brent price than you are in the WTI price on the screen. But several dollars a barrel, I think, is a good planning assumption for now. And we'll just have to see how the market evolves between now and the end of the year. One of the concerns we have is obviously, if more barrels are taken out of Russia. I think Russia is down in terms of their exports about 1 million barrels a day. If that number grows and the EU is talking about sanctioning more of those barrels, I think that physical premium will go up. Neil Mehta : And the follow-up is on natural gas. And so we do love your perspective on how you're thinking about U.S. natural gas, in particular -- and if anything structurally changed in your view of mid-cycle? And then as it relates to your hedging position, remind us how open you are over the next couple of years? And can you participate in the strengthening commodity curve. John Hess : Yes, I'll have John handle the hedging. And natural gas, obviously, is being impacted specifically in Europe, and the LNG trading business because Europe buys about 40% of their supply from Russia. Obviously, that continues to be interrupted. Very concerns about its availability going into the winter, you're also starting to see the EU and European countries start to ration gas, and that's having an impact on the European price, the Asian price because of the LNG factor. And I think the U.S. has been relatively insulated from that because of shale gas and domestic production as well as the Freeport terminal, having had its problems and when that recovers. So I think the numbers for natural gas in Europe are somewhere between $50 and $60 an Mcf, where in the U.S., it's closer to 9%. So the U.S. is still up but it's much lower than the rest of the world, in part because we're energy-independent. We're a net exporter. So I think as you think about natural gas going into the winter, that\u2019s going to stay very tight both in the U.S. and even more so in Europe and Asia. When you look past that, I think a lot of that is a function of when does the Russian-Ukraine conflict get resolved, got willing sooner than later, where lives are saved on both sides for that matter. And then I think the natural gas business will start to normalize. There's plenty of natural gas out there, but it has to be falling for inventories to rebuild so that you get more back to equilibrium prices. But we see the natural gas market, both in the U.S. and the rest of the world, staying tight, certainly through this coming winter. John, do you want to hit the hedging question? John Rielly : Sure. So for hedges for next year, we do not have any hedges on in 2023 or beyond at this point. Now, you know our strategy, and you should assume that we'll continue with that strategy is to put a floor price on. So as we get to the end of the year, we'll use puts, obviously, where volatility is, that from everything that John has been discussing on this call and also just the time aspect of the put options. We'll be putting them on closer to the end of the year or early into next year. That's typically the time frame that we do that. But we do want to put a floor on. You can expect us to do that again next year and years after to just again to provide that insurance, should prices -- should there be a change? Should there be a recession or something happening that drops those prices, but we'll do that towards the end of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Maybe just follow up on some of the last discoveries here in Guyana and some of the stuff before. Where are you in terms of drill stem tests, flow rate tests, things like that as we try to think about some of the things that will eventually raise -- more than likely raise the 11 billion-barrel resource target that's out there. John Hess : Greg? Greg Hill : Yes. So as we said, these 2 discoveries, Seabob and Kiru-Kiru, which are still underway, so those will be additive to the already announced 11 billion barrels gross recoverable hydrocarbons. I think the significant part about these discoveries is why they're so encouraging is that if you look at Seabob, that is leading to a potential inboard oil play in the southeastern part of the Stabroek Block. And in fact, as we look forward, the next 2 wells, Yarrow and Banjo will help further delineate that inboard oil opportunities. So there could be another oil FPSO centered on that inboard oil play. So as you mentioned, after we get these wells done, we'll do some DSPs, et cetera, on them really trying to prove up really that inboard oil play. So very, very exciting. Roger Read : Yes. So Guyana has been that way for several years now. It's good to see it keep you on. The other question, if I could, just kind of going back to the inflation question. As you're starting to look and understand all the things that are out there, recession, et cetera. But let's assume the crude strip is right. We're going to continue to see activity and probably some inflation next year. Where are you at this point in terms of getting a good handle on what 2023 underlying inflation might be in terms of -- you talked about Guyana already, but lower 48 and Gulf of Mexico. John Hess : John, do you want to answer that part? John Rielly : Sure. So I mean we are seeing, Roger, that just like our competitors, we're seeing upward pressure onshore and offshore with steel prices, labor costs and rig rates. So there's no question we are seeing that. So we -- as you mentioned, we talked about Guyana. So onshore, you heard Greg mention that the D&C cost did go from 6.2% to 6.3% this year. We are seeing inflation coming from 2023, these things continuing. So I can't give the number. That's why we'll wait till the end of the year, but you should expect that 6.3% to be higher in 2023 when we get the full numbers in. Again, we're working hard to mitigate the effects through efficiency gains, working with our suppliers, contracts and all our relationships there. And with the strength of the oil prices, like you mentioned, I still think with that tightness going into 2023, we will continue to see that. But of course, with the higher oil prices, obviously, we're getting much higher returns in cash flow. So I can't be exactly specific. That's what I said earlier, but we'll continue to work the contracts through the end of the year, and I'll update everyone on our January call. John Hess : Yes. And I think, Roger, the other thing is Greg and his team moved expeditiously this secure excellent equipment with Nabors and also with -- and cruise with Halliburton as well. So some of our competitors, I don't think are as well positioned as we are to have high-quality equipment and people. And I think that will inure to our benefit as we go into next year to mitigate the cost pressures plus the fact that Greg and his team are leaders of the manufacturing and have a proven track record of mitigating cost increases. So the exact number, as John said, we\u2019ll give you at the end of the year, but I think we're staying ahead of it and taking steps to mitigate whatever that impact is. Operator : Our next question comes from Vin Lovaglio with Mizuho. Vin Lovaglio : The first question was just on debottlenecking work at Liza Phase 1. I was just wondering if you could remind me about the investment required to get those 20,000 barrels extra online? And then probably more importantly, your ability to carry over a similar debottlenecking work to future projects. John Hess : Greg? Greg Hill : Yes, sure. So the investment level to get to that new nameplate of that new capacity of 140,000 barrels a day from the 120 on Phase I, very minimal. I mean this was some piping changes, et cetera. So you shouldn't think about that as a major investment on Phase 1. As we look forward to future phases, certainly in Phase II and also Payara, I think we could see the potential for additional debottlenecking for those 2 vessels. Beyond that, as your vessels get bigger, say, the 250 class, we'll have to wait and see. And I think the important thing to remember about these debottlenecking efforts is it's going to be bespoke for each vessel. So it's going to depend on the individual dynamics of that vessel operating as to how much additional capacity you can eke out of it. So hopefully, that answers your question. Vin Lovaglio : Great. And the second 1 was just back to cash return and the regular dividend? I mean, obviously, the investment profile and the capital intensity of Guyana development is quite a bit different from U.S. unconventional. Just wondering how this affects your thinking on regular dividends and if you think that the regular or the base dividend is 1 way that you can ultimately differentiate from your peer group and the E&Ps. John Hess : Yes. We certainly intend to increase the dividend each year and at a moderate pace, but 1 that builds value over time that will be sustainable, but also meaningful. Operator : Our next question comes from David Deckelbaum with Cowen. David Deckelbaum : I really only had, I think, 1 additional follow-up to some of the other questions that were answered already. But as we think about -- you've thrown out the 200,000 a day target in the Bakken as a most optimal level of performance for the asset. Just given some of the inflation that we're seeing there, some of the inflation that we're seeing both on the unit cost size, is 200,000 still the right number? And is there -- is that still a steady-state 4 rig program? Or just given the move in higher pricing if we were to believe in the long-term price at higher given some of the inflation, do all of these numbers move slightly higher? John Hess : Yes, Greg? Greg Hill : No. Look, I think if you look at our portfolio, we've got 2,100 or more drilling locations that generate great returns at a $60 WTI. So obviously, at current prices, those returns are fantastic, right? And so certainly, the movement in the oil price from a return standpoint is outstripping any inflationary effects. And the 200,000 barrel a day kind of plateau rate, if you will, for the Bakken is absolutely the optimum place to be because it really fills up all the infrastructure that we have in place in the Bakken. So you need to think about future wells as almost like a tieback in the Gulf of Mexico. The infrastructure is already there. So the incremental returns are very high for those Bakken wells. So we'll hold that with the portfolio we have, we'll hold that for rigs and be able to hold that plateau at about 200,000 barrels a day for almost a decade, all the while, the Bakken generating significant amount of free cash flow during that period. So at $60, it generates over $1 billion of free cash flow. Obviously, current price is much higher. So it becomes this massive cash annuity for the portfolio at that 200,000 barrels a day.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Carman. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today\u2019s conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements.

A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. On the line with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. In case there are any audio issues, we will be posting transcripts of each speakers prepared remarks on www.hess.com following the presentation. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay, good morning. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. Today, I will share some thoughts about the oil markets and then review our progress in executing our strategy. Greg Hill will then discuss our operations, and John Rielly will review our financial results. Global oil demand has returned to pre-COVID levels of approximately 100 million barrels per day. As we look to 2023, even with a recessionary environment and a slowing world economy, we expect global oil demand to grow by at least one million barrels per day driven by China reopening its economy and an increase in global air travel. Oil supply, on the other hand, continues to struggle to keep up with global demand. Global oil inventories are approximately 300 million barrels less than pre-COVID levels, and there is very little spare production capacity in the world. Oil markets were tight even before Russia invaded Ukraine and are expected to get even tighter this winter with the potential for further sanctions on Russian oil exports. The world is facing a structural supply deficit and significantly more global oil investment is needed. According to the International Energy Agency, a reasonable estimate for the global oil and gas investment needed for supply to meet demand is approximately $500 billion each year over the next 10 years. The last five years have seen significant underinvestment, which will tighten supply as global oil demand grows in the years ahead. The International Energy Agency\u2019s World Energy Outlook provides multiple scenarios for addressing the dual challenge of growing global energy supply by about 20% over the next 20 years and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. In all of these IEA scenarios, oil and gas will be needed for decades to come. So, to ensure an affordable, just and secure energy transition, we need to invest significantly more in oil and gas, and we also must have government policies that encourage investment, rather than discourage it. In a world that will need reliable, low cost oil and gas resources for decades to come, Hess is very well positioned. Our strategy is to deliver high return resource growth, a low cost of supply and industry  leading cash flow growth, and at the same time maintain our industry leadership in environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. Our successful execution of this strategy has uniquely positioned our company to deliver significant value to shareholders for years to come, by growing both intrinsic value and cash returns. By investing only in high return, low cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated and balanced portfolio focused on Guyana, the Bakken, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and Southeast Asia. With multiple phases of low cost oil developments coming online in Guyana and our robust inventory of high return drilling locations in the Bakken, we can deliver highly profitable production growth of more than 10% annually over the next five years. As our high quality resource base expands, we will steadily move down the cost curve. Our four sanctioned oil developments in Guyana have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. In terms of cash flow growth, we have an industry leading rate of change story and durability story, providing a unique value proposition. Based upon a flat Brent oil price of $65 per barrel, our cash flow is forecast to increase by approximately 25% annually between 2021 and 2026 more than twice as fast as our top-line growth, and our balance sheet will also continue to strengthen, with debt to EBITDAX expected to decline to under one time in 2024. As our portfolio becomes increasingly free cash flow positive in the coming years, we are committed to returning up to 75% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders, with the remainder going to strengthen the balance sheet by increasing our cash position or further reducing our debt. We continued common stock repurchases during the third quarter, repurchasing $150 million of stock as part of the $650 million stock repurchase program announced earlier this year, and we intend to repurchase the remaining $310 million of stock in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we plan to continue increasing our regular dividend to a level that is attractive to income-oriented investors, but sustainable in a low oil price environment. As our free cash flow generation steadily increases in the years ahead, share repurchases will represent a growing proportion of our return of capital. Key to our strategy is Guyana, one of the industry\u2019s highest margin, lowest carbon intensity and highest growth oil and gas prospects according to Wood Mackenzie data. On the Stabroek Block in Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we continue to see the potential for six floating production storage and offloading vessels or FPSOs in 2027 with a gross production capacity of more than one million barrels of oil per day and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. In terms of our sanctioned oil developments on the block : The Liza Phase 1 and Liza Phase 2 developments are currently operating at their combined gross production capacity of more than 360,000 barrels of oil per day. Our third development at the Payara Field, with a gross production capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day, remains on schedule for start up at the end of 2023. Our fourth development, Yellowtail, which was sanctioned in April, will be the largest development to date on the Stabroek Block with first oil expected in 2025. The project will develop an estimated recoverable resource base of approximately 925 million barrels of oil and have a gross production capacity of approximately 250000 barrels of oil per day. Front end engineering and design work for our fifth development at Uaru is underway, with a Plan of Development expected to be submitted to the government before year end. In terms of exploration and appraisal in Guyana, this morning we announced two new discoveries on the  block at Yarrow and Sailfin, bringing our total this year to nine. These discoveries will add to the previously announced gross discovered recoverable resource estimate for the Stabroek Block of approximately 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent \u2013 and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. In Suriname, we recently drilled the Zanderij-1 well, where Hess has a 33% interest and Shell is the operator. The well demonstrated a working petroleum system and encountered oil pay. The well results are being evaluated and further exploration activities are being considered. Turning to sustainability, we are proud to be recognized as an industry leader in our environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. Hess has once again achieved Level 4 status in the Transition Pathway Initiative\u2019s recent management quality assessment, which is the highest level awarded to companies that demonstrably manage climate-related risks and opportunities from a governance, operational and strategic perspective in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. In summary, we continue to successfully execute our strategy and deliver strong operational and ESG performance. We truly offer a unique value proposition \u2013 to grow both our intrinsic value and our cash returns by increasing our resource base, delivering a lower cost of supply and generating the best cash flow growth among our peers, major oil companies and the top quartile of the S&P 500. As our portfolio becomes increasingly free cash flow positive, we will continue to prioritize the return of capital to our shareholders through further dividend increases and share repurchases. I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. In the third quarter, we delivered strong operational performance. Companywide net production averaged 351,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day excluding Libya, compared to our guidance of 330,000 to 335,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This production beat reflects strong performance across our portfolio. For the fourth quarter, we expect companywide net production to average approximately 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. For the full year 2022, we now expect companywide net production to average approximately 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, up from our previous guidance of approximately 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Turning to the Bakken, third quarter net production averaged 166,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was above our guidance of 155,000 to 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and primarily reflected strong execution and recovery following challenging weather conditions in the first half of the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken net production to average between 165,000 and 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2022, we now forecast Bakken net production to average approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is the high end of our previous guidance range of 150,000 to 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the third quarter, we drilled 20 wells and brought 22 new wells online. For the fourth quarter, we expect to drill approximately 30 wells and to bring approximately 25 new wells online; and for the full year 2022, we expect to drill approximately 90 wells and to bring approximately 80 new wells online. In terms of drilling and completion costs, although we continue to experience cost inflation, we are maintaining our full year average forecast of $6.3 million per well in 2022. Given the improvement in oil prices and our robust inventory of high return drilling locations, we added a fourth rig in July. Moving to a four rig program will allow us to grow net production to approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2024, which will maximize free cash flow generation, optimize our in-basin infrastructure and drive further reductions in our unit cash costs. Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, third quarter net production averaged 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was at the high end of our guidance range of 25,000 to 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily reflecting the successful start up of the Shell-operated Llano 6 tieback. For the fourth quarter and full year 2022, we forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Southeast Asia, net production in the third quarter was 57,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, above our guidance of approximately 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Planned maintenance work was successfully completed at both the North Malay Basin and JDA assets during the third quarter. Fourth quarter and full year 2022 net production is forecast to average between 60,000 and 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now turning to Guyana. In the third quarter, net production from the Liza Phase 1 and Phase 2 developments averaged 98,000 barrels of oil per day, including tax barrels of 7,000 barrels of oil per day \u2013 above our guidance of 90,000 to 95,000 barrels of oil per day. Both the Liza Destiny and Liza Unity Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessels delivered strong operating performance and high facility uptime during the quarter. Guyana net production is forecast to average approximately 110,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter, including tax barrels of 20,000 barrels of oil per day. For the full year 2022, Guyana net production is forecast to average approximately 77,000 barrels of oil per day, including tax barrels of 7,000 barrels of oil per day, slightly above our previous guidance of 75,000 barrels of oil per day. Turning to our third sanctioned development at Payara, topsides installation and development drilling are underway. The overall project is approximately 88% complete. The FPSO Prosperity will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and is on track to achieve first oil at the end of 2023. Our fourth sanctioned development at Yellowtail will utilize the ONE GUYANA FPSO with a gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day. Fabrication of topside modules kicked off in September and the hull is expected to arrive in Singapore in early 2023. The overall project is approximately 29% complete and is on track to achieve first oil in 2025. With regard to our fifth development, Uaru, the operator plans to submit a Plan of Development to the government before the end of this year, with approval expected by the end of the first quarter of 2023. The plan utilizes an FPSO with a gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day with first oil targeted for the end of 2026. As John mentioned, this morning, we announced discoveries at Yarrow and Sailfin. The Yarrow-1 well, located approximately nine miles southeast of the Barreleye-1 well, encountered 75 feet of high quality, oil bearing sandstone reservoir. The Sailfin-1 well, located approximately 15 miles southeast of the Turbot-1 well, encountered 312 feet of high quality, hydrocarbon bearing sandstone reservoir. The Banjo-1 well did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and was expensed in the third quarter. The Banjo-1 well did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and was expensed in the third quarter.  On Block 42 in Suriname, we recently drilled the Zanderij-1 well, where Hess has a 33% interest and Shell is the operator. The well demonstrated a working petroleum system and encountered oil pay. The well results are being evaluated and further exploration activities are being considered.  Looking forward, fourth quarter exploration and appraisal activities on the Stabroek Block in Guyana will include the Fangtooth SE-1 well, which is a deep test located approximately 8 miles southeast of the Fangtooth-1 discovery well. We will also drill the Fish-1 exploration well located approximately 62 miles northwest of Liza-1. This well will target multiple stacked reservoir intervals. In addition, we plan to drill the Lancetfish-1 well, located approximately 3 miles west of the Liza-3 well which will target deeper reservoirs.  In closing, our execution continues to be strong. The Bakken is on a strong, capital efficient growth trajectory, our Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia assets continue to generate significant free cash flow, and Guyana continues to get bigger and better \u2013 all of which position us to deliver industry leading returns, material free cash flow generation and significant shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2022 to the second quarter of 2022. We had net income of $515 million in the third quarter of 2022, or $583 million on an adjusted basis.  Net income was $667 million in the second quarter of 2022. Turning to E&P. E&P adjusted net income was $626 million in the third quarter compared with $723 million in the second quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of E&P earnings between the third quarter and second quarter of 2022 were as follows : Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $370 million. Lower realized selling prices decreased earnings by $314 million. Higher DD&A expense decreased earnings by $70 million. Higher cash costs and Midstream tariffs decreased earnings by $55 million. Higher exploration expenses decreased earnings by $22 million. All other items decreased earnings by $6 million for an overall decrease in third quarter earnings of $97 million.  In the third quarter we sold eight cargos of crude oil in Guyana, up from six cargos in the second quarter. For the third quarter, our E&P sales volumes were underlifted compared with production by approximately 1 million barrels which decreased our after-tax income by approximately $50 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to sell nine cargos from Guyana.  Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $68 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared with $65 million in the second quarter. Midstream EBITDA, before noncontrolling interests, amounted to $252 million in the third quarter of 2022 compared to $241 million in the previous quarter.  Turning to our financial position. At September 30, excluding the Midstream segment, cash and cash equivalents were $2.38 billion, and total liquidity was $5.73 billion including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $5.60 billion.  In the third quarter, we continued our common stock share repurchases with the purchase of approximately 1.4 million shares for $150 million. We intend to acquire the remaining board authorized amount of $310 million in the fourth quarter of this year. Total cash returned to shareholders in the third quarter amounted to $265 million including dividends. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $1.4 billion in the third quarter compared with $1.5 billion in the second quarter, primarily due to lower realized selling prices. In the third quarter, changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash flow from operating activities by $66 million. E&P capital and exploratory expenditures were $701 million in the third quarter and $622 million in the second quarter.  Now turning to guidance. First for E&P, our E&P cash costs in the third quarter of 2022 were $13.19 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $13.64 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $13 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and in the range of $13.50 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year, which is unchanged from our previous guidance. DD&A expense was $12.56 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya and $13.03 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya in the third quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $13 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and $12.50 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year, which is also unchanged from our previous guidance. This results projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $26 to $27 per barrel of oil equivalent for both the fourth quarter and full year 2022.  Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $155 million for the full year, which is down from our previous full year guidance of $160 million to $170 million. The Midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $310 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $1,205 million for the full year, which is within the range of our previous full year guidance of $1,190 million to $1,215 million. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya is expected to be approximately $210 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $560 million for the full year, which is up from our previous full year guidance range of $540 million to $550 million. We expect non-cash option premium amortization, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices, will be approximately $165 million for the fourth quarter.  Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $800 million in the fourth quarter and full year guidance of approximately $2.7 billion remains unchanged. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $65 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $270 million for the full year, which is the midpoint of our previous full year guidance range of $265 million to $275 million.  For corporate; Corporate expenses are estimated to be approximately $35 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $135 million for the full year, which is down from our previous full year guidance of approximately $150 million. Interest expense is estimated to be approximately $85 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $345 million for the full year, which is at the lower end of our previous full year guidance range of $345 million to $350 million.  This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open. Arun Jayaram : Yeah. Good morning, Arun Jayaram from JPMorgan. John Rielly : Morning. Arun Jayaram : Morning guys. John, I know you guys are pretty knee deep, in your planning and budgeting process, but I was wondering if you could offer any, soft guidance commentary for 2023 as we think about volumes and CapEx and what is obviously in a little bit more of an inflationary environment in particularly offshore. John Rielly : Sure, Arun. Thanks for the question. As usual, we will provide, to your point, our 2023 capital guidance in January, but I'll try to give you some high-level information now compared to 2022. So if we're going to start with Guyana. In 2022, we have $1 billion of development spend. And as you know, that includes two projects, Payara and Yellowtail. So in 2023, we will continue spending on Payara and Yellowtail, but we will add, subject to government approval, a third development project at Uaru. And, to a lesser amount a gas to energy project as well. So while the Uaru project is going to have industry-leading returns and a low cost of supply, the cost of the Uaru project, as you mentioned, will be higher, reflecting the current market conditions as well as additional scope to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. So with that, we currently expect our Guyana spend to increase by approximately $500 million to $700 million in 2023. So the midpoint of that would be going up from $1 billion to $1.6 billion. In the Bakken, we are spending approximately $850 million this year, and we added the fourth rig later in the year. So we expect an additional $250 million of spend in 2023, reflecting a full year of a 4-rig program. And that 4-rig program as well as the expected industry inflation drives that $250 million increase there in the Bakken. In the Gulf of Mexico, we are still finalizing our 2023 program, but we do see the potential for two well tiebacks and also one hub class exploration opportunity. So with that is approximately $150 million increase in the Gulf of Mexico. So therefore, adding those up, taking the midpoint of the Guyana number, we expect our 2023 capital exploratory spend, and again, it's preliminary to be approximately $3.7 billion or about $1 billion more than 2022. Arun Jayaram : Great. And any thoughts on just overall volumes or too premature at this point? John Rielly : It is premature at this point. And I mean, again, think about us from a longer-term standpoint on production growth, we've seen that we can grow our top line production growth. And it's just an output of the great opportunities that we have in Guyana that over the long term, we can grow at greater than 10%. Because \u2013 just think about in 2024 now, as Greg mentioned earlier, we'll get the Bakken to 200,000 barrels a day. And then we'll have Payara on as well. So that's going to add another 50,000 to 55,000 barrels. So right then add those two together, you're almost up 25% absolute from where we are right now. So again, as we move into next year, we'll give that production guide early in the year. But the growth is going to be lumpy basically when the FPSOs come online. So that's how you should think about it as we move into next year. Arun Jayaram : Great. And just my follow-up, I wanted to \u2013 I've gotten some buy-side queries on Exxon's release today. And maybe you could just help clarify they mentioned in their release that they expect Guyana's oil productive capacity to be more than 1 million barrels by the end of the decade. John, today, you mentioned you'll have six FPSOs by 2027, which is in line with the consortium's previous outlook. Anything in that comment, in Exxon's release that you could kind of clarify? John Hess : No, you have to ask Exxon about that but our comment about by 2027 having productive capacity growth of over 1 million barrels of oil per day. That's very consistent with what Exxon has said the last several years, and that's the correct\u2026 Arun Jayaram : Okay, great. Probably just semantics. Thanks a lot, John. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open. Doug Leggate : I love the pronunciation. Good morning everybody. John Hess : Good morning Doug. Doug Leggate : John, I guess I would like to \u2013 sorry to be up on this last point that Arun mentioned. But I know I've asked you and I've asked Exxon this before and anyone who's listened \u2013 knows that Exxon's answer is they're basically being conservative. But tell me why, with the long plateaus that you're clearly going to have in these boats, so the production capacity of an additional [indiscernible] doesn't get you close to $1.3 billion. Over $1 million just seems to me is getting a bit old, pardon my expression, but it looks to us, at least 30% over that was what you've got line of sight on. Why is that not right? John Hess : Doug, I think the 2027 number of six FPSOs and at least 1 million barrels a day of gross production is a good number. It's a conservative number, and is there some upside to that? Yes, there certainly is. Doug Leggate : Is my math wrong? John Hess : No. Well, as opposed to talking about your math, let's talk about our math. We're saying 1 million barrels a day, six FPSOs, 2027, there's upside to that number. Doug Leggate : Okay. All right. Sorry to press. All right. My follow-up is as you look into \u2013 John's obviously walked through the CapEx story. Obviously, the cash \u2013 the recovery of the cash flow of CapEx in Guyana makes a lot of that, obviously, just somewhat move to the overall cash return story, I guess, given how quickly you get the money back. So I guess my question is that the 75% of free cash flow target, you're clearly lagging that this year. What can we expect by way of an inflection in cash returns in 2023 at pricing current strip? John Hess : Yes Doug, thanks for the question. It's an excellent one. As we look to 2023, our financial priorities remain first, to invest in our high-return opportunities, especially in Guyana and Bakken that John talked about, the $3.7 billion capital program. Second to maintain a strong cash position and balance sheet to ensure that we can fund these high-return opportunities and investments through the cycle. Then we would give strong consideration next year to further increasing our regular dividend. And then following that, in line with the capital return program, where we have committed to returning the remainder of our free cash flow up to 75% through share repurchases. And similar to this year, we have the flexibility to return in excess of 75%. You'll recall, at the end of the quarter, we had $2.38 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So we have flexibility for next year. So depending upon market conditions, oil prices, financial prices, where the recession and the economic slowdown come out, we'll be positioned to increase our return on capital further. But that's going to be a decision that we'll make as we go into next year. First, to make sure that we can fund our high-return programs; second, keep the strong balance sheet; third, increase the dividend. And then anything left over as we go out, not just next year but in the years ahead, and we deliver increasing levels of free cash flow. We expect share repurchases will represent a growing proportion of our capital return program in the years ahead. Doug Leggate : So, John, just to be clear, you've got a debt maturity next year. How much is that? John Rielly : It's actually in 2024, and it's $300 million, in 2024. And we do expect to... Doug Leggate : 2024, got it. John Rielly : Yes. Hey Doug, I just want to make sure what you said earlier because this year, we are actually returning more than our 75% in our framework. So just remember, our framework, we did our debt reduction of $500 million. And as John mentioned, our framework has the flexibility when oil prices are strong to do more than 75%. And that's what we are doing this year. As John mentioned, we'll complete the $310 million in the fourth quarter. So again, we have that flexibility to stay strong. And as John said, depending on market conditions, we'll do 75% or more, we'll see. Doug Leggate : Thanks so much guys. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stephen Richardson with Evercore. Please go ahead. Stephen Richardson : Good morning. Thank goodness for easy to pronounce names. Could I was wondering if I could ask Greg, a couple on exploration. On one, it seems that you've got a success at Uaru and Banjo-1 sounds like it wasn't. Our recollection was that this was testing for the inboard oil play to the Southeast. Could you maybe talk about a little bit more to the extent that you're able in terms of those two? And what was confirmed and what wasn't? And what we should take away from that? Greg Hill : Yes, sure. So first of all, I would say the inboard oil play has been very successful because we've had four discoveries in the area. So recall, Barreleye had 230 feet of high-quality pay. Seabob had 131 feet of high-quality pay, as we announced this morning; Uaru had 75 feet of high-quality pay. And finally, Lukanani had 115 feet of high-quality pay. So all of those will help to underpin a future development. And even though Banjo was dry, it had noncommercial qualities of \u2013 quantities of hydrocarbons; it had hydrocarbons that went through it. We've got more wells to drill in that area. So if I step back and say four successes, one non-commercial and more to come, I still feel very optimistic about \u2013 I still feel very optimistic about the inboard play. And also, I think it's important to know that Banjo was the Western most prospect that we drilled in that inboard play as well. Stephen Richardson : That's helpful. And maybe, Greg, I mean, this whole semantics around the 1 million barrels or the six boats or the 10 boats or whatever it may be, could you maybe \u2013 at what point should we be thinking that we get more clarity in terms of the length of plateau versus additional boats? Is this something that we're going to be \u2013 get some additional clarity on the next 12, 24 months? Or is this a longer event as we kind of see how the reservoirs react in production? But it seems to us that\u2019s the \u2013 as we think about recovering 11-plus billion barrels, those are kind of the two variables? John Hess : Yes. Steve, I want Greg to answer that. But you have the clarity on what production is going to be. It grows a million barrels a day at least in 2027. I think that\u2019s really important. So people don\u2019t get confused by other releases. That is the number, and there\u2019s upside to that. Now, Greg can talk more about tiebacks and plateaus, but that million barrels a day is a very good number that people should use in terms of having clarity and visibility of the production growth trajectory. Greg Hill : Okay. Great. So, I think the plateau rates or lengths, I should say, are going to vary by vessel. However, given the high resource density and the potential for near-field tiebacks. And that\u2019s in both the upper campaign and the deeper plays, because remember, the deep play underlies the shallow or upper campaign in reservoir. So, we expect to see these production plateaus main for a longer period than what would be typical for other deepwater development. So, I\u2019m pretty optimistic about the length of the plateaus. But again, each one will be bespoke based upon the reservoir density in and around each vessel. Stephen Richardson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Neil Mehta : Good morning team. John Hess : Good morning. Neil Mehta : Morning, John. First question is around the Bakken. Really good quarter for you guys here after some weather issues earlier this year. Can you just refresh us on how we should be thinking about the trajectory in the Bakken in 2023 and then as you get into 2024 as well? Greg Hill : Sure. So, we guided $165 million to $170 million in the fourth quarter of this year. And that really reflects a couple of things. One is most of the wells are going to be completed at the back end of the quarter. We also looked at our historic kind of weather performance in the fourth quarter, and we increased our contingency a little bit in the fourth quarter to reflect that. If you think about where we\u2019re headed in the Bakken with the four rigs, that\u2019s going to allow us to increase production to about 200,000 barrels a day in 2024. And with our extensive inventory of high-return wells, we expect to hold this plateau for nearly a decade and then generate significant free cash flow. And during that period of time, you can assume that the oil percentage of the wellhead is going to be broadly flat at around that 65%. So, you can almost end point this year and pretty much straight line to the end of 2024, assuming the end of 2024 would be 200,000, and that will give you a reasonable approximation of what the trajectory will be. Neil Mehta : All right. That\u2019s good color here. And then, John, if I could ask you to step back and talk about your view on the macro, you always have a good read on the oil markets. Just your perspective on where we are in terms of the rebalancing as you go into 2023? And how that feeds into your framework around hedging given the backwardation in the curve? John Hess : Yes. I\u2019ll give some remarks on further detail on how we see the oil market, and John Rielly will talk about our hedging. Look, the impact of high interest rates, strong dollar, inflation obviously is being felt in the financial markets. You know better than anybody, from your perspective, it\u2019s already being felt, not only in the financial markets and the pullback, but also in certain parts of the economy. But I have to say, even though we\u2019ve seen a slowing of demand in China and in Europe overall, global oil demand continues to be pretty resilient. And we\u2019re not seeing a major impact from inflation in the high dollar in oil demand itself. And in fact, as we look out to next year between China reopening its economy and continuing to increase overall global air travel, we see upside to current demand globally of 100 million barrels or going up a million barrels a day next year. I don\u2019t think if there is a pullback in the economy where it does affect oil demand, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anywhere near what it was during the world financial crisis, which was upwards of two million barrels a day. But I think part of what\u2019s going on here, there\u2019s been a slow but steady increase in demand recovering from COVID, and we haven\u2019t completed that recovery yet. And that\u2019s the major reason, oil demand. We think as you go into next year, we\u2019ll go up at least a million barrels a day from the 100 million a day right now. The risk, I think, is to the upside. What\u2019s going to happen with Russia oil supply, what\u2019s going to happen with Russia gas supply? How do we get through the winter? I think \u2013 how cold is the winter? That if anything, could increase that million barrels a day that I just talked about. As you know, there\u2019s oil substitution for gas supply industrially, some residential, commercial, both in Europe and Asia, obviously, on the electricity side. How much that fuel substitution remains to be seen as well. So, we see the market if anything, having strengthening impact tailwinds going into the winter. And as such, I\u2019d say there\u2019s more upside to the price from where we are now than there is downside. But with that sort of as a backdrop, John, how about our hedging? John Rielly : Sure. So with that backdrop, I mean, Neil, what we do is, we use put options for our hedging strategy. And with all the variables that John just mentioned and the time value here the volatility levels right now, putting on the puts would be too expensive. So, we do plan to get the similar level of hedge protection that we had this year. Now, we will continue to watch the market. We\u2019ll try to get some on in the fourth quarter, but it could be early next year that we get these hedges on. So, you should expect us to get that \u2013 a similar hedge position on. It will just be a matter of timing when we do it. And again, just with put options. John Hess : And again, to underline what John said, that\u2019s to protect the downside and still give our shareholders the benefit of the upside. Neil Mehta : Makes a lot of sense. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Roger Read : Yes. Good morning. Going to come back, I guess, a little bit on the CapEx, and I know you\u2019re hesitant to get any more than what you\u2019ve had. But I\u2019m just a little curious as you look across the various regions you operate onshore, U.S., offshore, U.S. and Guyana, how much of \u2013 when you look out, you can say, is fairly well committed or contracted, signed where there\u2019s not a lot of risk of a surprise as we think about 23% on the CapEx front, the underlying inflation that we\u2019re just kind of seeing everywhere? Greg Hill : Yes. So on the inflation, like our competitors, we\u2019re seeing upward pressure across both our onshore and offshore businesses and steel prices, labor costs, rig rates. So let\u2019s talk about the Bakken first. Regarding the Bakken, now what we\u2019ve seen this year, the industry has seen overall inflation of 15% to 20% versus 2021. However, as you know, our teams have been able to reduce this to 8.5%. And we\u2019ve done that through lean manufacturing, strategic contracting and technology, and that\u2019s enabled us to deliver that B and C cost of $6.3 million per well in 2022. So our net inflation has been about half of what the industry has seen in the Bakken, if you will. Now, if we look to 2023 in broad terms, we\u2019re anticipating a further 15% to 20% inflation in oil country tubular goods, even though steel prices are moderating, the mills are still at capacity and demand is very strong. We\u2019re also expecting 15% to 20% potentially in drilling rigs and 5% to 10% inflation in frac spreads, frac sand and labor. So that kind of gives you an idea. Now of course, we\u2019re working to mitigate some of these further increases, and we\u2019ll guide well cost in the Bakken in January 2023 as usual. And recall in Guyana, the first four FPSOs are contracted and have limited exposure to inflation, and I should add that operators have done an excellent job of offsetting any inflation in oil country tubular goods, et cetera, through the efficiency gains that they\u2019ve realized in Guyana. Now as already mentioned, the Uaru FPSO cost is going to reflect current market conditions as well as scope changes, and we\u2019ll give an update on Uaru once the project has been approved and sanctioned, but it will still be world-class, still have world-class breakevens. Roger Read : Yes, it\u2019s certainly something to watch down there. And the only other question I had is related to Guyana. Has there been any update, any change to the thoughts of gas development down there long term? I mean I know we have the pipeline to be onshore, but anything else as you\u2019ve had these additional discoveries and as you\u2019re thinking about out to the 2027 period with six FPSOs? Greg Hill : No. I think in the short term, it\u2019s all about the gas pipeline to sure slipstream [indiscernible] off of Liza and supply onshore clean power plant that the government will build. Beyond that, very long term in terms of LNG or anything like that\u2019s way down the road. We are focused on optimizing the development plan to move those oily developments forward. And as John said, we have clear visibility to six, and the seventh is likely just around the corner. That will be an oily boat as well. Roger Read : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Sankey Research. Your line is open. Paul Sankey : Good morning, everyone. John Hess, while you\u2019re on the subject of oil markets, could you give an update and outlook for Libya, please? Thank you. John Hess : Paul, thanks for the easy question. Look, Libya is still having political unrest, political divide between the east and the west. And there are some encouraging signs that they\u2019re going to start coming together for the leadership of the country. But it would be premature for me to comment further on that. We are still hopeful that we\u2019re going to be able to conclude our sale of our assets there to total and ConocoPhillips, but it needs a leadership approval from the government and that\u2019s a work in progress. Paul Sankey : Understood. Another thing which is a little bit inside baseball, but maybe an opportunity for you to talk about a big theme is the asset retirement obligations that you had in the quarter. Is that a sort of a one and done payment that you\u2019re making in the Gulf of Mexico? Is there an outlook there for more of the same, or is that sort of putting an end to it? And could you comment on the overall attractiveness and position in the Gulf in Mexico and your plans there? We don\u2019t really talk too much about it. But obviously, we\u2019re aware you\u2019ve got a pretty good position. Thanks. John Hess : So I\u2019ll start with the asset retirement obligations, then I\u2019ll hand it over to Greg for the Gulf. So the asset retirement obligations that we had that we took the charge on this quarter, it was basically for non-producing properties that we just updated our estimates on those wells that are being abandoned. And this is really kind of near-term wells that we\u2019re going to be working on. So that yes, is more of a one time. Now overall, like we\u2019ve got a lot of wells that will come to be abandoned, but over the long term, and the change in the estimate for all those wells, were not that much, but what happens from an accounting standpoint is when they\u2019re producing, you increase the liability, increase the asset. So again, I would say you don\u2019t have to think about it more as a recurring type thing. This is kind of a one off for these non-producing properties that we have in the near term. Greg Hill : Thanks. And Paul, let me talk about, kind of where we\u2019re headed, in the Gulf. So, as you kind of intimated, the Gulf of Mexico remains in a really important cash engine and platform for growth for us. And so our objective is to sustain or grow production there through both tiebacks and hub class exploration opportunities. So we\u2019ve been selectively rebuilding our Gulf of Mexico portfolio, as you know, in the last six years, and we\u2019ve acquired more than 60 new lease blocks and have a really good balance of both types of opportunities. So I think a good planning assumption is that we would drill two wells per year for the next several years, and then if we kind of hone in on 2023, we\u2019re still finalizing the program. But we\u2019re seeing the potential next year for two tiebacks and one hub class exploration opportunity based upon the success of our Huron well this year. And also in most of these prospects that I talked about, our partners are Shell and Chevron. So we\u2019re in with a very good partnership in the Gulf. Paul Sankey : Got it. And I\u2019ll ask a leading question, has government policy made a difference to the way you\u2019ve looked at the Gulf of Mexico? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Greg Hill : No, it hasn\u2019t. Paul Sankey : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question, one moment. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Bob Brackett : Hey, good morning. Thanks for the color on the Uaru development and you mentioned 250,000 a day, I\u2019d seen third party reports at 275 [ph] a day. And it sort of begs the question, given that standard haul, how large could you get in terms of what\u2019s the capacity limit for an FPSO of that class? Greg Hill : Oh, thanks, Bob. I think, the opportunity to kind of debottleneck is going to be bespoke. So it\u2019s going to be vessel by vessel. Now, recall with debottleneck Phase 1, it went from 120 to 140. Based on the early production performance of Phase 2, it looks likely that we will probably have some debottleneck potential there. As these well \u2013 as these vessels come on, based upon the early production history, call it the first year or so, that is when you\u2019ll decide, where your pinch points are and how much bottlenecking capability there is on each vessel. So it\u2019s going to be bespoke and we\u2019ll just have to wait and see what that early production data shows. Bob Brackett : And in terms of maximum capacity, any guess? Greg Hill : Well, I think, 10% to 15% is kind of what would be typical, if you look at Phase 1 and maybe potentially Phase 2, 275, I don\u2019t know, I just don\u2019t know. Again, every vessel is going to be different and I think it\u2019d be premature to throughout numbers like that. John Hess : Yes. And Bob, obviously, this is all subject to government approval. We\u2019re going to be putting our plan of development in and assuming something in the range conceptually of 250 a day is probably a good planning assumption, but again, it\u2019s subject to government approval. Bob Brackett : Very clear. Follow-up then, this has been your biggest year of sort of deeper Santonian exploration Guyana, any update on progress and learnings thoughts about the Santonian? Greg Hill : Well, I think, the results speak for themselves. I mean, the deep is very promising. And I think we will continue. As I said in my opening remarks, we will continue to really understand, the deep potential with many of the wells that we\u2019re going to be drilling in the fourth quarter. Fangtooth Southeast, for example, located eight miles Southeast of Fangtooth is going to spud. And then that, Fangtooth is a very high quality, very large reservoir system, and putting another well, eight miles Southeast of there will tell us a lot. So I am very optimistic about the deep. John Hess : Yes. And there are a number of other prospects that we had a recent review on one\u2019s called Lancetfish, which is the East of Fangtooth. Then we have Fish-1 and Fish-2 that are reasonable distance to the West and Northwest of Fangtooth. So, there\u2019s a lot of prospectivity to come. As we get more success in finding these deeper horizons, our ability to correlate the seismic new prospects are lighting up. So there\u2019s a lot more upside that Greg\u2019s talking about that hopefully in the next six months we\u2019ll be able to give updates on. Greg Hill : Yes. And Bob, just to remind you that, the Phase 1 is 62 miles Northwest of Liza-1, so that gives you an idea the extent of some of these deep reservoir systems, what we see. And then of course, Lancetfish is tuck close to Liza, it\u2019s about three miles west of the Liza-1 well, and it\u2019s targeting deep sands that underlie that Liza complex. Bob Brackett : Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. All right. And our last question is from the line of Noel Parks with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open. Noel Parks : Hi, good morning. John Hess : Morning. Noel Parks : I was wondering at Banjo if you could just talk a bit about how the results there sort of maybe ripple through your analysis. It \u2013 thinking about maybe the seismic interpretation or if there is anything else you learned about beyond just the aerial extent of the resource there? Greg Hill : No, look again, I think we already talked about the significance of Banjo. I think that the question is really about the inboard oil play. And recall, we\u2019ve had four discoveries in this area, Barreleye, Seabob, Uaru, Lukanani, which all had significant amounts of oil pay. Banjo was the western most well, so in that area, it was a bit of an out step, if you will, from the fairway. We\u2019ve got a bunch more wells to drill in that area. So I don\u2019t think you should read anything negative into the Banjo result at all. Noel Parks : Okay. fair enough. And I just wanted to turn to the Bakken for a minute, and just wondering if you had any updated thoughts on or experience with recompletions up there. If I recall, you had done some work going back to some of the oldest vintage wells were done sort of with the original much lighter completions out there. And so, and if you have been doing anything out there, what adventure, I guess, about what the returns might look like for that sort of work? Greg Hill : Well, we have been doing a number of refracts and the results have been very good. And in some cases, the wells, the IP rates that we\u2019re seeing are as good as some of the new wells. And that\u2019s not surprising because these were kind of vintage 001 completions. We have several hundred wells that we could refrac and we will fit them in our program as we go forward. One of the advantages of the refrac program is it allows you more continuity with a frac crew. So we\u2019ve been sort of dovetailing some refracs into our program just to maintain continuity of a second frac crew. So you\u2019ll see more of that activity next year. But so far so good. The results are good and the returns are very good because all the infrastructure are already there, the well\u2019s there, so. Noel Parks : Okay. Thanks a lot. Greg Hill : Yep. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Oh, and Mr. Todd \u2013 remove himself. So thank you very much. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] As a remainder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today\u2019s conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess\u2019 annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also on today\u2019s conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. On the line with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. Today, I will share some thoughts about the oil markets and then discuss our continued progress in executing our strategy. Greg Hill will then cover our operations and John Rielly will review our financial results. Oil and gas will be needed for decades to come and are fundamental to ensure an affordable just and secure energy transition. The world faces a massive dual challenge. We will require approximately 20% more energy globally by 2050. And over the same period, we need to reach net zero emissions. At the end of last year, the International Energy Agency, or IEA, published its latest World Energy Outlook that offers three scenarios and they are scenarios not forecast for how to meet this dual challenge. In all three of the IEA scenarios, the world is facing a structural deficit in energy supply and significantly more investment is required both in oil and gas and also in clean energies. According to the IEA, a reasonable estimate for the global oil and gas investment required to meet demand growth is approximately $500 billion each year for the next 10 years as compared with approximately $300 billion to $400 billion invested annually in the last 5 years. In terms of clean energies, an annual investment of between $3 trillion and $4 trillion is needed each year for the next 10 years, significantly more than last year\u2019s investment of approximately $1.2 trillion. Business leaders and government officials must have a sober understanding of this investment challenge, especially since capital is becoming more scarce and more expensive in the current financial environment. The energy transition is going to take a long time, costs a lot of money and require many technologies that do not exist today. To have an orderly energy transition, policymakers must have climate literacy, energy literacy and economic literacy. Our strategy is to grow our resource base, deliver our low cost of supply and generate industry leading cash flow growth and at the same time, maintain our industry leadership in environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. Our successful execution of this strategy has uniquely positioned our company to deliver significant value to shareholders for years to come both by growing intrinsic value and by growing cash returns. In terms of cash flow growth, we have an industry leading rate of change story and an industry leading duration story, providing a unique value proposition. Based upon a flat Brent oil price of $65 per barrel, our cash flow is forecast to increase by approximately 25% annually between 2021 and 2026, more than twice as fast as our top line growth. And our balance sheet will also continue to strengthen with our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio currently under 1x. As our portfolio becomes increasingly free cash flow positive, we are committed to returning up to 75% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders with the remainder going to strengthen the balance sheet by increasing our cash position or further reducing our debt to ensure that we can fund our high-return investment opportunities through the cycle. Executing this strategy in 2022, we decreased our debt by $500 million, increased our regular quarterly dividend by 50% and completed a $650 million stock repurchase program. Looking ahead, we plan to continue increasing our regular dividend to a level that is attractive to income-oriented investors, but sustainable in a low oil price environment. As our free cash flow generation steadily increases in future years, share repurchases are expected to represent a growing proportion of our return of capital. By investing only in high-return low-cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated and balanced portfolio focused on Guyana, the Bakken, Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. Key to our strategy is Guyana, which is home to the Stabroek Block, one of the largest oil provinces discovered in the world over the last 20 years, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator. Since 2015, we have had more than 30 discoveries on the Block, including 9 last year, underpinning a gross discovered recoverable resource estimate of more than 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent with multibillion barrels of exploration potential remaining. We are pleased to announce today a significant new oil discovery at the Fangtooth Southeast-1 well, located approximately 8 miles southeast of the original Fangtooth-1 discovery. The Fangtooth Southeast-1 well encountered approximately 200 feet of oil-bearing stand stone reservoirs and was drilled to 5,397 feet of water. Fangtooth was our first standalone deep exploration prospect on the Stabroek Block and this area has the potential to underpin a future oil development. Our four sanctioned oil developments on the Stabroek Block have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. We have line of sight to 6 floating production storage and offloading vessels or FPSOs [Technical Difficulty] billion, of which more than 80% will be allocated to Guyana and the Bakken. Our financial priorities are to continue to allocate capital to our high-return low cost investment opportunities, to keep a strong cash position and balance sheet, and to grow our dividend and as market conditions and our return of capital framework provide to increase share repurchases. In Guyana, the Liza Phase 1 and Liza Phase 2 developments are currently operating at their combined gross production capacity of more than 360,000 barrels of oil per day. Our third development, Payara, remains on schedule for startup by the end of 2023, with a gross production capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day. Our fourth development, Yellowtail, is expected to come online in 2025, with a gross production capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day. A plan of development for our fifth development in Uaru with a gross production capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day was submitted to the Government of Guyana in November and final approval is expected by the end of the first quarter. We also will continue an active exploration and appraisal program in Guyana with approximately 10 wells planned for the Stabroek Block in 2023. In the Bakken, we plan to continue operating a 4-rig program, which will enable us to generate significant free cash flow, lower our unit cash costs and further optimize our infrastructure. We have a robust inventory of high-return drilling locations to enable us to grow net production to an average of 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025. Greg and his team continue to do an outstanding job of applying lean manufacturing principles to create a culture of innovation, improve efficiency and manage inflationary cost pressures. We will continue to invest in our operated cash engines offshore in 2023, where we also see attractive investment opportunities. In the Gulf of Mexico, we plan to drill two infrastructure tieback wells and two exploration wells. And in Southeast Asia, we will invest in drilling and production facilities at both the North Malay Basin and joint development area assets. As we continue to execute our strategy, our commitment to sustainability will remain a top priority. In December, we announced one of the largest private sector forest preservation agreements in the world, to purchase high-quality, independently verified REDD+ carbon credits for a minimum of $750 million between 2022 and 2032 directly from the Government of Guyana. Protecting the world\u2019s forests and the important role they play as natural carbon sinks is foundational to the Paris Agreement\u2019s aim of limiting the global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Avoiding global deforestation was one of the major commitments made at the COP26 Climate Summit, where more than 130 countries, including Guyana, pledged to end deforestation by 2030. The Government of Guyana plans to invest the proceeds from our carbon credits purchase agreement in sustainable development to improve the lives of the people of Guyana, with 15% of the proceeds directed to indigenous communities. This agreement adds to our company\u2019s ongoing and successful emissions reduction efforts and is an important part of our commitment to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions on a net equity basis by 2050. The agreement further strengthens our strategic partnership with Guyana and demonstrates our long-term commitment to the country and its people, building upon the national healthcare initiative we announced earlier in 2022. We are proud to have been recognized throughout 2022 as an industry leader in our environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. In November, Hess earned a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the 13th consecutive year and for the first time was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. In December, we also achieved leadership status in CDP\u2019s annual global climate analysis for the 14th consecutive year. In summary, we continue to successfully execute our strategy, which offers a unique value proposition, both to grow our intrinsic value and to grow our cash returns, by increasing our resource base, delivering a low cost supply and generating industry leading cash flow growth. As our portfolio becomes increasingly free cash flow positive, we will continue to prioritize the return of capital to our shareholders through further dividend increases and share repurchases. I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. 2022 was another year of strong strategic execution and operational performance for Hess. Proved reserves at the end of 2022 stood at approximately 1.26 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Net proved reserve additions of 184 million barrels of oil equivalent were primarily the result of the Yellowtail sanction in Guyana and the Bakken. Excluding asset sales, we replaced 144% of 2022 production at a finding and development cost of approximately $14.80 per barrel of oil equivalent. Turning to production. In the fourth quarter of 2022, company-wide net production averaged 376,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was above our guidance of approximately 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Strong performance across the portfolio more than offset the severe winter weather impacts experienced in the Bakken during the month of December. For the full year 2023, we forecast net production to average between 355,000 and 365,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of approximately 10% compared with 2022 production of 327,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. For the first quarter of 2023, we forecast company-wide net production to average between 345,000 and 355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the Bakken, fourth quarter net production of 158,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was below our guidance of 165,000 to 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting severe winter weather impacts in December, which limited our new wells online to only 15 in the quarter. For the full year 2022, net production averaged 154,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In 2023, we plan to operate 4 rigs and expect to drill approximately 110 gross operated wells and bring online approximately 110 new wells. In the first quarter of 2023, we plan to drill approximately 25 wells and bring 25 new wells online. In 2022, our drilling and completion cost per Bakken well averaged $6.4 million. In 2023, we estimate industry inflation will average between 10% and 15%. However, we expect to mitigate this impact through the application of lean manufacturing and technology and forecast our D&C cost to average approximately $6.9 million per well or about 8% above last year. For the full year 2023, we forecast Bakken net production will average between 165,000 and 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. First quarter net production is forecast to average between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting weather contingencies and the carryover effects from the severe winter weather in December. Net Bakken production is forecast to steadily grow over the course of \u201823 and \u201824 and average approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025. We expect to hold this level of production for nearly a decade. Moving to the offshore, in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 31,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2022. For the first quarter and full year 2023, we forecast net production in the Gulf of Mexico will average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting normal field declines and planned maintenance. The Deepwater Gulf of Mexico remains an important cash engine for the company as well as a platform for growth. In 2023, we plan to participate in 4 wells, 1 infrastructure-led exploration well, 1 hub class exploration well, and 2 tieback wells. The infrastructure-led exploration well will be the Hess-operated Pickerel Prospect located in Mississippi Canyon Block 727, which is expected to spud in April and will be brought online through existing infrastructure at Tubular Bells. The well will target the same Miocene interval that was successfully drilled at Esox and tied back to Tubular Bells in 2020. The hub class exploration well will be spud in the second half of the year and will be a Hess-operated opportunity in the Northern Green Canyon area in the Gulf of Mexico, targeting high-quality sub-salt Miocene sands in areas where the application of the latest seismic imaging technology has improved the sub-salt image. The 2 tieback wells will be spud in the fourth quarter, 1 well will be at Stampede and the second well will be at the Shell-operated Llano field. First oil from both wells is expected in 2024. In Southeast Asia, net production from the joint development area in North Malay Basin, where Hess has a 50% interest, averaged 67,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2022. For the first quarter and full year 2023, we forecast net production in Southeast Asia, the average between 60,000 and 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Turning to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator, the partnership delivered exceptional facilities for liability, project delivery and exploration success in 2022. Net production from Guyana averaged 116,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 78,000 barrels of oil per day for the full year 2022, both above our guidance. For the first quarter and the full year 2023, we forecast net production in Guyana to average approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day. Turning to developments. Liza Phase 1 was successfully debottlenecked in 2022 and has been operating at or above its revised nameplate capacity of 140,000 barrels of oil per day. Liza Phase 2, utilizing Liza Unity FPSO, achieved first oil in February of last year and production ramp-up from start-up to nameplate capacity was achieved in about 5 months, which is world-class performance in the deepwater. The Liza Unity is currently operating at or above its nameplate capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day. Production optimization opportunities are currently being considered for late 2023. The third development, Payara, is approximately 93% complete. The Prosperity FPSO is expected to depart from Singapore in late first quarter and commence hookup and commissioning activities following arrival in Guyana. The project remains ahead of schedule and is anticipated to achieve first oil by the end of 2023. Yellowtail, our fourth development, is approximately 40% complete and remains on track for first oil in 2025. The ONE GUYANA FPSO is - hull is completed and is expected to enter drydock in Singapore in April. Topside fabrication activities have commenced and module fabrication sites in Singapore and China and development drilling is underway. The final development plan for our fifth development, Uaru, was submitted in November, and we are currently awaiting approval by the Government of Guyana, which we anticipate by the end of the first quarter. Pending government approvals, our sixth development, Whiptail, is expected to be sanctioned early next year. Turning to exploration. The Fangtooth Southeast-1 well, located approximately 8 miles southeast of the original Fangtooth-1 discovery well, resulted in a significant new oil discovery, and this area could form the basis for a future oil development on the Stabroek Block. The Fangtooth Southeast-1 well encountered approximately 200 feet of oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs and further appraisal activities are underway. We continue to see multibillion barrels of additional exploration potential on the Stabroek Block. And in 2023, we plan to drill approximately 10 exploration and appraisal wells that will target a variety of prospects and play types. These will include lower risk wells near existing discoveries and several penetrations that will test deeper intervals. With regard to upcoming wells, operations are continuing at the Tarpon Fish-1 well in the northwest corner of the Stabroek Block, approximately 43 miles northwest of the Liza-1 well. The well is in the first test of cretaceous age clastic reservoirs in Northwest Stabroek. The well will also test a deeper Jurassic aged carbonate prospect. Lancetfish-1 is a deep play exploration well, located approximately 2.5 miles northeast of the Fangtooth Southeast-1 well that underlies a portion [underneath] the field. Drilling operations are underway on the Noble Don Taylor drillship. Beyond that, there is a well called Basher, which will target a deep prospect in the Fangtooth area and a well called Blackfin which will penetrate an updip upper Campanian prospect east of Barreleye. Moving to offshore Canada, we plan to participate in the BP-operated Ephesus-1 well in the Northern Orphan Basin. The well will target a very large submarine fan of tertiary age. The Stena IceMAX rig is expected to arrive on location in the second quarter despite the well, which is located in approximately 4,000 feet of water. BP has a 50% working interest and Hess and Chevron, each have 25%. In summary, our execution in 2022 was again strong, and 2023 will be an exciting year with the Bakken returning to a steady growth trajectory, with an active drilling program in the Gulf of Mexico and with the advancement of our major projects and further delineation of the significant upside in Guyana, all of which position us to deliver industry-leading performance and significant shareholder value for many years to come. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly. John Rielly : Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the third quarter of 2022. We had net income of $624 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with $515 million in the third quarter of 2022. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings, we had net income of $548 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with $583 million in the previous quarter. Turning to E&P. E&P adjusted net income was $591 million in the fourth quarter compared with $626 million in the third quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of E&P earnings between the fourth and third quarter of 2022 were as follows : higher sales volumes increased earnings by $246 million; lower realized selling prices decreased earnings by $288 million; higher DD&A expense decreased earnings by $29 million; lower cash costs and Midstream tariffs increased earnings by $19 million; lower exploration expenses increased earnings by $13 million; all other items increased earnings by $4 million for an overall decrease in fourth quarter earnings of $35 million. For the fourth quarter, our E&P sales volumes were overlifted compared with production by approximately 1.3 million barrels, which increased our after-tax income by approximately $60 million. Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $64 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with $68 million in the third quarter. Midstream EBITDA, before non-controlling interest, amounted to $244 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $252 million in the previous quarter. Turning to our financial position. At December 31, excluding the Midstream segment, cash and cash equivalents were $2.48 billion; total liquidity was $5.73 billion, including available committed credit facilities; and debt and finance lease obligations totaled $5.6 billion. During the fourth quarter, we completed the sale of our 8% interest in the Waha Concession in Libya for net proceeds of $150 million, and we purchased 5 million REDD+ carbon credits from the Government of Guyana for $75 million. Total cash returned to shareholders in the fourth quarter through share repurchases and dividends amounted to $405 million. We repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of common stock for $310 million in the fourth quarter, bringing total share repurchases in 2022 to $650 million at an average price of approximately $120 per share. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $1.4 billion in both the fourth and third quarter. In the fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities after changes in operating assets and liabilities was $1.25 billion compared with $1.34 billion in the third quarter. E&P capital and exploratory expenditures were $818 million in the fourth quarter compared to $701 million in the third quarter. Now turning to guidance, first for E&P. We project E&P cash costs to be in the range of $14 to $14.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter, which includes a planned workover at the Penn State Field in the Gulf of Mexico. For the full year 2023, E&P cash costs are expected to be in the range of $13.50 to $14.50 per barrel of oil equivalent. DD&A expense is forecast to be in the range of $13 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year 2023. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs to be in the range of $27 to $28 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and $26.50 to $28.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year 2023. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million in the first quarter and $160 million to $170 million for the full year 2023. The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $290 million to $300 million for the first quarter and $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion for the full year 2023. E&P income tax expense is expected to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million for the first quarter and $590 million to $600 million for the full year 2023. As of January 24, 2023, we have purchased WTI put options for 75,000 barrels of oil per day for 2023 with an average monthly floor price of $70 per barrel. We plan to increase our hedge position to a similar level as 2022, depending on market conditions. Based on our current position, we expect non-cash option premium amortization, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices to reduce our earnings by approximately $25 million in the first quarter and by approximately $120 million for the full year 2023. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $850 million in the first quarter and approximately $3.7 billion for the full year of 2023. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million for the first quarter and $255 million to $265 million for the full year 2023. For corporate, corporate expenses are estimated to be approximately $35 million for the first quarter and $120 million to $130 million for the full year 2023. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million for the first quarter and $305 million to $315 million for the full year 2023. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Arun Jayaram : Yes. Good morning. John Hess : Good morning. Arun Jayaram : Greg, I was wondering if you could give us a bit of a teach-in on the deeper sand channels that you\u2019re exploring and have had success at Fangtooth. I know you\u2019re drilling Lancetfish. But give us a sense of \u2013 are you still in the Campanian, but a little bit of a teach-in on what you\u2019re exploring for? Greg Hill : Well, thanks for the question, Arun. Again, as we have said before, if you look at the deeper interval, it\u2019s only 3,000 feet below the upper Campanian in which the majority of our discoveries and if you look at that interval, it really underlies a lot of Stabroek Block. And over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve had a number of penetrations in that tails of existing wells. But I think importantly, the Fangtooth discovery was our first stand-alone deep prospect and the Fangtooth-1, the first well had 164 feet of pay. In the Fangtooth Southeast well, which is located 8.5 miles southeast of that original discovery well, it had 200 feet of oil-bearing pay. And so we are going to continue to appraise that this year, probably get a DST in it. And as you mentioned, there are some other channels in and around Fangtooth, there is one called Lancetfish that\u2019s northeast of Fangtooth, and there is a prospect called Basher, which is actually west of Fangtooth and the combination of all that is pretty exciting. And as John mentioned in his opening remarks, it could mean a potential future oil development in there. We will also continue to explore the deep as we kind of go through the next couple of years. But I think it\u2019s very encouraging, and we will just continue to add to the discovered resource and also the significant exploration upside we see. Arun Jayaram : Got it. Just a follow-up, I know, Greg, you mentioned you\u2019ll do a DST later this year. But what is it about Fangtooth that\u2019s kind of moving it up the development queue, perhaps maybe after Whiptail to be the seventh boat on the Stabroek Block? Greg Hill : Yes. I think it\u2019s that we\u2019re seeing good quality reservoir and again, oil bearing. So our strategy is to continue to progress the oil developments as quickly as we can on the Stabroek Block. So good quality sand and oil bearing. So it\u2019s coming up in the queue. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays. Your line is open. Jeanine Wai : Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. John Hess : Good morning, Jeanine. Jeanine Wai : Good morning. Maybe just going to cash returns real quick here. You\u2019re committed to returning up to 75% of annual adjusted free cash flow through dividends and buybacks. Can you talk about what determines where you fall within that range for 2023, whether it\u2019s related to oil prices, the balance sheet or maybe anything else? I mean we note that you have a really healthy cash balance right now and your debt maturities in \u201824 and \u201827 are pretty manageable. John Hess : Yes. No. Excellent question, Jeanine. As I said earlier, with this capital budget of $3.7 billion, our first priority is to continue to allocate capital to our high-return, low-cost investment opportunities. That\u2019s really priority number one for this year. Along with that, the next priority is to keep a very strong cash position and balance sheet. You heard John saying we bought some puts to provide downside protection, still have unlimited upside appreciation for our shareholders. But I want to protect the downside where it\u2019s a volatile market, and we want to make sure the downside is protected. And then in terms of return on capital, yes, over the year, 75% of that free cash flow will be returned to our shareholders as we did last year. The first priority within that, Jeanine, is to grow our dividend. So our Board meets regularly and will give strong consideration to increasing our dividend during this quarter. Then as the year goes on as market conditions and our return of capital framework provide, then strong consideration will be to increase share repurchases as we did last year. Jeanine Wai : Great. Thank you. And maybe turning back to Guyana here, the Uaru development project, I believe, is anticipated to be around $12.7 billion. Would you be able to comment on the moving pieces versus the Yellowtail cost estimate? For example, how much is related to additional scope versus inflation? And are there other things that aren\u2019t included in that $12.7 billion? And should we consider that as the baseline for future projects, which look to be a similar size or maybe even bigger? Thank you. Greg Hill : Yes. So the $12.7 billion is consistent with the estimate that the operator submitted as part of their EIA to the Government of Guyana. And that number is going to be finalized as the project progresses. And once we sanction it, we will give the final details. But in any case, the final cost of Uaru reflects a couple of things. It reflects current market conditions and then also additional scope. One example is, is the surf is twice as big as Yellowtail, for example, because it connects a number of further away kind of reservoir systems. But we will give you a final color on that once the project is finally sanctioned. John Hess : And I think, Jeanine, what\u2019s also important is Uaru still offers some of the best returns in the industry. So even though there is cost inflation with the resource we\u2019re developing. The fact that it\u2019s low cost, low carbon, it still offers some of the best returns in the industry. Jeanine Wai : Great. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open. Doug Leggate : Hi, good morning, everyone. John Hess : Good morning. Doug Leggate : Guys, I wonder if I could ask a kind of a longer-term question. So Exxon had signaled a couple of years ago that if the deeper horizon worked, John, I think you\u2019ve talked about this a number of times, we could be looking at double the resource potential at the time they were talking 10, so that would be 20 billion BOEs. It seems crazy to think that. But my question is, are you going to have enough time because the exploration phases on the stand that runs out in 2026. And this thing continues to get bigger, we\u2019re already in 2023. What needs to happen for you guys to retain everything that you ultimately could find over the next several years? And what does that mean for development time lines and, I guess, relinquishment of block acreage and so on? John Hess : Yes, Doug, excellent question. We still see multibillion barrels of exploration potential remaining. Greg made some great context remarks on the deeper horizon at 18,000 feet versus where most of our development efforts and exploration efforts have happened at 15,000 feet. We are still in the early innings of defining the deeper potential, definitely multibillion barrels potential remaining. And to get after that, that\u2019s why ExxonMobil is doing an excellent job developing this block, has a six-rig program. Three of them are for development activities and three really are for exploration and appraisal. So, we are going to continue to have a very active exploration appraisal program this year and future years to make sure we capture all the high-value resources that we think are on the block. Doug Leggate : So, just to be clear, John, you think you are going to have enough time in terms of securing the development approvals before \u201826, or do you have an extension on that to secure the development approvals? John Hess : No. The reason we are doing the exploration and appraisal program, Doug, is to get ahead of that to make sure we capture all the resources that we can, and we work closely with our joint venture led by ExxonMobil and the government to do that. Doug Leggate : Thank you. Appreciate that, John. My follow-up, I here want to take this is it\u2019s kind of a two-parter, if you don\u2019t mind, because I think you did mention Uaru's EIS but you have also given guidance on Guyana for this year, which has got a lot of kind of cryptic comments perhaps around downtime for debottlenecking Liza and so on. So, there is a lot of things going on in terms of that 3-year, 4-year visibility. So, my question is this. First of all, can you give us some kind of a guide as to what the downtime and ultimate capacity would look like for Liza-2 as we go through this year? Some sort of trajectory, I guess. And then my kind of Part B is, a lot of people are freaking out over the $12.7 billion number that Exxon put in the EIS. Now, we know that the absolute cost recovery is not a big of a deal. But you guys typically have come in lower than that because of contingency. Can you tell us what Hess\u2019 number is relative to that $12.7 billion? Greg Hill : Yes. Thanks Doug. So, let me take your first question. So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are looking at a potential debottlenecking sometime in the latter half of 2023 for Phase 2. Now, as we have spoken before, each one of these is going to be bespoke, depending on the vessel. You typically want a year of dynamic data before you engineer the project to understand where the pinch points are on the vessel. As I have said in the past, I think you can expect kind of a 10%-ish uplift in any kind of debottlenecking. I think that\u2019s in the range of possibilities here as well. Again, we are just in the early stages of engineering that. So, that would maybe come on in the fourth quarter. So, we have included some downtime for that in the guidance for Guyana. I think the quarter four of 2022 basically had no downtime. And as we project forward to 2023, we are really trying to include pigging and the normal maintenance downtime, some debottlenecking downtime in those production estimates for next year and also the tax barrels are a little bit different what John can talk about. And John can also talk about the CapEx for Uaru. So, John Rielly John Rielly : Yes. On the $12.7 billion, Doug, right now, look, we are going to wait for the final sanction where we come out with our estimates. But you are correct, there was always a contingency in at the beginning of these projects and rightfully so, several years of construction. What we can say is that ExxonMobil has done a fantastic job on every single project, meeting or beating their estimates on cost and on time on execution. So, John has said it earlier, this project will have world-class breakeven, will be world-class returns there in Uaru. We are excited about that. Final details once the government has approved it, we can provide. Doug Leggate : And it\u2019s not lost on as its 30% bigger. Thanks so much John. I appreciate it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Paul Cheng : Hey guys. Good morning. Couple of questions, I think the first kind of is two part is for John Rielly, just to clarify. When you say 75,000 for $70, is that Brent or WTI? And also that when you are talking about in the fourth quarter, the $75 million, the carbon credit purchase, where does it show \u2013 where did you show up in the income statement and the cash flow for the fourth quarter? John Rielly : Sure. So, let me do your first question was on the hedges that we put on. We have WTI put options on right now. So, that\u2019s 75,000. And like I said, we do intend to get to a similar level as last year. And combined between WTI and Brent, we had about 150,000 barrels a day hedged last year. So, again, you should be looking for us to add to this position. But currently, that 75,000 is for WTI put options at $70. Paul Cheng : And John, for the 120 million on the premium for the full year, is that just for this not in anticipation of the increase in the put option you are going to put? John Rielly : That is correct. That is just for the 75,000 we have. Simple math, if you want to double it to get to 150,000, you could double it, but we will give you updates on that as we increase our hedge position. Then your second question on the carbon credits. So, what we have, that 75,000 \u2013 75 million purchase on the carbon credits, you will see it on our balance sheet in other long-term assets. And when you look at, there is nothing on the income statement because that is an asset being held. And on that cash flow statement, it is in working capital. Paul Cheng : Okay. And my final question is for Greg. Bakken, can you tell us what is the winter storm impact in the fourth quarter? And also, I understand the first quarter you have been conservative contingency on the weather. But for the full year production, it seems now you have low compared to what we have expected even after taking into consideration of the first quarter. Is the number of wells that you plan for this year end up is going to be lighter than previously, or is there anything that you can share that seems to be low comparing to what I think previously has been discussing? Greg Hill : No. So, I think let me talk first about the snowfall for that. The severe snowfall coupled with really low wind chill, significantly impacted our ability to mobilize resources. You just can\u2019t put people to work at minus 30, minus 40 wind chill. And so what that did was it significantly increased our backlog of down wells. And then importantly, it delayed bringing new wells online. We projected 25 new wells online coming on in the fourth quarter, that number was 15. So, we lost 10 wells. And if you assume those things come on at 1,100 barrels a day, 1,200 barrels a day, you can see that\u2019s a fairly significant impact. I think we are in recovery mode. We expect to recover in the quarter from that. It just takes time to build and dig out of that literally. But importantly, Paul, I think the Bakken now is on this steady build, this steady cadence, a steady build to get to that 200,000 barrel a day average in 2025, so there will be this regular cadence. We will probably touch 200 towards the end of 2024. But I think importantly, we will average 200,000 barrels a day in 2025. So, we are on a solid trajectory from here to 2025 and not concerned at all about it. Wells are performing as expected. You are coming in with these IP 180s of 120, EURs of 1.2. That\u2019s in spite of going into a little bit less quality acreage. So, the reservoir is performing exactly as expected. These are just weather aberrations as you kind of go through the year. That\u2019s all it is. Paul Cheng : I see. Great. Do you have an estimate what is the exit rate for this year in Bakken? Greg Hill : No, not yet and we will guide that as we go through the year, Paul. And as I am always kind of hesitant because fourth quarter is always a little odd on weather, so we wait until we are closer and kind of look forward at weather forecast before we like to project that far out. Paul Cheng : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Neil Mehta : Hey. Thanks guys. And I just want to follow-up on Jeanine\u2019s question around capital returns. In the fourth quarter, you bought $310 million worth of stock, and I think you did $650 million last year. The share prices have done really well, so congrats on that. Has the appreciation of the share price changed your \u2013 how aggressive you want to be around buying back stock? And as we think about this year, recognizing to prioritizing the dividend, should we think that there will be a ratable buyback as well? John Hess : Thanks Neil. Just going back to what John has said a little early, you reiterated our priorities, invest in those high-return opportunities Guyana and Bakken, maintain that strong balance sheet. So, the first thing, as John had mentioned, we will be looking at the dividend because that will give strong consideration first to that dividend increase. And then in line, we are going to return cash up to the 75% through further share repurchases then. So, as we look at \u2013 as you said, with the stock appreciation, we are committed to that return framework, and we will return up to that 75% through both the dividends and share repurchases. And the way we look at it right now is we currently only have two FPSOs on producing in Guyana. We have Payara starting in this year. And remember, every time an FPSO comes on and once it\u2019s fully ramped, Payara is going to be about 55,000 barrels a day, 60,000 barrels a day to us and $1 billion in cash flow. So, then you have Yellowtail similarly in 2025, a little bit bigger. So, 65,000 barrels a day approximately. When that\u2019s fully up and running, a little bit more cash flow than that $1 billion. Now, we have got Uaru in \u201826, and we got up to 10 FPSOs to develop all the resources we have found. So, we believe in buying our shares in advance of that significant cash flow growth and NAV accretion that each of these FPSO generates. So, we believe that will deliver significant value to shareholders by continuing the share repurchases. Neil Mehta : Yes. Thank you, John. And the follow-up is just around post-2023 CapEx, recognizing again that there is a cost recovery element here. And we just try to calibrate our models post-2023. Any moving pieces that you would point us to, to help us think about where we should test those numbers? John Hess : So, obviously, this is really early, Neil, so thanks for that question. But as you move into next year, just think Bakken steady four-rig program shouldn\u2019t be much changes there. Gulf of Mexico, we will see what happens. Greg had talked about the wells we are drilling this year and we will see what \u2013 any follow-ons as it relates to that. So, it\u2019s a little early. Southeast Asia may be slowly coming down. You saw it came down a bit in \u201823 from last year. And then Guyana, obviously, the big spend. So, we will continue to have three FPSOs kind of coming in line. So, Payara will be on, but we will still have three FPSOs that are in the development phase. So, with those, I mean you see with current market, so the current market is a bit up, so you can kind of take up those three FPSOs a bit as compared to what we have this year. And then the one other piece to add is the FPSO purchases, which we expect to have our first FPSO purchase in early 2024. Neil Mehta : Great. Thank you. Thanks John. Very helpful. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Ryan Todd : Thanks. Maybe just a couple of quick ones. First off, I appreciate you talked about some of the cost inflation that you have seen and been able to mitigate there in the Bakken. I don\u2019t know you have talked about it indirectly with the Uaru number. But what are you seeing in terms of cost inflation on the offshore rig rates are certainly up? I mean as we look at things in Canada and Gulf of Mexico and across your portfolio, what type of inflation are you seeing year-on-year, and where is it worse in the offshore? Greg Hill : Well, I think as you mentioned, I mean certainly, rigs are going up kind of the mid to high-3s, approaching 400, I think for offshore rigs, not unreasonable. Now remember, we are largely insulated from that because the \u2013 certainly, the first three developments in Guyana are actually already locked in four actually with Yellowtail. So, those costs were locked in. Some of the rig rates flowed a little bit. And obviously, oil country tubular goods were up, but I will say that ExxonMobil has done an outstanding job of delivering improvements to offset both rig cost increases and oil country tubular good increases. So, we are fairly insulated because of the projects we have going on. And as we mentioned, the cost in Uaru will reflect that market inflation, and we will get into details all that once it\u2019s finally sanctioned. But those are sort of the levels we are seeing. But again, we are largely insulated from that in our portfolio because of the nature of Guyana. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks. And then maybe just a philosophical question on the hedging, I appreciate the detail on this year\u2019s hedging. As we think longer term, as production capacity continues to increase in Guyana and that stable cash flow kind of grows, do you expect to reduce your hedging amount over time, or do you view that as just kind of a strategic importance from an insurance point of view? John Hess : We definitely view it as strategic importance from an insurance point of view. And I think you can clearly expect our WTI hedge levels to remain at similar levels that we have done before, again, the tax and royalty aspect of it. Percentage-wise from on the Brent side as production keeps growing each time we bring on FPSOs, you could see maybe percentage-wise that we could have a lower hedge percentage overall. But again, I think you should expect us to have a good significant insurance protection each year just to protect that downside and again, leave the upside for investors. Ryan Todd : Thanks John. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Noel Parks with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open. Noel Parks : Hi. Good morning. John Hess : Good morning. Noel Parks : I just wanted to touch base on something that was mentioned earlier on. You were just talking about experiencing exceptional facilities reliability in Guyana. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about maybe how that contributed to results? I was just curious if you had modeled some maintenance or slowdown in there that you want it not having to do? Greg Hill : No. What my earlier comment was if you look at Q4 in Guyana, there was little maintenance at all in Guyana. And then as we look forward for a whole year, you have to build some of that in. You will have some pigging runs and some facility maintenance. So, we had to build that into the downtime as we kind of look forward for a full year of Guyana production, but Q4 was exceptional, very high reliability. Noel Parks : Okay. Great. And I apologize if you touched on this. I dropped off for a minute. But the offshore Canada prospect that you mentioned, I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about the geology of that and how it was identified? Greg Hill : Yes, sure. So, we identified this prospect with a number of partners really about the same time that we identified the Guyana opportunity. And this is a very large stratigraphic trap. There is only a one-well commitment. As we mentioned in our opening remarks, the rig will show up in the second quarter. The prospect is very shallow. It\u2019s about 15,000 feet or so, and it\u2019s only in 4,000 feet of water, total depth 15,000. So, this is going to be a kind of a one-well wonder, and we will see where it goes. But it\u2019s very large. Noel Parks : Okay. Great. Good to hear. Thanks. Greg Hill : Thanks. John Hess : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. On the line with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter conference call. Today, I will discuss our continued progress in executing our strategy. Greg Hill will then cover our operations, and John Rielly will review our financial results. We believe that Hess offers a unique value proposition for investors. Our strategy is to deliver high-return resource growth, a low cost of supply, and industry-leading cash flow growth, and at the same time, maintain our industry leadership in environmental, social, and governance performance and disclosure. In terms of resource growth with multiple phases of Guyana developments coming online, and our robust inventory of high-return drilling locations in the Bakken, we can deliver highly profitable production growth of more than 10% annually through 2027. On the Stabroek Block in Guyana, we currently have line of sight to six floating production, storage and all floating vessels, or FPSOs, in 2027 with a gross production capacity of more than 1.2 million barrels of oil per day. In terms of the low cost of supply, as our resource base continues to expand, we will steadily move down the cost curve. By 2027, we forecast that our cash unit costs will decline by 25% to approximately $10 per BOE and that our portfolio will achieve a breakeven Brent oil price of approximately $50 per barrel. Our four sanctioned oil developments on the Stabroek Block have a breakeven Brent oil price of between approximately $25 and $35 per barrel. In terms of cash flow growth, we have an industry-leading rate of change story and an industry-leading duration story, providing a highly differentiated value proposition. Based upon a flat Brent oil price of $70 per barrel -- $75 per barrel, our cash flow is forecast to increase by approximately 25% annually between 2022 and 2027, more than twice as fast as our topline growth. And our balance sheet will also continue to strengthen with our most recent debt-to-EBITDAX ratio at approximately one-time. Successful execution of our strategy has uniquely positioned our company to deliver significant value to shareholders for years to come, both by growing intrinsic value and by growing cash returns. Our financial priorities are to allocate capital to our high-return low-cost investment opportunities, to maintain a strong balance sheet and cash position to ensure that we can fund our world-class investment opportunities in Guyana and the Bakken, where we have allocated more than 80% of our 2023 capital budget and also return up to 75% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders through dividend increases and share repurchases. In line with our return of capital framework, in March, we increased our annual dividend by 17% to $1.75 per share. Looking ahead, we plan to continue increasing our regular dividend to a level that is attractive to income oriented investors, but sustainable in a low oil price environment. As our free cash flow generation steadily increases in future years, share repurchases are expected to represent a growing proportion of our return of capital. To manage oil price volatility, we have hedged 130,000 barrels of oil per day in 2023, of which 80,000 barrels of oil per day have $70 per barrel WTI put options and 50,000 barrels of oil per day has $75 per barrel Brent put options, which positions our shareholders to be protected on the downside, while fully benefiting on the upside. Key to our strategy is Guyana, the industry's largest oil province discovered in the last decade, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator. Since 2015, we have had more than 30 discoveries on the block, including two since the start of 2023 at Fangtooth Southeast-1 and Lancetfish-1, underpinning a gross discovered recoverable resource estimate of more than 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent with multibillion barrels of exploration potential remaining. We have the potential for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. The Liza Phase 1 and Liza Phase 2 developments produced an average of approximately 375,000 gross barrels of oil per day in the first quarter. The FPSO for our third sanctioned development at Payara arrived on the Stabroek Block earlier this month ahead of schedule and is targeted to start up early in the fourth quarter with a gross production capacity of approximately 220,000 of oil per day. The fourth sanction development, Yellowtail is expected to come online in 2025 with a gross production capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day. Government and regulatory approvals are expected very soon, hopefully this week for our fifth development at Uaru, which will have a gross production capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day, a plan of development for our sixth development Whiptail, is expected to be submitted to government and -- for regulatory and government approvals later this year. Turning to the Bakken. We plan to continue operating a four-rig program, which will enable us to grow net production to approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025, lower our unit cash, fully optimize our infrastructure and generate significant levels of free cash flow. Greg and his team continue to do an outstanding job of applying lean manufacturing principles to build a culture of innovation, improve efficiency and mitigate inflationary cost pressures. As we execute our company strategy, we will continue to be guided by our long-standing commitment to sustainability and are proud to be an industry leader in this area. Earlier this month, we announced a $50 million donation over the next five years to the Salk Institute harnessing plants initiative, which is a potential game changer in tackling the global challenge of climate change by developing plants, crops and wetlands natural ability to capture and store potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere. We are proud to once again have received a AAA rating in the latest MSCI Environmental, Social and Governance rating assessment. AAA, which is MSCI's ESG's highest rating, designates our company as a leader in managing industry-specific ESG risks relative to peers. We received our first AAA rating in 2021 after earning AA ratings for 10 consecutive years. In February, Hess also earned a place on the 2023 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the fourth consecutive year. In summary, we continue to successfully execute our strategy, which offers a unique value proposition for our industry by growing both our intrinsic value and our cash returns, with multiple phases of low-cost oil developments coming online in Guyana and our robust inventory of high-return drilling locations in the Bakken. Our portfolio is positioned to become increasingly free cash flow positive and as it does, we will continue to prioritize the return of capital to our shareholders through further dividend increases and further share repurchases. I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. We demonstrated strong operational performance across our portfolio in the first quarter. Company-wide net production averaged 374,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, above our guidance of approximately 345,000 to 355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the second quarter, we forecast the company-wide net production will average between 355,000 and 365,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance activities at Liza Phase 2 in Guyana, several of our Gulf of Mexico fields and at North Malay Basin in Southeast Asia. For the full year 2023, we now expect company-wide net production to average between 365,000 and 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase from our previous guidance of 355,000 to 365,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to strong performance in the first quarter of 2023. In the Bakken, first quarter net production of 163,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was above our guidance of 155,000 to 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting high uptime and strong recovery from challenging weather conditions this winter. In the first quarter, we drilled 25 wells and brought 24 new wells online. In the second quarter, we expect to drill and bring online approximately 27 new wells. For the full year 2023, we expect to drill and bring online approximately 110 new wells. Individual well results in terms of EURs and IP 180s continue to meet or exceed expectations. For both the second quarter and full year 2023, we expect Bakken net production to average between 165,000 and 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moving to the offshore. In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, first quarter net production averaged 33,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, above our guidance of approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily reflecting better uptime. In the second quarter, we expect net production to average approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance at several of our Gulf of Mexico fields. For the full year 2023, we continue to forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Deepwater Gulf of Mexico remains an important cash engine for the company as well as a platform for growth. In May, we plan to spud the Pickerel 1 well located in Mississippi Canyon Block 727. Pickerel is an infrastructure-led exploration prospect, which will be tied back to Tubular Bells. Following Pickerel, we plan to drill another tieback well at Stampede and a hub class exploration well in the Green Canyon area. In Southeast Asia, first quarter net production averaged 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Second quarter net production is forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance at North Malay Basin. Full year net production for Southeast Asia in 2023 is now forecast to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with our previous guidance of 60,000 to 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block, the operator ExxonMobil continues to deliver outstanding facilities reliability and project execution success. First quarter net production averaged 112,000 barrels of oil per day above our guidance of approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day, primarily driven by strong facility uptime and well performance. For the second quarter, net production from Guyana is expected to average between 105,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil per day, reflecting reduced capacity at Liza Phase 2 for planned maintenance. We now expect full year 2023 net production, the average between 105,000 and 110,000 barrels of oil per day compared to our previous guidance of approximately 100, 000 barrels of oil per day. Turning to Guyana developments. The Prosperity FPSO, with a production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, arrived at the Stabroek Block on April 11. The vessel is undergoing hookup and commissioning and is targeted to achieve first oil from Payara, our third development early in the fourth quarter. Yellowtail, our fourth development is approximately 45% complete and remains on track for first oil in 2025. The 250,000 barrel of oil per day One Guyana FPSO hull entered dry dock in Singapore on April 2. Topside fabrication and installation activities have commenced and development drilling is underway. Government and regulatory approvals are expected very soon for our fifth development at Uaru, with a gross production capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day. Finally, for our sixth development, Whiptail, the partnership is on track for final submission of the field development plan to the government of Guyana later this year. Now, turning to exploration. The Lancetfish-1 Well, located 4 miles southeast of the Fangtooth 1 discovery, encountered 92 feet of oil-bearing sandstone reservoir. This discovery further underpins the potential oil development in the Greater Fangtooth area. Drill stem tests and core analysis are underway at Fangtooth 1 and further appraisal activities for Lancetfish and Fangtooth Southeast are planned for later in the year. In the second half of the year, we plan to drill the Bacher 1 well, which is a deep prospect located approximately 7 miles west of Fangtooth 1 and another deep exploration prospect called Lancetfish, located 2 miles southwest of Fangtooth 1. Moving to offshore Canada, we expect to spud the BP-operated Episys 1 well in the Northern Orphan Basin in May. The well will target a very large submarine fan of tertiary age. BP has a 50% working interest in Hess and Chevron, each have 25% interest. In closing, our execution continues to be strong. The Bakken is on a steady growth trajectory. Our Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia assets have active drilling programs and we continue to advance our major projects and further delineate the enormous upside in Guyana, all of which position us to deliver industry-leading performance and significant shareholder value for years to come. I will now turn the call over to John Reilly. John Rielly : Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2022. We had net income of $346 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared with $497 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, or $522 million on an adjusted basis, which excluded items affecting comparability of earnings. Turning to E&P. E&P net income was $405 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared with an adjusted net income of $565 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. The changes in the after-tax components of E&P earnings between the first quarter of 2023 and fourth quarter 2022 were as follows. Lower sales volumes decreased earnings by $138 million lower realized selling prices decreased earnings by $45 million. Lower cash costs and midstream tariffs increased earnings by $16 million. Lower exploration expenses increased earnings by $7 million for an overall decrease in first quarter earnings of $160 million. For the first quarter, our E&P oil sales volumes were under lifted compared with production by approximately 325,000 barrels, which decreased our after-tax income by approximately $15 million. Now, turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $61 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared with $64 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Midstream EBITDA, before non-controlling interest amounted to $238 million in the first quarter compared to $244 million in the previous quarter. Turning to our financial position. At March 31, excluding the Midstream segment, cash and cash equivalents were $2.1 billion, total liquidity was $5.4 billion, including available committed credit facilities, and debt and finance lease obligations totaled $5.6 billion. In March, we received net proceeds of $50 million from the sale of approximately 1.8 million Hess-owned Class B units to Hess Midstream. In the first quarter of 2023, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $1 billion compared with $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to lower sales volumes and realized selling prices. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the first quarter decreased cash flow from operating activities by $394 million, which includes premiums paid for hedging contracts. E&P capital and exploratory expenditures were $765 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $818 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P. Our E&P cash costs were $12.96 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2023, which was lower than our guidance of $14 to $14.50 per barrel of oil equivalent due to higher production and the deferral of workover spend to the second quarter. We project E&P cash costs to be in the range of $15.50 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter, reflecting planned maintenance activities at the Liza Unity, North Malay Basin and several facilities in the Gulf of Mexico and higher workover spend in the Gulf of Mexico. Full year cash cost guidance in the range of $13.50 to $14.50 per barrel of oil equivalent remains unchanged. DD&A expense was $13.16 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter of 2023. DD&A expense is forecast to be in the range of $13 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter and full year DD&A expense in the range of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent remains unchanged. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs to be in the range of $28.50 to $29.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter and $26.50 to $28.5 0 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year 2023. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the second quarter and full year guidance of $160 million to $170 million remains unchanged. The midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $305 million to $315 million for the second quarter and full year guidance of $1.230 billion to $1.250 billion remains unchanged. E&P income tax expense is expected to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million for the second quarter and $670 million to $680 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $590 million to $600 million due to higher commodity prices. During the first quarter, we purchased WTI put options for 80,000 barrels of oil per day for 2023 with an average monthly floor price of $70 per barrel and Brent put options for 50,000 barrels of oil per day for 2023 with an average monthly floor price of $75 per barrel. We expect non-cash option premium amortization, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices will be approximately $50 million for the second quarter and approximately $190 million for the full year 2023. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $975 million in the second quarter and full year guidance of approximately $3.7 billion remains unchanged. For midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million for the second quarter and full year guidance of $255 million to $265 million remains unchanged. For corporate, corporate expenses are estimated to be approximately $30 million for the second quarter and full year guidance of $120 million to $130 million remains unchanged. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million for the second quarter and full year guidance of $305 million to $315 million remains unchanged. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks. Sorry, I was on mute there. Greg Hill : No worries. Ryan Todd : First off, I guess, congratulations on very strong production in Guyana this quarter. Can you talk about what you've seen on productive capacity on these first two developments, both on the reservoir side, what you're seeing subsurface there, as well as post debottleneck surface facility side. What should we expect these two facilities to sustainably produce going forward? Greg Hill : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So, first of all, the wells have been performing extremely well above expectations. So subsurface going great, continue to see further upside in the subsurface as we kind of produce the wells. And then, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, Exxon Mobil and SBM are just doing an outstanding job of topsides reliability and also the debottlenecking side. Recall that Phase 1 was debottlenecked to the 140,000 barrels, it's actually producing between 140,000 and 150,000 barrels, sort of in that range. And then if you look at Phase 2, it has a nameplate of 220,000 barrels. It's on track to be debottlenecked towards 250,000 barrels by the end of the year. So, again, more upside coming on Phase 2. And it's been operating kind of 230,000 barrels or so on a regular basis, but we'll pick up that up towards 250,000 barrels by the year -- by the end of the year. So upside, upside. Ryan Todd : Awesome. Thanks, Greg. And then, maybe, just one on cost inflation and what you're seeing. It's obviously very topical across the space right now. I mean, can you talk about what you're seeing in the Bakken onshore and offshore as well in terms of kind of leading-edge trends across various silos of what you're seeing on service costs? Greg Hill : Sure. Yes. So in some areas such as oil country tubular goods, we're expecting some moderation in inflation coming. Onshore rigs pretty much staying flat, but we're still seeing some pressure in certain areas, particularly labor. Now, specifically in the Bakken, we anticipated year-over-year inflation of between 10% to 15%. That's about where it's running. However, remember, we're mitigating about half of these impacts through the application of strategic contracting, lean manufacturing and technology. So, our Bakken well guidance of $6.9 per well for the year, remains unchanged. So if we look at the offshore, we're expecting year-over-year industry inflation there between 15% and 20%. Now remember, in Guyana, the first four FPSOs are contracted, so they'll have limited the exposure going forward. And then in addition, ExxonMobil is just doing a fantastic job of mitigating kind of inflation effects through their outstanding execution and performance using that design one, build many strategy, which is sort of like lean manufacturing in the offshore. And then finally, in our Gulf of Mexico operations, we contracted our services in 2022, so we missed some of the recent uptick. So because of that, our overall capital guidance of $3.7 billion remains unchanged this year. Ryan Todd : Great. Thanks, Greg. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open. Doug Leggate : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for getting me on. John Hess : Good morning. Doug Leggate : Gents, I wonder if I could kick off with one on the somewhat rare event nowadays of a dry hole in Guyana. I know that's a little bit flippant, but I'm curious as to where you think you are on the cleaning curve at this point. This was obviously a step out carbonate. You haven't really talked about it. How many more of those do you think you're going to be pursuing, I guess. And if I could just do a quick add-on to that, when you talk about the 11 billion barrels, what are we actually talking about is actually included in that versus the -- I guess, north of 30 discoveries you have so far. Greg Hill : Yes. Thanks, Doug. So let me co-quarry [ph] first. Recall that was a higher-risk carbonate play that was located 37 miles from Liza 1 and it didn't encounter commercial hydrocarbons, but it did provide a lot of valuable data that further improves our understanding of the subsurface. Going forward, Doug, we still continue to see multibillion barrels of upside that hasn't changed. And finally, in reference to your question, the 11 billion barrels, the majority of that is in the upper campaign. And obviously, with our exploration program this year, we're really starting to understand the deep and what potential that holds. But across the block, this multibillion barrels of additional upside remains unchanged. Yes, we'll have a few dry holes as we test different things along the way, but there's still a lot more to play with. Doug Leggate : So, are we talking like two-thirds of the wells are the 11 billion barrels or the discoveries rather? If not 31 is my point. What's the -- what's not included? Greg Hill : What's not included in the 11 billion? So, the recent discoveries that we've had are obviously not included in that. Again, Doug, it's mainly Upper Campanian, right? So, as we get results, the lower Campanian, obviously, that will be incorporated. But the multibillion barrels of additional upside encompasses the upper and the lower. It's not just the lower. It's -- there's still a lot of upper Campanian to play for as well. Doug Leggate : Thank you for that. I'll take the rest offline. My follow-up is just a housekeeping question, maybe for John Rielly. John, you walked through the working capital moves. I guess my question is, when I look at the accretion mass on Guyana, the NPV accretion with the potential buybacks, it seems kind of obvious that the value that you're in your share price today, a lot of it is obviously not being reflected. So, I'm curious on what the strategy is for the buyback program, meaning, is it a -- after working capital cash flow number that you're looking at, or is that's obviously going to move around quarter-to-quarter? Just how are you thinking about it because we were anticipating you might have a little quicker buyback pace this quarter. John Rielly : Sure Doug. So, let me just back up and talk about our financial priorities that we have. So, the first priority is obviously to invest in these high-return opportunities, obviously driven by Guyana and the Bakken because that's going to drive our free cash flow growth. And as John said earlier in his comments that we can grow intrinsic value and cash returns and it's Guyana Bakken that will allow us to do that. Our second priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet. Again, we're in a good position with that. We want to also have a strong cash position, and we do have $2.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So, we're in a good place with that to fund our high-return projects. So, for us, we have this capital return framework, and we're going to follow that, that we put out. And so what we do is return up to 75% of our free cash flow on an annual basis, so that is after working capital, that is after capital expenditures, and even after debt maturities, which we don't have any this year, we do have $300 million in 2024. And so first thing that we'll do in that return of capital framework is focused on the dividend. As John mentioned in his opening remarks, we want to increase that dividend each year. And we did do that in March, so we had that 17% increase $0.25 per share increase and so that is going to be the first thing. So, we did increase our returns shareholders here in the first quarter with that dividend increase. Then the remainder of that free cash flow, that 75% will be done in share repurchases. And you're right, we agree with you about the NAV accretion that we'll be having with these FPSOs. And just to remind everybody, with each FPSO comes on, like obviously, we have Payara here coming early this year that generates net to us $1 billion of cash flow. So, again, the Payara and the Yellowtail wireless. So we're getting that $1 billion kind of a year adding to our portfolio. And so as we go forward, more and more of our capital returns will be share repurchases. And so buying our shares basically in advance of those as we get -- as Payara comes on, generates that $1 billion and gets in front of Yellowtail and Uaru, obviously, will be, I think, be able to deliver significant value to shareholders just following this framework that we have. Doug Leggate : Okay. That\u2019s very clear. Thanks. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Neil Mehta : Yeah. Good morning team and congrats on a super quarter. John, first question is for you about building downside resiliency in the business model. Obviously, there's a lot of reasons to be constructive long-term \u2013 near-term is more uncertain from an economic perspective. And so just curious on how having gone through the last 10 years with a lot of volatility, have you built in defenses within the Hess business model? I think you talked about one, which is the hedging strategy and then also improving the balance sheet. But just any thoughts around that as we think about creating defensive attributes? John Hess : No. Look, we obviously focus -- and thank you for the question. We focused our portfolio on high return, low cost of supply opportunities. Obviously, we think we have built a highly differentiated value proposition and part of that is the low-cost model. The fact that over the next five years, we can get our breakeven to $50 Brent. Also, the cash cost going down 25% as well. I think that makes our portfolio very resilient in a low price environment. John Reilly talked about capital discipline and also the priority on keeping a strong balance sheet and cash position, our cash position at the end of the quarter was over $2 billion. And we will continue to hedge by buying puts to protect the downside and still give our shareholders the upside. So I think relative to a lot of our competitors that are having cost pressures going up, our costs are going down, and we're going to keep a strong balance sheet to stay resilient through the cycle. Neil Mehta : Yeah. That's very clear. And then a follow-up just on the Bakken. Can you talk about the trajectory that you anticipate over the course of the year? And then what do you think we get to plateau and at what level? Greg Hill : Yeah. So we exited Q1 in line with our forecast, a little bit ahead of guidance, but it was in line with our forecast, and we expect to see a build through the end of the year as we continue to steadily bring wells online. Now we'll provide guidance for the Bakken as usual, in our second quarter conference call for the rest of the year. But I think, Neil, just expect sort of a steady increase with a four-rig program across 2023 and 2024. We'll get to 200,000 barrels a day in 2025. And then be able to hold that flat for almost a decade with the inventory that we have. So steady increase to 200,000, hold it flat for a decade. I want to remind people that when Bakken reaches that 200,000 plateau, it will generate about $1 billion of free cash flow. So steady cash flow generator for the company. Neil Mehta : Thanks guys. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Paul Cheng : Hey guys, good morning. John Hess : Hi. Good morning. Paul Cheng : Two questions. Just curious that, I mean, John, how important is the Hess Midstream for the longer term of the company? I mean, do we need to have the ownership over there, especially then, I mean once you get Bakken, say at 200,000 barrels per day, do we still need to have the operatorship or even the ownership? That's the first question. John Rielly : Sure, Paul. I mean we remain committed to maximizing the long-term value of Hess Midstream. It's been a key strategic partner for us. It adds differentiated value to our E&P assets up there in the Bakken with us maintaining that operational and marketing control so we get provides takeaway optionality to high-value markets. Also, it's key to our gas capture and driving down flaring in our GHG emission intensity. So I would say think about Hess Midstream more of the same, they've been doing -- they've been executing brilliantly really for us on the ESG and also just getting the E&P production to markets. And then when you think about Hess Midstream, it has a very strong credit position and continues to generate free cash flow growth. So the Hess Midstream, they did outline that they have about $1 billion of financial flexibility through 2025 for capital allocation, which includes then the potential for incremental returns of capital, like the recent $100 million transaction that they just did. And so that $100 million is a small part of that $1 billion financial flexibility. So Hess Midstream has the potential to execute multiple buybacks basically each year through 2025. So I think you can think about it just more of the same that way, Paul, and we are happy with the investment. Paul Cheng : Okay. Second question, I think this is for Greg. Greg, I think that I've been saying that the Yellowtail is going to be 2025 versus oil. Any kind of maybe a new bit narrower window? Is it going to be in the first half, second half or any kind of color you can provide? And also, how many exploration wells, not appraisal well, but exploration wells, the consultant plan to drill between now and the expiration of the exploration basis? Greg Hill : So let me answer the exploration part first. So Paul, remember, we've got multibillion barrels of upside. The license expires in October of 2026. We will take the next four to five years to fully understand that potential get it locked down. So I think you should think about three wells -- three exploration rigs a year pretty much going through 2026. And we can drill usually about 10 or so exploration and appraisal wells a year. So think of that sort of a level exploration prospectivity going forward, again, going after that multibillion barrels of upside that we continue to see. Your question on Yellowtail. Look, Yellowtail... Paul Cheng : Sorry. For the 10 well per year, do you have a split roughly that the -- between exploration and appraisal? Greg Hill : No, we don't. Obviously, that's going to depend upon success, right? So when we have an exploration success, we tend to then want to appraise that success. Just like we're doing at Fangtooth, remember, Fangtooth 1 was 160 feet. Fangtooth Southeast was 200 feet. Now we have Lancetfish with 92 feet of pay, probably going to be a development. So we're going to want to appraise around that greater Fangtooth area. So it's really going to depend upon success as we go forward as to what the split is. Yes. Now regarding Yellowtail, look, it's too early. I mean Yellowtail is running ahead of schedule right now. Looking good, but these are major projects. So I think just right now, in 2025 is the right way to think about it. And obviously, as we get further down, we'll narrow the window on those dates. Paul Cheng : Right. Thank you. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Noel Parks with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open. Noel Parks : Hi. Good morning. John Hess : Good morning. Noel Parks : I wondered if I could get you to talk a little bit about your thinking on hedging policy. You laid in the put options. So that's certainly interesting. And you have, of course, big production ramp-ups ahead with new development coming online from Guyana. So I guess just as you look ahead and over the years, we certainly have had periods of backwardation in the curve. I just wonder if you -- maybe just as you're looking ahead, say, to 2024, what's on your radar screen? How -- what's your balance of thinking about downside protection versus realizing upside and so on? John Rielly : Sure. So our philosophy on the hedging is we believe it is strategic importance, just like you said, from the downside protection. We view it as an insurance, and so what we do ensure we buy the insurance, and we use puts. Our strategy is to use puts to protect full downside, but leave the upside for investors. So again, that's what we did this year. And you see we have 130,000 barrels a day this year, very comfortable with that level. We had 150,000 barrels a day last year. So I think you can think about that, let's just say, approximately 150,000 barrel a day level as we go forward. And for your question like for 2024, you can assume we'll put on insurance or hedges at that type of level as we move into 2024. And with the put options, the way we do that is we'll look more to do that in the latter part of this year, right, because of the cost, the time value of the money on the put option. So you typically would see us putting it on either towards the end of 2023 or early in 2024, like we did this year. And again, so we're trying to get -- obviously, within our putting the insurance on trying to be as opportunistic as possible, but we will eventually get that hedge on because we want that downside protection, really just as John Hess mentioned earlier. Noel Parks : Great. Thanks. And I want to turn to on the regulatory side. You mentioned that a lot of you expecting government approvals this year. I'm just wondering, as you have keep teeing up each next development, is the approval process? Is it becoming pretty cut and dry at this point from -- or even easier from one development to the next, or I was wondering, have you seen any shifts over time in terms of what the Guyana officials are scrutinizing sort of what their basis for approval is for each project? John Hess : No. The Guyana government is very rigorous and overseeing the government and regulatory approvals. I think there's a very good working relationship with ExxonMobil as operator and the government itself. I think the approval process is appropriate for both sides. And the fact of the matter is, hopefully, this week, we'll be getting approval on Uaru, and I think that speaks volumes about the approval process. So it's going appropriately in timing and also in depth of analysis by the government. The government obviously has their own priorities and the ExxonMobil as operator addresses those. So I'd say the approval process continues to be one that's diligent and thoughtful for both sides. Noel Parks : Perfect. Thanks a lot. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Arun Jayaram : Hey, good morning. John Hess : Good morning, Arun. Arun Jayaram : Greg, maybe for you. Good morning, John. Greg, I was wondering if you could give us kind of the path to first oil at Payara. I know the vessel landed in Guyana on April 11. And just give us a sense of the activities you kind of required to hit that early 4Q start-up and maybe a sense of what you've risked in terms of the guidance for Payara barrels in your updated guidance for volumes? Greg Hill : Sorry, I turn. Yeah. Thanks, Arun. So first oil from Payara, remember now has been brought forward. So we were saying into the fourth quarter to early fourth quarter now. So we've already pulled it forward few months. In terms of what has to be done, remember, Payara is more extensive than Phase 2. So it's got 30% more wells. It's got 80% more surf the leads of Phase 2. And so it's expected to take a bit longer to hook up and commission in Phase 2 is. But things are well on track. I think we've adequately risked things as well as the operator, ExxonMobil to confidently say at this point, early first quarter or early fourth quarter of this year, yeah. Arun Jayaram : And what have you all included in terms of the updated guide for Payara? Greg Hill : We haven't included anything yet. So at the midyear, obviously, as we get closer to that first oil date, we'll be updating our guidance. Arun Jayaram : Okay. Great. And maybe just a follow-up also in Guyana. You've announced discoveries at Fangtooth, Fangtooth Southeast and Lancetfish. Greg, have you all done a DST yet at Fangtooth? And do you think there's enough resource between those three discoveries to underwrite a seventh boat, or will you need some success at Bacher, and you mentioned, I think, Lancetfish on today's call. Greg Hill : No. I think about the Fangtooth area as a big hub. And as you mentioned, we do have both drill stand tests and core analysis for Fangtooth-1 and Fangtooth Southeast. Fangtooth 1 is underway. Fangtooth Southeast is planned for later in the year in terms of the DST. And then we also are planning an appraisal well at Lancetfish. So as you intimated when you add Bacher in and the other wells that we're going to drill Lancetfish, obviously, there's potential for a hub there, but we really need that DST data to figure out what the field development plan will be. Arun Jayaram : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open. Paul Cheng : Hey, thanks. This is for John Rielly. Just a quick follow-up. Related to Guyana, it looks like you guys have been booking some deferred tax on there. Can you give us a trajectory that -- how that is going to shape up over the next several quarters or over the next several years? I assume that at some point, it will catch up maybe by 2026, 2027 and whether that will be on the ballpark correct? Thank you. John Rielly : So you're right, we are booking deferred tax in Guyana. Guyana has a 25% statutory rate. So we will be recording a 25% effective rate and it's just similar. Let me just say to like the US, where the tax rules for depreciation, you can amortize the fixed assets quicker for the tax basis, so you get a higher deduction for tax purposes versus book. And so as a result of that, your current cash tax rate is lower than the $25 million, and therefore, we book deferred taxes. I would, Paul, just for guidance purposes, let's just say, for the rest of this year, it can change obviously as we continue to bring on more and more boats, but use a similar deferred tax level that you see in the first quarter for Guyana. Paul Cheng : John, how about for the next several years? John Rielly : I don't want to go in the next several years because every year when we add the capital and it changes the depreciable base, and you're going over five years, so you get higher depreciation. So it's difficult to provide that to you for the next couple of years. So we'll try to guide you year-by-year as the boats come on. Paul Cheng : Can we assume in this way that as you still ramping up more projects and from say, maybe two projects at the same time, go to three projects, and so your CapEx is rising. So as a result, we're going to see the deferred tax continue to be a passive until that you sort of stabilizing your investment? John Rielly : Yes. Yes, you can assume that. Paul Cheng : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jay Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jay Wilson : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone and thank you for participating in our second quarter earnings conference call. Our earnings release was issued this morning and appears on our website, www.hess.com. Today's conference call contains projections and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in such statements. These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factors section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Also, on today's conference call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. On the line with me today are John Hess, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Hill, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rielly, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to John Hess. John Hess : Thank you, Jay. Welcome, everyone, to our second quarter conference call. Today, I will share some thoughts on the energy transition and then discuss our continued progress in executing our strategy. Then Greg Hill will cover our operations and John Rielly will review our financial results. First, in terms of the energy transition, it is important to realize that progress has been made towards the goal of the Paris Agreement. According to the International Energy Agency, or the IEA, the global median temperature increase prior to the Paris Agreement was 3.5 degrees Celsius. Today, according to the IEA's stated policy scenario, the world is on a trajectory to a median temperature increase of 2.5 degrees. However, much more progress is required and we currently are not on a path to meeting the Paris Agreement's goal of 1.5 degrees. There are 3 important gaps affecting the pace of progress. First, the world is facing a structural deficit in energy supply and the key challenge is investment. To meet growing energy demand, the world needs to invest $4 trillion each year for the next 10 years in clean energies, significantly more than last year's investment of $1.4 trillion. The world also needs to invest $500 billion each year for the next 10 years in oil and gas, as compared with $300 billion to $400 billion invested annually in the last 5 years. Second, developed countries have a gap between their current pledges and the investments they are making to reach their emission reduction commitments. For example, the United States has pledged a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. And even with the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, our nation will likely fall far short of that pledge. Finally, developing countries are also facing large gaps in their aspirations for emission reductions. I recently had the honor of speaking at the Energy Asia Conference in Kuala Lumpur. Asia represents 50% of the world's population, 50% of global energy use and 50% of global emissions and will, therefore, play a key role in the energy transition. The conference speakers, both government officials and business leaders, made it clear that Asia will need to find the right balance between energy affordability and emission reduction commitments. At COP28 in December of this year, developing countries' voices must be heard to address their rights to economic prosperity and a higher standard of living. The reality is that the energy transition will take a long time, cost a lot of money and require many technologies that do not exist today. We must recognize that oil and gas will be needed for decades to come and are fundamental to an orderly, just and secure energy transition. Policymakers need to have climate literacy, energy literacy and economic literacy to enable a net zero future. In a world that will require reliable, low-cost oil and gas resources for decades ahead, we believe that Hess offers a unique value proposition for investors. We continue to execute our strategy to deliver high-return resource growth, a low cost of supply and industry-leading cash flow growth and, at the same time, maintain our industry leadership in environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. In terms of resource growth with multiple phases of Guyana developments coming online and our robust inventory of high-return drilling locations in the Bakken, we can deliver highly profitable production growth of more than 10% annually through 2027. In terms of low cost of supply, as our resource base continues to expand, particularly in Guyana, where our first 5 developments have breakevens in the range of $25 to $35 per barrel Brent, we will steadily move down the cost curve. By 2027, we forecast that our cash unit costs will decline by 25% to approximately $10 per BOE. In terms of cash flow growth, we have an industry-leading rate of chain story and an industry-leading duration story, providing a highly differentiated value proposition. Based upon a flat Brent oil price of $75 per barrel, our cash flow is forecast to increase by approximately 25% annually between 2022 and 2027, more than twice as fast as our top line growth. And our balance sheet will also continue to strengthen, with our most recent debt-to-EBITDAX ratio at approximately 1x. Successful execution of our strategy has uniquely positioned our company to deliver significant value to shareholders for years to come, both by growing intrinsic value and by growing cash returns. We plan to continue increasing our regular dividend to a level that is attractive to income-oriented investors but sustainable in a low oil price environment. As our free cash flow generation steadily increases in future years, share repurchases are expected to represent a growing proportion of our return of capital. By investing only in high-return low-cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated and balanced portfolio focused on Guyana, the Bakken, Deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. Key to our strategy is Guyana, the industry's largest oil province discovered in the last decade, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator. Since 2015, we have had more than 30 discoveries on the Stabroek Block, underpinning a gross discovered recoverable resource estimate of more than 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent, with multibillion barrels of exploration potential remaining. In June, we were honored to be named E&P Explorer of the Year in the 15th annual Wood Mackenzie exploration industry survey for the second consecutive year. In terms of Guyana developments, we currently have line of sight to 6 floating production, storage and offloading vessels, or FPSOs, in 2027, with a gross production capacity of more than 1.2 million barrels of oil per day and the potential for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the Stabroek Block. In the Bakken, we have a 15-year inventory of high-return drilling locations to enable us to steadily grow net production to approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025. We plan to continue operating a 4-rig program which will enable us to fully optimize our infrastructure, lower our unit cash costs and generate significant levels of free cash flow. Turning to our operated offshore assets. In the Gulf of Mexico, we had a successful oil discovery during the quarter at the Hess-operated Pickerel-1 well with approximately 90 feet of high-quality net pay which we plan to tie back to our Tubular Bells Production Facility, with first oil expected in mid-2024. In Southeast Asia, we have 2 important long-life natural gas assets, North Malay Basin and the joint development area, or JDA. Our major priorities going forward are to continue to maximize cash flow and production at North Malay Basin and to work with the governments of Malaysia and Thailand to extend our PSC agreement at the JDA. As we execute our company strategy, we will continue to be guided by our long-standing commitment to sustainability and are proud to be an industry leader in this area. Last week, we announced the publication of our 26th Annual Sustainability Report which provides a comprehensive review of our strategy and performance on environmental, social and governance programs, including our net zero commitment and the significant progress we have made toward our 2025 emissions reduction targets. In summary, we continue to successfully execute our strategy to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth and financial returns to our shareholders, while safely and responsibly producing oil and gas to help meet the world's growing energy needs. As a result, our company is uniquely positioned to deliver significant value to shareholders for years to come, both by growing intrinsic value and by growing cash returns. As our portfolio becomes increasingly free cash flow positive, we will continue to prioritize the return of capital to our shareholders through further dividend increases and share repurchases. I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update. Greg Hill : Thanks, John. In the second quarter, we demonstrated strong operational performance across our portfolio. Company-wide net production averaged 387,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, well above our guidance of approximately 355,000 to 365,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the third quarter, we expect company-wide net production to average approximately 385,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance and hurricane contingency in the Gulf of Mexico. For the full year 2023, we now expect company-wide net production to average between 385,000 and 390,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from our previous guidance of 365,000 to 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily reflecting our strong performance in the first half of 2023 and the expected startup of the Payara development in Guyana early in the fourth quarter. Turning to the Bakken. Second quarter net production of 181,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was above our guidance of 165,000 to 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with approximately half of the increase due to strong operational performance and the remainder from higher production entitlements under our percentage of proceeds contracts as a result of lower NGL prices. In the second quarter, we drilled 32 wells and brought 30 new wells online. In the third quarter, we expect to drill approximately 27 new wells and bring online approximately 30 new wells. For the full year 2023, we expect to drill and bring online approximately 110 new wells. Individual well results in terms of IP180s and EURs continue to meet or exceed expectations. For the third quarter, we expect Bakken net production to average approximately 185,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And for the full year 2023, we have increased our forecast of net production to between 175,000 and 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from our previous guidance of 165,000 to 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, second quarter net production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the third quarter, we expect net production to average approximately 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime and hurricane contingency. For the full year 2023, we continue to forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We are excited to announce that the first well of our 2023 Gulf of Mexico drilling program has resulted in an oil discovery. The Hess operated Pickerel-1 infrastructure-led exploration well in Mississippi Canyon, encountered approximately 90-feet of net pay and high-quality oil-bearing Miocene-aged reservoir. Long lead construction activities are underway to tie the well back to the Tubular Bells production facility, with production expected to commence in mid-2024. Following Pickerel, we plan to drill the Black Pearl development well in which Hess is the operator and has a 25% working interest and Chevron, CNOC and Equinor each have 25%. This well is planned as a tieback to the Stampede Production Facility. Following Black Pearl, we plan to drill the Vancouver prospect located in Green Canyon Block 287. Vancouver is a large hub class exploration prospect, targeting subsalt Miocene-age reservoir. Hess is the operator and has 40% working interest and Shell and Chevron each have 30%. In Southeast Asia, second quarter net production averaged 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the third quarter and full year of 2023, we forecast net production to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block, second quarter net production averaged 110,000 barrels of oil per day at the high end of our guidance range of 105,000 to 110,000 barrels of oil per day, driven by strong facility uptime and well performance. For the third quarter, net production from Guyana is expected to also average approximately 110,000 barrels of oil per day. We now expect full year 2023 net production to average approximately 115,000 barrels of oil per day compared to our previous guidance range of 105,000 to 110,000 barrels of oil per day, reflecting the expected early fourth quarter start-up of Payara, with a gross production capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels of oil per day. We forecast Payara to contribute approximately 15,000 net barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter. Turning to our fourth development, Yellowtail. The overall project is approximately 60% complete and remains on track for first oil in 2025, with a gross production capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day. The fifth development, Uaru, was sanctioned in April. Uaru will develop more than 800 million barrels of oil from the Uaru, Mako and Snook fields. The FPSO will have a gross production capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day and is on track to achieve first oil in 2026. With regard to our sixth development, Whiptail, the partnership anticipates submitting a plan of development to the government of Guyana in the fourth quarter, with first oil targeted for 2027. Now turning to exploration. In Guyana, the Stabroek Block exploration license was formally extended by 1 year to October 2027 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The extension also pushes out the contractual acreage relinquishment by 1 year to October 2024. In the Fangtooth area, drill stem tests and core analysis are ongoing. Moving forward, we plan to drill the Bacher-1 well which is a deep prospect located approximately 7 miles west of Fangtooth-1 and the Lancetfish-1 well, located approximately 2 miles southwest of Fangtooth-1. We also plan to drill the Lancetfish-2 appraisal well also in the Fangtooth area. Exploration and appraisal activities are also planned in the southeastern portion of the block to better understand the longer-term potential of this area. Activities will include drilling and exploration prospect called Blue Fin, located approximately 6 miles southwest of Himara-1. In closing, we achieved strong operational performance in the quarter. The Bakken is on a steady growth trajectory. We had exploration success in the Gulf of Mexico with more drilling planned. Our Southeast Asia assets continued to deliver steady production through high reliability and successful ongoing drilling programs. And Guyana keeps getting bigger and better, all of which position us to deliver significant shareholder value for years to come. I will now turn the call over to John Reilly. John Rielly : Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2023. We had net income of $119 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $346 million in the first quarter of 2023. On an adjusted basis which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings, we had net income of $201 million in the second quarter of 2023. Turning to E&P. E&P adjusted net income was $237 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $405 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P earnings between the second quarter and first quarter of 2023 were as follows : higher sales volumes increased earnings by $66 million, lower realized selling prices decreased earnings by $118 million, higher cash costs and Midstream tariffs decreased earnings by $71 million, higher exploration expenses decreased earnings by $34 million. All other items decreased earnings by $11 million, for an overall decrease in second quarter earnings of $168 million. For the second quarter, our E&P oil sale volumes were overlifted compared with production by approximately 100,000 barrels which had an insignificant impact on our after-tax results for the quarter. Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $62 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared with $61 million in the previous quarter. Midstream EBITDA before noncontrolling interest amounted to $247 million in the second quarter compared to $238 million in the previous quarter. Turning to our financial position. At June 30, excluding the Midstream segment, cash and cash equivalents were $2.2 billion. Total liquidity was $5.6 billion, including available committed credit facilities and debt and finance lease obligations totaled $5.6 billion. During the second quarter, we received net proceeds of $217 million from the public offering of approximately 6.4 million Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream and the sale of approximately 1.7 million Hess-owned Class B units to Hess Midstream. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $974 million in the second quarter compared with $1.03 billion in the first quarter. E&P capital and exploratory expenditures were $933 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $765 million in the previous quarter. Now turning to guidance. Our E&P cash costs were $13.97 per barrel of oil equivalent in the second quarter of 2023 which was lower than our guidance of $15.50 to $16 per barrel of oil equivalent, primarily due to higher production. We project E&P cash costs to be in the range of $14 to $14.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and in the range of $13.50 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year which is at the lower end of our previous guidance of $13.50 to $14.50 per barrel of oil equivalent. DD&A expense was $12.79 per barrel of oil equivalent in the second quarter of 2023. DD&A expense is forecast to be in the range of $12.50 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and in the range of $13 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year which is at the lower end of our previous guidance of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent. This results in projected total E&P unit operating cost to be in the range of $26.50 to $27.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for both the third quarter and full year 2023. Exploration expenses, excluding dry haul costs, are expected to be approximately $60 million in the third quarter and approximately $170 million for the full year which is updated from the previous guidance of $160 million to $170 million. The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $320 million to $330 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of $1.230 billion to $1.250 billion remains unchanged. E&P income tax expense is expected to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of $670 million to $680 million remains unchanged. We expect noncash option premium amortization which will be reflected in our realized selling prices, will be $52 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of $190 million remains unchanged. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $1.025 billion in the third quarter and full year guidance of approximately $3.7 billion remains unchanged. Turning to Midstream. We anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million for the third quarter and $240 million to $250 million for the full year which is down from the previous guidance of $255 million to $265 million, reflecting the impact of the Midstream capital market transactions completed in the second quarter. Turning to Corporate. Corporate expenses are estimated to be approximately $25 million for the third quarter and $110 million to $120 million for the full year which is lower than the previous guidance of $120 million to $130 million due to higher interest income. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million for the third quarter and $300 million to $310 million for the full year which is updated from the previous guidance of $305 million to $315 million. This concludes my remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Doug Leggate : Greg, I wonder if I could just ask a couple on Guyana. First of all, with Payara, you gave the guidance of the expected production for the fourth quarter but can you give us some idea of the ramp up? When would you expect to see full facility production at Payara? Greg Hill : Yes. So thanks for that question, Doug. Yes, as we mentioned it's coming on early in the fourth quarter and I would expect the ramp-up to be like Liza Phase 2 kind of on the order of 5 months or so in terms of ramp Payara is a little bit bigger, so it might take marginally a little bit longer but I would say 5 months, yes. Doug Leggate : Okay. Is there a debottlenecking strategy around Payara like you've done in Liza 1 and 2? Greg Hill : Yes, I think there will be because there is a lot of discovered resource in and around Payara. So there will definitely be a debottlenecking strategy as well. Doug Leggate : My follow-up is really on exploration. It seems Exxon -- I guess yourselves and Exxon submitted a 35-well program that's been approved by the government now. So I guess that fits into that timeline you were talking about with the extension. But I'm really trying to understand what this means for the risked resource view. You haven't updated the 11 billion barrels for about 1.5 years and our understanding from our field trip down there was that Fangtooth Southeast was a success. So can you give us some update as to when you would expect to see the resource numbers revised? John Hess : Sure. Doug. It's John and thanks for the question. Look, we have a very active exploration appraisal program this year on the Stabroek Block. A lot of it in terms of appraisal, especially in the Fangtooth area. Greg addressed that in his remarks. And other appraisal on the block, some exploration on the block. And I think the real takeaway, Doug, is that we still see multibillion barrels of oil equivalent. And at the appropriate time, we'll consider increasing the resource estimate of greater than 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Doug Leggate : Just to be clear, John, the 11 billion relates to how many discoveries? John Hess : Doug, that line continues to get upgraded. And I would say, it's the overall program and there's still more to be recognized from some of the outstanding wells we drilled. As you know, a lot of evaluation work is underway in an area like Fangtooth. And until we get that evaluation work done, including the drill stem test, production tests, it's a little premature to jump that number until we're ready to give more clarity on it. Operator : Our next question comes from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Securities. Arun Jayaram : Greg, I was wondering if you could give us maybe an update on how the debottlenecking efforts are going at Liza 1 and Liza 2. Are there any other projects scheduled for the back half of the year? And give us a sense of where you think the new plateau level of production is for both facilities in the post debottlenecking? Greg Hill : Sure. So Arun, as you know, Liza Phase 1 has already been debottlenecked. It's comfortably operating in the 145 to 150 range on a regular basis, so I think that's about what you can expect out of that one. If we look at Liza Phase 2, so that's Unity, it's producing above its nameplate of 220. It's sometimes as high as 240. The operator has a plan to further debottleneck that facility between now and the end of the year. So I think we'll be approaching the 250 number as we get sort of towards the end of the year. And then there's another kind of an engineering project next year to look at the possibility of further debottlenecking Phase 2. I think the operator is quite comfortable with a number around 400,000 barrels a day from both of those facilities and I would add that's 20% above the sanction case. So ExxonMobil is just doing an extraordinary job of debottlenecking, higher reliability. I can't say enough about the outstanding job they're doing as an operator. Arun Jayaram : Great, that's helpful. And maybe one for John Rielly. John, I was wondering if you could maybe offer some soft CapEx guidance for 2024, including kind of an expectation that you do kind of purchase the FPSO and you obviously announced the discovery now at Pickerel. John Rielly : Thanks, Arun. As you know, it's a little early for 2024 capital. We do -- there is a plan to purchase the Unity FPSO in 2024. But look, we're still working on Whiptail, getting the final cost estimates in on that. So I think what we'll do is provide our typical 2024 guidance in January. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : John, I know you reiterated full year budget at $3.7 billion. But the first half year is a bit low and so where the ramp-up is going to be in the second half? John Rielly : Yes. So we have Guyana, obviously, the ramp going there, getting Payara online. And look, we managed just the progression of the developments there. So we'll be working on Yellowtail. There's obviously working on Uaru. So you just got -- the back half of the year, you've got more spend coming in Guyana. Then also, what we have is the Gulf of Mexico rig. So as Greg mentioned, we have -- that rig came in right at the tail end of Q2 and so it drilled Pickerel. We had the success there. And as Greg mentioned, it's going to be doing Black Pearl and then Vancouver. So again, that's tilted towards the second half of the year. And the only other thing I would add on that and this was expected, is that the weather window up in North Dakota, this is the best time for some of the facilities to work up there. So that's why we get a little bit more in the back half in the Bakken as well. Paul Cheng : And I mean -- do you think there's any reasonable probability the full year spending end up going to be below the budget, given the run rate that we see? John Rielly : Paul, I think we are just going to keep reiterating the $3.7 billion. The execution has been terrific so far, as you can see on the production side and we've been very efficient on the capital side. But we do have plans to spend that full $3.7 billion. So I would look just to keep the capital at that level in your model. Paul Cheng : Okay. On Guyana, I think that you probably have a $45 million, $50 million of deferred tax in the quarter. Any kind of rough estimate you can provide for the third and fourth quarter may look like. And also that whether the expansion of exploration period by 1 year, you're saying more in the onetime payment from the consortium to the government at all? John Rielly : Let me start with that 1-year payment. No, there was no payment. That was really, as Greg had mentioned earlier, due to COVID-19 and the force majeure us not being able to explore during that period. So that just is extended to one year. As far as the deferred taxes which are always a bit difficult to actually the forecast, you are right, it was approximately $45 million in Q2. It was about $36 million in Q1. I would say, from our forecast and what we're looking and you've got the Payara start-up which makes it even harder to forecast, that it will be a little bit higher than that $45million number you mentioned in Q3 and Q4 on the deferred taxes. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler. Ryan Todd : Maybe just one follow-up on the extensions there in Guyana. And congrats on getting the extension for both the acreage relinquishment and the exploration license. I know you had always said that this was going to be easily managed and now have a huge impact. But does the extension have any impact on how you may allocate resource there over the next few years or, in general, on your approach or what you're able to do there in the basin? Greg Hill : No. I don't think at all. It won't change the pace. I think you can expect certainly next year, probably a 6-rig program. And it won't affect anything. It will just give us that extra year to lock down whatever we can before the expiry which we have every interest in doing, obviously. John Hess : Yes. To be clear, each year, we plan to drill 10 to 12 exploration appraisal wells. So it just gives us another year to have further evaluation, then it will be in the best interest of the country and also our joint venture itself. So we have, as I said before and Greg did as well, multibillion barrels of exploration potential remaining. And we can orderly have a prosecution of that opportunity. Ryan Todd : Great. And then maybe as a follow-up. I know you were just talking about the capital budget for the year but what are your latest assumptions in terms of -- or what you're seeing in terms of cost inflation or deflation on the contract side? And how does that compare with what you had earlier been assuming in your capital and OpEx guidance? Greg Hill : Yes. So let me address both the onshore and the offshore. So in the Bakken, we observed inflation of between 10% to 15% blended in the first half of 2023. And we were able to mitigate about half of that through the application of strategic contracting, lean manufacturing and technology. Now we're starting to see some costs, such as oil country, tubular goods beginning to moderate. We're still maintaining our well cost guidance at $6.9 per well because we're increasing proppant loading in several areas of the field to further maximize the issue NPV. So we're just going to stick with our 6.9%. But again, we are seeing some deflation start to occur in the Bakken. If we go in the offshore, rig utilization remains very high in the offshore, so costs have not moderated there. However, most of our spend is in Guyana were the first 5 FPSOs are contracted. ExxonMobil was doing a great job of mitigating inflationary effects using its Design One, Build Many strategy. And in addition, recall for our 2023 Gulf of Mexico program, most services were contracted in 2022 when costs were lower. So long and short, our overall 2023 capital guidance of $3.7 billion remains unchanged and we'll provide 2024 guidance in our January call, as John Rielly said. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Neil Mehta : Yes. It was a strong quarter in the Bakken, recognizing that volume can be noisy with commodity prices. But just curious on your thoughts on getting to that 200,000 barrels a day of plateau. And is there visibility to pull that forward if you continue on this execution track? Greg Hill : No. I think, Neil, our plan still shows that we'll get to an average of 200,000 barrels a day in 2025. And as we've said before, with our extensive inventory of drilling locations, we expect to hold that plateau for nearly a decade and the Bakken then becomes a significant free cash flow machine. Neil Mehta : All right. The follow-up is just around -- it's a couple of cash flow items. First is around return of capital. What's the framework for increasing that as you continue to progress through the program in Guyana? And the second, is there any update on hedging strategies as we look into 2024? John Rielly : For the return of capital program, so we're going to continue to be disciplined in the execution of our return of capital framework. I mean as you know in March of this year, we announced an increase in our dividend by 17%. And as we go through the year, we'll continue to follow the framework. And as a reminder, our financial priorities remain. First, we're going to invest in the high-return opportunities, especially in Guyana and the Bakken. And as was mentioned earlier, we do have -- our capital is a bit back-end loaded this year. So we have more capital coming in the second half of the year. Our second is to maintain a strong balance sheet. And with that, we do have that $300 million debt maturity coming next year which we do intend to pay off. But again, a key to maintain a strong balance sheet and cash position -- and we have a nice cash position now, the $2.2 billion and that's in place so we can continue to fund these great return projects in the Guyana and Bakken. And then what we will do and we'll follow this framework, it's an annual framework. We're going to return up to 75% of our free cash flow to shareholders through the dividend increases, as John has mentioned earlier and share repurchases. And as John has mentioned earlier, as our free cash flow generation steadily increases, share repurchases are expected to represent a growing proportion of our return of capital. Neil Mehta : Great. And on hedging? John Rielly : Sorry. Yes, on hedging. For the hedging, you've seen us in the past couple of years. We've been hedging in around 130,000 to 150,000 barrels of oil per day with put options. So we want to make sure we give the upside to investors. And you can think about that we will maintain that type of level. So on a percentage basis of our oil production, because with Guyana coming on and Payara coming on at full ramp, you're getting just that production capacity between 55,000 and 60,000 barrels a day add there. Yellowtail will be even more because it's a bigger boat. So we're going to have higher and higher oil production. So the hedging percentage, as a percentage of our overall oil production, will go down. But we'll maintain around that 130 to 150 level. Operator : Our next question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Roger Read : Yes. Just, I guess, two questions I had. One, in terms of Guyana, just what you can tell us about how the wells have been performing and how maybe that fits into the rated guidance on production or the overall confidence that allows you to raise production guidance? Greg Hill : No. The wells are performing better than expected, really across the board. And of course, the capacity is driven by the physical constraints on the vessel. But obviously, with those wells outperforming, we want to increase that capacity view as high as possible through debottlenecking. But the wells are doing fantastic. Roger Read : That's good to hear. And then my other question, as you look at your Gulf of Mexico exploration program, sort of the relatively lower risk Black Pearl versus the higher risk Vancouver, anything you're doing on the seismic side that's making that, let's say, offsetting the risk to some standpoint? Greg Hill : Yes, absolutely. I think there's 2 things that really have been the discontinuity, I'll call it, in the last 5 years in exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. And the first one is ocean bottom nodes. So we are shooting ocean bottom node surveys in and around all of our hubs. And that is coupled -- that coupled with the new algorithms, so Full Waveform Inversion, FWI, the combination of those 2 things are allowing us to see new opportunities in subsalt in the Gulf of Mexico. And that's not only true for in and around our hubs but it's also true for hub class opportunities as well; so very exciting. We've got over 80 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico. And with that inventory, our aim is to maintain that cash engine in the Gulf of Mexico at a minimum, hold production broadly flat but then also potentially grow that production with a hub class success. And those seismic improvements that I talked about are leading that charge with the great portfolio that we have. Operator : Our next question comes from Kevin MacCurdy with Pickering Energy Partners. Kevin MacCurdy : Just one question on the Bakken production guidance raise. Gas and NGL has obviously outpaced your quarterly guidance but you also had strong oil production above our expectations. Is there any color you can provide on how much of the guidance raise was oil versus gas and NGLs? John Rielly : So specifically here, as we move through the year, our oil production is going to continue to increase. So as you saw the increase in Q2, you can expect a similar increase in Q3 as we saw from Q1 to Q2. And then we continue to expect to see these increases as we go forward. And then outside of the winter months in there, we'll continue to have oil increases as go through into 2025 and we get up to that 200,000 barrels of oil per day. So in general, from an overall guidance standpoint on what we were doing, it's kind of similar. Some of the half of the guidance increase is due to performance and half was due to those pop, those NGL and gas volumes. Operator : Our next question comes from Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna Financial Group. Biju Perincheril : John, I was wondering how you're sort of tidying up the design tolerance on each of the FPSOs. Just trying to understand as you go through the subsequent debottleneck in projects, how we should think about your production uplift? Greg Hill : Yes. So I think the thing I will say is that every vessel will be bespoke. So the way that we do this debottlenecking is we produce the vessel for a year or so and then get all of the dynamic data. And then from that data, make a decision on how much we think that we can squeeze more out of the vessel, or do an engineering project to further debottleneck that. But I think the bias will be to debottleneck these vessels as much as we can because there is so much additional resource around each one of these hubs. And that, coupled with the multibillion barrels of additional upside says that these vessels are going to be full, at plateau longer than what would be typical for a deepwater development. And -- but again, each one will be bespoke. So -- but certainly, the bias is going to be there to debottleneck as much as possible. Biju Perincheril : Got it, that's helpful. A follow-up on the Bakken. You -- so that 200,000 barrels equivalent, at their plateau levels, what should be the oil mix we should expect at that point? Greg Hill : Yes. So longer term, when we're at that 200,000 barrels a day, you can expect about 100,000 barrels a day of oil. So about 50%. Operator : Our next question comes from Noel Parks with Tuohy Brothers. Noel Parks : You made a mention in the Guyana discussion about just putting resources into more exploration of the Southwestern part of the block. I wonder if you could just sort of refresh us on sort of what the original view of that geology was. And now with benefit of the incremental drilling of what you hope to discover or discern there. Greg Hill : Again, the discovery is down in that part of the block. They're all Upper Campanians, so they're Liza-like reservoir, so very high-quality reservoirs. As you move to the southeast of the block, the GOR does increase. So the reason that we want to do some further appraisal and exploration down there is to really understand the higher GOR developments on the block. Still going to be very good projects, I'm sure but we just need a little bit more data to fully understand how we're going to develop those, where we fit in a queue. I think the important thing is, though, our objective is to move oily developments forward. So for example, Fangtooth is a great example that we're trying to move oily developments up in the queue. But at the same time, there's more that we need to understand about the Southeast part of the block. So we will occasionally do some appraisal or exploration drilling down or just to further up our understanding of that part of the block. Noel Parks : Great. And I appreciate your comments just a minute ago about seismic improvement and the opportunity in the Gulf of Mexico. I was just wondering whether there were any projects that Hess is participating in on a non-operated basis in the Gulf? Whether -- I was wondering if there were any of those sort of under the radar that might be worth mentioning? Greg Hill : No. I think there's, again, in the Shell assets, in particular, around some of their hubs, where we have an interest -- a non-operated interest, they're doing the same things. We are OBN and finding new opportunities around those hubs as well. So you'll see some of those feature in the future as well. Noel Parks : Are those sort of near term or more sort of on the horizon? Greg Hill : No, that was in near term. It will be part of the mix as we kind of execute over the next 2 to 3 years. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Paul Cheng : And just a quick follow-up on the Pickerel, to be on stream mid-2024. What is the net to Hess going to look like? And what's the development cost? Greg Hill : Sure, Paul. So that we're still evaluating the well results. But we anticipate peak gross production rates to be in the range of 8,000 to 10,000 barrels a day. John Hess : And we have 100% interest in that well, to be clear. Greg Hill : Yes. And that -- as we said, that will be tied back to the Tubular Bells facility kind of midyear next year. Paul Cheng : Great. John, any what estimate -- what's the development cost on this pipeline? John Rielly : Again, we are still overall coming -- evaluating the results of the well. One, I can tell you, it's a very high-return project, obviously, with it being a tieback to Tubular Bells. And typically, these type of tieback wells are going to have like a $10 per barrel kind of costs or lower. That's what we'll typically see in those -- in these tieback wells. Greg Hill : Find and develop. Paul Cheng : Right. And Greg, what's the resource -- recoverable resource that we estimate for this? And is it all oil or that is the mix between oil and gas? Greg Hill : No, it's a mix of oil and gas, 80% oil, 20% gas. So it's mainly oil. And as John mentioned, we're still evaluating the well, so I don't want to give a resource estimate yet. But again, it's going to be extremely profitable. ILX tieback, very low find and development costs. So nothing to worry about here, Paul at all. Paul Cheng : Okay. And final one from me. Yellowtail and Uaru, you're talking about 2025, 2026, should we assume you're somewhat like similar to the Payara, is going to be in the early fourth quarter? John Hess : I think what we're saying is that each of these will come on in the year quoted. I think it's too early to say exactly when in that year for these later projects. So we're just quoting in the year itself. And as we get closer, obviously, the Yellowtail is 60% complete, so that should tell you something about where it is in the queue. Paul Cheng : Okay. And on the Gulf of Mexico, second quarter production is better. Is it because that some of the maintenance downtime has been able to perform at a shorter period? Or that something is actually being pushed to the third quarter? John Hess : No, it's really reliability -- no, it's really just higher reliability across the board. Operator : Our next question comes from Phillips Johnston with Capital One Securities. Phillips Johnston : Just a quick one for John Rielly. On the first quarter call, you were asked about your investment in Hess Midstream and it was pretty clear that it's going to remain a key strategic asset for the company going forward for a few different reasons. With the unit sale in Q2 for a little over $200 million, you've cut your stake down about 38% [ph]. I'm sure you can't comment on potential future sell-downs but can you maybe just remind us of the threshold to where you would no longer have operational and marketing control? John Rielly : So let me just start high level that we remain committed to maximizing the long-term value of Hess Midstream. It's adding differentiated value to our Bakken E&P assets. And part of it is allowing Hess to maintain operational control which we can for -- even with a much lower ownership percentage. So nothing to worry about there from that, Phil. Then what it also does, it provides takeaway optionality to high-value markets. And also, it's that ability to increase our gas capture to drive down flaring in our GHG emissions intensity. So -- and as you know, we've set a zero routine flaring goal by 2025. So the one other thing about it, to your point but with a strong credit position and its continuing free cash flow growth, Hess Midstream has said they continue to have greater than $1 billion of financial flexibility through 2025 to support potential incremental share repurchases. Similar to the ones that we've done this year, we had 2 $100 million gross transactions executed in March and June. So you should expect some more of those with that financial flexibility. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Q&A portion of today's conference call. We'd like to thank you very much. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",
