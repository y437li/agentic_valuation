Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Oracle Corporation Quarterly Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to introduce Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations, Oracle. Please go ahead, sir. Ken Bond : Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial table, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are President and Chief Financial Officer, Safra Catz; and President, Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendment for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise the results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Ada Catz : Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2 and turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Larry isn't with us today because he is at an important race for the America's Cup. I want to start by letting you know that currency in Q1 gave us a 2% headwind for new software license and total revenue, which was more than my guidance last quarter. So today, my comments on the quarter will generally reflect constant dollar growth rates. Q1 for us was really solid overall and quite strong in the Americas. We're especially pleased with our software results, as total software revenues were $6.1 billion, up 8% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues were more than half of the total company revenue at nearly $4.4 billion, up 8% from last year. Attach rates and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels, and software updates and product support continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $1.7 billion, up 6% from last year. Looking at GAAP results by region, we saw excellent results in the Americas with growth of 15%. That's growth upon a previous year, so that's really very strong. Asia-Pac saw solid growth of 5%, while EMEA declined 5%. There were some interesting product details that I think bode well for the future. Exadata Software was up over 15%; GoldenGate in-memory software was up 30%; BI Technology and Foundation Suite were up around 10%. Also strong was retailing, CRM sales and applications in North America generally. The quarter wasn't dependent on any one large deal, anything like that, it was just a very solid quarter. Hardware systems product revenue was $669 million, as older products like the older M-series and Netra saw significant declines. Storage was more a mixed story with TAPE down a bit, SAN down significantly, while network attached storage was up. The Engineered Systems customer base continues to expand nicely. Exadata bookings look very good. Revenues from Exalytics, SuperCluster and the Oracle Database Appliance all grew over 100%. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $8.4 billion, up 4% from last year. Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.7 billion, which was 6% higher than last year, and operating margin expanded to 45%. We still believe there remains ample leverage in the business model. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%. EPS for the quarter grew 12% in U.S. dollars to $0.59 on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate was 7-point -- was 17.7%, which was lower than my guidance for last quarter due to some onetime event and the mix of earnings. On a GAAP basis, EPS for the quarter was $0.47 in U.S. dollars, which was up 14%. Free cash flow increased to a record $14.2 billion over the last 4 quarters and to an all-time high of $6.1 billion for Q1, up 11% from last year. We're now on the cusp of generating more free cash flow than IBM. Just 5 years ago, we generated roughly half the level of IBM's free cash flow over 4 quarters. We now have over $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is $15 billion. As we've said before, we are committed to returning the value to our shareholders through earnings growth, share repurchases and the dividend. This quarter we repurchased 92.8 million shares for a total of $3 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased nearly 335 million shares for a total of $10.9 billion, paid out dividends of nearly $1.7 billion for a total that is nearly 90% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. Now, to the guidance, and I want to remind you that last Q2, new license in cloud revenue increased 18% in constant currency. So this will be a very, very tough comparison. And though our pipelines and potential transactions for the quarter look really very exciting, our sales leaders remain very careful about what they are forecasting to us. So new software license and cloud subscription revenue growth is expected to range from negative 4 to positive 6 in constant currency and negative 6 to positive 4 in reported dollars. Hardware product revenue is expected to range from negative 9% to positive 1% in constant dollars and negative 11% to negative 1% in reported dollars. As a result, total revenue growth on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 1% to 4% in constant dollars and negative 1 to positive 2 in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.65 and $0.70 in constant dollars, $0.64 to $0.69 in reported dollars. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.51 to $0.56 in constant dollars, and $0.50 to $0.55 in reported dollars. I want to remind you that last year, we had the benefit of a $145 million acquisition-related benefit for the Pillar earnout, so excluding that benefit, GAAP EPS last year would have been $0.51. This guidance assumes a tax rate of 23.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. Of course, it may end up being very different. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments. Mark V. Hurd: Yes. Thanks, Safra. Just a couple of things to add. Our new license executed really as we expected. The Americas had a solid quarter, as Safra mentioned. 15% growth, with both the U.S. and Latin America growing double digits and Asia-Pac came back strong with growth of 5%. Database continues to be very strong, double-digit growth again this quarter. Now, while customer activity on 12c was excellent, it really is the traditional products. Database Options, Enterprise Manager that drove this double-digit growth. And we've seen that trend in the last 3 of the last -- or 3 of the last 4 quarters. And cloud right now had a strong quarter. It's really started to hit stride, with great wins at A&A, LinkedIn, SIRIUS XM Radio, Telus, Barclays Bank, and we're also really excited about our Sales Automation Release 7. Not only will the entire Oracle sales force run on Release 7, but we're very excited to bring this to market. In HCM, our Taleo product had a very strong quarter with key wins at Honeywell, Emerson, Humana, Xilinx and DIRECTV. And last quarter, we teased you a little bit with announcements we've made, and then we made them in June. We announced the deal with Microsoft enabling customers to run Java in the Oracle Database on the user cloud. And we'd also be partnering with NetSuite on HCM. And lastly, we announced a comprehensive partnership with salesforce where they've chosen to power their cloud with the Oracle 12c database and Exadata amongst Oracle -- other Oracle products. We expect others to follow suit. Moving to Engineered Systems, we have great wins at Eton, Telecom Italia, China Mobile, SunGard, Ingersoll Rand and Hitachi. In the last 2 quarters, we have shipped almost 2,000 systems. And this quarter, we saw great unit growth north of 60% as we shipped nearly 800 systems. Nearly 40% of Exadata Systems were sold to new customers, and we expect to grow our business with these customers over time. We're gaining a material amount of unit market share. Exalytics, SPARC SuperCluster, the Oracle Database Appliance all had growth in excess of 100%. Lastly, our sales org in terms of salespeople is up. We're making investments in productivity to make them sell more. We're growing faster than our key competitors, and our attrition is down from historical levels and down significantly from last year. Now with that, I thought I'd make a couple of comments about Oracle OpenWorld, which is next week. We plan to have roughly 60,000 people at the event in San Francisco from 145 countries. We expect to have 2 million attendees online. So this is going to be the biggest one yet. We've got a great lineup of speakers. We've got EMC, Dell, Michael Epps [ph] will be there. We've got Fujitsu, Deloitte, Intel there. We've got customers : LinkedIn, AT&T, Facebook, Electronics Arts, Thomson Reuters, New York Stock Exchange, Tesco, Deutsche Telekom. I could just go on. It's going to be a great set of people from the industry, as well as customers, a very large attendee base. And we will make some significant product announcements at the event as well. We'll be introducing Oracle 12c in-memory database. We'll be talking about it being able to deliver 100x faster application performance using our new architectural approach. We'll talking about -- we'll be talking about existing Oracle apps that can now run in the Oracle Database functionality without change when using this in-memory capability. We'll have some releases in cloud. We'll talk about we'll have some releases in HCM and talent management, we'll talk about database as a service, Java as a service that will be available to our customers. So there'll be a whole slew of product announcements there that Larry will be talking about Sunday night and will continue on through the week. So we're excited about the upcoming activities at Oracle OpenWorld. With that, I'll turn it back to Ken, and we'll take whatever questions you've got. Ken Bond : Brian, we'll go to the Q&A now if you're ready. Operator : And we'll now take our first question from John DiFucci with JPMorgan. John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Mark, you mentioned the strength in database and it's reflected in license. But it's also, I think, reflected in margins this quarter. And you mentioned, and I would think it's really too early for 12c to be having much of an impact on the numbers anyway. You mentioned Options, Enterprise Manager. I guess the question is why the strength right now in database, and how does this business look as we look forward at the core database with Options? Mark V. Hurd: The interesting thing, John, first is we not only had good growth in database but we also had good growth in database in the U.S. So it was very strong. It's exactly what you described. First, it was broad-based across the regions even with a strong showing in the U.S. And it was really the options. And again, as you start dealing with some of the issues you see in the market, take for example something as simple as the data growth that you all hear in the industry. 30%, 40% data growth that our customers talk about. The ability for us to compress that data is a tremendous opportunity and it's an option that you can get advanced compression, you can get it with Exadata that dramatically changes our customers' total cost of ownership. So we had good growth really across regions, particularly strong in the U.S., particularly strong in Options. GoldenGate was very strong, we had good growth in RAC, Active Data, in-memory caching. Security was -- I mentioned this, I think, last quarter too, we had very strong growth again in security. And these are turning to be material businesses, John. And I think this is not really the beginning -- I would not call any of this really any significant impact from 12c. This is really just the core database and the options around the core database. John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : You mentioned Exadata. So that sounds like sort of that Exadata pulls along some of these options too, and that's having an effect here. Mark V. Hurd: Well, it's all part -- yes, it's all part of one story, John, in the context of we've got so much database out there and you see the drive more performance, more security, drive more compression. You can get a lot of it with the database. It's a product; you can get even more of it when you buy Exadata. And so it's a strong value prop, John. John S. DiFucci - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And if I might just one quick one for Safra. Safra, the guidance you gave is a little bit below where the Street is right now. You mentioned you talked about exciting pipelines I think the words that you used. But you also talked about manage - the salespeople or manage -- sales managers being, I don't know what word you used, but it sounded like being prudent. I guess, if you -- in the past, you sometimes gauged what that guidance is. Do you think that, that is something -- the guidance you've given, is it similar to the conservatism that is prudent that you normally give? Is it a little more conservative or less, or if you can comment on that? Safra Ada Catz : Well, as I always say to you all, I read the same newspapers or read the websites that you all do, and there's a lot of news out there, whether it's coming out from our own government or from Europe. And that influences what we put at the backdrop for our forecast. And today was a big news day in both directions. And so we're just trying to -- I think everybody's just trying to stay a little bit to have a little bit of room, and we could do significantly better. But we still -- even though our pipelines are big, we still have to close all those deals. And I just can't assume that we will. So try to just be reasonable about it, be conservative about it. But I just need to take into account a lot of different inputs. And I think we -- that's where the guidance range is. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll now take our next question from Raimo Lenschow. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I just had a topic around you guys had a conference call with salesforce a few weeks ago that focused on joining the different clouds. A few minutes ago, we had a call from 2 cloud vendors that want to work closer together going forward. Can you talk maybe a little bit about this new environment of vendors having to preintegrate their core products? And also maybe go on a little bit about Fusion, and it's a more complete solution than what others has. How is that done and how does that fit into the new world here? Safra Ada Catz : Yes, Raimo, so first of all, I think that what you're seeing is that in fact, customers want systems that are integrated. And that I think works to our advantage. And it's significantly easier obviously to have very integrated and very seamless integration when you own all the products as we do for those customers that have mixed environments, especially the large installed base of one of our competitors. The big benefit, of course, in working with us is that it's all based on our technology. I think it gets significantly harder when you're talking about almost random companies who are trying to make the experience seamless when their systems are so very, very different, the definitions, the underlying platforms are very, very different. For us, we view this as a huge benefit towards us, and we think it's actually powering the strength of Fusion and the interest in Fusion as -- because Fusion actually has a second piece to it, which is it integrates; not only all of our applications work together in Fusion, but they also work with all of your existing Oracle applications in a way that if you -- and Fusion itself can be deployed, some on-premise if you like, and some in the cloud. And back and forth, in fact. So what you're seeing is customers wanting more choice but better integration, and we're really the only ones who have all the products and the depth and an ability to deliver it in the cloud, in the public cloud, in a private cloud behind their firewall or in our -- or on-premise, which is truly about customer choice. Operator : And our next question from Joel Fishbein. Joel P. Fishbein - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division : Mark, a quick question. As I was going through the numbers, it looked like hardware support's up 5% against hardware that's down 13%. Can you give me some -- or give us some more color on what's going on there? Mark V. Hurd: Yes, I mean I said, Joel, it's, we've -- I talked about this in the past. I think that if you look historically when the hardware business was not part of Oracle, the attach of service to a unit, so you sell a unit and then you sell service with it. Historically, pre-Oracle, that was a very, very low number. And we realigned our business so that as we sort of shifted to these very high Oracle content products, we now attach support all the time. And as a result, the growth of support is not symmetrical with the product growth rate. And so what we do is having support now growing materially faster as we catch up to what I would argue would be industry norms in terms of the way you attach support to a product. And it's causing -- I understand your point. It doesn't look right that hardware support is growing now 5%. I might add our margins have improved dramatically with the growth rate. But it is because that we now have high Oracle content products, and we are attaching support to those products regularly when we sell them. And that is causing our hardware support to grow in a way that doesn't align directly to the hardware price. Now, I can tell it to you the other way, Joel, once we start growing the top line in hardware, that will even be a further catalyst to our hardware support. And because much of that cost in hardware is support, it's sort of a baseline set of costs to be in the business, things like parts depots and spare parts, you'll actually be in a position where you can make even more margin. So it's really, Joel, just us going back to the fundamentals of running a good hardware support business, and it starts with attaching the service and the support to the product when you sell it, which is what we've done. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brent Thill. Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : My question is on the general demand environment. And, Safra, I think you made a comment that you believe you could do significantly better. Overall, tax spending seems to be pretty positive yet your guidance, and we certainly respect the tough comp, is really for no license growth. So from your perspective, what are the key enablers for you to get back to what I would assume you would perceive to be more healthy growth in the license side? What key building blocks do you have to fill in from here? Safra Ada Catz : We just have to execute and we have to avoid any kind of economic deterioration or things like that. Some of those things are out of our control. You just have to execute. We have to have another quarter just like this one, just straight execution, follow a straight line. I think we have an opportunity to do significantly better. But so we just want to move forward. It really does come down for this next quarter to being an extremely difficult comp. Mark V. Hurd: I'd probably put a little different view on your comments. One, listen, to Safra's point, we read all of our peer groups' results. And to be very blunt, they're not very good. So depending on who you're talking about, most of their numbers are negative. So when you say there's a robust expending environment, I'm not sure whose numbers you're reading. So that's sort of point one. When you look at scale technology companies, there's some pretty significant headwinds out there when you certainly look in July through the June readouts. So when you look at this quarter, I would argue we, again, gained a lot of share just based on the results we just gave you. So I think what we're telling you out there is we see what's out there. We're trying to be prudent and thoughtful in the guidance we give. I don't think it's as much about the tough comp. I mean, tough comp is part of it. There's also a couple points of currency that are involved in the number that guided you to, to 0 as well. So that would be my view of it. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jason Maynard. Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I want to talk a little bit more about the hardware business. And Mark, if you could maybe give us a little bit of a drill-down into what's going on with the M and the T, and how you expect that to play out. Talk a little bit about what's going on with kind of the legacy products. And the last question would be are you still comfortable with seeing some growth this year in the overall hardware business, just on the product side? Mark V. Hurd: Sure, thanks. Jason, I think we'll see -- we'll have some growth in hardware this year. I would say your question, which was primarily about the SPARC line. T was okay in the quarter, M was not. So as you know, in sort of Q4-ish timeframe, mid-Q4, we released a new set of M products we're pretty excited about. We've got a big installed base that we can move. It takes time to get those products certified and tested in customers' environments, but that's what happened in the numbers. We had the strong Exadata unit growth that both Safra and I described. We had very good results in several regions in our storage, if you will, our NAS storage business. TAPE was unexciting as it has been for a period of time, and the real issue was again in the M part of the SPARC line. That's really the story in hardware. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Heather Bellini. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I wanted to follow up, Mark, a little bit on the response you gave to Brent just talking about the competitive environment. I was just wondering specifically if you could share with us kind of who -- what companies in particular kind of are you benchmarking yourself against or who are you benchmarking yourself against? And kind of how would you -- how do you kind of keep score versus those guys, if you will? Mark V. Hurd: Well, that could take us a while. I think the -- let's start off with -- if you're looking at who our competitors are, Heather, we certainly compete in the infrastructure business with IBM. They would be a competitor. We certainly would compete to a part of the infrastructure business with EMC, probably to a lesser degree. Not so much in the head on storage business, but the fact that when we're dealing with data and management of data, you can see competition from that perspective. In the Applications business, clearly SAP on a global basis, they would be a competitor. And then in addition to that, you have competitors, I'd say, even like salesforce and Workday now, albeit that they're mostly North American and that they're mostly in one process : Workday and HR and salesforce and sales automation. We still view them as competitors. Now, I could go down a slew of others in various product groups, but those would be the big ones that I would describe to you, Heather. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rich Sherlund. Richard G. Sherlund - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division : Mark, the headcount, you're up about 9% in Americas year-over-year and you're up about 3% in the rest of the world. You showed good license growth in the Americas. I'm sort of curious what's behind the headcount growth in Americas versus the rest of the world. Are you ramping sales headcount, or what's happening there? Mark V. Hurd: Yes, it is nothing more than the run rate that comes. So imagine as we talked over the several quarters, there is not a big bump sequentially per se as it is just the run rate of the hiring. As I've said before, we were quicker to hire in Europe, which is what really has helped us in Europe. While Europe was not fantastic for us in Q1, over the past several quarters they've gained a lot of share in Europe, and one of the reasons for that has been the fact that they've simply been in more deals. They've been in front of more customers. We were slower to ramp in the U.S., although to your point with your numbers, we have begun to, and that shows up in the run rate that turns into this year-over-year comp rate. And it is shown up by the fact that when you look at our U.S. numbers over the past couple of quarters, we are beginning to see some of that same effect that we saw in Europe. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Mark, I'm wondering if you talk about -- you did have a better performance it seems like from a sales execution perspective in Q1. I'm wondering if you could talk about what changes you've made in the sales organization with executions in the fiscal '14, in the early months of that. Mark V. Hurd: We really made no changes in fiscal '14. So as we said last year, we made changes over a year ago. And one of our objectives going into '14 was to make a minimal amount of changes. We -- before we went into 2014, we had all our territories deployed, our quotas deployed. We really looked to change almost 0 territories and keep the territories the same as they were the year before. We kept our specialization the same as the year before. So as a result, we wound up really ready to go in the very early part of the quarter. And I think we talked about this in the last conference call, but it was a big thing for us to have our quotas deployed and our territories defined. Everybody knew their boss very early in June, and you could see it had in the end some effect for us. So there really were not many changes in the sales force. And it's also shown up -- and frankly our attrition is down, which is helpful as well because we have performers. And when you have to have attrition, you have to change a territory when someone attrits and the fact that the attrition down is helpful to us in that respect as well. Operator : And we'll now take our last question from Kash Rangan. Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Mark and Safra, could you talk about -- it's been a couple of years since you finished up Taleo and RightNow, and I wonder if you could give us your thoughts on how you view the growth opportunities with these 2 product lines albeit they're niche-y one, but they are still important, if you get it. But also I think the one story that is not told is the vertical-specific application. There is a bit of a myopic focus on HR and CRM, which I completely get, but you guys have been historically very strong in vertical application. So I'm curious to get your thoughts on how -- do you see growth opportunities in verticals and how are they doing in general. Mark V. Hurd: RightNow has done very well for us. When you look at the overall market position to the earlier question, today, we're really #1 in service automation. We haven't talked about Alcoa, but we're really #1 in marketing automation. So when you look at what's gone and when you look at the Web commerce space, our products like ATG and Decca, we're #1 in commerce server and the overall customer experience space. And when you line those up, we have a very powerful offering in that whole customer experience -- broader customer experience area. So right now, what's strong in the quarter, I would argue we grew in RightNow in the quarter against a very tough comp. Our toughest comp in RightNow in the quarter was Q1 and we had growth in Q1, and we were very encouraged by that. Particularly, Kash, the growth globally. We've had good global traction with RightNow. Taleo had a good quarter, very good growth in Taleo in the quarter, so we were excited about that as well. And they are both market leaders, leading recruiting app, and again, leading service automation app. Verticals, we told the story many times. I mean, we've had a tremendous run in retail. We really -- I hate to use the term rolled up the retail industry, but we're in the process of really going retailer to retailer to retailer with merchandising, planning, our point-of-sale capabilities and being able to really be the, we think, the leader in the retail applications marketplace. We made investments over the past couple of quarters in additional products and communications industry for our acquisitions at Tekelec and Acme Packet. And the collection now, we have a collection of billing assets, and those assets make us a leader now in the communications industry as well. We're doing the same thing in utilities, we're doing the same thing in banking, the same thing in health care. So it is a critical strategy for us. And the great news is when we win in these industries, all of Oracle wins. I mean, we win at the database layer, we win at the middleware layer, we win the hardware layer. So it's a very key strategy for us, and we've made investments in those areas, as that's both from an acquisition perspective and with more distribution as well. Ken Bond : Thank you, Mark. In closing, a telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator for closing comments. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.",

I am traveling today, so I hope you can hear me all right. I am going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I will then review guidance for Q3 and then turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments. This quarter currency was a 2% headwind to new license and 1% to hardware and total revenues, so my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rates. Q2 was a solid quarter overall as we exceeded our forecast in all major revenue segments and we are pleased with the results. Total software revenues were $6.9 billion, up 5% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove about half of total company revenues at $4.5 billion, up 7% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue was $2.4 billion, up 1%. As many of you know, we had an absolutely fantastic Q2 last year with new software license growth way above expectations of 18%. So we are actually very pleased because that was quite a tough compare and over the last two years we grew 19%. Looking at GAAP results by region, the Americas grew 5% with Latin America showing excellent growth. EMEA grew 3% and Asia-Pacific declined 10% with Japan continuing to be challenged. Currency continues to be a significant headwind in Japan and Australia. Now while our China business is not large enough to make a significant difference to our business, we did actually see good growth there this quarter. Within software, database continues to do well with Exadata software, GoldenGate and TimesTen In-Memory software products, all up more than 20%. Also strong was human capital management, both on-premise and SaaS as well as our retailing and Life Science verticals. The quarter, by the way, wasn't dependent on any one large deal. Overall the hardware business, including hardware support grew 2%, with hardware system product revenue up $714 million and not only have our engineered systems continued to show excellent growth, but they have actually become a material part of our overall hardware business now accounting for nearly 30% of all hardware product sales. While it is still early in the customer adoption cycle, the new M-Series and T-Series servers saw good growth sequentially. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 1% higher over last year and the operating margin was 46%. We believe we can invest for growth and make money as we continue to see the leverage of our business model. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.69, growing 9% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 20% and GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.56, up 7% in constant currency. Free cash flow increased 14% to a record $14.6 billion over the last four quarters. Our consistent growth of free cash flow over the last [three] [ph] years has resulted in our surpassing IBM which, as you know, has seen declines in the last eight of the last 12 quarters and we now have nearly $37 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $13 billion. As we said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through earnings growth, stock repurchases and a dividend. In this quarter, we repurchased 83.4 million shares for a total of $2.8 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased nearly 323 million shares for a total of $10.7 billion, paid out dividends of nearly $1.9 billion for a total that is nearly 90% of our free cash flow. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share for the quarter. Now to the guidance. New software license and cloud subscription revenue is expected to range from 2% to 12% in constant currency and 1% to 11% in reported dollars. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from a negative 1% to a positive 9% in constant dollars and negative 2% to a positive 8% in reported dollars. As a result, total revenue growth on GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 7% in constant dollars and 2% to 6% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.68 and $0.72 in constant and reported dollars. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.54 to $0.58 in constant dollars and in reported dollars. Now, this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 23% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%, and of course that may end up being different. With that, I will turn it over to Mark for his comments. Mark Hurd : Yes. Thanks, Safra. I will just add a couple of comments and turn it to Larry. We had solid sales execution and beat forecast in all segments. We had good results in Europe; in the Americas, Latin America was strong for us. Database continues to show good performance due in part to strengthened Exadata and database options and we have not yet begun to see the coming benefits of 12c, which will help drive license growth. Exadata and all our Engineered Systems had booking growth of nearly 35% on top of similar growth last year. All six Engineered Systems saw double-digit revenue growth, including the Big Data Appliance and SPARC SuperCluster, which saw triple-digit growth. Our Engineered Systems business is now big, delivering strong consistent growth in our hardware business, including support grew 2% in constant currency. In Cloud, we had bookings growth of 35%, and saw excellent growth across all major product pillars. Fusion SaaS was even better with HCM, sales force automation and ERP, all up triple digits. We are adding customers at high growth rates, contract sizes are growing and hundreds of customers are now live on Fusion SaaS. In HCM, we had excellent growth in all pillars, core HR, payroll and talent cloud. Let me list out just a few wins. British Telecom, Siemens North America, Carlson Wagonlit, Health Net, InterContinental Hotels, PPG Industries, Cummins, Government of Rotterdam, Southwestern Energy, PDG Realty in Brazil, CEMEX, Marks & Spencer, Scripps Health, those are HCM. BT and Siemens are especially noteworthy as they will both be servicing employee bases of more than 60,000 employees. In customer experience we saw growth across all four pillars, marketing, sales, service and social cloud. Key wins at Oshkosh Truck, All Nippon Airways, Live Nation, Tesco, The Washington Post, Procter & Gamble, Perry Homes, CRH Building Materials, [Econ] [ph] Europe, Queensland's state government, TomTom, LifeScan Canada. In ERP, while still early we saw triple digit growth in ERP, with many of our wins net new ERP customers to Oracle. This quarter, we issued new releases in HCM, talent, sales, marketing and social cloud. We also introduced Hyperion Planning and Budgeting as a cloud service and we expanded our data center talent to 17 locations globally with Canada, Germany and Brazil coming online soon. I will spend a little more time on cloud this quarter as I think it's important to understand what we are seeing and that we are gaining traction. Our Cloud and Engineered Systems business have hyper growth like characteristics, inside to Safra\u2019s point, the largest cash flow company in enterprise technology. The growth of just our software business is more than double the revenue of Workday. Let me with that turn it over to Larry. Larry Ellison : Thanks, Mark. Oracle enters 2014 with a refreshed version of the key products that are expected to drive growth over the next calendar year. Oracle's latest database version 12c was specifically designed for the cloud. Oracle 12c makes all your Oracle applications multitenant applications without you having to make any changes to your applications whatsoever. Oracle 12c also dramatically speeds up all your Oracle applications by making them in-memory applications without you having to change a single line of your application code. Oracle's Fusion Cloud applications for HCM, CRM and ERP, all have a new simplified user interface and an integrated social network that makes our enterprise applications as easy to use and familiar as Facebook, while enabling better collaboration and teamwork among your employees and your customers. All these new application interfaces were specifically designed for use on modern mobile devices like telephones and tablets. Bookings for our cloud applications grew strongly this quarter, 35%, reflecting a continuously improving win rate versus the new generation of SaaS specialist. Our Engineered Systems bookings also grew rapidly, 34% in this quarter. We think these three product areas, database, cloud applications and engineered systems will drive Oracle's growth in calendar year 2014. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Operator, if we could now begin the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Absolutely. Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities. Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities : First for Larry. I know it\u2019s early for Oracle cloud infrastructure and Platform as a Service but can you update us on where you stand there? We are seeing really good growth out of Amazon. I know your approach is a bit different but if you could update us on your strategy and where we stand on that? And Mark, if I could just get a little clarification from you on the growth rate on the cloud side. I think you said 35% bookings growth and a triple digit for HCM, CRM and ERP. Was that revenue growth or bookings growth? Mark Hurd : Rick, why don't we let Larry start and then I will. Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities : Yes. Thank you. Larry Ellison : Okay. Well, Rick, as you know, our strategy is to be a player in all three parts of the cloud. All three levels of cloud : SaaS, cloud applications, platform and infrastructure. We think we are going to be especially strong in platform where our two platform brands, our database brand is the Oracle Database 12c and our programming language brand is this thing called Java. So we think we have a much stronger platform than any of our SaaS competitors. Let's just start from there. If you look at SalesForce.com and Force.com, you look at their platform capabilities versus the Oracle Database and Java and we think we have a considerable advantage and of course all of our SaaS, all of our applications are built on the Oracle Database, built on our platform, our database and our Java server. Finally, down at the infrastructure level, we intend to be price competitive with Amazon and Microsoft Azure and Rackspace. So we intend to compete aggressively in, what I will call, commodity not being a bad word, the commodity infrastructure as a service marketplace. But we are not going to that alone. It is not going to be just infrastructure as a service. Our intention is to sell our customers infrastructure as a service and the same customer a highly differentiated platform as a service will let us get better margins and highly differentiated suite of enterprise applications for the cloud. So we are going to be cost competitive and price competitive at the infrastructure level while being highly differentiated at both the platform level and the application level. Already we have more enterprise SaaS applications than any other cloud services provider. We will continue to expand our footprint and use our size as an advantage. Mark Hurd : Rick, Mark. I know I threw a lot of numbers out there quick to you on the SaaS growth but what the numbers are is that our aggregate bookings growth in SaaS was 35%. Okay, point one. That includes all of our products. What I was pointing out was that if you look at Fusion HCM, Fusion Sales Automation and Fusion ERP, those three grew in bookings triple digits. That's the delineation. Rick Sherlund - Nomura Securities : Great. Thank you. Mark Hurd : Okay. Ken Bond : Next question, please. Operator : That will come from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse : Congrats on a great quarter. A lot of time on the call was spent on cloud applications and database, but I want to focus my question on hardware. Obviously, you guys showed some upside to consensus this quarter and you guided next quarter for hardware to grow year-over-year, I guess, this is for both, Mark and Larry. I wonder if you could just give us more comments on what you see on Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics and then also compare that to just sort of where we are with the [inaudible] business? Mark Hurd : Yes. I will start and let Larry add. Bookings growth in engineered systems, as I mentioned, was 35%. Important Phil to know, this is a big business now, so, we had 35% growth this quarter against a similar growth rate last year, so this is a compounding effect for us. All six of our engineered systems in the quarter had double-digit revenue growth, and as I mentioned, it was really encouraging I think for us to see SPARC SuperCluster had an excellent quarter for us in addition to Exadata. I mean, we had big wins, no not actually big wins, I mean we had we had very important name wins P&G, Verizon, AmerisourceBergen, ICICI Bank [in] [ph] China, Televisa, Exalytics was strong in the quarter, Phil, we had Petrobras from an Exalytics perspective. Again, a very broad based set of customers, very consistent across our regions in terms of performance and again very strong bookings growth against a very strong compare. I will let Larry add anything he would like. Larry Ellison : Yes. I think our Engineered Systems business really has two parts. One is Exadata, Exalogic and Exalytics, all of which really built their reputation in the marketplace for high performance and of course you can take that high performance in performance or you can take it in lower cost. The other thing we have introduced recently are lower cost engineered systems. They go after the mass and price-sensitive parts of the market, so we have announced an Oracle Virtual Compute Appliance, a bunch of low cost commodity servers running Linux, integrated in our case with InfiniBand, connected with InfiniBand versus the traditional Ethernet, but our system comes with its own VM. It's kind of an industry standard Xen-based VM, the industry standard Linux, standard commodity servers with a high speed networking interface. We have, again, that's called the Oracle Virtual Compute Appliance. It's relatively new and it's very aggressively priced and we think it's a mass market product that competes against our friends at Cisco. We also have had for some time the Oracle Database Appliance, another low-cost mass market product, so we expect to sell a lot of engineered systems not just the well known high end Exadata machines, but a complete suite of machines that go from extreme high performance, the ability to build large scale clouds out of the commodity servers. Mark Hurd : You know, Phil, I think just before we leave the point on hardware, a couple of other points to Larry's point about what we call the ODA, which is the Oracle Database Appliance, we are now at a point where we are roughly at 2,000 of those units. We don't talk about that product much, because to Larry's point it's a more entry-level system, but we\u2019ve had great success with it. On the sort of core server side, it's going to be very interesting for us to see how much share we gained in the quarter. Our M and T Series, the SPARC line, if you will, actually grew sequentially, so if you looked at them quarter-to-quarter, we actually grew sequentially and our decline in that business was actually quite small year-on-year and when you look at that, obviously, compared to our Core Unix competitors, that's going to be a big gain. When you add that to the Engineered Systems' performance in the quarter, our aggregate hardware business just gained a lot of market share. Ken Bond : Next question, please? Operator : That will come from the Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo : Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I have a couple of questions, but first maybe Mark and Safra. If I look at your performance on a constant currency basis by geo, the U.S. was up 5% and I think you are now 9% growth in the first half of this year. EMEA looked better, obviously, on a sequential basis in Q2, but APAC looked like the one region where there was more trouble and it was down, I think, 10% on a constant currency basis, so could you maybe talk a little bit about what you see happening at least from a macro perspective, maybe some of the changes to the leadership there and how do you think about Asia performing over the second half of the year? Mark Hurd : Why don't I start, Jason, and I will let Safra chime in afterwards, if she would like to. I think you are right in your assessment. I think we had a good quarter in Europe again. I think when you get the read-throughs across our industry it is even broader than that. Our Europe team has performed well. We have said before that our Europe team realigned itself early. There is no question in our mind that our Europe team is taking market share. They have performed well not only this quarter but, frankly, over a consistent period of time. I think we feel very good about our position in Europe and the share that we are gaining. In U.S., I think you are right as well. I think U.S. had a solid quarter, overall, all-in with what we expected. And as you know, that was going against a tougher compare from last year. Asia has been rocking for us. It's obviously rocking from a macro perspective. Safra mentioned the good news was our performance in China. And our performance in China was actually quite strong. Most of the issue involved in the quarter was in Australia and New Zealand which continues to be a difficult market there. I do not believe that to be an Oracle issue. I believe that more to be a macro issue. We really feel in the long-run that we have got a very strong upside opportunity in Asia. We have put, to your point, some new energy into Asia, some new excitement into Asia and we expect it to pay off. So those would be my comments about Asia, to your point. If Asia had done a little better, you can imagine how much would the performance we would have delivered in the quarter. It would have been even more exciting. Safra Catz : Yes, the other part for us for Asia, what we call Asia-Pacific, is merged together includes Japan, which we actually expect to bounce back this quarter, just between comparisons and other things. There is nothing, you know, you made a mention to the leadership in Asia-Pac or something like that and I actually don't know what you are referring to there, because there is nothing in particular going on in our Asia-Pac. So that's it. So it's Japan and Australia basically, where [our expense was] [ph]. Ken Bond : Okay. Thank you. Operator, next question, please. Operator : We will hear from John DiFucci with JPMorgan. John DiFucci - JPMorgan: Thank you. I think it was Larry who said that growth is going to come from database, cloud apps and engineered systems. I want to focus on the first and third of those. I guess, can you give us any more color on the database machines including Exadata and SPARC SuperCluster, I think primarily and I guess ODA also? But it is early with 12c, but has there been any impacts that 12c could be having on driving growth with engineered systems? Maybe Mark, even any anecdotes on what customers might be doing with 12c coupled with Exadata that might be different than what they did with 11g? Mark Hurd : Well, I will let Larry start and I will add some color after that. Larry Ellison : Okay, let me add one more engineered system, which is our M6 In-Memory system. As you know, there is a lot of interest now in in-memory databases. We announced the Oracle 12c In-Memory option and you couple the Oracle 12c In-Memory option with an M6 with 32 terabytes of main memory. That's 99.99% of all the world's databases can be now kept in main memory with orders of magnitude improved the performance. So we think that's going to be a very interesting combination. So 12c, we think, is interesting to a lot of cloud companies and companies that are not in the business of reselling applications but are building private clouds. So the combination of selling it to net suites of the world that allows them to offer a higher quality service at a lower cost or big banks and telecommunication companies that allow them to build an effective private cloud. We have seen more interest in 12c than any database version in recent memory. The multi-tenant option and the in-memory option, I think, are going to have very rapid uptake in 2014 and 2015. Mark Hurd : I think, John, in addition, we are yet to see the 12c benefit in our results sort of point one. Point two, to your point about Engineered Systems and database side. Clearly, the opportunity for us to now consolidate Oracle environments in big accounts is extreme. Most of our customers have found tens and tens and tens of ways to configure the Oracle database. They have Oracle 8, 9, 10, 11, they have multiple different types of operating systems, multiple different types of hardware platforms, so the opportunity for us to simplify and standardize those Oracle environments and our customers typically spend 10s and 10s and in many cases hundreds of millions of dollars a year, to operate the Oracle database environment because of that complexity. Our ability to simplify this and standardize this on Exadata, on our engineered systems with 12c, the formation of what would be private clouds and database-as-a-service for our customers, gives us a chance to save our customers in some cases 30% to 40% out of their total costs on the Oracle environment. This is an extremely big opportunity for us and 12c is just one of the added opportunities we have now to consolidate those environments. Larry Ellison : I think one part of your question was 12c and does it drives even more growth than the engineered systems, especially Exadata and SPARC SuperCluster, and the M6 in-memory machine and I would say, absolutely yes. John DiFucci - JPMorgan: Larry, my question kind of goes back to something you said earlier, especially with the multi-tenancy option, because our due diligence in talking to customers anyway was this is something they are waiting for, so that they can put multiple applications on one Exadata and be able to manage those applications in isolation, in a way that they couldn't before and it just seems like that that brings that step function up and efficiency and I was just wondering if anybody has actually done that at least in their labs yet or. I mean, it makes a lot of sense, but are you seeing any of it yet? Larry Ellison : Yes. We have seen a number of customers take it and do it in the laboratory. Of course, this is back to what Mark was saying. They have lots and lots of Oracle environments and they want to consolidate it onto a smaller number of machines and reduce the amount of labor required to manage all of those machines. Exadata, with all of this extreme performance, a lot of people have questioned the size of the Exadata market, saying, \"Well, how many people need that kind of extreme performance?\" Well, it's not a matter of one Exadata machine providing extreme performance to one application. It's one Exadata machine that allows you to get rid of 50 machines or 100 machines and consolidate those 100 separate applications and those 100 separate databases on that single Exadata machine and manage it as a single environment and that's exactly what the multitenant option does. It's what Mark was saying, our customers spend a fortune managing tens, hundreds, thousands of different Oracle environments, different Oracle versions. They have to patch them, upgrade them, back them up, do all of those things. We can simplify that, make that a more reliable process, make that a less expensive process, by using the multitenant option on top of Exadata, so it's a huge opportunity for us to sell into our installed base, lower our customers' overall cost of managing the Oracle environment and get them a better overall experience in terms of performance, reliability and maintainability. John DiFucci - JPMorgan: Great. Thank you very much. Ken Bond : Next question please? Operator : We will hear from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thank you. Safra, you have built one of the most profitable companies in technology as measured by operating margins and I guess I just wanted to ask, how we should think about the puts and takes you see as related to Oracle's non-GAAP operating margin expansion as you look out over the next two to three years? Safra Catz : Well, I think what you can see in our numbers right now is that year-over-year the difference is really we have invested in sales capacity right now as compared to last year and we expect that to pay off, so remember the big things that impact our margins are, first, our enormous installed base of customers who pay us either for license updates and product support or for running systems for that. Those numbers are going to continue to grow. Simultaneously, as you know, as Mark talked about, and he's going to chime in, in a second, we decided that we were really going to lean in to the cloud to get market share and we were going to be able to do it unlike all those cloud companies. We were actually, still as a company, going to make a large amount of money and so we have ramped up the sales organization and we are at full strength and it takes time for that to pay off but at that point your expenses are at one level and now the revenues come in. So we think we still have a lot of room as we expand our installed base, as you know, continue to grow every quarter and now we are going to start seeing expansion in the margins as the revenues follow through. Mark, do you want to add to that? Mark Hurd : Sure. No, I think to add to Safra's point, a lot of that sales resource that we have hired up that's in our current period expense is driving that 35% bookings growth in cloud. The great news is it's 35% bookings growth in cloud and triple digits in some of our core Fusion modules. The bad news is, it's not licensed. It shows up as subscription and becomes a continuous revenue stream for us over time. So we have hired into that, to Safra's point, put those resources to work and they are busy building that subscription base. As that goes through the process of becoming annual subscription and it becomes recurring revenue, it behaves a much more like our support business than it would our license business. So we have purposely hired up. By the way, we are really happy now that we have had our sales organization in this sales model now for almost a couple of years. We have had them in the same sales model for a couple of years. We are happy with their progress and I think this quarter, particularly in the cloud, with a number of new logos, the growth in our core Fusion areas and just the absolute growth. This is promising and will over a period of time it will have the effect on operating margins that Safra described and remember even when our licenses are flat, and I am not trying to make that a good number, but even when they are flat, all that means is we have got just as many new subscribers this year as we did last year and with our retention rates and support you know what happens to our operating margins over time. They just continue to expand. So again, I will tell you what I said in my script earlier. I think you have got a company here that has fantastic cash flow with elements of hyper growth inside it and the cloud is one of them and we put resources into it to drive that growth. Larry Ellison : I would like to chime in here too briefly saying that the mix of our products is changing. I know we got a lot of criticism when we bought Sun and we have gone through this transition where we had a growing hardware business, Engineered Systems, and a shrinking hardware business, Commodity Systems as we shied away from Commodity Systems in trying to be competitive in that marketplace. As we more or less completed that transition now, the Engineered Systems business is now a large business and it has much higher margins than the commodity business that we have gotten out of over the last couple of years. So the mix has changed in hardware from the low margin hardware to much higher margin hardware. I am also including our storage business in that, by the way. The mix has changed somewhat in our software business where a larger percentage of our software business are annuities or are renewals versus new licenses. That renewal business is a more profitable business. We think, as our cloud application business gets larger, that's also when annuity business that promises to be even more profitable than our license business. Time will tell but we think we are going through a number of changes in mix to our overall products that we sell and that's very, very positive for our margin improvements in the future. Ken Bond : Thank you. Operator, next question, please. Operator : And that will come from Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill - UBS: Good afternoon. Larry, on the database side, you mentioned you hadn't seen this level of interest in a while and I was just curious if you could talk through, when do you think we will see the inflection point of 12c kicking in? Is it couple of quarters away? Is it a year away? And historically, the database market is considered to be a single-digit growth market. Anything changed with this release that you think can help accelerate growth beyond the historical rates that we have seen. Larry Ellison : Well, yes. I think we will spike beyond the single-digit amount, but given with the warning the caveats that our database business is quite a large business, but I think there will be a spike in that driven by two things. The multitenant option and I don't want to deemphasize the in-memory option either. I think you will see, I mentioned pretty rapid uptake probably starting a little bit in Q3 and then much more in our Q4 in the first half of the next calendar year. The in-memory option, I expect, people will start playing around with in the second half of the year, but as we get around this time next year, we will see good growth being driven by the in-memory option. Again, I had to go all the way back to 11i in the early days of the Internet when I have seen that much interest in new features in our database. Brent Thill - UBS: A quick follow-up for Mark, there has been some ongoing speculation around the sales force and how they are being structured. I think you just mentioned to Heather's question. There really hasn't been any change, but I know that question many of us have gotten in the last couple of weeks and I am just curious if you could just comment. Mark Hurd : I really can't. Only in the context of this there's just nothing to talk about. There at the territory level, Brent, we don't have any sales people changing territories, changing accounts. We are not [rewarding] anything. If anything, we are actually very happy with the model we are in and the continuity of it and the continuity of the management, the familiarization of the team with our products, we are driving a lot more training into the sales force, so one of our real tenets is just continuity. We say continuity, continuity particularly of the relationship between the sales person and the customer. It's very important for us to have continuity with the customer and we have made it now, so that the territory changes around Oracle are a really big deal and so that level of discipline is in and nothing has just changed about it whatsoever. Brent Thill - UBS: Great. Thanks. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : That will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays: Thank you. I wanted to talk a little bit about the Cloud business again. What do you see in terms of customer reception? Obviously, you have a very much increase in growth rates here, but how are you selling that? Is that kind of like account management control function in terms of you going in and a lot of deals we are seeing where you just kind of up-sell from what you have already or are these deals competitive than what you see in terms of your positioning against the competitors, the pure play ones? Thank you. Mark Hurd : Well, will take it and let Larry chime in as he sees fit. We go to market by functional area and we call on the functional owner of that functional area particularly in areas like HCM. We will call on the Chief Human Resources Officer and talk to them about our solutions. Now to your point, some of those are customers are current customers of Oracle HR applications and some of those customers are not. We have, we think, very strong differentiations in the area of mobility, we think is a core strength of Oracle HCM, we have social capabilities integrated into our solutions, we have got analytics, which is a very big deal integrated into our application and supposed not everything these are core differentiations in this case specifically versus workday, so, we go directly to the [CHRO] and clearly there is a role of IT in it, but we go at the CHRO acting. We call on the CHRO and then we integrate that sales process with IT. Now, think of us doing that sort of functional area by functional area; whether that's with the CMO and marketing, the Chief Sales Officer and sales automation, et cetera. We feel very strong, Larry made some comments earlier, about our differentiation, the one I just added and that's how we go to market. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays: Perfect. Larry Ellison : Let me just emphasize. We are organized against our secular competitors, so a while ago, Mark has emphasized, we haven't made any changes to sales force in a while and that is absolutely true. A while ago though, we decided, we had to lineup an HCM sales force directly against workday. That's all they think about. Every day is competing against every workday prospect and going out there competing against workday. We have another team people that compete against Salesforce and Salesforce Automation. We have another team that competes against Salesforce in service automation and customer experience. We have another team that focuses on ERP and SAP and so far it's the cloud ERP which is a relatively new market where that team is focused entirely on Workday. So Workday is really not in cloud ERP yet. That's an area they would like to get into but we watch that very closely. We are organized. We are organized by functional area so we can compete effectively against these new generation of specialists. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays: Okay. Thank you. Ken Bond : Next question, please. Operator : And that will come from Brad Reback with Stifel Nicolaus. Brad Reback - Stifel Nicolaus : Thanks a lot. Mark, maybe a quick question. I am back on the Salesforce and productivity. Obviously you have hired a lot. This has grown faster than revenue but maybe you can give us a sense of where we are in the productivity curve and will you reach full productivity this year or is it sometime in next year? Mark Hurd : No, we would not reach full productivity as, again, remember what we said a little earlier, that a reasonable amount of our hiring has gone into the cloud. And as a result, many of those resources are selling annual recurring revenue. And that annual recurring revenue would be a percent of what you would normally have had in the old license business. So you have got a period of time for those people to get productive and get revenue, and again, it starts all with what we announced today. It starts with bookings and then you drive that booking over a period of time and you build a subscription base. Normally speaking, you would think it would take you a couple to three years to get to that full productivity of the equivalent of a recurring stream of revenue to what you would have typically seen in license. Now that said, some of our resources have gone into what you would think of as the traditional license business. And by the way, you see some of those results in areas like what we have in Europe. So an example, we hired up in Europe very early in the process that Larry was just talking about and it's showing up with our market share gains and you see evidence of that across many of our regions. So the best way to answer that is sort of a hybrid impact. We have more resources. We are seeing the productivity helping us gain share in many of our core markets. In cloud, we are in early days. And as we talked about today, it all starts with bookings. I would say that we have gotten more and more comfortable with now the size of the distribution pipe and really our focus now is on their productivity. The engineering of the sales process, as Larry and I have gone through a couple of examples up today, mean that they are standard sales place for our sales force to go execute, training our sales force and maturing that sales force. So that's really where we are in the process. Brad Reback - Stifel Nicolaus : Great. Thanks very much. Ken Bond : Thank you, Mark. Operator, I think we can turn the call back to you for closing in a moment but I will make some closing remarks here. Thank you all for joining us today. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions on this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us again. Happy holidays and I will turn it back to the operator for closing. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Oracle Corporation Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Conference. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations, Oracle. Please go ahead, sir. Ken Bond : Thank you, Kelly, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison; President and CFO, Safra Catz; and President, Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. And we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendment, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. This quarter, currency was a 1% headwind to new software license and a 2% headwind to hardware and total revenue. In addition, EPS this year was reduced by $0.02 due to a currency remeasurement nonoperating loss for Venezuela that obviously had not been included in my guidance. In Q3 of last year, Venezuela's devaluation had a $0.01 impact. Q3 for us was a solid quarter, and overall, we're pleased with our results. Core businesses were within guidance and areas of investor focus, including cloud, Engineered Systems and hardware, all delivered strong results. My comments today are generally going to reflect constant dollar growth rates, unless I mention it otherwise. Total software revenues were nearly $7 billion, up 6% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove nearly 1/2 the total company revenue at $4.6 billion, up 7% from last year. Q3 renewal rates were at a 4-year high, as our installed base of 400,000 customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $2.4 billion, up 5%. Looking at GAAP results by region, the Americas grew 9%, with Latin America particularly strong, and EMEA grew 3%. Asia Pacific, though, declined, with Australia and India both down. Within software, cloud subscriptions were $292 million, up 24% from last year. As our cloud business continues to ramp, bookings growth was again much higher than cloud subscription revenue growth. We've been using Fusion accounting for our own financial reporting for 2 years. And revenues for all portfolios of Fusion, including financial, supply chain, HCM and customer experience, grew triple digits. Now as our cloud business becomes more material, I want to share how cloud subscriptions affect our financials. Most obvious is that revenue is initially lower, as subscription license revenue is recognized over the life of the agreement as opposed to license revenue being taken upfront. Over time, since we are providing much more than just the software and the update, the revenue is higher. The additional value we are providing is the hardware, including our Engineered Systems, the hosting and the expertise that only Oracle can provide, while leveraging the economies of scale that we have. So while customers are paying over time, they're using and paying for more Oracle products through cloud subscription. They are paying less in total because they too can benefit from our operating synergies. Net-net, the cloud operating business is attractive for both customers and for Oracle, but especially so given the integration of Oracle hardware, software and expertise.  For software, database continues to do very well, with Exadata, Exalytics and Business Intelligence software products all up more than 30%. Also strong was customer experience and/or CRM, both on-premise and SaaS, as well as our communications and project management verticals. The quarter was not dependent on any one large deal. Hardware system product revenue was $725 million, up 10% from last year. Obviously, we're pleased to have exceeded our guidance, but it's also nice to report growth. Engineered Systems grew more than 30%, and this spectacular growth is reflected not only in our hardware growth, but also in the very long list of customer wins we had against IBM. Engineered Systems now account for nearly 1/3 of all hardware product sales. Hardware gross margins are down about 2 points, because we are packing the newest systems with more memory without raising prices. Hardware support was $600 million, up 7% from last year, but down sequentially on normal -- our normal seasonal pattern. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income grew $188 million to $4.4 billion, up 6% over last year. And the operating margin was 47%, again. We believe we can invest for growth and make money, as we continue to see leverage in our business model. As I mentioned earlier, included in our nonoperating expense is a foreign currency remeasurement loss of $110 million related to our Venezuelan subsidiary. Were it not for this loss, EPS would have been $0.02 higher. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23%. The non-GAAP EPS was USD 0.68, growing 7% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 21%, and GAAP EPS for the quarter was USD 0.56, up 10% in constant currency. Free cash flow increased 11% to $14.4 billion over the last 4 quarters. We now have more than $37 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $13 billion. As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through earnings growth, stock repurchases and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 55.4 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased nearly 360 [ph] million shares, for a total of $10.7 billion and reducing -- and reduced our share count by 5%. We've also paid out more than $1.6 billion in dividends this fiscal year so far. Stock repurchases and dividends have totaled more than 85% of free cash flow over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. Now to the guidance. And if currency were to stay where it is today, then the impact of currency would be minimal. Of course, this could change quickly. New software license and cloud subscription revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to 10%. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to 10%. As a result, total revenue growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 7% in recorded dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.92 and $0.99 in constant dollars and in reported dollars. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.79 to $0.86. Now I want to remind you that last year we recognized an acquisition-related benefit of $269 million in connection with the Pillar Data Systems earnout. Excluding that benefit, GAAP EPS last Q4 would have been $0.74. This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. And of course, it may end up being different. Finally, my guidance does not take into account any additional nonoperating remeasurement losses as a result of exchange rate changes in Venezuela. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Safra. Oracle's Engineered Systems, including Exadata and SPARC SuperClusters, achieved a 30% constant currency growth rate in the quarter, while throughout the industry, traditional high-end server product lines are in steep decline. Our Engineered Systems business is growing rapidly for the same fundamental reason that our cloud applications business is growing rapidly. In both cases, customers want us to integrate the hardware and software and make it work together so they don't have to. As customers shift from -- to pre-integrated hardware and cloud computing in search of lower cost and more rapid implementations, Oracle is presented with new opportunities for leadership in a number of market categories. Five years ago, we delivered our first Exadata machine. In the next few months, we will deliver our 10,000th Engineered System. We believe Oracle's Engineered Systems are well on their way to replacing IBM pSeries as the leader in high-end computing.  Eight years ago, we started to rewrite all of our applications for the cloud. Now those, Fusion ERP, HCM and CRM cloud applications are competing effectively with SaaS product specialists like Salesforce and Workday. SAP has not yet begun to rewrite their ERP, HCM and CRM applications for the cloud. This gives us the opportunity to become the leader in cloud applications and replace SAP as the leader in the overall applications marketplace.  Strong sales of our cloud applications, Engineered Systems and 12c database demonstrate that Oracle is successfully exploiting the transition to the new generation of cloud computing and big data. Mark? Mark Hurd : Sure. Just a couple of comments. Solid results for us in Europe and North America. Latin America was very strong for us, while Asia Pac was mixed. Japan had a solid quarter. In cloud, this was our best quarter ever. Excellent bookings growth, more than 60%. The booking growth more than doubled the revenue growth, as we're just winning in the cloud across all portfolios. Contract sizes are growing. More than 65 7- or 8-figure deals, with many driven by Fusion HCM and sales cloud. We're seeing good growth from acquired cloud offerings and Fusion cloud growth was even better, with HCM, sales force automation, and ERP all up triple digits. In HCM, we added 250 customers or roughly 4x to 5x the number reported by Workday. We're seeing excellent growth across all solutions, core HR, payroll and Talent Cloud, double-digit growth in Taleo and triple-digit growth in Fusion HCM. In ERP, triple-digit growth with a bigger customer base than Workday. And we're growing faster, period. In customer experience, we added more than 260 new customers with strong growth across all our solutions : marketing, sales, service and social clouds. Our 60%-plus cloud booking growth is considerably higher than salesforce.com. Our Fusion products are now in release 8, with 1,000 new features in that release, with improvements. Coming with release 9 again this summer will be a similar number of new features. So release 8, 1,000 new features, release 9 this summer with roughly the same number of features. Along with responses in BlueKai soon, we continue to gain momentum on the product side, the customer side, and you will see this in our financial performance. At hardware, 10% overall growth. We grew in every single region. We're growing while our competitors are declining. We're taking share and we created a new category in high-end computing, Engineered Systems. As Larry mentioned, soon, we will have sold more than 10,000 Engineered Systems, and our 32% growth rate this quarter is against a meaningful comparison. In fact, Q3 last year was the all-time record, at that time, for systems sold. All major Engineered Systems products grew double-digits, SPARC SuperCluster saw triple-digit growth again this quarter. Both the T server and NAS storage saw good growth, and combined with Engineered Systems, these products now make up nearly 2/3 of all product revenue and grow roughly 20%. Database continues to show strong performance and we've not yet begun to see the coming benefits of 12c, which will help drive license growth. Middleware was very strong as well, with double-digit growth, led by excellent performance in data analytics. Cloud and Engineered Systems are 2 hypergrowth businesses inside the largest cash flow company, enterprise technology. And with that, we'll take whatever questions you've got. Ken Bond : Kelly? Can they, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Karl Keirstead : My question is for Mark. I guess the stronger momentum in Oracle's cloud software bookings and revenue growth really jumped out at me among the data points in the release. I know you gave some good color by product. Wondering if you might add a little bit more depth to help us understand what the broader drivers were. Was it Oracle doing a better job cross-selling on acquisitions? Was it the better functionality in Fusion version 7? Maybe any other factors that you think are worth highlighting. Mark Hurd : Yes. I mean -- and the good news I'd tell you is that we're just better at almost every part of this. I mean, I really don't know how much, how -- I think we felt we knew a lot a year ago or a couple of years ago. We just know a lot more now. We're better at -- we're better from a product perspective. I talked to you a little bit about what we've got in release 8. I mean, its 1,000 new features across the entire release. So big, big jump from a product perspective. We obviously have more feet on the street than we had. And certainly not just more feet on the street, but they've been in place longer. They've been now trained multiple times. And clearly, the perception in the market now has improved a better cloud position. I think last quarter, our 35% growth was good news, and clearly, this 60% growth is even better news. So I think that will help us as well. But it is broad based, Karl. So there's no one deal in here. There's no one product line that drove it. It's really across all of our product lines. As I mentioned, our Fusion products, our organic Fusion products, really had a fantastic quarter. Fusion HCM, Fusion sales automation and Fusion ERP, all 3, very strong. And it's really true across most regions as well. I don't have a region story that would be unique to the growth rate. It was fairly consistent across all regions. So I hope that's helpful. Operator : We'll move next to Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : The other area that stood out this quarter was hardware. And it fits -- it's a bit puzzling, because like if I look at the IBM numbers, they are declining quite significantly. You mentioned some of the drivers there already. Can you just kind of go a little bit deeper in there and also kind of how you see that kind of -- we've been waiting for a turnaround in hardware for a while? Now all the things that you're talking are coming through. Is that kind of something sustainable? And how do you see that playing out against the competition going forward? Lawrence Ellison : It's absolutely sustainable because Engineered Systems has been growing rapidly for a long time. We keep talking about it. Now the problem has -- a couple of years ago, was Engineered Systems was a small percentage of the total. Now Engineered Systems has grown up to be over 30% of the total. So there's very -- and soon, it's going to be 1/2 of the total. So that's very, very positive. The x86 commodity business, which used to be a big business when we bought Sun, has now shrunk to almost nothing. So our hardware business has gone through the transition where we've gotten out of the commodity storage business, we've gotten out of the commodity server business and replaced it with computing systems with a lot of our own intellectual property. There -- these businesses are growing rapidly and have very good margins. The reason we compete with IBM pSeries all the time head-to-head. And it's not uncommon for our systems to go -- to be several times faster than IBM. Let me give you one example, without saying who the competitor was. We replaced a system at -- in the world's largest cloud company. You guys can figure out who that is, world's largest cloud company. We delivered an Exadata system to them. They moved their application and got it live in 3 weeks and experienced 10x better performance at a fraction of the cost. This is not uncommon, when we install an Exadata machine or a SPARC SuperCluster, to have a very rapid implementation, deliver terrific performance at a dramatically lower overall cost because all of the complexity of integration is done by us, not by them. Mark Hurd : I'd add to your comment, you asked if it was sustainable. What I'd hope you'd be encouraged by was if you looked at our performance over the past several quarters, you've seen the reflection of our execution of our strategy in hardware support. You've seen hardware support continued to incline year-over-year and sequentially in terms of its performance. We grew now at 7% in Q3, which is a reflection of what Larry described. The fact that there is higher Oracle IP directly relates to our attach rates and eventually what turns into hardware support. So we now have our core businesses that have all been refreshed, and that's why I mentioned it. Our T-Systems, our Network Attached Storage or ZFS storage and our Engineered Systems are now almost 70% of our revenue. And all 3 of those are growing. And they are gaining share. So it's sustainable. I -- listen, I can't predict the macro, but I can predict we will continue to gain share. And to add to Larry's point, we just don't compete with the server vendors, we actually do a lot of other things than just compete with an IBM. I mean, we compete with EMC, frankly, when we get into those environments, because we radically change our customer's storage requirements. If our customers got a petabyte of storage, we can -- we know how to compress that data, with Exadata, to where they may only need to use 100 terabytes. And so this opportunity for us to now change the game and the way people think about how they use their infrastructure is, in my opinion, long term, a very sustainable strategy. And we've got differentiation, and that's what we're using. Operator : We'll hear now from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard : I had a 2-parter question for you. The first part is -- Larry, maybe talk a little bit about 12c and how you think it influences the hardware business next year. I know there's a -- the c can stand for cloud. But I'd be curious to get your take on the consolidation opportunity. And then as part of that, Safra made a quick comment about, I think, the renewal rates in your largest revenue line around license update and support. I'd love to get a little more color from there and how you're seeing 12c influence maintenance renewals and customers subscribing for support. Lawrence Ellison : Okay. I'll start with 12c in terms of its rate of uptake there. There are 2 key aspects of 12c, one that came out with the initial release, which is the multi-tenant feature, that's why it's called 12c for the cloud. It literally takes any application that you've got, any Oracle application you've got and makes it a multi-tenant application. Even companies like salesforce.com, who we're both a supplier and a -- to salesforce.com and a competitor with salesforce.com. I just recently got a note from Marc Benioff who's excited about bringing in Exadata and 12c and making that the basis of salesforce.com's cloud computing infrastructure, that they put their application on. So we're seeing adopters with very, very high standards in terms of having to supply millions of users reliably and cost effectively in the cloud, talk about moving their entire business to 12c and Exadata. That's just the tip of the iceberg, these hyperscale companies. We think virtually all of our customers are on their way to moving to 12c. Now some -- the early adopters, and then there's the rest of the guys who come down on -- down the road a bit later. But we think it's very attractive to our conventional customers and to hyperscale customers like Salesforce and others. I'll let -- the second piece is the in-memory piece. And we think that comes out this summer, comes out June, basically, June, July, August, something like that. And we think that's going to accelerate the adoption of 12c a lot. I think the performance gains there are so dramatic, we think people will -- even the people who like to wait a while for the new features and make -- maybe wait 6 months or 1 year before they try it out, there are people trying it out now -- hundreds of people trying it out now before it's even released. So we think this is a unique feature in terms of being able to have a huge payoff right away. And we think 12c will be the most rapidly adopted new release in many, many years for those 2 reasons, in-memory and multi-tenancy features. I'll let Safra comment about the renewal rates. Safra Catz : The renewal rates in database are always extremely strong. Folks make really long-term bets on our database. And because we just continue to provide the kind of innovation Larry's talking about, they are -- they always renew. I mean, it doesn't make sense not to. They get just so much enormous value. We continue to invest in the database, as Larry just mentioned. And as a result, renewal rates remain extremely, extremely high for the database, for all our products, to be frank. But database is always great. And it remained again that way this quarter and all year. Operator : We'll hear now from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Mark, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the comments you made about modern Middleware and data analytics. If you could help highlight your strategy for us, as well as if you can go over with us your competitive positioning. Mark Hurd : Sure. Yes, I mean, I think as I mentioned, the Middleware growth was strong. Underneath it, data analytics was very, very strong. Our growth in data analytics was -- in the tech part of data analytics was greater than 40%. So it's a big number now. We've done several things. One, we've seen a couple of shifts. Well first, we've added a lot of salespeople. Second, with the addition of our Endeca product line, more addition of Exalytics, we brought a lot of new technology to the space. We've also seen the competitors that we compete with shift. Traditionally, Oracle would see BusinessObjects and Cognos, and we actually see Tableau a lot more than we see those 2 at this point. And frankly, I think the integration work we've done within Endeca with Exalytics has paid off. The sales people we brought have paid off. And you see it show up in our results. There are other things in Middleware, Heather, that performed very well as well. But of materiality, that's probably the one to call out, which is data analytics. Lawrence Ellison : If I could just add one thing to that. With the release of Oracle in-memory database with 12c, our data analytics performance is going to increase by more than a factor of 10, some cases it's up more than a factor of 100. So we think this summer, with 12c, our data analytics business is going to take off. And of course, the intention is to sell a lot of those data analytics products in the cloud as opposed to on-premise. We will give customers a choice, but we'll offer that data analytics in the cloud, data analytics on premise. It's a big push for us. As Mark said, we see new competitors and an opportunity, and once again, to move to the front of the pack, to become the #1 data analytics company in the world. We think the new competitors are small and innovative. The old competitors have a lot of market share, and we think that market share is there for the taking as long as we can deliver high-quality technology, and that's what we'll do this summer. Mark Hurd : I should have mentioned that, too. Larry triggered that thought. We did announce some BI offerings in the cloud in the quarter. And so while not yet a material part of our revenue, an awful exciting offering to add to everything else that I and Larry mentioned, in terms of what we're bringing to the market. So we're excited about the space. We think there's opportunity for us to gain material share here. Operator : And Rick Sherlund with Nomura has our next question. Richard Sherlund : For Larry, can you update us on your progress in delivering your infrastructure stack in the cloud delivered as Platform as a Service? And are there any metrics you can give us on the traction that you're seeing there? Lawrence Ellison : Yes. Well, it's available on a limited basis right now. It's going to -- it's going to be available in both Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service. We've done all the pricing. The Infrastructure as a Service, the new price pretty much equivalent to Amazon, that really -- we think that's a commodity business and not in any way a bad -- in a bad sense. To play that game, you have to be -- we're going to have a compute service and a storage service. The storage service is already out, the compute service is going to be released in NAS shortly. And that will be very competitive, we think, with Amazon or anybody else in this business. The big differentiator for us, is along with Infrastructure as a Service, we have a very strong Platform as a Service offering coming out with our infrastructure. And that, of course, our 2 major platform plays. In Middleware, it's Java and the database, of course, it's Oracle. We think that gives us a unique pair of differentiators in the Infrastructure or Platform as a Service as taken together. And we think that's what our customers are going to do. Customers are going to come to us and buy our platform in the cloud, and buy infrastructure in the cloud, and move a lot of their existing applications off -- out of their own data centers into our cloud and they suddenly -- and they can do that without having to change their applications at all. So you can move their applications intact to our cloud and get all of the cost benefits, all of the efficiencies of scale, and they don't have to change the apps at all. We think that's a unique proposition that we offer our customers. And again, delivery time is all this summer. Operator : That will be from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Philip Winslow : Just want to build on that last question on the cloud. At OpenWorld, you guys talked about some metrics in terms of Fusion Applications in the cloud and the percentage of customers that are choosing cloud-based deployment of Fusion. Wondering if you could comment on just what you've been saying over the past few quarters there. And then also, just competitively, with Fusion in the cloud, what are you seeing out there, versus Workday, versus salesforce.com? And now that Fusion apps and Fusion apps in the cloud have been out there for, obviously, multiple quarters? Mark Hurd : Well, I'll take -- I think what you asked was the deployment of Fusion on-premise versus cloud. I think that's what you asked, and it's cloud, cloud, cloud. So I mean -- let me repeat it one more time, cloud, cloud, cloud is generally where Fusion is deployed. So we've had great success with it. We have great adoption. I think one of the things that's important -- I've seen some opinions. I won't credit a source, there are growth rates -- these exciting growth rates we're describing are coming from acquired properties as opposed to Fusion activities. And I want to make sure I'm clear, Phil, to refute that. Now, it doesn't mean -- I love acquired properties too, so I love them all. But I just want to make sure it's clear in the numbers that our Fusion products are growing very fast, faster than our overall growth rate. Now as it relates to your conversation about Workday, I tried to be as transparent as I could be. I got -- we've got the good fortune that they're transparent in most cases. Although I didn't get to see their customer list this quarter. In previous quarters, I hear their numbers, and we just have more new customers than they do. So it seems like a good metric to me, and we'll continue to see as we move going forward. But we're very comfortable competing with them. We felt very good about release 7. As I told you, we're now in release 8. We're very comfortable with that product. We've gotten our sales organization trained, and we're very comfortable competing with them, and of course, we're growing off a bigger base than them. With Salesforce, we do all of what Larry described, we compete with them. They're a customer at the same time. But in sales automation, were competing with them. We had very strong growth in Fusion sales auto in the quarter. And we're very comfortable with also our position in service cloud. Now that's right now acquired product. But we feel very good about both, but we've added now also the capability in marketing. So we bought a B2B marketing, a leading market automation company B2B in Eloqua. We supplemented that with the leading B2C company in Responsys. And we've now announced our intention to acquire BlueKai. So we believe we have a leadership position in marketing automation, leadership position in service automation. We're on the attack in sales automation, although clearly #2 to Salesforce at that point. But we believe the ecosystem we've now laid out is second to no one and the leading position in the marketplace. And I think it's showing up in our results. Operator : And that will be from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : First, Mark, any tweaks -- what are the things that are working successfully from a sales execution, go-to-market standpoint that you plan on emphasizing as you look at your business next year? And one for you Safra. Deferred revenues, down sequentially. Can you expand upon what might have contributed to that? Mark Hurd : I'll start and let Safra finish. I mean, we've obviously added a lot of capacity. We feel very good about the capacity we've added. We're very focused on those people being very productive. So what you see us investing a lot now is training. I probably mentioned training 3 times during this call. And so as our product set continues to get -- just continues to get better and better and better, and our salespeople now have more time in seat, training is a big deal. Now we will add people next year, as Larry talked about some exciting stuff we now have in platform and in infrastructure, so you'll see us add salespeople. And as we start to compete with again a new competitor, as it relates to platform and infrastructure, you'll see us do some supplemental adding in some other places, but a real keen focus, Kash, on productivity and making these people -- because you can imagine towards -- I guess, the size of our sales force, we have billions of dollars of revenue associated with the productivity gains we can make with the capacity we now have in this company from a sales perspective. Lawrence Ellison : If I can add one thing, I mean, just to scale it. As we roll out Platform as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service, we will have specialists selling nothing but Platform as a Service and nothing but Infrastructure as a Service. And we'll have someplace between 500 and 1,000 of them that we're going to add next fiscal year, starting with the class. This is around the world. So again, we go back to this thing that we have a new set of competitors, and we need specialist sales teams that are used to competing with Amazon, other specialist sales teams that are used to competing with IBM pSeries. It's a different sale to a different customer quite often. And so we have -- we're lining up against all of our new competitors and making sure we have sales capacity, as well as a competitive product. Safra Catz : Okay. Kash, the Q3 deferred revenues are following the exact same seasonal pattern that they always follow, including last year. So though they're sequentially down, that's really because Q4 is the peak for support renewals, et cetera. And it always goes down from Q2 to Q3 sequentially. I do want to remind you, of course, that it is up over $200 million over the same quarter last year. And that's really what you should be looking at. There's nothing going on as far as burning down or whatever. It's simply the same thing we have every Q3, where it's just as it burns down the big Q4 renewals, and it shows up right there in that line. That's it. Operator : That will come from Macquarie's Brad Zelnick. Brad Zelnick : Larry, big data is obviously a huge opportunity for Oracle, given your strength in database and traction with Engineered Systems. But from an apps perspective, can you talk about the opportunity to differentiate and drive growth by leveraging big data within the apps themselves? And do you see big data as more of its own category? Or a feature of next-generation applications? Lawrence Ellison : I think it's an underlying category. For example, there's no doubt that in-memory databases allow us to analyze large amounts of data more quickly. The fact that our Exadata machines have multiple tiers of caching. We now not only have DRAM and rotating storage, we have a lot of flash memory that we have to manage. It allows us to manage huge amounts of -- huge databases, multi-petabyte databases, and deliver very high performance. So no, we think of big data as an underlying set of technologies. For batch, if you want a big data batch process, the open-source product Hadoop is a very good product, if you're doing batch processing. If you're doing big data realtime processing, then we think the Oracle Database is by far and away, the best manage -- best technology for managing realtime processing of big data. We think this is a category where we're already the leader. And in fact, we're gaining on our competitors. If you look at all of our database competitors, both relational and non-relational databases, we're taking share both on the SQL area and we're growing a lot faster than the no-SQL area. So we're very comfortable that the improvements we've made to our database will allow us to prosper in the big data era. But again, we think of it -- and of course, any application then written on top of Oracle can exploit that data and that application becomes enriched. So our telecommunications billing system, which has to manage huge amounts of transactions with millions and millions of customers, be able to figure out whether to cut off a phone call when someone exceeds their bill and do all of that realtime, that's realtime processing of huge amounts of data by a phone company. Those are the kind of applications we provide that almost no one else can provide. Operator : And our final question today will be from Brad Reback with Stifel. Brad Reback : Safra, year-to-date, CapEx spending's down about 9%. I know in the past, you've been fairly adamant about not needing to really ramp up CapEx like a lot of your competitors have had. But given the really strong 60% bookings growth in cloud, has any of the thinking changed there? Safra Catz : Remember, we have enormous scale that we have not fully tapped. We've been making investments this whole time. And so there'll be -- we will continue to invest as we do now. We have obviously some visibility into our contracts that we've signed. But we have so much scale that we've been investing in for years, much of it still available. And so we're very comfortable where we're at right now. And we budgeted to it, and I don't think you'll be seeing any massive gapping just because our size is so large. And because we have our own hardware, we have our own systems, we can really thoroughly optimize for our applications with compression and all these other things that other folks just don't have the benefit and luxury that we have. Lawrence Ellison : Yes. We think, with our Engineered Systems and our data compression technology, we can deliver the same storage and the same compute capacity of our competitors for a lot less money. I mean, that's what we're selling -- we're selling this technology to our customers. That's our pitch. And we think we can build our own data centers just as efficiently. And that's why I don't think you'll ever see our CapEx approach our infrastructure competitors in the cloud. Safra Catz : No. No. Ken Bond : Thank you. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be reached in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. And we look forward to speaking with you. Thanks for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for closing. Operator : Again, that will conclude today's conference. We thank you, all, for joining us.",

Today's conference is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations, Oracle. Please go ahead, Mr. Bond. Ken Bond : Thank you, Chelsea. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's fourth quarter fiscal year 2014 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations Web site. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison; President and CFO, Safra Catz; and President, Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you from placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we will begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we've made some significant changes in our financial reporting and in our guidance to match our company's fundamental transition. We're now firmly into the transition to the cloud and we had previously disclosed our SaaS revenues in the 10-Ks and Qs. As the cloud revenue has become larger and more significant, we've gone ahead and disclosed some on the phase of our income statement. You may want to actually take out your income statement as we go through this, just so that you can follow me. What we previously reported as new software license and cloud subscription is now reported on two separate lines; new software license and another line for cloud Software-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service, SaaS and PaaS. At this time, the bulk of the revenue is Software-as-a-Service. Well, we expect Platform-as-a-Service to become very important as we do the full launch of Platform-as-a-Service this fall. Also, we previously reporting in service what we previously reported in services is now reported on two separate lines, cloud Infrastructure-as a-Service, IaaS and services. ,: So to start, I'm going to go over the Q4 results with our new detail, and then sum it up using our old disclosure for comparability to my previous guidance. Then I'll move on to the guidance for Q1. Generally, I'll be using non-GAAP measures in constant currency unless otherwise stated, but we'll point out GAAP numbers or U.S. dollar growth rate when the difference is important for comparability to last year. So using our new reporting, software and cloud revenue totaled a record 8.9 billion in Q4, growing 4%. New software license was 3.8 billion flat in U.S. dollars, declining 1% in constant currency, while new software license application revenues were up 6%. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were 327 million, growing 23%. Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service was 128 million, growing 13%. Software license updates and product support was 4.7 billion, growing 6% in constant currency and 7% in U.S. dollar. Software supported cash and renewal rate were strong as usual. To most closely compare these numbers to my guidance last earnings call, new software license and cloud SaaS and PaaS added together were 4.1 billion, up 1% in constant currency and 2% in U.S. dollars. With our new presentation, you can see that our on-premise based software business, which is new software license and software license update and product support has steadily grown over time to 8.5 billion this quarter. On top of that, we're building our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS cloud business, which grew nearly 20% and is already approaching a $2 billion run rate with 455 million in revenues this quarter. Hardware system revenue was nearly 1.5 billion growing 3% on a GAAP basis and 2% on a non-GAAP basis. Hardware products were 870 million, growing 3%, and hardware support was nearly 600 million, growing 2%.  Engineered systems had another good quarter with double-digit growth and represent 1/3rd of hardware product sales. In addition, we saw very strong growth in NAS storage in the quarter. Hardware product gross margins were 49%, down about two points from last year as we continue to put more value in our products without raising prices that's grabbing significant market share as all our major competitors shrink. Keep in mind that as we've increased hardware supported tax rates, hardware support margin has steadily improved and total hardware systems margin are unchanged from last year at 66%. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was 11.3 billion, up 3% from last year. Operating income was 5.8 billion, up 2% in constant currency, 3% in U.S. dollars, operating margin was 51%, same as last year. Unlike new software license transactions where we've recognized the revenue upfront, we've recognized the revenue from cloud software over time. In the short-term -- in the short run it delays revenue, but over the medium and long-term, we can expect more revenues as we do more of the work for our customers, while our customers can expect to pay substantially less than total with savings in the form of large reductions in the cost of implementing and running their own system. Over time, this contributes to our business model, particularly given our differentiated product in each of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.  As we get to the operating income line, I want to remind you that our GAAP operating income last year benefited from a $269 million reduction in the purchase price of an acquisition. This was entirely excluded from a non-GAAP purpose, but did show up in our GAAP -- in the GAAP numbers, which flow all the way through. In addition, both on GAAP and non-GAAP results include another foreign currency loss this quarter, this time for $102 million from the devaluation of our Venezuela net assets, compared to the dollar. This of course was not included in my guidance last quarter. Our net asset values in Venezuela have now devalued so much that it will not have any meaningful impact on our numbers going forward. Were it not for the Venezuela currency loss, EPS would have been $0.02 higher. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23%, the GAAP tax rate was 20.5. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.92, up from $0.87 last year. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.80, unchanged because last year our GAAP EPS was helped by the $0.04 reduction in the purchase price for the acquisition I just mentioned. I want to make sure I said that correctly, so you understand what happened. We got a $0.04 benefit last year in our GAAP EPS. This year we obviously don't have that benefit, and without that benefit it would have been $0.76, not $0.80. Operating cash flow increased 14.9 billion, and free cash flow grew to 14.3 billion over the last four quarters, both a record Q4 results. For the fiscal year 2014, total software and cloud revenues totaled a record 29.2 billion, growing 5% in constant currency. New software license was 9.4 billion, up 1%. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were 1.1 billion, growing 20% non-GAAP and 24% GAAP. Cloud infrastructure to service was 456 million, growing 1%. Software support was 18.2 billion, growing 7%. Hardware system revenue was nearly 5.4 billion, growing 2%. Of that, hardware products were 3 billion, down 1% for the year, and hardware support was 2.4 billion, growing 5% for the year. Services revenue was 3.7 billion, declining 4% as a result of the continuing move of our consulting business to shorter, faster, cheaper engagements for our customers as they move to the cloud. Total revenue grew 4% to a record $38.3 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margins for the full year was 47%. Earnings per share were $2.87, growing 8%. We've successfully grown the company's revenues and earnings through every transition whether it was many computer database to a complete suite of products, client server to Internet, commodity hardware to engineer systems and now on-premise to cloud. We're well on our way into our most recent transition. We have nearly 39 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is more than 14 billion. Deferred revenue now stands at 7.3 billion, up 2% from last year. In Q4, we repurchased more than 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion, and for the full year we repurchased nearly 281 million shares for a total of more than 9.8 billion, and the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend $0.12 per share between dividend and buyback. This year we returned nearly $12 billion or more than 80% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. Now, let's move to the guidance. Software and cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis which includes new software license, software support, SaaS and PaaS and IaaS is expected to grow 6% to 8% in U.S. dollars, 5% to 7% in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS, one of the line items on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 25% to 35% in U.S. dollars, 24% to 34% in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS on a GAAP basis is expected to grow 27% to 37% in U.S. dollars, 26% to 36% in constant currency. Next, another one at the line, cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 10% to 20% in U.S. dollars and 9% to 19% in constant currency. Hardware system revenues on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware systems products and hardware system support is expected to be between negative one and positive three or negative two to positive two in constant currency. Total revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 4% to 6% in U.S. dollars and 3% to 5% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.62 and $0.66 in U.S. dollars, $0.61 and $0.65 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.49 and $0.53 in U.S. dollars and $0.48 to $0.52 in constant currency. Now, this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 22% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. Of course it may end up being different and with that I'll turn it over to Larry. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. Okay. Oracle is focused, focused like a laser on one goal over the next few years, becoming the number one company in cloud computing\u2019s two most profitable segments, Software-as-a-Service, SaaS; and Platform-as-a-Service, PaaS. We expect to become number one for three reasons. First, we have the most complete and modern portfolio of SaaS products in the cloud. CRM sales, CRM service, marketing; in human capital management, we have core human resources, recruiting, talent management and payroll. In ERP we have accounting, procurement, supply chain, project management and more, the most comprehensive suite of products in the cloud by far. Second, all of those SaaS applications run on the world's most powerful platform in the cloud, the Oracle in-memory, multi-tenant database and the world's most popular programming language, Java. Third, we have dramatically expanded, specialized and lined up our sales forces to sell SaaS and PaaS subscriptions against the new generation of cloud software competitors and it\u2019s working. As we enter our new fiscal year, we are already number two in overall SaaS subscription sale. In FY '15 our plan is to grow our SaaS bookings over 50%. That will allow us to close in on the number one spot. We already have a huge lead over Workday in cloud ERP. We acquired 120 new cloud ERP customers in Q4 alone. In HCM, we are dominating Workday in Europe, and beating them in dozens of core HCM deals here in North America. Walking you through some of the details of highlights regarding our cloud wins and our great Q4 quarter in the cloud - let me just actually start with hardware a little bit. We\u2019re now roughly in the middle of transition in our hardware business, engineered systems strategy are now a significant part of our hardware, we\u2019ve grown hardware for the second quarter in a row. The change in mix away from commodity hardware to high-value engineered systems that transform the business to an integrated engineered systems business that brings with it extremely attractive annuity. Let me give you some facts about hardware. Engineered systems grew to record levels in Q4 while our competitors as Safra described are declining. We will ship our 10,000 engineered system in Q1; we\u2019re at the scale. Our hardware support margins are now approaching to 70% and this business is sticky. SPARC super cluster bookings grew triple digits, Exalytics, Big Data Appliance and Oracle Database Appliance all grew double-digits. Oracle has become the hardware company taking share, growing and doing it profitably. And as I said we are in the middle of the transition.  Now, I will talk about cloud. We are actually just starting this transition. We are the only company that has a whole suite of cloud applications. We are salesforce.com's primary competitor, Workday's primary competitor. And in the cloud we\u2019re many times the size of Workday, we\u2019re bigger than SAP, and we are going to pass Salesforce in cloud. Let me run a few facts about our cloud. As industry analysts build their waves and quadrants they name cloud leaders in specific cloud areas and Oracle today is the leader across more cloud solutions than Salesforce, Workday and SAP combined. Cloud bookings grew 37% last year. Q4 was the best ever for bookings. Fusion cloud bookings growth was three times the overall growth rate. Fusion HCM, ERP and sales force automation revenue all grew triple-digits. We added 870 cloud customers in Q4 including in HCM nearly 320 customers, with Fusion 110 HCM customers. If I take Workday's reported number of 75 new customers, we are adding customers at four to five times the pace of Workday. In customer experience we added 430 customers with 120 plus Fusion sales force automation wins. With BlueKai now on board along with Eloqua and Responsys, we are the clear number one in marketing automation with bookings growth of 200% this quarter. In sales force automation, bookings grew more than 80% and revenue was up triple-digits. As Larry referenced we added 120 ERP cloud customers in the quarter, all Fusion. In just Q4 we added more ERP cloud customers than Workday's total customer base for financials. More than 70 customers go lives just this quarter with hundreds already live. We are about to deliver release 9 of Fusion this summer. With Fusion we have built the most attractive cloud solution in the industry. We have acquired the most attractive SaaS companies in the industry. We are already number one or number two in every SaaS category and we won't stop until we are number one in every category. Just like hardware where we focused in engineered systems in software we are focused on the cloud. We are executing, we are winning and we are going to be number one. And with that I'll turn it over for questions. Ken Bond : Before we go to questions, Chelsea, I want to call out that we understand that some of you may have difficulty hearing parts of Mark's comments. So we will continue to move forward with the call and we will try to address some of Mark's comments into the Q&A. Chelsea, if you could start the Q&A please. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We will go first to Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill \u2013 UBS: Thanks, good afternoon. Safra, just on the revenue recognition changes, I'm just curious if you could walk through why now, and I think you stated in the press release that you're seeing a shift to ratable revenue recognition versus upfront, and if you could maybe just talk through how long you think that will take to accelerate the sales process to align to this new model? Safra Catz : Okay. So, thanks for the question. Let me clarify my quote. Really we have -- we always, always recognize SaaS and PaaS cloud subscriptions over time. That's always been the way we do it. New licenses, we recognize upfront. We haven't changed any of our actual accounting. What happened is that more of our software revenues are coming in as SaaS subscription, which we recognize over time versus new license deals, which we recognize upfront. So we haven't actually changed any of our accounting, it's just that with our focus on cloud and the fact that we are selling more cloud, we recognize that ratably over time as appropriate on that contract, and so a bigger piece of software and what we use to call software and cloud subscription -- new software license and cloud subscription, a larger piece of it is recognized over time. Did you understand me or should I try that again? Brent Thill \u2013 UBS: No, that's great. I guess just from a go-to-market maybe, Mark, just that process of putting that in place. How long does that take to get the sales aligned to that process? Mark Hurd : Well, -- can you hear me okay now? I just want to make sure; I'm at a different microphone. But when you hire a sales person who is selling cloud, they are really selling ARR, which is Annual Recurring Revenue. Roughly speaking, ARR is a third of a license. It's not precisely right. It differs a little bit by solution, but it roughly right. So therefore we take roughly three years for somebody to get to the same productivity of what you'd think of in the license model. So that's probably the timeframe you should be thinking of, and it's Larry. Larry Ellison : Okay. There are two things. There is the rate in which -- This is Larry. The rate at which we recognize revenue, which of course statutorily whenever we sell a cloud subscription whether it's Platform-as-a-Service, Software-as-a-Service, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, you always recognize the revenue ratably by month versus selling a license, you recognize it upfront. That's the accounting. The sales force is motivated by their commissions. And we\u2019ve made it commission neutral. In other words the sales force doesn't really care if they sell a license or they sell a subscription. They get paid the same amount in either case. So the sales force has -- there is no time at all required for the sales force to transition to this new model. They get paid equally for a cloud subscription or a license. So there is no transition time, it's zero. What is different and what Safra was explaining is that we as our cloud business gets bigger and I think everybody wants our cloud business to get bigger, I certainly do. We actually make more money when we sell a cloud subscription. We breakeven \u2013- a subscription is probably after three years as Mark pointed out. We get about the same amount of money from a subscription after three years as we get from a license. But these subscriptions last three, four or five, 10, 15, 20 years, so we make a lot more money on a subscription, but we recognize the money over time. So as we make the transition to selling more cloud software services as opposed to upfront licenses, we will recognize the cloud revenue over time. And that eventually, that cloud revenue eventually will grow to be even bigger than our license revenue, at least that\u2019s our plan and we will make more money doing that over time. But during the transition selling those cloud subscriptions what would have been a license is now recognized over time. So we are going to recognize the revenue more slowly. And that will somewhat affect the top line during the transition. That's okay, because in the long-term we make much, much more money. And we can effectively compete against this whole new array of competitors like Salesforce and Workday versus the previous generation of competitors like SAP and IBM. Brent Thill \u2013 UBS: Very clear, thank you. Operator : We will move on to Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank : Hi, thanks. This question is for Safra. Safra, you were able to keep the operating margins flat at about 47% despite among other things, a big 10% growth in sales and marketing in fiscal '14. I just wanted to ask you if you look forward to fiscal '15, do you think that pace of sales investments is likely to moderate and how comfortable are you with Oracle returning to year-over-year margin improvement in this fiscal '15? Thank you. Safra Catz : Well. I actually expect us to continue to improve over time to be honest with you. The one thing that could maybe impact our margins negatively is if we are like voraciously successful with cloud in the next year or so such that a lot of revenue comes in this cloud even though I don't recognize it upfront. And so we have expenses, some expenses related to that, that are not matched by our other improvements in productivity in the rest of the business. Generally, I think we've got it very, very well balanced and I actually expect our operating margins to improve because we made the big investments in the field already. In most regions the big, big investments have gone in over the past three years and I don't expect them to continue to increase at that rate. Mark, Larry, do you want to comment on? Mark Hurd : No. I think well, Safra says it right. We have gone through a sizable build up based on the strategy that we described to you previously. We are still adding. We are not adding at the pace that we were adding. So I think you should expect that Larry talked about pretty exciting opportunity for us in PaaS, the last sales people in the area of PaaS and there will be some complementary areas to the sales force that we've got. But you won't see the size of increases that you have seen over the past two or three years. Safra Catz : And this could be outweighed by revenue growth and this could be outweighed by revenue growth as well as profitability improvements in the rest of business. Mark Hurd : It is a reasonable to point to bring up because it sort of relates to that first question that came up that as our sales force now becomes more productive particularly when you see cloud booking. Larry gave you a very important statement about some thoughts about cloud bookings in 2015. As those numbers turned from bookings into revenue, that turns into a very attractive model as it relates to your first question about our operating margins. Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank : Got it, very helpful. Operator : Walter Pritchard with Citi has the next question. Walter Pritchard \u2013 Citi: Hi, Safra. I am wondering if you could talk about -- you gave guidance for license three months ago and you were towards to the low end of that. I wonder if you could help people understand what the source of the deviation was there. You did talk about you are seeing more demand show up in SaaS. Was the total sort of volume or demand you saw from the software perspective SaaS and traditional on-prem license in line of what you expect at the midpoint or is at the low end? Just trying to calibrate versus what you got given all of the moving pieces. Safra Catz : I think we are doing better in cloud than we expected that has become extremely, extremely popular and as a result we have rest of the growth in new license, we have a lot more in cloud but obviously I am not recognizing all that cloud upfront. In fact some of it especially stepped this actually booked in Q4 is not recognized at all and so it shows up later as you will see we are on projecting cloud growth in the high 20s to 30s in my guidance which is obviously a reflection of what's been going on. Cloud is doing extremely, extremely well and sometimes to the extent, you know the customer's alternative of course would have been to buy a license. And so that's what we are doing. I am actually thrilled that we are where we are in new license considering how much cloud growth we've got. Walter Pritchard \u2013 Citi: Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Kash Rangan with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Hi; one observation and a question. Observation is, you folks have done a remarkable job growing your earnings through this cloud transition and investing in the sales force which is something that many large cap tech and many large cap software companies are not able to -- that speaks to the power of the model. But my observation was that, Safra, I think you mentioned applications up about 6% or so which is commendable especially given the cloud transition. But any commentary on the technology side of the equation. Did that come in? How did that stay relative to your expectations and how should we think about the 12C cycle is the best of the 12C cycle yet to come especially with the multi-tenant option and the in memory option. Just trying to get a gauge whether there was any transition issue involved in the quarter on the tech side. Thank you very much. Safra Catz : Actually, it's a good question. I am going to get Mark and Larry talk about the new products in the database. But actually what went down in this quarter was a incredibly difficult compare in technology over Q4 last year actually. So I am actually very satisfied with where we came out on the tech side, happy with the app side and overall, extremely happy about what's going on in cloud for us. Mark Hurd : In the comparison we did a huge deal. Salesforce.com is entirely based on the Oracle database and Oracle technology and in Q4 last year of course they decided to standardize for the next 10 years, actually more precise in the next nine years on the Oracle database and we had a very large deal with Salesforce.com which created a bit of a difficult compare for us this year in the tech portion of our business. Safra Catz : With that our new products, Larry, just did launch last week. Larry Ellison : Yes. In term of 12C clearly the 12C is brand new. We think the multi-tenant option and the in memory option are very, very attractive especially to cloud companies. Most of the cloud companies are based on the Oracle database. We are, for example, this last Q4 we did a huge -- a big deal with SAP was success factors is based entirely on Oracle. So people are using the Oracle database in the cloud. So we had a nice deal with them. We had a nice deal a year ago, nice deal with Salesforce.com, obviously net suite at abate. But virtually everybody with the exception of Workdays based on the Oracle database. And we think these two features the in-memory feature and the multi-tenant feature really will allow us to deliver by far the best database experience in the cloud. And that should drive our database sales for the next few years. Mark Hurd : Okay. Just a little bit of color for you on the database number. First, database to Larry's point was a tough compare in the U.S., but in Europe we grew double-digits. So we had very strong database growth in Europe and so really was that one compare that Larry has described. Middleware had growth in the quarter as well which was good to see. And of course as Safra mentioned our apps business, I mean sort of enjoyed the benefit the other way, about 6% growth in apps and just to get context Kash, I want to emphasize that we had 6% growth in apps license. Sometimes we have on premise at the same time as we had the bookings growth that I referenced which was [37%] (ph) for the year in cloud bookings and it becomes so popular here. So we actually got both benefits in the quarter, so a strong quarter for us. Operator : Moving on to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo : Hey, good afternoon, guys. I actually have a couple of questions on just cloud and applications overall, maybe first Larry. Which product areas are you seeing best traction, fastest growth? And then the second part maybe Mark, can you maybe breakdown adoption by region because the U.S. look like it was a little slower compared to EMEA and I am trying to figure out if that's a reflection of perhaps greater cloud growth or adoption in the U.S. relative to Europe and on premise licensing. Thanks. Larry Ellison : I think we are recognized clearly as the leader in marketing and of course our marketing suite Gartner recognizes that as the leader in marketing in the cloud, we are the upper right hand company. And we had great growth in marketing and we are getting traction both in B to C, and B to B end marketing doing very, very well. HCM, kind of across board we are doing extremely well from core HCM to recruiting in talent. We've just been very, very successful in HCM. Its early days in ERP, however, Q4 was a great ERP, Fusion ERP. And this is all the stuff that we built. This is all Fusion, it took us eight, nine, ten years, whatever you want, although I didn't logged on to build on next generation cloud products, Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM, Fusion CRM. It was the top road. But we are beginning to get really serious traction especially in North America for ERP. Our HCM products are doing extremely well in North America. We were head-to-head against Workday. And we are running the table in EMEA and HCM. We really are the dominant supplier in the cloud in EMEA. In terms of the adoption rates, I mean obviously cloud is much slower to be adopted in Asia-Pac. I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark Hurd : I think, Jason, a couple of points. One, HCM, I think we are doing really well. I mean I know nobody loves it when I read all names, but to be very blunt, our wins in the quarter were significant, just a couple, Cox Enterprises, ITEN, Fair Isaac, National Instruments, Vivendi, Xerox, Fairmont Hotel, these are just a few of the quality brands we took down in HCM alone. So we had a strong HCM quarter. We were actually going up against a strongest HCM compare last year that we've seen, but it was very, very impressive. So I think we have a position in HCM, where we're battling out with Workday. We think we're winning a lot more than we're losing, and we're doing really well internationally, particularly in Europe as Larry described. Marketing, we won Kaiser, ITEN, Lexmark, Panasonic, Thomson Reuters, Time Warner Cable, Ricoh, I mean these are quality names that have adopted the Oracle marketing. And I could go on across all these areas. So as I described in my prepared comments that maybe you couldn't hear, when you look at these Gartner waves or Gartner Quadrant (indiscernible) and Forrester waves, we lead in more of these waves and quadrants than our three cloud competitors combined. So I really feel very good about where we are now. And your question about regions, I think you're taking the long conclusion out of Europe versus United States. Our U.S. cloud business has done very well. You don't see it reflected in the numbers quite as well, because of the conversation we had a couple of questions ago about the recognition of subscription revenue, but the bookings in the United States are quite strong. Our relative position in Europe maybe stronger, but the adoption is slower relative to what we've seen in the U.S. Europe has done fantastic. Let me take nothing away from Europe. But where you're really seeing them done a great job up is winning what's available in the European market, and they've done a great job in our traditional business at the same time. Operator : We'll now hear from Richard Sherlund with Nomura Securities. Richard Sherlund - Nomura: Thank you. I just want to follow-up on 12c. Larry, would you envision what the capabilities of 12c that your SaaS partners that use Oracle will re-architect their products to support multi-tenancy at the database level and take advantage in memory capabilities as well to advance the apps offered on top of 12c? Larry Ellison : Well, if you've already put multi-tenancy, let me answer your re-architecture question, what the 12c database does, the multi-tenant feature takes an existing application that doesn't have multi-tenancy build into it at the application layer and make those existing applications all multi-tenant. So there are a lot of companies that want to get to the cloud. I mean I'm going just take out of thin air Cerner, who really don't have multi-tenant products, but would like to get to the cloud. They'd be a perfect example of the company who runs on top or Oracle that would like to get to the cloud where the Oracle multi-tenant database gives them fast track to the cloud, and fast track of -- very fast big data analytics with our in-memory options. So those two things I think will be instrumental get us moving our huge ISD community for the cloud on top of our platform. We think that's a gigantic opportunity, and let me emphasize, Salesforce is really two businesses, Salesforce.com; they're leader in the cloud. They have two businesses. They have got there Salesforce automation business, which is most of their application business. And then they have got what they now call Salesforce 1, which is their platform business. Our platform business is made up of the Oracle database with multi-tenants, in-memory and the world's most popular programming language, Java. We have virtually every ISD runs on top of the Oracle database. Virtually all of these companies would like to be able to move their offerings to the cloud. We now enabled that. Our platform is just coming out this fall. This is a net new business for us going forward, moving all these ISDs into the cloud. We think this might be the biggest single -- in an opportunity-rich world as we're seeing our SaaS applications, the growth is accelerating. We're growing much faster. So this year, 50% bookings I mentioned before, we're seeing the demand for our SaaS applications accelerate absolutely. And having a broad portfolio gives us a lot of room to grow. PaaS is this new opportunity, where a bunch of companies are just chomping at the bit to get their businesses to the cloud. We can move that ISD community to cloud with 12c. We think that's a gigantic opportunity. And it's going to help us grow our Saas Paas business and make us number one in both categories. Richard Sherlund - Nomura: Is the in-memory piece as important as the multi-tenancy? Larry Ellison : Well, it's different pieces, right? I mean the multi-tenancy piece basically let you get to the cloud period with multi-tenancy. And the in-memory piece allows you to offer big data analytics. And what you're asking me, which is more important, big data analytics or multi-tenancy in the cloud, I think they're both crucial to modern computing. These are two of the biggest, biggest parts of modern computing. People spend a lot of time talking about the cloud and getting to the cloud, getting your business to the cloud and modernizing it. And big data analytics, I mean they're number one and number two in the conversation about technology these days in all of the meeting I've been. Operator : Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs has the next question. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thank you so much. As Oracle continues with its success in the cloud, over time -- I know you mentioned the revenue benefits over time, but I'm wondering how we think about the long-term operating margin profile of the company as you guys continue down the path of your success? And then also just a follow-up for Mark; knowing you had a tough comp in the U.S. with the Salesforce.com deal in the Americas, was there anything else impacting growth in the region, in the quarter and on the flipside, you had one of the best growth rates we've seen out of you guys in EMEA in quite some time, is there anything there that you can highlight? Safra Catz : Why don't you take the question first? And then I'll move in. Mark Hurd : In the U.S., no, everything roughly behaved as we expected. That's the issue on the comp. Europe, I've said this I know multiple times on these calls, they just executed marvelously. They've taken enormous amounts of market share. They have just done a great job, and it's across, Heather, really all aspects of our business. It's across our engineered systems business, our database business, our middleware business, our SaaS business. They were the first to add sales capacity. They had a sales capacity really three and a half years ago, and they've trained and assimilated that capacity, and that capacity has now got us in materially more deals. Simultaneously, we've been able to take some very strategic transactions as we did this quarter that are just part of that overall series of success as we've seen out of Europe. And I think as you know, Europe hasn't been the most robust economy over the course of that timeframe. So I think our team there has just executed marvelously. Safra Catz : Heather, on your margin question, as you can see in the numbers and they basically speak for themselves. We've been doing this buildup and investment all within our profitability envelope. You can look at our cash flow statements. You can see our capital investments. We're incredibly advantaged because we make virtually absolutely everything in the cloud that we need, whether it's the hardware, engineered system, the software, the operating system, the database, we have it all. And we have a business that is at such scale that we have enormous economies of scale. We can add customers at an extremely high profitability level, because we have so many customers generally. And additionally because we control literally so much of our own supply chain, so we can deliver these services and we already have the sales force, we have everything in place. And we are not even at scale in cloud. So imagine at scale what's going to happen here, and as these new bookings which in this heavy growth period actually start to rain back as revenue, we're extremely optimistic about our ability to grow cloud. And over time, as I said in my prepared remarks, in the short-term less revenue come in. In the long-term and medium-term, more revenue come in. And simultaneously, our customers spend and save an enormous amount of money themselves. So it's really a win/win as well for both of us. Mark Hurd : Let me just add \u2026 Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Larry Ellison : Let me just add one little piece, which is the two parts of the cloud business that we're focused on are SaaS, the applications and PaaS, the platform database and Java programming language. We think inherently those businesses are 40%-50% margin businesses. We think that's not the case in Infrastructure-as-a-Service business. We think that's a lower margin business, but we think we can run it profitably in association with our SaaS and PaaS businesses. Where we're really trying to grow the business, where we're determined to be number one is in SaaS and PaaS. We're in infrastructure of service as a convenience to our customers, who want to have one stop shopping and buy their applications platform and infrastructure at the same place. But we think collectively, those three businesses, as Safra said we're our supply chain. So we buy electricity in buildings; everything else we make. And we think we can deliver the cloud services without compromising our margins whatsoever. Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Operator : And our last question will come from Joel Fishbein with BMO Capital Markets. Joel Fishbein - BMO Capital Markets : Hi. Mark, I might have missed this, but I just wanted to get some more color on the integrated systems. It looks like the business was a little weaker than we have expected -- I'd love to get some color around that. I might have missed it on your opening comments. Mark Hurd : You mean engineered systems, correct, Joel? Joel Fishbein - BMO Capital Markets : Engineered systems, sorry, Mark. Mark Hurd : Yeah, strong quarter, best quarter we ever had. So, just to be clear, I think I said this in Q3 that Q3 was the best you we ever had except for this Q4 that we're going to have, that we've had, and we beat it in Q4. Now, in Q4 was that same deal that Larry described earlier as a comparison and as Safra mentioned, I think she said in her remarks, but also if she didn't, we have double-digit growth in engineered systems in the quarter. So it was a record for us and very strong. We couldn't grow hardware the way we did without engineered systems having a strong quarter. So we are also excited about that. Joel Fishbein - BMO Capital Markets : All right. Thanks a lot. Mark Hurd : Thanks, Joel. Operator : And Mr. Bond, I'll turn things back to you for closing or additional remarks. Ken Bond : Thank you, operator. Our apologies for the technical difficulty this afternoon, we understand that the webcast came through cleanly. A telephonic replay of the conference call will be available shortly. Dial-in information for that webcast replay can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speak with you soon. Thank you again for joining us. And with that, I'll turn it back to Chelsea for closing the call. Operator : Thank you, Mr. Bond. Again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you all for your participation.",

As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes.  I'd like to now turn the call over to Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ken Bond : Thank you, Victoria. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Oracle's first quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which include the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; CEO, Safra Catz; and CEO, Mark Hurd.  As a reminder today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.  And finally we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.  Before taking questions we will begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra A. Catz : Thanks Ken. I am going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2, then turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments. Those of you who have followed us for a while know that Q1 is a seasonally smaller quarter which can mean more volatility in our results and that's what we saw this quarter. Currency was a 1% tailwind to total revenues. Today my comments generally reflect constant dollar growth rates. Cloud revenue totaled $477 million, growing 29%. In that cloud, SaaS and PaaS were $339 million, up 31% from last year and up 4% sequentially. Cloud infrastructure as a service was $138 million up 25%. Q1 results in the cloud were better than expected and with us now three times bigger than Workday, now that's not enough for us, as our goal is to be bigger than Salesforce and faster growing than Workday while growing cash flow and improving our already high levels of profitability.  New software license was $1.4 billion, down 2% from last year and software updates and product support was a record $4.7 billion, up 6%. Software and cloud revenue totaled $6.6 billion in Q1 growing 6%. Customers have started to move from on-premise systems to the cloud but with so many on-premise customers and only 30% of our support-base in applications we haven't seen a reduction in software updates and product support renewal rates which continue at their usual high levels. However as the movement to the cloud grows we expect this transition will affect our revenue to the positive. These customers will essentially replace their software support payments with a cloud subscription which will mean substantially more revenues to Oracle. That is because not only will we be providing the most up to date software but we'll also be providing the hardware, the application management and complete operation. Of course we expect it as a customer pays more to Oracle this increase will be more than offset by a reduction in their cost of implementing and running their own systems. And because we control nearly all of our own supply chain and benefit from enormous economies of scale we expect most customers converting their premise based software support payments to cloud subscription will be immediately accretive to operating income as well. In the case of new or existing customers taking cloud subscriptions in lieu of buying new or additional software licenses there will be a short-term delay in revenue. But over the medium and long term we also expect more revenue and operating income as well as increased cash flow.  As for the details in this quarter, GAAP software and cloud results in the Americas grew 6% helped by a very strong performance from our North America application team and our global business unit. Thanks to the fantastic EMEA management team considering the geopolitical situation in Europe and Middle East, EMEA was up an astounding 7%. Asia-Pac grew 2%. Engineered systems continue to grow and were over a third of hardware product revenue over the last 12 months. However hardware revenue in total was down 8% as other servers and storage revenues especially tape declined. Hardware system product revenue was down 14% while hardware system support was down 2%. Consulting services, which I don't usually comment on because they're not as strategic to our business, also suffered from some execution issues in North America. Total revenue for the quarter was $8.6 billion, up 2% from last year. The quarter was not depended on any one large deal. Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, was 1% higher than last year and operating margin was 44.4% down just 22 basis points from last year because the sales shortfall in hardware in some hardware and consulting happened late in the quarter and did not allow us time to adjust our expense base in the quarter.  Free cash flow increased to a record $14.7 billion over the last four quarters to an all-time high of 6.5 -- and to an all-time high of $6.5 billion for the quarter, up 6% from Q1 last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, EPS for the quarter grew 4% in US dollars and to $0.63 on a non-GAAP basis.  The GAAP tax rate was 19.7% due to some one-time events and the mix of earnings. On a GAAP basis EPS for the quarter was $0.48 in US dollars, up 2%. At quarter end deferred revenue was at a record $8.9 billion, up 5% from last year and we had nearly $52 billion in cash and marketable securities.  Net of debt our cash position was $19 billion. So both of these balances are roughly $5 billion lower now that we've closed the MICROS transaction. This quarter we repurchased nearly 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months we've repurchased more than 5% of the shares outstanding a year ago and paid out more than $2.1 billion in dividend as nearly 75% of our cash flow was returned to shareholders. We recently increased our share buyback authorization by an additional $13 billion and we now have a total authorization of more than $15 billion available. The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. As I move to guidance I need to make some comments first regarding MICROS, which we closed a few days ago. Firstly we will not own it for the whole quarter. Secondly, and much more importantly, because our revenue recognition policies and our operating procedures are strict the contributions from MICROS will not be consistent with their historical run rate. For example I am only expecting about $14 million in on-premise new license revenue for the quarter from MICROS.  Also given recent currency movements we expect to see a currency headwind of 1% for cloud revenues, 2% for software and cloud revenue combined and 2% for both hardware and total revenue and that could very much change. So taking all that into account SaaS and PaaS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow between 40% to 45% in constant currency, 39% to 44% in US dollars. On a GAAP basis SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 39% to $0.44 and 44% in constant currency and 38% to 43% in US dollars. Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 40% to 44% in constant currency and 39% to 43% in U.S. dollars. Software and cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow 5% to 8% in constant currency, 3% to 6% in U.S. dollars. Hardware system revenues on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis which includes hardware system products and hardware system support is expected to be negative 8% to positive 2% in constant currency, negative 10% to 0% in U.S. dollars. Total revenue growth on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 2% to 6% in constant currency, 0% to 4% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.68 to $0.72 in constant currency, $0.66 and $0.70 in U.S. dollars. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.53 and $0.57 in constant currency and $0.51 and $0.55 in U.S. dollars. This guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 22.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 23%, of course it may end up being different. As you've seen in the last few minutes we announced that Larry was elected Executive Chairman and appointed Chief Technology Officer; Mark and I have been appointed CEO. Other than Mark and I reporting to the Board of Directors of which Larry will be Executive Chairman instead of to Larry directly no other reporting relationships will change at the company. In addition, I will no longer go by the CFO title. I will be the Principal Financial Officer for all regulatory purposes. We will not be hiring a CFO and my teams will continue to report to me. With that I will turn it over to Larry for his comments. Lawrence J. Ellison: Thank you, Safra. Next week at Oracle Open World we will be rolling out our new database cloud service with our new multi-tenant Database-as-a-Service offering. Our customers and ISVs can move any of their existing applications and databases to the Oracle Cloud with the push of a button.  With the push of a button your data is automatically compressed 10 to 1 and encrypted for secure and efficient transfer to the Cloud. With the push of a button your existing application automatically becomes a multi-tenant application and it's moved to the Oracle Cloud. No reprogramming is required.  Every single Oracle feature, even our latest high speed and memory processing is included in the Oracle Cloud Database Service. Hundreds of thousands of customers and ISVs have been waiting for exactly this. Database is our largest software business and database will be our largest cloud service business.  Mark, over to you. Mark Hurd : Yeah, listen before we take questions I thought I'd just give you seven or eight facts about our Cloud business in the core. First, bookings grew 54%, 3x last year\u2019s growth rate. Fusion bookings, ERP, HCM and SFA all grew triple digits. Two, revenue grew 32% USD, 2x last year\u2019s growth rate. Three, we got 500 new Cloud customers in the quarter. Four, 170 of them were HCM customers. Based on what I heard Workday report they got something like 25. We got 60 Fusion HCM new customers in the quarter. Four, in CX, we had 290 new customers, 90 Fusion SFA and almost 200 marketing new customers in the quarter. Five, ERP we added 90 new customers in Fusion ERP and a like number in our EPM cloud. And all I am taking about now is ERP cloud and EPM cloud.  Fusion overall had triple digit bookings growth, triple digit revenue growth. We added nearly 200 net new Fusion customers and had many tens of go lives. And while the transition of the cloud is in the early stages we are already at a run rate of nearly $2 billion. A couple of comments on hardware; we declined in SPARC in this quarter while we grew engineered systems double-digits. As Safra mentioned, engineered system now makes up a third of our hardware. While we're growing double digits our competitors are declining double digits. We shipped our 10,000th engineered system in Q1. Lifetime bookings in hardware alone for engineered systems now exceed $3 billion. Hardware support margins are now approaching 70% as a testimony to the change in our overall hardware mix and the stickiness of this business. With that I'll turn it over to you all for questions. Ken Bond : Victoria we'll go to the Q&A portion of the call please. Operator :  (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities. Richard Sherlund - Nomura Securities : Thank you. My question is for Larry. Larry, I wondered if you could address the issue of why the change in your role in the company and if you could clarify what the change might really be in terms of the working relationship and your responsibilities and daily activities in the business? Lawrence J. Ellison: Well, again Mark and Safra have done a spectacular job and I think they deserve the recognition of their new title. I'm going to continue to work with Thomas Kurian in software engineering and John Fowler in hardware engineering and Ed Screven and Mark and Safra as I have exactly in the past. So I'm going to continue doing what I have been doing over the last several years, they're going to continue what they've been doing over the last several years. So they deserve the recognition. They deserve the CEO title and I'm happy that our management team continues forward as a team. Ken Bond : Next question please? Operator :  Certainly, your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital : Hey, thank you. Mark and Safra congratulations to the new role. Question from me, it's like if you look about into the quarter, I mean obviously there were expectations out and you were slightly weaker on the one hand side I see the transformation, I see very strong deferred number and a very strong cash number, but then I see the hardware basis, how do you think about the quarter and how in Q4 you thought it was better than we thought about it. How do you think about Q1 now? Thank you. Mark Hurd : Well again I like Safra's quote, we're focused on two things, becoming number one in the cloud. That means growing our cloud business rapidly. So you're seeing an acceleration in our growth rate. We are forecasting that we grow our cloud, our SaaS and PaaS cloud business this coming quarter between 40% and 45%. So not only are we getting bigger in the cloud, our growth rate is going up. That's usually the opposite of what happens. So we are focused on becoming number one in the cloud being bigger than Salesforce in the cloud. And to do that we got to increase our growth rates and that's exactly what we're doing. Now while we're doing that, we have one other key focus to continue to deliver record levels of cash flow and that's exactly what we're doing. So we're getting bigger in the cloud, our growth rate is increasing in the cloud. Our cash flow is getting better we think it was a great Q1 and it's going to get even better in terms of our growth rates in the cloud.  I thought you might mention in your question that the Chairman last quarter referenced a 50% bookings growth rate and we delivered 54%. And I'll make a ball prediction we'll do it again. And that's exactly what we need again when we say we want to be number one in the cloud we have to deliver growth rates in that 50% range, and that's what we're shooting at and that's what we think we can achieve and by the way that isn't even including our new database service that we've rolled out this fall.  So that's going to add a multiplier to our growth rate in the cloud. So we're getting triple digit growth rates, I mean almost, in our Fusion applications, our internally developed organically developed Fusion applications and now with the database in the cloud we think that's going to continue to amplify that growth rate and increase the size of our business and make us number one. So if we can do that, we could have number one in the cloud, execute this transition we'll become the leader in the cloud and deliver record level cash flow. We think we're doing a pretty good job. Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital : Good, thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse : Hi, congrats guys on the growth that you're seeing in the cloud first in terms of just the revenue and obviously the upside and deferred and along those lines I wonder if you could comment or just provide some more details and what you are seeing in the cloud versus on-premise on the application side? Mark you noted some pretty nice wins in terms of Fusion, HCM just wonder if you could provide some more detail and kind of comparing the trend on premise in the cloud? Mark Hurd : Yeah, so I mean first my prediction there of 50% to Larry's point was a SaaS prediction as opposed to an overall cloud prediction which frankly could be higher. On apps in the quarter, we grew apps in the quarter on premise. We had double-digit growth in North America on apps. So we had good growth on apps, license, plus what we did in SaaS. So it was a really strong overall apps ecosystem quarter.  Let me add that I believe this number is correct. We added more ERP customers in the cloud. This past quarter than Workday has had in the life of their company. So how about that? So we are feeling really good about our ability to become the leader in ERP, we are the leader in mid-market and high end ERP in cloud, increase our leadership in marketing and defeated Workday in their core HCM business.  So I think that context is what you're looking for. We had a strong ERP license quarter in North America. We had a really strong SaaS ERP number in North America and to Larry's point if everything we've heard Workday talk about with their customers we got more in the quarter than they have in the lifetime of their company. Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse : That's what I'd like to hear. Congrats guys. Mark Hurd : Thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein with BMO Capital. Joel Fishbein - BMO Capital Markets : Hi guys, I would like to get some color on the 12c database cycle, specifically the drivers and when we should expect it to impact numbers? Lawrence J. Ellison: Well again there are two key portions of the 12c database. One is the fact that it takes your existing applications and make them multi-tenant by virtue of running on the 12c version of the database. And the second is it takes your existing applications and stores the data in memory and compress along our format therefore sometimes increase your analytic performance by a factor of 100. So those are the two big drivers on our 12c database but as you know it takes people a while to adopt these features. But I think you're going to see the database business, option business accelerate through the remainder of this fiscal year and will continue on through the next fiscal year. So I think we are going to get strong results for the rest of this fiscal year and again it will continue on for at least another 12 months after that. Safra A. Catz: Yes, database options actually was in double digits and it is exactly as Larry said it is accelerating, it has accelerated. It is actually double more than double. So doing very, very well and in-memory is one of those options. Joel Fishbein - BMO Capital Markets : Is it where you had expected to be at this point in the cycle? Lawrence J. Ellison: I'd say slightly ahead of where we normally expected to be. Now we were optimistic about these two features. So we thought the adoption rates would be faster than historically we've experienced with new versions of the database and that's exactly what's happening. But again the geometric progression, it's happening sooner but the big numbers are still one, two quarters away. Joel Fishbein - BMO Capital Markets : Great, thank you. Ken Bond : Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard \u2013 Wells Fargo : Hey good afternoon guys. First congratulations on the changes in the roles but I do have to say Larry we're going to miss you on these calls and it's been quite a run. Lawrence J. Ellison: You should be so lucky I am staying on the call. Jason Maynard \u2013 Wells Fargo : All right. Lawrence J. Ellison: So you're going to have to wait a little while longer before you get me off the call. I apologize to everyone for that. Jason Maynard \u2013 Wells Fargo : Good news then, good we can still bother you then with our questions. So with that I really had two questions, one maybe Mark you can tackle and then one for Safra but Mark on the hardware side, could you give us a little more color on let's say some of the shortfall that you saw and maybe break it down by geo or break it down by product line, just some color there? And then Safra Get down by GO or break it down by product line and just some color there. And then Safra, just on your deferred revenue growth again maybe talk a little bit about the composition of the upside you saw in deferred revenue and whether that was maintenance, multi-year contracts on the SaaS booking side, just in general what was driving that for the business? Thanks. Safra A. Catz : So let me take deferred revenue because I always get that question when it goes down and so I am going to take it when it goes up also. It's the same answer, I know that's really [though] but the reality is that deferred revenue is almost entirely, but not entirely but almost entirely impacted by support which as I mentioned remains extremely strong. Q1 as always an extremely -- it's seasonal it's everything I've ever told you in every one of the calls it's very, very strong.  Yes some of it is SaaS but really the bulk of it and the growth in the business remains very, very strong, renewals remain very, very strong. And as a result deferred revenue remains strong and growing. So it's a dominated because of the size of the business by the growth of increased support. Lawrence J. Ellison: On hardware by the way to Safra's point, applications support revenue growth just for that -- add that in. Just so you make sure everybody is clear who has an opinion on that. In hardware we had tape decline we had SAM decline, we have a new SAM release that will come out shortly Open World. We grew in what we think of as ZFS. So our NAS storage grew; engineered systems I mentioned grew double-digits. Now while I say SPARC declined within engineered systems, the SPARC super cluster actually had very strong growth. So we had strong growth in engineered or we had double-digit growth in engineered systems, strong growth within that was SPARC super cluster, ZFS, NAS storage growth, tape decline, SPARC declined, that's hardware. Ken Bond : Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Hi, thank you very much for taking my question. Just want to drill into the tech side of the business. It looks like we\u2019ve been waiting for the 12c product cycle. Can you talk about if the weakness in tech licenses in the quarter was due to transition effect as you get into 12c training or if there was any execution pockets that you ran into? And also I think you were pretty optimistic and you continue to be optimistic about the demand for multi-tenant and in memory. Could you compare that to how strong the RAC cycle was? Thank you. Mark Hurd : I'll take the first part, but I'd say on tech overall, I think tech overall was fine with the exception of one region which was North America. So if you looked at all the numbers Safra gave you I think good clarity on our options business which was strong even in North America but Core Tech, North America was weak virtually around the rest of the world that was fine. So we had good performance roughly what we expected in the quarter in what I would call Core Tech.  As far as the adoption rate, we're seeing in-memory and multi-tenant it's actually being adopted at a faster rate than RAC. And I think RAC is a good comparison because RAC is absolutely a strategic feature for transaction processing where in-memory is a strategic feature for [inaudible]. And it's just that RAC actually takes -- is a little more difficult to implement. So I would say the adoption was therefore somewhat impacted from customers trying it out and getting used to it and getting people trained and then they would -- it would pan out on a few critical -- mission critical applications. In-memory, it doesn't require a lot of training, as it literally is kind of push a button and it runs a lot faster. Therefore we're seeing somewhat of a faster adoption rate and I think you will see that in the next -- over the next several quarters. So should be at least as big as RAC and grow slight -- and have a slightly faster adoption rate. Lawrence J. Ellison: By the way Kash I should have taken the time to [inaudible] to our European team, Safra did that but I'll do it as well. In Core Tech in Europe we grew double-digits. So just to give you a context of the kind of performance we saw in Europe, it's truly outstanding. Mark Hurd : Let me add my voice to that as our Russian business kind of headed towards zero and they have all these other problems that you read about in the newspaper or on the web. And they still managed -- Lo\u00efc still managed to do a brilliant job over there and his team continues to execute very, very well in what we call difficult circumstances. So we are thrilled about the work he is doing for us. Kash Rangan - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Thank you everybody. Lawrence J. Ellison: Thank you. Ken Bond : Next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank : Yeah, hi, thanks. My question is back to the leadership changes and in particular I\u2019d love to learn a little bit more about how these changes might trickle down into the rest of the Oracle organization? Safra you touched a little bit on the CFO role and how I think you left a message that there\u2019s really no significant change. I wanted to ask Mark as you transition to your new role whether that would result in any change on the sales leadership and sales structure side as well? Mark Hurd : No. Safra A. Catz: Yeah, and Karl I just want to make sure we are very, very clear. There will actually be no changes, no significant changes right, just want to clarify, no changes whatsoever. Mark Hurd : And Karl I don't want to be short but it\u2019s just not in order -- and we were pretty [flat] in terms of the way we run the place and we want to keep it that way. So I want to stay closer to the action not get further away from the action. So to be direct the answer is no but I want to make sure you heard the rest of that. Karl Keirstead - Deutsche Bank : Got it, okay, that\u2019s very clear. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill - UBS: Good afternoon. Maybe for each of you just touched on the business model transition to subscription, how long you expect this to take, to roll through the model? Larry, I know even in the database side there is some interesting opportunities as database-as-a-service could impact the old school model. I am just curious how you look at this? And then for all of us on the line obviously you get to see the backlog number and you can look at the growth but we can\u2019t actually see in the physical backlog and at some point would you look to something like Salesforce where they give you a backlog number every quarter as a reporting metric going forward? Lawrence J. Ellison: Again the way I look at is we are going to be doing more for our customers, exactly what Safra said earlier, we are going to be doing more for our customers than we did before. So before we use to sell them software and they would have to provide their own datacenters and their own machines and their own labor and their own network to run all of that.  And now we are going to put a lot of that in our datacenter, we are going to buy the machines, we are going to provide both the skilled labor, whether you are buying the infrastructure-as-a-service, we will be maintaining the operating system and the virtual machine for you along with the hardware and storage, processing and storage. If you buy platform we we'll also be maintaining the Oracle database and Java, the world\u2019s most popular programming language and the world\u2019s most popular database at our platform. We're going to be doing more for you. And as we do more for you, you are going to pay us more but the customer is going to spend less so, it\u2019s a win-win. We get economies of scale, we get specialization of labor, we are very good at running Oracle databases, we are very good at managing Java virtual machines. We are pretty good at running datacenters and we are great at running all of these applications. Then that\u2019s the third level, if you buy our ERP and our planning application then again we are doing -- we are your datacenter, we are your hardware company, we are your networking company, we are your storage company, we are all of those things.  So the promise is for Oracle to be a much larger and much more profitable and much more critical supplier to our customers, a much more strategic supplier to our customers, especially when we go to the next level of application which are the vertical applications which -- where we, in financial services for banks, for telecom companies, for retailers, for hotels and restaurant chains, all of those things. It gives us an opportunity to give them a complete solution which is strategic to their business and has much higher value then selling technology components which what the industry has been doing historically. So we see this as a huge opportunity for Oracle Corporation to grow and expand our relevance into the next generation of computing. There our business will be more profitable and we think we have all the assets to do that. I mean it\u2019s very interesting that in ERP we overnight over one quarter sold more ERP systems in the cloud than Workday has done in the life of their company.  We have a lot of assets. One of the things we lead with ERP is budgeting and planning EPM in the cloud. Workday's answer to that is we don't have one of those. None of our competitors have one of those in the cloud. SAP, as far as I know, isn\u2019t moving anything to the Cloud other than Ariba and SuccessFactors, by the way which I am [not] going to point out run on Oracle, both of them run on Oracle, not HANA, run on Oracle.  So Oracle is one of most the popular database in the cloud. So every generation of computing, computing gets bigger. And this is our chance to get bigger to become more important. If we execute well and when Mark says he wants to stay close to the action, and when Safra says you got a laser light focus on two things, being number one in the cloud and delivering record levels of cash flow.  We are all focused on this unbelievable opportunity to be the one big company, the one big company with all the resources to make this transition to the cloud and become the leader in that next generation computing. It's an opportunity we are all focused on and we are not going to miss it. Ken Bond :  Thank you, Larry. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued early today. Please call the Investor Relations department if any follow-up questions in this call, we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today.  With that I will turn call back to Victoria for closing. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd like to now turn the call over to Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ken Bond : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Oracle's second quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. As a reminder today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and any other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions we will begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks Ken. I am going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3, and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. Clearly we are very pleased with our results as hardware and total revenue were both above my CD guidance while total software was up at the high end. Cloud grew 47% on premise software license and support grew 6%, hardware systems grew 4% and total revenue grew 7% in constant currency. The as-reported numbers were heavily impacted by the strengthening of the US dollar in comparison to other currencies. Total revenue saw a 4% currency headwind which was double to what it was at the time of my guidance. Software and Cloud as well as hardware system saw a growth rate affected by 3%. Currencies continue to move significantly. So my comments today are generally going to reflect constant dollar growth rates. Total Cloud revenue was 590 million growing 47% with Cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue of 364 million, up 41% from last year and more than double last year's growth. The cloud bookings from several quarters is now helping drive SaaS and PaaS revenue growth. When bookings turn into revenue, depends on many factors. But as I reviewed the numbers over the last few quarter one thing is clear, the acceleration in the business bodes very well for our future. Cloud infrastructure as a service revenue was 155 million, up 62% but due in part to prior year compares being low. Overall our Cloud results were better than expected as we are clearly growing faster than sales force and were more than three times the size of Workday. Our goal remains to be bigger and grow faster in the cloud in both companies while improving our already high level of profitability. Total software revenues were 7.3 billion up 8% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove nearly half of total company revenue at 4.8 billion, up 9% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing install base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $2 billion. Looking at GAAP software and Cloud results by region, the Americas grew 8% with North America database growing double digits and very strong Cloud growth, AMEA grew 9% with Cloud growth of more than 80% and Asia Pacific grew 7% powered by Japan. Overall the hardware business including hardware support grew 4% with hardware system product revenue of 717 million and hardware support revenue of 690 million. Our engineered systems saw solid growth with particular strength in both Exalogic and big data appliance as we continue to gain share. For the company total revenue for the quarter was 9.6 billion, up 7% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was 4.4 billion also up 7% from last year, and the operating margin was unchanged at 46%. Excluding MICROS, both hardware gross margin and operating margin expanded by more than 1% that we were able to maintain our industry leading operating margins with MICROS now part of the business while growing our Cloud business 47% is a testimony to the strength of our business model. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% that's higher than my guidance of 23% and EPS was $0.69 in US dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 23.5%, a point higher than my guidance and GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.56 in US dollars. The higher tax rate reduced EPS for both GAAP and non-GAAP by a cent. This was a result of revenue mix by region driven primarily by foreign currency impact and a couple of other small factors. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was down very slightly at 14.5 billion as we increased CapEx spending a little bit. Just so that you get a sense of the size here, CapEx spending over the last four quarters in about $150 million higher than that same four quarters the previous year. We now have nearly 45 billion in cash and marketable securities net of debt our cash position's approximately 12 billion. As we've said before we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividends. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies as the right valuations and both are critically important. This quarter we repurchased 52.8 million shares for a total of 2.1 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than 200 million shares for a total of 8.1 billion, paid out dividends of 2.1 billion for a total that is more than 70% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. Now to the guidance. As you can imagine we feel very good about our prospects and our performance. But I have to tell you I am always keeping an eye on the situation in the macro environment especially aboard. Additionally given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect revenue by more than 4% and EPS by $0.04 if rates stay as they did -- as they are just about now, but as we just don't know how much. I am going to provide constant currency guidance today. SaaS and PaaS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 30% to 34% in constant currency. On a GAAP basis SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 31% to 35%, Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 29% to 33%, software and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis including SaaS and PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow between 5% to 8%. Hardware system revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis which includes hardware system products and hardware system support is expected to be somewhere between negative 2 and positive 8 in constant currency. Total revenue growth on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 4% to 8%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.69 to $0.74, again all this in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.55 and $0.60. Now this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 23% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% but this too may end up being different especially as tax rate is very heavily impacted by the mix of earnings which is impacted by currency. With that I am going to turn this over to Larry for his comments. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Safra. As Oracle Cloud business gets bigger, our growth rate is going up. As our competitors' Cloud businesses get bigger, their growth rates are going down. This has big implication I'd like to explain. In Q2 we booked more than $170 million in new SaaS and PaaS annually recurring revenue or ARR. In other words, we sold over $170 million of new SaaS and PaaS annual subscriptions this past quarter. In Q4 of this fiscal year, we expect to sell more than $250 million of new annual SaaS and PaaS subscriptions. That means, during our next fiscal year we will sell well over $1 billion of new SaaS and PaaS annual subscriptions. What makes this particularly interesting is that next year Oracle will sell about the same total dollar amount of new SaaS and PaaS business as Cloud market leader salesforce.com. Stay tuned, it's going to be close. We are catching up to them and we are catching up very quickly. Mark, over to you. Mark Hurd : Thank you. Okay, let me just give you a couple of numbers and a few names and then we will go to your questions. SaaS and PaaS revenue as Safra mentioned grew 41% in CD. ERP EPM revenue grew more than 80%. CX revenue grew nearly 50%. I think that company Larry mentioned salesforce.com reported 28. CX marketing automation grew 200% in revenue but we are the clear number one. Bookings grew nearly 150%. I want to say one more time it was 150%. Fusion bookings, ERP, HCM and Sales Force Automation all grew triple digits. All pillars saw booking growth in excess of 50%. We added more than 860 SaaS customers with more than 230 that subscribed to more than 1 pillar when they bought a cloud subscription from us. Nearly 650 existing customers expanded their cloud services in the quarter. In HCM we added 230 new customers, in CX more than 460 new customers, in ERP EPM 250 new customers. In one quarter we added 2.5 times Workday's entire install base. Nearly 150 of the new ERP customers did not have any Oracle ERP before they bought Cloud subscription from Oracle in the quarter. Overall Fusion has triple-digits bookings growth, triple-digit revenue growth. We had over 125 go-lives in Q2. That's SaaS. In PaaS we had a breakout quarter. We had 150 brand new PaaS customers. As many of you know, we announced PaaS at Oracle OpenWorld, the end of September. Three quarters subscribed to multiple PaaS services, the PaaS opportunity is big given the size of our install base and you might argue is big or bigger than the SaaS opportunity. Let me read you a few names from the quarter. In HR, Fidelity National Financial, Pella, Siemens, Barnes & Noble, Baylor Healthcare System, DIRECTV, Honeywell, Johnson & Johnson, Kaiser, Nokia, Northup Grumman, Societe Generale, Skanska. In sales service clouds, FlowServe, 3M, Adidas, Equifax, DIRECTV, Fiat, Tellus, United Parcel Service, Visa, Yahoo, Big server, Super Cypress Semiconductor. In marketing cloud, Bloomberg, Equifax, Fiat, Honeywell, Ricoh, Siemens, Telefonica, Visa, Emerson, Kroger, Lego Systems. In ERP EPM cloud, Odebrecht in Brazil, HJ Heinz, InBev, Lafarge, Michael Frager, and I don't have more time to read more. These are like huge list of logos that we gained in the quarter. Couple other comments, premise software grew 6% in CD. I continue to expect this business to grow nicely while our cloud continues to maintain hyper growth. Moving quickly just to mention hardware. Engineered systems bookings grew double digits. Bookings for Exalogic, SuperCluster and big data appliance, (inaudible) point all grew more than 50%. And I just want to make sure for those of you who don't listen to additional hardware companies' calls, it is clear we are taking substantive market share in hardware. And wrapping up, our cloud revenues' already at a $2 billion rate and I said at the Financial Analyst meeting our SaaS pipeline is large. Since then it's gotten bigger. We outpaced our bookings growth planned for the first half of the year and set our sights on 100% bookings growth for Q3. With that we will take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura Securities. Richard Sherlund : Hey, thank you for taking the question, and good quarter. On the cloud side, I am curious as far as the new versus exiting customers, I think you got some metric there. Could you give us a sense of are you seeing a conversion from existing on-prem customers or is most of this new business that you are picking up? Mark Hurd : Well, first let's go through it by pillar because I think that's the way you have to do it. In marketing everything is really new. We don't have a market install base. So when we give you those numbers, Rick, there really everything coming is a net new logo. Now it may be in a company that's got Oracle product but it's all net new. Most of our sales Cloud is net new. There is some Siebel conversion but as I mentioned at the Financial Analyst meeting, our Siebel install base, when you look at the sport numbers, is fairly stable. So we have a lot of net-net new even in if you will sales Cloud. We have a mix in HR both conversion and net new. And I think the important thing you saw this quarter as we talked before Rick, I think it's not just the fact that our strategy isn't the just best of breed in each of these apps, but also to have a suite of capability, and that's why I wanted to mention the multi-pillar deals that occurred in Q2 because we have customers now that are not just buying in ERP from us but they are buying ERP and HR. They are buying sales Cloud and marketing. And we also get the opportunities to go back into that install base once we've got one app, and sell a second app, a third app, a fourth app. And so it was an exiting quarter across a number of those metrics. Lawrence Ellison : Rick just for me to add one thing. As Mark said you have to take a pillar by pillar, you also have to take it layer by layer in the cloud. So -- where a lot of our SaaS business are brand new logos. People who've never done business with Oracle before you would expect that in PaaS it's virtually all our install base. But the reason being almost every moderate size company in the world is already an Oracle user. So the PaaS we are selling at this install base as Mark said SaaS is a bit of a mix depending on pillar. Richard Sherlund : Yes, and Larry you are seeing customers pivoting now to PaaS and infrastructure as a service, if you could maybe spend a moment on that. Lawrence Ellison : Again, I think, we are pushing very hard as PaaS as opposed to infrastructure as a service. I mean that's where our huge differentiation is, that's where we give you so much more automation in terms of database tuning and installation and backup and recovery and logging and security. So our big push is in the PaaS. We are in infrastructure as a service which is a low cost commodity business where we have the same pricing as Amazon and Google and the rest. We are in that because when our customers come, as Mark said earlier, they buy one pillar and go buy another. I can talk about layers in the Cloud, will they will buy a few SaaS applications, they will buy some PaaS and they will buy some infrastructure as a service as they want to have a unified security model and a vast network to interconnect all of these pieces. Richard Sherlund : Thank you. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you Rick. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard : Hey, good afternoon guys. I have two questions. One I want to follow-up on the Cloud piece and then I had a question on the database. On the cloud piece Larry, you talked about a billion dollars in bookings. I just want to make sure then I am reading this correctly. That's an incremental one billion\u2026 Lawrence Ellison : Yes, Jason, on the -- that's another business that we will have sold when you annualize. This is not total contract value. This is in terms of annual subscriptions rates. We will sell next fiscal year well in excess -- we expect to sell well in excess of $1 billion of new annual subscriptions. Jason Maynard : And that's on top\u2026 Lawrence Ellison : Which is about what Sales Force will be selling in their next fiscal year. I think they are 1.1 something like that best as we can estimate. And we think we have a good chance of passing them. I don't know, we could pass them or catch them or -- but it's going to be very close. We are in that ballpark. So we are selling new business at the same rate as the market leader next year which I think -- we are expecting this hyper growth. Sales Force is slowing down, we are speeding up. They are only twice as big as us. Their round numbers are 4 billion, we are 2 billion. But we are growing a lot faster, and we have a lot more products, and we have a large install base to see into. So we think again I said -- announced, just words. We said -- we think we can become number one in the Cloud. We think we will be number one in the Cloud, and we will be number one in the Cloud very quickly. Mark Hurd : And Jason, just to add to your question, I mean most of -- all of our comments that Larry made, then I made in that effort, we are all talking about ARR, not TCV. Jason Maynard : Right. Mark Hurd : So there's not a multiplier on -- or average contract value is up longer than annual. Jason Maynard : Right. Mark Hurd : But we are talking in comparisons of ARR. IBM will announce a $1 billion deal over 10 years. Jason Maynard : Right. Mark Hurd : That $1 billion deal to us would be $100 million. If it was a 10-year deal, and it's evenly distributed, we would count that as $100 million of ARR. Jason Maynard : Right. Mark Hurd : 100 million over one year. We annualize all of this stuff, how much of revenue once they are installed and running, and that there's a delay between when we book something and when we start collecting revenue because we don't collect revenue till the users are up and running and it's implemented. Okay, so there is that delay. But once they are up and running, it's an annualized number we are giving you, not a total contract value number we are giving you. Jason Maynard : Right, I got that part. But I also want to make sure I am clear. This is incremental on top of your current $2 billion plus run rate? Mark Hurd : Of course. And it should be a lot more than 2 billion by the way because that's next fiscal year. So we are not going to end this fiscal year still will 2 billion. That will grow. You have bookings that have been booked that have yet to be provisioned. Therefore you will have a bigger base on which those bookings will go. At the same time the bookings we get in the future will take time to provision as they go forward. So it's a layered model as you build up on the revenue Jason. Jason Maynard : I want to ask one thing on the database business. Larry, lot of customers in the past, they have been conditioned to wait for R2 of the database to come up. This time around you guys made a major release this past summer with the N memory option. I would be curious to get your take on what you are seeing in terms of customer adoption, are we starting to see folks, hey we are going to move to this incremental dot release that came out, I think it was June-July time frame. Or some folks still waiting for R2 and what's the advice to the guidance from Oracle in terms of when customers should migrate to 12C? Thank you. Lawrence Ellison : Okay, so there are two major pieces of our new database release, once as you mention is the memory option. But that's not the only driving factor where people are operating their database version. The other is metal-Tennessee, the multi-tenant option which is appropriate for the Cloud that allows them to again convert all of your existing Oracle applications and make them multi-tenant applications while preserving security and reliability, a better way than do multi-tenancy at the application layer. Anyway, we think those two features in concert are driving -- will drive a much more rapid adoption, the Oracle database over the next couple of years. So we think our database business is going to have a very strong 24 months coming up. Safra Catz : And Jason the options did very-very well in the quarter. So there's no question customers are extremely interested and are buying the options. Jason Maynard : Right, great. Thank you guys. Appreciate the answers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Kash Rangan : Hi, happy holidays and good news from Oracle to hear that. Can you talk about the net new cloud bookings and what exactly is driving that? If you can give us color by product, is it HCM or serum, or to Larry's point, the layer. Is it the PaaS or the SaaS layer or geographies? And in particular, Larry, if you could drill into the PaaS layer and help us understand is it a net new market or could it come at the expense of the traditional database business, which maybe gets cannibalized or maybe not? Just wanted to get your thoughts on it. Thank you. Lawrence Ellison : Let me -- Mark will give you a more detailed answer, but my answer is yes. It's all of the above. One other thing, we have such a broad -- if you look at our product line versus our competitors, we are Salesforce's only real competitor in sales automation. We are the leader in marketing automation. We are fighting hard to be the leader in service automation where our competitor is salesforce.com. We are Workday's only real competitor in HCM, and we think we have passed them in HCM. But you can make an argument we are both fighting our new CM. but we are killing Workday in ERP. If you conclude ERP and EPM together, it's planning, budgeting, performance management and their graphic ERP, all of that, we sold 2.5 times more customers this past quarter than they have done in the life of their company. We are the clear leader in mid-range and high end ERP with no competition from Workday. They are just not there or when they are there they are losing every time. So we are very strong in HCM, we are very strong in ERP, we are very strong -- we are the leader in ERP, we are the leader in marketing, we are the leader in EPM, we are contending for leadership in service automation and in HCM and we they guys in second place behind Salesforce in Salesforce Automation. But every place else except for that one segment, we are the leader or fighting to be the leader. So we have incredible breadth of SaaS products. Now our SaaS products are built on top of Java and the Oracle database, the platform, and companies want to make extensions to the applications. They want to link the applications to existing applications, and so on. Using our platform, makes a lot more sense than using a proprietary platform from salesforce.com. We don't think it's a fair fight. But wait, salesforce.com uses our platform to build their applications. They just can't sell our platform as a part of their service offering to their customers. So they have not license to do so. We can sell our platform, we do sell our platform. So we sell the same platform that we build on to our customers. So we've seen a huge amount of interest. But from our SaaS customers using our platform and also there's huge install base we have in the database business. Interested moving test and development and certain aspects of their database work to the Cloud, not everything, but a part of it, a bit of hybrid, and we are seeing these customers now experimenting, they're at the experiment level. But the potential for this as Mark said is probably bigger than our SaaS business and I think we are going to be by far the leading SaaS company in the Cloud. Look at our product portfolio. Kash, who wins in all of these battles? The suite vendors always beat the point solution guys. It's happened in every generation of computing where the end user, the customer, doesn't want to be the integrator of 30 separate applications from 30 separate vendors. No different now, just on the Cloud now. Same problem, they don't want to integrate a lot of different stuff. We have all the stuff pre-integrated. We think we are in a great position, we are seeing hyper growth at SaaS, we are seeing hyper growth in PaaS, we are getting bigger and our growth rates are getting higher. That's the -- unlike anyone else in the Cloud business. Kash Rangan : Thanks, and happy holidays. Lawrence Ellison : Yes, listen, add to it the products are more mature. We are on release 9 of our SaaS products. We only had -- not only our products' more mature, we have more of them. Our suite is broader. We've added sales capacity before 2.5 years ago. So realigning the sales force, adding capacity, they are trained, they are getting more training and we have references. And when you add the familiarity now of the SI community to it, you just have a lot of factors. There's no one of these factors in isolation, it's the culmination of a lot of work over a lot of period done. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : And you next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Great, thank you. Mark, I was wondering if you could share with us, I mean, your performance this quarter, given what's going on with currency was definitely better than I think people were expecting on a constant currency basis, even. And I'm wondering how much of that due, do you think, maybe the US environment, a deal-closing environment getting a little bit better from a macro perspective? And how much of it is due to sales force efficiency improvement? Mark Hurd : So you are saying macro versus us? Heather Bellini : No, macro in the US, right, seems to be doing better. So how much of it is due to kind of -- is your sales force productivity improving, and that's what's driving kind of the confidence and the guidance for next quarter, and your results on a constant currency basis this quarter? Because I think versus what everyone was thinking, things look a little bit -- things are looking better. Mark Hurd : Well I don't think anything changed from what we had been seeing for a while. The only difference is we saw it in pipeline, we saw it in proposal, and now it's turned into actual numbers and performance. So I don't think this is an event. I think this is a set of activities that have occurred over a long period of time, as I tried to reference in my previous question. I would not take some short-term improvement in the US macro and turn that into -- that's whey Oracle has great cloud bookings in Q2. I think our performance was driven by exactly the phenomena that I described. Better -- great products, more mature products, better references, lots of capacity in our sales force that's better trained that's out in the market winning deals. That's what I think drove it. Lawrence Ellison : I would like to second what Mark said, is we're just further up the learning curve and everything. Our sales management team terrific. We realigned our sales force against our secular competitors. So we have an HCM sales force that goes up against Workday. We have a sales automation sales force that goes up against salesforce.com and we have a service automation sales force that goes up -- but they are different -- it goes up against salesforce.com. We have a marketing automation sales force, we have an ERP sales force, we have an EPM sales force. We have all of these specialized sales forces and we created those, actually Mark created those several years ago, and we have been hiring, staffing, and they are much more mature. We started working on some of these products. Lot of these products are -- we built them internally. We started about 10 years ago -- after 10 years of development, the Fusion applications, again Mark said we are on release 9, and they are getting really good, the user interface is getting good, we are getting -- we have a lot of good customer feedback again over a period of years. We have improved the UIs, we have improved that multi-national capability. There -- we have improved security in the Cloud, we are the leader -- I think we are the leader in application security in the Cloud. So it's just walking up the learning curve, and at some point it becomes visible to everybody. Now I think we've been -- a few quarters ago talked about the size of the pipeline, look pretty good, they are kind of stunning. But I know the next thing is it turns into bookings, the next thing it turns into revenue, the next thing is we have more revenue than anyone else in the Cloud, and I think that's the next shoe that's going to drop. Heather Bellini : Great, thank you. Lawrence Ellison : Thanks Heather. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies & Company. John DiFucci : Thanks. I have a question for Safra. Safra, as you said CapEx has creeped up a little bit, it's up 26% on a trailing 12-month basis or about 150 million. Non-GAAP operating margins have really helped steady as has free cash flow. But as you transition to more Cloud based business, should we expect free cash flow to trail off a bit even if it's just temporarily? Safra Catz : It's all so tiny -- these amounts are so small in the scheme of what's going on. I mean -- I think it's kind of unusual that I would even call out a $150 million increase year-over-year on capital expenditure but since you guys aren't even used to it I figure let me call it out as small as it is. Obviously in the launch for PaaS and the volumes that we are expecting, we made our investments. And as we expand, we will continue, but these are really tiny numbers and are totally dwarfed by our 14 billion plus in free cash flow. I mean it's kind of -- I am not sure other companies would've even mentioned it, and you are probably asking me because other companies make these enormous announcements of spending billions and billions and you have to remember, I mentioned it at Financial Analysts Day, we control almost our entire supply chain. You see, we literally -- I mean we are very close to starting with sand, and then we have computers. I mean we make almost everything, and as a result we get everything at the best possible prices and economies of scale. We are already a very large company, so we already had huge investments over the years, and so you have a lot of capacity and again -- so I would not fret on this really small number because I am not planning on making some announcement that we are going to spend billions because we've already spent and it's just showing up little teeny bitties at a time. John DiFucci : Okay, thanks, that's helpful. If I could, just a quick sort of tactical follow-up and it's regards to guidance. And we can go through our own calyx of foreign exchange effects to get a reported number relative to the constant currency guidance, but generally what's the delta in growth for the top line between constant currency and reported numbers that you have? Safra Catz : In this past quarter that we just had? John DiFucci : No, actually I'm talking about guidance, yes. Safra Catz : No I didn't give -- listen, the rates right now compared to last year depending on which line item because it depends for us geographic distribution and all of those things. It's over 4%, in some areas it approaches 5%. I mean it's -- the number of currencies really collapsed in comparison to the dollar. So if that's what you are asking me, I think I am answering, if things stayed as they are today, it is over 4% of the impact in many of the big numbers -- of the numbers you guys follow. John DiFucci : Okay, great, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. Safra, just on operating margins, there's been a lot of focus, if you can continue to drive steady operating margin improvement despite this transition in the cloud. I think you were clear to John that the investments are already in. But as you look at kind of the next level of operational improvement, where do you see the biggest levers? And I guess as you transition in the Cloud, as more of the business gets there, is this inherently a more profitable business from your perspective, as you get to that side? Safra Catz : Yes. I mean there's no question. We have done the analysis and I think I shared at least some of it with you all during Financial Analyst Day, but there is no question that at scale we continue to improve our margins dramatically taking advantage of both our economies of scale and our controls, almost our entire supply chain and really our intense automation which really ultimately results in our being very-very price competitive and allowing our customers to spend much-much less all in than they ever did and yet we get a much more significant percentage of their wallet share. So we expect as we continue to go -- I am very pleased with where margins are laid out this quarter, and as we get to volume, I actually think we are going to do better -- continue to do better. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Philip Winslow : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. And I'd just like to echo the congratulations for this quarter. Most people have touched on a lot of the other lines of businesses so far, but I want to ask a question about hardware. You guys exceeded your guidance this quarter and guiding for growth year-over-year again next quarter. Just give us a sense for what you're seeing in that hardware line. And we finally hitting that point that you all have talked about that the stuff that you're not focused on is getting small enough and declining less that the growth areas are starting to show through, just how we should think about that would be great? Mark Hurd : Well, I think you should think about it that we are just winning. I mean that would be the overriding thing I would take away. So you look at some of the markets we are in particularly in computers that are scaled computers, the $20,000, $25,000 and up category that you typically see from most of the research firms. We are gaining startling amounts of share. And you are talking about growth rate, gains of share that are 7, 8, 9, 10 points of share gain and if you are going to ask what the drivers are underneath it, they're what we've been talking about before. We had double-digit bookings growth in engineered systems as I described a few minutes earlier. Safra and I both mentioned a couple of products and we've had very good performance out of what's called the Oracle SuperCluster, The SPARC SuperCluster has had significant growth. We've had very good growth and a product we don't talk about much called the Oracle Database Appliance. It's had significant growth for us. And so that this whole strategy of lining hardware and software to gather is what customers want. I can make an argument to you; it's the same market trend you see in the cloud. We just do more work for the customer. We integrate the products for the customer, the customer doesn't have to do it. We optimize the software for the solution and it's delivered us strong growth. And so when you look across really every line for us we had very good performance, by the way, I should add, in storage. Storage, our network attached product, again now it's a bigger base, had very strong growth in the quarter as well. So we're quite pleased with the performance we have seen in most of our product categories across most of our geographies particularly in terms of share gains. Philip Winslow : Great. Thanks guys, and congratulations again. Mark Hurd : Thank you. Safra Catz : Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Karl Keirstead : Thank you for fitting me in. I've got a question about two growth metrics that stood out to me that exceeded my expectations, and I'd love some color. The first, and maybe this is directed to Mark. Mark, it felt like North American database in the prior few quarters ran a little bit less than expectations. And yet Safra mentioned in her comments that North American database sales were back to double-digits. And I'd love to understand what drove that. It doesn't feel like there's a big broader demand improvement, so I'd love to know how you pulled that off? It's impressive. And then for Safra, you put up 9% software support revenue growth in constant currency. That's actually the best number you've put up in a little while, and I'd love a little color on that? Thank you. Mark Hurd : Well I think on the database question North America, Larry answered that a bit earlier talking about 12c. I mean we are into a new release. We have talked about the timeframes it would come on board. You saw a good performance in North America, frankly when you looked at database overall in CD, we grew like 5, 6 points -- I will say 6 in CD. And so again my guess would be we're gaining share. Again as you look at database overall, I know you mentioned the metric you described about database, but as I tried to go through at Financial Analyst meeting, when you look at the CAGR on a three-year basis, it is a very strong upper single digit CAGR in database. So while you talk about one quarter or another. This is not new phenomena that you see this kind of performance in database and that with 12c. Our pipeline has grown in database and I think it's reflected in the numbers that you saw in the quarter. Karl Keirstead : Thanks, and Safra, yes. Safra Catz : Yes, sure. I am actually looking at all the numbers and the contract base and it's been going up -- I mean it jumps around, but I have other quarters where it's very close. And remember we are selling in extremely large amount, cancellation rates are very low. Attach rates are extremely high. And all of that added together just ends up with a good number. Karl Keirstead : Right. Okay. Thanks a lot. Mark Hurd : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bond for his closing remarks. Ken Bond - IR: Thank you, operator. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department if any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you again. Thank you for joining us today. With that we will close the call. Operator : Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Kirk Materne - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker) Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings Call. As reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations. Kenneth Bond - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. As reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra. Safra Ada Catz - Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review guidance for Q4 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As you can imagine, we are very, very pleased with our results, as software and cloud, cloud SaaS and PaaS, total hardware, total revenue and earnings per share were all above the midpoint of my CD [Constant Dollar] guidance. As you probably remember, I didn't provide U.S. dollar guidance for Q3, given the unusually high volatility in exchange rates. The currency headwind ended up being 6% for software and cloud revenues as well as total revenue, 7% for total hardware revenue, and $0.06 a share \u2013 and $0.06 for earnings per share. Currencies continue to move significantly so my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rates, which is how we look at the business. Cloud SaaS, and PaaS revenue was $375 million, up 33% from last year. Bookings were again over 100%, adding to the momentum, which is helping drive SaaS, PaaS revenue growth. Now when bookings turn into revenue depends on many factors, but one thing is clear, our momentum in Cloud bodes very, very well for the future. Cloud infrastructure as a service revenue was $155 million, up 32%. Overall, our Cloud results were much, much better than expected as we are clearly growing faster than Salesforce. We're more than three times the size of Workday now. Software and Cloud revenues were $7.2 billion, up 7% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues drove nearly half of total company revenue at $4.7 billion, up 8% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing install base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue was $2 billion while we continued to enable our customers with their ongoing transition to Cloud. Looking at GAAP Software and Cloud results by region, the Americas grew 7%, EMEA grew 9% and Asia-Pacific grew 4%. Total hardware including hardware support grew 5% with hardware system product revenue of $712 million and hardware support revenue of $587 million. Engineered Systems saw double-digit revenue growth on the strength of our product portfolio. Obviously, we continue to gain share against IBM and HP, whose high-end server businesses continue their decline. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 4% from last year, and the operating margin was 46% in constant currency. That we are able to maintain our industry-leading operating margin while growing our Cloud business more than 30% is a testimony to the strength of our business model. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.7%, and EPS was $0.68 in U.S. dollars, growing 9% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 20.8%, and GAAP EPS was $0.56 in U.S. dollars. As I mentioned earlier, but for the currency moves, EPS would have been $0.06 higher. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.5 billion. Capital expenditures continue to be a bit higher as we position cloud orders and build out for the enormous fourth quarter SaaS and PaaS growth we anticipate. Just to put it into perspective, when you compare the same nine months last year to the nine months, the first nine months of the year this year, our capital expenditure is up about $350 million. That's all. We now have over $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $11.5 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $6.4 billion, down slightly due to currency, but in constant dollars, it actually grew 6%. Within short-term deferred revenue is $321 million for SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Cloud services. As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation, as both are critically important. This quarter, we repurchased 46.1 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased nearly 200 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion and we've paid out dividends of $2.1 billion for a total that is more than 75% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 25% today from $0.12 to $0.15 per share. Now to the guidance. First of all, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect results, but as we just don't know how much, I'm going to again provide constant currency guidance only. Secondly, our customers are clearly embracing Oracle PaaS faster than we expected, which is actually great for us. Just to give you a little bit of insight on how we look at the business, for every $1 million of license we sell, we expect to collect another $1 million from support over five years for a total of $2 million, while for every $1 million of PaaS we sell, we actually expect to collect $5 million over five years. That's what we're looking at in our business, and though it may have some short-term effect, it's actually already showing up in the revenues. So there we go. SaaS and PaaS on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 26% to 30%. On a GAAP basis, SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 27% to 31%. Cloud IaaS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to grow 29% to 33%. Software and Cloud revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license, and software support is expected to grow 2% to 6%. Hardware systems revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, which includes hardware system products and hardware system support is expected to be between negative 2% and positive 8%. Total revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 1% to 6%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.90 and $0.96 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.76 and $0.82 in constant currency. And again, all of my guidance today is in constant currency and assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% and a GAAP tax rate of 23%. Of course, it may end up being different, but that's what we have got in our model right now. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments. Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Safra. As usual, I'll try to give you some numbers behind the numbers. I think overall a very solid quarter for Oracle and a great Cloud quarter for Oracle. As Safra did, I'll give you numbers in CD. SaaS, PaaS revenue grew 33%. Bookings ARR grew 130%, double last year, and up double digits sequentially. Fusion bookings ERP, HCM and SFA all grew triple digits. Fusion bookings have grown more than 200% every quarter this year. We added 800 brand-new SaaS customers, nearly 800. Nearly 530 existing customers expanded their cloud services in the quarter; in HCM, 220 new customers; in customer experience, 407 new customers; in ERP, 160 new customers. ERP SaaS install base is multiple the size of Workday. We're adding customers at more than 10x the rate of Workday. Less than 25% of our ERP SaaS wins involve any on premise Oracle ERP customer, meaning that over 75% are net new to Oracle. I would give you a stat on SAP, but we never see them in cloud ERP. PaaS, more than 400 new PaaS customers in the quarter. Bookings up 200% sequentially. Q4 in PaaS is going to be very big. Premise software grew 6%. We expect continued growth. Engineered systems grew 15% in the quarter. We sold more than 1,000 systems, including over 500 Exadata units booked. Given competitor results, we're taking huge market share. Oracle will be the leader in high-end servers this year. And wrapping up, our cloud revenue is already above a $2 billion run rate, our SaaS/PaaS pipeline is already large and growing rapidly, and it's growing faster than what you're seeing in the bookings, that being the pipeline. We now expect Q4 bookings of $300 million, $50 million higher than before. We also expect FY 2015 bookings growth to be greater than 100%. You probably remember when Larry actually gave 50% growth in bookings as guidance at Financial Analyst Meeting, and we're going to double that number. Clearly, the migration to cloud is happening faster than we expected, and to Safra's point, that's great news for Oracle. It's great news for our customers and great news for our investors. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Larry. Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer : Thank you, Mark. This quarter Oracle sold cloud ERP systems to 160 new customers. That's more ERP customers than Workday has acquired in all the years they've been in the cloud business. Not one of our 160 cloud ERP deals was competitive with SAP. As Mark said, we just don't see them in the market. By the end of this quarter, Oracle will have sold over 1,000 cloud ERP systems. We are on our way to building the largest ERP business in the cloud. Oracle now has a cloud revenue run rate of well over $2 billion a year. We're already the world's second-largest SaaS and PaaS company. On our last quarterly conference call, I predicted that in our fiscal year 2016 Oracle would likely sell more SaaS and PaaS new business than Salesforce.com. Well, I was way too cautious. Sorry, I'm just checking my notes here. Did I lose the call for second? Safra Ada Catz - Chief Executive Officer : No. You're here. Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer : You're good. Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer : Okay. Let me just back up one second, and I think this is important. On our last quarterly conference call, I predicted that in our fiscal year 2016 Oracle would likely sell more SaaS and PaaS new business than Salesforce.com. I was way too cautious and conservative. Our cloud business is growing a lot faster than even I expected. Our cloud bookings are now growing at over 100% per year, so I'd like to revise my prediction. I now believe that Oracle will sell more new SaaS and PaaS business than Salesforce.com in this current calendar year, 2015. It's going to be close, but I think we're going to sell more in the cloud than they do this year. I suspect that might come as a big surprise to a lot of people out there. You won't have to wait very long to find out who's going to win this. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator. Kenneth Bond - Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, we'll go ahead and begin the Q&A portion of the call now, please. Operator : Thank you. Your first question will come from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason A. Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. I actually wanted ask Larry a couple questions about the database business. First off, Larry, I would love if we could get a little bit of insight on 12c adoption. The second thing is I'd like to talk a little bit about some the use cases driving the PaaS growth? And if you can indulge me, maybe the last question is I'd be remiss not to ask for a competitive assessment of S/4HANA from SAP. Thanks. Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer : Okay. Well, let's start with the 12c adoption rates. The most important new feature we probably put in the database and sometimes in terms of customer enthusiasm is our in-memory database feature. And that, along with the multi-tenancy feature, are the two pieces that are really driving 12c adoption to higher rates than anything we've seen in about \u2013 for a very, very long time. So I think people are moving very quickly. Again, it takes years for people to move to the next version of the database. People are very cautious but they're moving more quickly than historical precedent to adopt 12c, for two big reasons. One is multi-tenancy and the other is our in-memory database option. So that's going exceptionally well. The use cases that are spurring adoption of Oracle, the Oracle database in the Cloud is the very simple fact you can take any workload, any database that you currently have running in your data center and move your database with the push of a button and move your application with the push of a button and run it in the Oracle Cloud. Nobody else can do that. If you look at the other PaaS vendors, or the second-biggest PaaS vendor, or, well, actually maybe they're the biggest PaaS vendor still. I'm not sure they breakout their number. Salesforce.com PaaS is based on proprietary technology that allows you to send salesforce.com applications. Our PaaS, our cloud platform as a service is based on two products : Java, the world's most popular programming language and an industry-standard, and the Oracle database, the world's most popular relational database and an industry-standard. We have enormous on premise usage, both Java and the Oracle database. And now people don't have to decide where they're going to run things. They can do tests and development in the Oracle Cloud and run production in on-premise. And then they can decide if they need more capacity, they can go from on-premise into the Cloud and back to on-premise. We're the only ones that allow you to move data and workload back and forth between the Cloud and on-premise. That's the primary use case we think that's going to drive Oracle PaaS to be the number one PaaS in the cloud very, very quickly. The third question is \u2013 as for HANA in the cloud, well, very simply, and I talked to a lot of people at SAP actually about S/4HANA in the cloud and people who have recently been at SAP. And you've got to understand one thing, this is the same old SAP. This is all written in ABAP. There's 30-year-old code in S/4 business suite. There is nothing new about this. They're simply hosting it on someone else's computer. I also can't find a website where you log on and try it. Everyone else lets you log on \u2013 you know, let's you log on, you go to a website if you want to buy our stuff, you want by SaaS, you want to buy PaaS, you go to the website, you get provisioned, and you go. Not so with SAP. This is 30-year-old code renamed S/4HANA. Now they did add a new user interface called Fiori to the old code but that's all they did. They did add another database that they support. They now support in addition to Oracle and Sybase and IBM DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server, they also support HANA. That's it. They've added one new database, they've added a more modern UI, all the old code in the middle is written in ABAP. Ask them. It's written in ABAP. It's 30 years old. We don't see them as a Cloud competitor. We actually almost never talk about them except when we get a question on the call. That's it. Kenneth Bond - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please? Operator : All right. And your next question will come from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Great. Thank you for the question. I actually had two of them. I wanted to know if you all could discuss, I think you mentioned it a little bit but go into a little bit more detail about how you're seeing the competitive environment changing versus salesforce.com and Workday, kind of what you've noticed over the last even three to six months. And then, Safra, I might've missed it, I apologize, but could you talk about your support growth in constant currency, please? I think I might have missed the number. Safra Ada Catz - Chief Executive Officer : Sure. How about, Mark, you do... Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer : Sure. I will start on the competitive environment. I would say that the competitive environment with Workday is different in HR than in ERP, EPM. In ERP, EPM our position is extremely strong. I would not call Workday competitive in that market at all. So let's put that aside. In the context of HCM, I think with each subsequent release of HCM, whether it had been release 7, release 8, release 9, and now release 10, we have simply engineered now a better product than Workday. And so I think, from an HCM perspective, head-to-head, they are in the United States, some strong fights. I think as our awareness, the education of our sales force and our references have gotten better, we now win more than half the deals in the United States. Outside the United States, our win rate goes up actually exponentially because of the breadth of our distribution in those markets. So that is sort of how I would characterize Workday. Also, any deal that comes up that's multi-pillar, so in many cases you wind up with an ERP competitive environment that then actually many times can drag in HR, and so we think competitively, Heather, the fact that we have ERP and EPM in the cloud, in SaaS with a strong lead, also benefits our HCM business as well. So out engineering, out distributed in almost all the world, as I've described big lead in ERP, EPM where I would not describe Workday as extremely competitive. Salesforce, I think perhaps different. Salesforce is clearly the incumbent in most accounts, not Oracle. We are, frankly, the guy coming up with a challenger capability, and we now bring a suite of capability with marketing in addition to sales automation. And we do a lot of things that they don't do. We really come to the customer with a different approach. As opposed to trying to help the customer basically report what the sales force is bidding on, we actually come to market trying to help the sales force, being our customers' sales forces, sell more stuff all the way from automating a marketing campaign to the actual process by which they communicate to the customer, get information about the customer, and actually go through a whole engineering selling process with the customer. And this is proven, you've heard it with our numbers. Our sales automation solutions in the quarter were superb. Marketing had a fantastic quarter. We are the leader in marketing. We are challenging very aggressively in sales automation, and we expect to give them a run for their money in every sales automation deal in the planet, but our differentiation, Heather, comes from bringing a suite of capability to help the sales \u2013 or our customers' sales organizations sell. Safra Ada Catz - Chief Executive Officer : Okay. And Heather, as far sequential growth in support, in constant currency it's up sequentially between 1% and 2%. The only change you see in the tables is as a result of currency. So sequentially up in software license updates and product support. Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. Thank you very much. Kenneth Bond - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please? Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel Nicolaus. Brad R. Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Oh, hi. Thanks. Sorry about that. Just one quick question, Safra. Can you give us a sense of what the FX impact was on cash flow in the quarter? Safra Ada Catz - Chief Executive Officer : So about \u2013 it was \u2013 well, about half of the decline in cash flow, a little bit more, I think, was actually entirely currency. And a little of it, frankly, was tax payments that under circumstances in some jurisdictions where you pay and then you discuss it. And then a little of it actually ended up being an inventory buildup that we're doing right now, about $100 million of inventory buildup in preparation for all of the engineered systems that go out in Q4. So we do the buildup of the pieces in Q3. So I would say, I know you asked about currency but currency is about half of it. Brad R. Reback - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And our next question will come from Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hi. Thank you very much. Mark, could you talk about the Engineered Systems business? Certainly growth of 15% is outpacing the market, but how is the split of business between the quarter rack, half rack, full rack, or if you want to look at it based on the products, Exadata, Exalogic, Exalytics, how is that shaping up? Where do you think the mix shift in this business is going to look like in the next 12 months or so? What I'm really trying to get an angle on is can the business get better as a result of greater 12c adoption as well? Thank you. Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, so let me \u2013 there were a lot of questions tied up there, so let me try to hit as many as I can. First, I think to your point, when you look at our competitor results in high-end servers, we're gaining a ton of share. So just to make sure \u2013 you said growing a bit faster. All of our competitors really in this space are highly negative. And as we've talked about growth was 15% in the quarter, it is spread between, I would say, a solid Exadata quarter all the way around. We grew in Exadata, and this is going against, I know you know this, Kash, fairly tough comparisons with the success of Exadata last year. But we had very strong performance on some of our new engineered systems. So it was pretty well-dispersed. We had strong growth in SuperCluster in the quarter. We had strong growth in our Oracle Database Appliance. We had good growth in our Big Data Appliance, which is our Hadoop Oracle appliance that we brought to market. Our Zero Data, one of my favorite named products that we have in the company, the Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance, contributed growth in the quarter. So the suite of products that we've brought to market in Engineered Systems as a group had a really strong quarter and while some of the numbers are small coming off of a baseline, they all contributed and they are all growing and in aggregate, we grew 15%. So I think our pipelines are up overall, and so we feel great about the quarter Engineered Systems delivered and great about our pipeline. Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: And the hardware refresh as it relates to 12c mainstream adoption, could you get a benefit there? Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I mean, I think, listen, we've seen a strong uptake of \u2013 well I shouldn't say that. Let me say it another way. The beginnings of the uptake of 12c, I believe that also helps, and it also helps in the context of what we see as 12c and the emergence of private clouds that exist within our customers where you see many of these architectural moves to these engineered systems as well. Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Wonderful. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Richard Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks. So, Larry, two questions. First, as we talk to companies that are native to the SaaS market, they indicate that they'll continue to win business because they have an inherent advantage being natively built for the cloud with ease of implementation and ease of use. And I wondered if you could comment on how you think you stack up now and future releases of Fusion, if there's more to be done on that front? And then secondly, you talked about in-memory in... Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer : Can I interrupt you, right, on that one? Was the question, some people are \u2013 SaaS \u2013 people are saying SAP was natively built for the cloud? Richard Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: No, no. These are the native SaaS companies I'm talking about. Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer : Oh, the native SaaS companies. Okay. I misunderstood. Okay. Got it. Richard Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Yeah. Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer : Okay. Well, let me just answer the first part of your question now. We made a big announcement almost 10 years ago that we were rebuilding all of our applications for the cloud. Now, it wasn't called the cloud 10 years ago, it was called SaaS. But we said that we were rebuilding everything on this thing called Fusion, and networks, were going to rebuild our middleware for the cloud, build our applications on top of our cloud middleware, and change our database for the cloud, make it multi-tenant, make it in-memory, do all of those things. We started a project 10 years ago to rewrite everything. When \u2013 Fusion ERP, every single line of code is brand-new. Fusion HCM, every single line of code is brand-new. I can go on and on, but all of these we \u2013 they are completely rewritten for the cloud, as is our database, and our database was not completely rewritten, we added specific features to the database to make it work properly in the cloud, the most prominent of which is the multi-tenancy feature. We think we put multi-tenancy at the right level of the stack in the database rather than multi-tenancy in the application which creates real security problems which I'm not going to go into. But we think we have a huge advantage over someone like Workday that doesn't have a database. Workday kind of build their own little database. And that's what you're buying into when you buy Workday. We built our own little database. It's called Oracle. Workday has its own programming technology. We haven't, we used this programming technology called Java. So \u2013 and we built everything, everything from scratch, every, I am telling you, every single line of code in Fusion HCM is new for the cloud every single line of code where Fusion ERP is new for the cloud. And those new cloud applications are based on by far the strongest platform. Workday doesn't even have a platform that they sell. They have no platform. They have the platform that they kind of use internally. Salesforce has a platform that we also think is not competitive with our platform. So you have to be very specific as what advantages, what advantages these small companies think they have over us in the Cloud when we have, I think, very clearly, the strongest platform based on industry standards and years and years of experience. We've adapted that for the Cloud. I'll give you an example of how strong our Cloud platform is. Salesforce.com uses our Cloud platform. NetSuite uses our Cloud platform. In fact, every single cloud company of size, the top 10, nine of them use our database in the Cloud. Workday is the only one that doesn't. But tell me again the advantages they think they have? Richard Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Ease of implementation and ease-of-use. Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer : I don't \u2013 ease of implement is easy to say, but we're getting our ERP customers \u2013 can you tell me, ease of implementation of what? And we think our Cloud ERP is very, is the best-of-breed in Cloud ERP. We think our Cloud HCM is now the best-of-breed in cloud HCM in the areas of user interface, which is usually what the people mean by ease-of-use. Better adaptive technology, which makes the implementation very, very rapid, a very rapid implementation, very low cost implementations we think are competitive with anyone out there. In fact, one of the reasons why our consulting business keeps getting smaller is because our applications implementations take so much less time and effort. Richard Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Larry, the second question was with in-memory capabilities, do you think it's possible that we see a lot more innovation in terms of the type of business processes that we can automate with this next generation of apps in the Cloud? Lawrence J. Ellison - Executive Chairman & Chief Technology Officer : Well, I think a lot of things that used to take a long time will take less time. So manufacturers will run MRP much faster than they used to. People that used to get reports overnight will get those reports instantaneously so they'll have access to more information. I think there are some very interesting applications in terms of security for immediate detection of intrusion, being able to analyze the data so quickly we actually can do a better job in security, that's one of the big things that we've been working on for some time. I think there are a lot of existing applications that you used to wait overnight for. You'll get that data instantaneously, and then there'll be a host of new applications. But how revolutionary that will be, I think this is going to happen, people will discover these new applications over a fairly long period of time. So as excited as we are about in-memory databases and we have by far the fastest in-memory database in the world. But again, the first benefit is to make the existing apps run much faster. The second benefit, \u2013 and that will happen right away. The second benefit will trickle in over the years as smart people discover new ways to build applications they never thought, that just weren't possible before the in-memory database. Richard Sherlund - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thank you. Kenneth Bond - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please? Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. S. Kirk Materne - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks very much. Mark, just two quick questions. First, I wanted to follow up on your earlier comments regarding the customer experience pillar. Specifically, can you talk about your position today versus 12 months ago in terms of your visibility with actually with the Chief Marketing Officers? Obviously you guys have extremely strong relationships with CIOs, but I'm wondering how your relationships on the marketing side and with the CMOs has changed over the last 12 months. And then secondarily, can you talk about just your industry solution trends and how they're doing and how important having some of that domain expertise is in terms of differentiating you all versus some of your competitors that don't have sort of that deep expertise in certain verticals? Thanks. Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer : Sure. And marketing we've obviously made a significant investment between the acquisitions of Responsys and Eloqua respectively were the leader in B2C marketing and B2B marketing. We've added BlueKai. We've added Compendium. We just added a really nice company in Datalogix, and BlueKai and Datalogix with their data capabilities now differentiate us, just not on the marketing automation process and what you do with CMOs in automating that process, but also in the underpinning data sets that CMOs get access to. So we have become the biggest and the most popular in SaaS marketing, and that, frankly, to your point, Kirk, has caused us to now, as we've done with our sales forces, pointed our IE (38:32) sales force directly at a buyer. And that buyer is the CMO. Very similar to what we do in HR where we call in the head of HR, in marketing we call on the head of marketing. And I think the best testimony to our success in our relationships are our numbers. Our growth in marketing in the quarter was over 200%, and when you look at our competitors, whether those be Adobe, the acquisition that Salesforce.com made, you just see that we are simply growing faster and we're taking market share in marketing SaaS. So that's what I would describe in marketing. You had another question. Would you refresh me on what that was? S. Kirk Materne - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker): Oh, sure. Just your industry solutions, just how they are doing and how important that is in terms of differentiating yourselves versus competitors. Thanks. Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, and they had a \u2013 frankly, we've got so much going on in the company, we probably ought to talk about them more. They had a very good quarter in Q3, as they've had over the past several quarters. Obviously, our position in retail was extremely strategic to our customers, and we've now added MICROS, which brought with it a great depth in hospitality and food and beverage. So our retail suite of expertise is not just in general merchandising but across food and beverage and hospitality as well. We had a very strong quarter in banking, and our expertise now in banking, we've grown our sales force, our ability now to help banks in compliance and anti-money laundering, many of the issues that our banking customers are facing today has become a tremendous asset for us. We've had a good quarter, and we continue to have good success in communications. And without going through each one of them, they do give us strong differentiation because when we sell in these industries, we're talking to business buyers. We're talking to retailers, we're talking CEOs, we're talking to head of merchandising, and I think next week Larry and I will be at our conference, our Industry Connect conference, and we'll have roughly 2,000 of our customers there, and they will be business buyers. They will not be what you would think of as typically CIOs. They will be people on the business side and it gives us a reach into our customers that frankly we wouldn't have without the investment we've made in our GBUs. Kenneth Bond - Vice President- Investor Relations : Next question, please? Operator : And our final question today will come from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Ross, your line is open. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Can you hear me now? Operator : Yes. Go ahead, sir. Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Mark, I had two quick questions. We've seen two quarters in a row of hardware growth in constant currency and you mentioned double-digit growth in Engineered Systems, but I'm curious on the core M and T server lines and storage and what's happening there and your visibility into the entire hardware bucket growth being sustainable going forward. And then I'd love also your thoughts on large-company appetite to move core ERP to the cloud, especially as we think outside of North America in the international sphere. Thanks. Mark V. Hurd - Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. To your point, Engineered Systems, I already went through it. It is now (42:00) a significant part of our hardware portfolio and grew 15%. M, while down, is a smaller piece of our hardware portfolio, being the M-Series of SPARC. T was down in the quarter, again, all offset by the growth we've seen in engineered systems. Storage grew in the quarter. We had significant, very strong growth in ZFS, if you will, our network attached storage product. That is not a new story, our ZFS growth, and I predict that will continue as we go forward. We have just released a new SAN product, FS1, that came to us through the Pillar acquisition that our engineering team has done a super job for us, and that represents, really, a whole new storage market for us now to go compete head up against EMC. So I believe going forward you will see a continuation of storage growth, the continuation of ZFS along with now FS1, a continued growth in Engineered Systems and we'll continue to push refreshing our SPARC base as we have since we've got \u2013 as we go forward. As it relates ERP, and you asked specifically about international markets, I mean, just for example in the quarter, just to give you some flavor for this, we closed ERP SaaS deals at FEMSA in Mexico at Saudi Telecom, at BAE Systems, at Hawaiian Airlines, at KPMG. I mean, these are all certainly very strong brands that are going ERP and ERP in Cloud, at least 75% of what I just named are outside the United States. So we've had very strong \u2013 back to just sort of the Cloud context which probably is at the core of question, I think I said a couple of quarters ago, we're just going to get better and better at this. And while the numbers are faster than I predicted and I wish I could've predicted them better two or three quarters ago, our sales force has simply just gotten more productive. They're better educated, with better products, and they now have references in virtually every single discipline and pillar that we sell in almost every country that we sell. And so what's happening is, it's very interesting, we're getting bigger and we're growing faster as we're getting bigger. And it's because of the multitude of these issues that I'm describing that have all now tilted our way after, frankly, 2, 2.5 years of hard work of getting our customers, similar to the last question, who now know their functional buyer. They know the head \u2013 the Chief Marketing Officer. They know the Chief Human Resource Officer. Our products have now gotten extremely mature and we've got references, and I think now that we add PaaS to our cloud offerings and I probably should've said this earlier, but I've been doing this a long time, and I've really never seen a pipeline grow as fast as our PaaS pipeline has grown. We've really released this at Oracle OpenWorld in October, and the speed of our pipeline growth, you see it just in the conversion to bookings. I actually, Safra and I get to see it in the benefit of the pipeline and it is just exciting times for Oracle. Back to Ken. Kenneth Bond - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Mark. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call and we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for closing. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

As reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ken Bond : Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Oracle's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Executive Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. As reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements we make today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with some prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. I am going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal 2015. I will then review guidance for Q1 and then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.  As you probably remember, I didn\u2019t provide US dollar guidance for Q4 given the unusually high volatility in exchange rate. The currency headwinds ended up being higher than consensus estimates would reflect, with 8% to software and cloud revenue as well as the total company revenue, 9% for hardware revenue and $0.09 for earnings per share. Currencies continue to move significantly and remain unpredictable. So my comments today generally reflect constant dollar growth rate which is how we look at the business.  We are delighted with our results, with the most important thing being that we dramatically over-achieved in the cloud. This is the first Q4 where we had everything together for the cloud. We had the products that we\u2019ve been working on for a decade, the operations, the sales force and the references with many, many happy customers. Having all that in place caused SaaS and PaaS bookings to grow more than 200%, our best ever growth rate for cloud bookings and more than $125 million higher than our own $300 million goal. For most companies, as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows, our growth rates are increasing.  So to the numbers, cloud SaaS and PaaS revenues were \u2013 I am doing only non-GAAP \u2013 were $419 million, up 34% from last year and well above the high end of my guidance. As our cloud bookings growth continues to accelerate so too will our cloud revenue growth. As I just said, bookings grew more than 200% further adding to the momentum which is helping drive SaaS and PaaS growth. Now when you translate the $125 million higher from SaaS and PaaS to had it been historically our license business, it probably would have been about $375 million more in license and it would all have been booked immediately, not ratably over time. So for us this was actually fantastic news. When bookings ultimately turn into revenue depends of course on many factors but one thing is clear our momentum in the cloud bodes very well for the future.  Combined with infrastructure as a service revenue of $160 million, which was up 31%, our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $579 million.  To help you further understand just how well we are doing in the cloud, I thought it would be helpful to compare our cloud billings growth rate to that of our principal cloud competitors. Billings is generally defined as total revenue in the period plus the sequential change in gross deferred revenue. Our practice at Oracle regarding deferred revenue has always been to net out the billed unpaid invoices from our deferred revenue balance on our balance sheet. I believe that our cloud competitors follow a practice where they disclose only a gross deferred revenue book balance, not net for uncollected invoices. So we put up a spread sheet on our website to show you the same thing for comparability.  We\u2019ve calculated Oracle\u2019s cloud billings using our competitors\u2019 methodology or the sum of total cloud revenue plus the sequential change in gross deferred revenue. What it shows is that billings grew from $468 million in fiscal 2014 fourth quarter to $834 million in this just finished quarter. That\u2019s a growth rate of more than 70% in US dollar and though there may be seasonality to billings number, this is dramatically faster than Salesforce\u2019s 21% billings growth and Workday\u2019s 31% billings growth in their most recently reported quarter.  In summary, our cloud business is significantly outpacing the competition. Now total software revenues were $8.4 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.7 billion, up 8% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continues to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenue was $3.1 billion reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud. The shift to cloud was very pronounced in Europe where new software license sales were most impacted. But Europe was also our fastest growing region for both cloud revenue and bookings as you would expect from the substitution.  Total hardware, including hardware support, grew 5% with hardware system product revenue of $818 million and hardware support revenue of $590 million. Engineered systems continued to be strong with double digit bookings growth and we continue to take share from IBM and HP. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.7 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5 billion and the operating margin was 46% with currency and MICROS lowering operating margins by 2%, that [ph] we were able to maintain our industry leading operating margins with MICROS and while growing our cloud business dramatically is a testimony to the strength of our business model. While we believe our over-achievement in cloud bookings will be much more valuable in both revenue and earnings over time, cloud revenue is recognized ratably unlike new license which is recognized upfront. This shift has the effect of lowering near term earnings per share but over time will increase it significantly. So for example, a $1 million license deal which would be recognized upfront dropped right to the bottom line would ultimately result in about $3 million in revenue over 10 years. A $1 million SaaS, PaaS bookings \u2013 SaaS booking results in $10 million over that same time period. I would not trade the cloud revenue for the license revenue as cloud revenues -- and cloud bookings mean significantly more in revenues and earnings over time.  The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 25.5% and EPS was $0.78 in US dollars, $0.09 lower due to currency. The GAAP tax rate was 25.4% and the GAAP EPS was $0.62 in US dollars, $0.08 lower due to currency. Both tax rates were significantly higher than my guidance and were the result of multiple factors but generally relate to the mix of earnings between the US and other jurisdictions with the US being a larger percentage of our quarter in recognized revenue than we forecast. For the fiscal 2015, total software and cloud revenues totaled $29.5 billion, growing 5% in constant currency. Cloud SaaS and PaaS were $1.5 billion, growing 34%. Cloud infrastructure as a service was $608 million, growing 36%. New software license was $8.5 billion and software support was $18.9 billion, growing 8%.  Hardware systems revenue was $5.2 billion, growing 1% and services revenue was $3.5 billion, essentially unchanged from last year. Total revenue grew 4% to $38.3 billion. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 45% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.77.  Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.9 billion. Capital expenditures continued to be higher as we provisioned existing orders and built out for SaaS and PaaS growth. As a reminder, our cloud data centers are built using our own engineered systems. So while CapEx is a cost to other cloud providers, a good portion of our CapEx is essentially a hardware sale which we sell as a cloud subscription.  We now have $54 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $12.4 billion. The short term deferred revenue balance is $7.2 billion, up 9% in constant currency. As we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation, as both are critically important. This quarter, we again repurchased 4.6 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than 193 million shares for a total of $8.1 billion. We paid out dividends of $2.3 billion for a total that is 80% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Now to the guidance. We feel very good about our own performance but of course we are keeping an eye on the macro environment especially abroad. Additionally, given the continued high volatility in exchange rates, we expect currency will affect results but as of now we just don\u2019t know how much. So I am going to again provide constant currency guidance, though I would take our results as some idea of what we think [indiscernible].  Clearly customers are migrating to Oracle cloud at even faster rate and my guidance reflects this accelerating mix shift. Since we are starting the new year, I am going to make some changes in my guidance. I am dropping some things, including smaller components of cloud and I am dropping GAAP guidance which both best match how we look at the business. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. So here it goes. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 39% and 43%. Software and cloud revenue, including SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow between 6% and 8%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 5% to 8%.  Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.59. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being very different. With that, I will turn it over to Mark. Mark Hurd : Just a couple of quick comments, Safra, to add, I think when Safra told you about the 34% year-on-year SaaS, PaaS revenue growth, that was 12% sequential growth and almost entirely organic. We talked about billings growth of 70% now faster than Saleforce or Workday. Bookings at 426 million was 200% plus growth for Q4.  Let me give you some customer numbers. We added 1217 SaaS customers in the quarter, new. 760 customers expanded. By pillar, HCM added 312 new customers in the quarter, 933 for the year, 3 times Workday\u2019s total customer growth over the last four quarters.  In customer experience, we added 657 customers in Q4, almost 1900 for the year. In ERP, we added 380 customers in Q4 and 888 for the year. Our installed base is now almost 1100 ERP customers in the cloud, nearly 10X the size of Workday. And let me add, we really never see SAP.  In PaaS, we added 1419 customers in Q4. Let me just repeat. That was 1419 customers in one quarter. We booked over 100 million and grew 100% sequentially. We are now at scale. Our cloud revenue is already above a $2.3 billion run rate. We added 858 million in ARR this year \u2013 858 million. Using the conversion that Safra used a little while ago, that would be almost 2.5 billion in license and we expect to sell between 1.5 billion and 2 billion in ARR next year. We are now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday. And we expect revenue growth next year could be as high in SaaS, PaaS as 60%.  Now I have given you a lot of numbers to reflect on but when you look at customer counts, booking, revenue, the result is the same. We are doing what you very rarely ever see happen in our industry. We are getting bigger and our growth rate is expanding. We will be the world\u2019s largest enterprise cloud company.  With that, let me turn it over to Larry. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Mark. Well, Mark gave you a lot of interesting numbers and I\u2019d like to drill into a couple of them.  First, I\u2019d like to look at our sales growth rate of cloud applications, SaaS and platform services, PaaS. I am intentionally leaving out our cloud infrastructure business, so I can do an apples to apples comparison with Saleforce.com which does not sell infrastructure as a service.  Okay. Last year, in FY\u201915 as Mark just said, we sold $858 million of new SaaS and PaaS business. About half of that, $426 million was sold in Q4. That\u2019s a year-over-year Q4 sales growth rate of over 200%. More importantly, the $426 million is more SaaS and PaaS new business that has ever been sold by any cloud services company in a single quarter, it\u2019s a record. Clearly our cloud business has entered a hyper growth phase.  This year, in FY\u201916, we plan on selling between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of new SaaS and PaaS business. In other words, we plan to sell at least twice as much as we sold last year. And that\u2019s at least 50% more new business than Salesforce.com will sell in their current fiscal year. And if we exceed our plan like we did this Q4, we could book twice as much new business as Saleforce.com. Now I don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely that we will sell double what Saleforce.com sells. But it\u2019s definitely possible.  Second, let\u2019s look at the impact these record sales rates have on SaaS and PaaS revenue. In Q4 of FY\u201915, our SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 35% in constant currency. Because our cloud sales has dramatically accelerated our SaaS and PaaS revenues are planned to grow at 60% in FY\u201916 unaided by any new acquisition. So our cloud service \u2013 our cloud business, is much bigger than Workday and we will grow faster than Workday will this year.  Our cloud SaaS and PaaS revenue is still second to Salesforce.com but we are growing much much faster than they are. So it won\u2019t be long before we pass them.  How and why is this happening? Our SaaS growth is due to the rapid acceptance of our new generation of Fusion application. We now have over 1000 Fusion ERP customers, around 10 times more than Workday. Mark said that once, I am going to say it twice. Around 10 times more than Workday.  Workday says they never see SAP in the cloud ERP market. That\u2019s the one thing Oracle and Workday agree on. It\u2019s between us, Oracle and Workday in the mid market and high end, the cloud ERP market and we are winning big time. We are the clear number one in cloud ERP and we are number one or number two in most other SaaS categories, including HCM, sales, service, marketing, EPM, supply chain and so on. We have a lot more SaaS application than any other enterprise SaaS company.  Our PaaS growth is due to the huge pent-up demand for the Oracle database and Java middleware as a service. Our customers can now move their Oracle databases and Java applications to the cloud with the push of a button. That\u2019s why our PaaS business is growing even faster than our SaaS business. Things are good for Oracle in the cloud. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Before we go to the Q&A, Holly, we have just one quick clarification. Share repurchases in Q4 were 46 million shares. With that I will turn it over to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo. Jason Maynard : Hey, good afternoon guys. Look, Oracle wasn\u2019t the first and won\u2019t be the last software company to go through this shift from selling upfront perpetual to ratable subscription licensing. And so the metrics that we are used to are obviously changing and you guys gave a lot of color around the current quarter. And what I hope \u2013 maybe we could do is drill down a little bit more on the longer term impact of the model and customer lifetime value. And I know your 10-year example, you generate more revenue with subscription. Can you guys talk a little bit about what you think the ballpark breakeven point is on a hypothetical deal, what happens to margins over this time and ultimately how this is going to impact cash flow? Larry Ellison : I will repeat what Safra said. Okay, let\u2019s take a $1 million deal. If it\u2019s licensed over a 10-year period, you have a $1 million upfront of a license and you get 20% a year for 10 years, and that is up another $2 million for over 10 year period, you get a total of $3 million, and that\u2019s after the cost of sales, it\u2019s very profitable business. Most of that 3 million you get after the cost of sales is profit. And a $1 million SaaS or PaaS deal, you don\u2019t get anything upfront. But you have to pay the commissions. And then you only get \u2013 and that $1 million deal is worth $10 million or more than 3 times as much as the license deal over a 10-year period, over triple the value. But the accounting is entirely different. The accounting you take it ratably over that 10-year period. You have to pay the commissions upfront and recognize expenses as upfront and you get 10 years, okay.  So now what\u2019s the profitability on SaaS and PaaS? It\u2019s \u2013 this is going to shock you. It\u2019s about the same as license and support. It\u2019s stunningly profitable. Infrastructure as a service is very different. Again I am talking about SaaS and PaaS. Infrastructure as a service, the margins aren\u2019t nearly so high. So we make money in infrastructure as a service. You can see what Amazon\u2019s profit margins are on infrastructure as a service. We think it can be a profitable business when you get scale. But SaaS and PaaS is very similar to license. So that $1 million which turned into something less than 3 million in profit after you get the scale in license, turns into something less than $10 million in profit, say 9 million in profit over the 10-year period that you are providing the service. So it\u2019s a much better business for us in terms of revenue \u2013 the revenue goes way up, the profits go way up, and the margins are approximately the same. Safra Catz : I think we have a huge advantage, Jason, that some of our competitors don\u2019t have. We make most of the components for the cloud service ourselves. Larry Ellison : Yes. Again, Salesforce paid us a lot of money for their platform. They buy Exadata from us to run their data center. They buy the Oracle database. They paid a lot of money for the Oracle database. So yes, by the way, we just signed an Oracle database deal, so SAP could run concurrent. We signed an Oracle database deal \u2013 this is all in the last 12 months, so SAP can run Ariba. We signed an Oracle database deal, so SAP could run SuccessFactors. We get a really good deal on the Oracle database, on Java middleware, on Exadata, and all of those things. So our expense profile is very, very different. By the way, it\u2019s interesting, SAP does not use HANA in the cloud very much. I know that because they keep paying us, again this quarter they paid us for Oracle [Perfect and Concur] [ph] and Oracle for Ariba and Oracle for SuccessFactors. They are using HANA for anything, I don\u2019t know about it. Mark Hurd : Jason, just to add \u2013 think that as you talked about the conversion from license to ratable I gave this out last quarter but I will give it again for this quarter. Last quarter I think I said that 82% of our cloud SaaS deals were actually not Oracle customers of an application when they acquired or contracted for a SaaS application. This quarter it was over 60. So these are \u2013 this is not just the conversion of Oracle customers, Oracle application customers to SaaS, this is a lot of greenfield new market share for Oracle as well. Jason Maynard : Great. No I appreciate the commentary. Thanks guys. Larry Ellison : Again to follow up to what Mark just said, so the SaaS market is much bigger than the license market. I think as Mark is saying, we know much further down the market, get the customers we could never get to before, because the SaaS service is much easier to consume for a mid-sized company than buying a computer, or opening a data center, hiring a bunch of people and running licensed software. So we think the available market is dramatically large. Mark Hurd : Yes, the global mid market is now available to us unlike it would have been in the traditional license model and it\u2019s very exciting. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits : Hi guys, good afternoon. Wanted to drill down on the cloud numbers and especially how they stood up probably to license. [The license] [ph] miss in the quarter as consensus by about 273, obviously that\u2019s very much due to that shift over to cloud in terms of accounting structure, terms structure. Is that all due to that or is there some impact anything negative that we should read fundamentally into the license miss and either database apps or middleware? Safra Catz : So first of all, I didn\u2019t give guidance regarding license. So whatever number you put in your spread sheet, we didn\u2019t make that number, okay. Michael Turits : No, I just meant relative to consensus. That\u2019s all. Safra Catz : Okay. Relative to all of you who have a lot of spreadsheets, so however, the reality is I think that you can see the most instruction from what happened in Europe. Our Europe new license was down a lot. Our Europe cloud was huge. So it was -- for them they focused all-in, they went all in on pushing cloud and that\u2019s where the focus went. Other than that, I think if we are going to talk about spreadsheets that I did not actually guide you to, in currency I think you all missed the boat there too a bit. But that\u2019s okay. We got another quarter now and \u2013 but the truth is that yes, our customers are focusing on cloud as are our sales force. We have a lot of references and when a customer comes to us to the extent that they are a good candidate for cloud, which they are, we are going to be talking about cloud, we are going to be selling cloud and we would much rather have a cloud booking for, as I said, for $1 million than we would for a license deal which I book all the way right upfront to the bottom line, we would much rather have a cloud booking for $1 million than a new license dollar and we are pushing that conversion quickly. Mark Hurd : Just to add little bit more. No region missed its CD forecast with the exception of Europe. So just to be clear, CD forecast that you are \u2013 when you are talking about dollars from a CD perspective, every region executed as we expected in license with the exception of Europe. Europe had a phenomenal cloud quarter inclusive of probably one of the most exciting financials in the cloud deal we have seen at HSBC. So some very exciting transactions in Europe and they definitely made the shift but to whatever you have in your numbers, on a local basis, no region missed its CD forecast in license with the exception of Europe that had a material shift to the cloud in the quarter, including some pretty exciting deals like what I just described. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Great, thank you. And Safra, I know our spreadsheets are nowhere near as good as yours are. But just to follow up a little bit. Q4 used to be \u2013 you\u2019d always characterize as Mardi Gras for Oracle from a license revenue perspective, and now that this transition seems to be happening so swiftly, and Q1 you would always have this big sequential drop-off. I know you don\u2019t specifically talk about license revenue but given we are all trying to get a hang of how to think about the company\u2019s seasonality going forward, should we think about Q4 \u2013 the dynamic for Q4 seasonality is going to become a little bit more muted, continue to become more muted as you have this success transitioning but then again Q1 which used to be a quarter where license revenue used to have such a big sequential decline, maybe Q1 gets a little bit easier. Is there any way you can help us think about the seasonal changes? Safra Catz : Yes. You are on it. Yes, Heather, you have got it actually exactly nailed correctly. The reality is that cloud is growing sequentially generally regardless. So Q1 in revenues, Q1 cloud is not going to be a giant drop-off from Q4, I know. My team here is telling me it\u2019s going up. I just gave the guidance. So yes, so Heather, you have that right. So the seasonality for the whole company is muted. It is still true that from a bookings point of view and things like that, Q4 is Mardi Gras and it\u2019s still Mardi Gras. But revenue smoothes out. New license which was always just so enormous in Q4 takes a dry and drop-off, it becomes less and less important. So in total revenue the seasonality smoothes out a bit, and \u2013 but of course, our new license numbers are still very big numbers but in Q1 they are a much smaller percentage of the total than they are in Q4. Mark Hurd : I do think it\u2019s worth nothing, Heather, that in Q4 for us on a cloud bookings basis, we came in with a forecast that we had which was what we talked about at the end of Q3 with the conference call and every week this forecast got better. Every week. There was not a single \u2013 I gave an example of one deal but there is no gargantuan transaction in there. There is no dominant region, there is no dominant pillar, it is consistent by pillar, by geography, and it was a very consistent steady move every week as we advanced through Q4. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : Hey guys, I am not going to ask you a spreadsheet question but I want to ask about databases. Any commentary on the new license sales of database, directionally how it\u2019s trending and also an update on 12c adoption, what percentage of the base is on 12c and any quantification you can provide on the options, that will be good. Thank you. Mark Hurd : 12c was good in the quarter. I think we gave you a comparison last quarter but if we compare it to 11, we\u2019ve been about 50% faster in feature adoptions of 12c than we were at 11, so it was very strong. And if you went by region, you saw a tremendous performance in database in North America, even in license. And you saw that really consistently across the regions except for the shift that we saw in Europe but the adoption speed of 12c was quite strong in the quarter as it was in Q3. Larry Ellison : Kash, let me give you a little kind of an interesting commentary, I think, on the relationship between PaaS and database adoption on-premise. We are the only company that says, hey, you should \u2013 what you run in the cloud and what you run on premise should be compatible so that you can push a button and move a workload from your private cloud to the Oracle public cloud and back again or you can do development test in the public cloud and do production in our private cloud on premise if you want to. So that has \u2013 we think over time that\u2019s going to dramatically accelerate the adoption of features \u2013 certain features of our database on premise, because they are getting those features in the cloud. They are getting multi-tenancy in the cloud. They are getting the in-memory database features in the cloud and they'll want to have an exact analog in their private cloud on premise. So I think that\u2019s going to actually help keeping our customers current with the latest features of database. Kash Rangan : Wonderful. Safra, any commentary on the license growth rate for databases? Safra Catz : Well, I want to talk to you actually about the options that did best. As you would expect, everything around security many of our customers are realizing the security options that we have which are really, very, very critical, obviously cyber attacks and all those things and also inside threats or something they are finally really focused on and so database security options were up very significantly like around 30%, that kind of level. And many of our customers are looking now at the multi-tenant option which is available with our newest products and that is doing very well. That means that our customers are moving even themselves into their own private cloud to manage more efficiently. So that is very, very good for us this year \u2013 this quarter. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. John DiFucci : I guess we understand and appreciate the emphasis here on the cloud business. But I\u2019d like to ask a question on what I guess is still the overwhelming majority of your revenue today. And that\u2019s \u2013 I am talking about the on-premise software business. How should we be thinking about your enterprise customer base, what is their behavior like and what do you think it\u2019s going to be moving forward from here? I mean in the past I think we heard both Safra and Mark talk about the sustainability of the Siebel maintenance stream. I guess as enterprises move to the cloud, is this move largely the \u2013 as your customers and I know, Mark, you sort of addressed this a little bit. But are they \u2013 are your customers largely replacing on-premise technology or is it primarily for new implementations today and into the future? I am sorry for the long question but I guess what I am trying to get to is how should we think about the current support steam from that on-premise software, the current support and maintenance into the future? Safra Catz : So firstly, it\u2019s very important that you understand our support base continues to grow. When we sell new licenses at all, any new license, that increases our base. We do continue to sell billions of dollars of new licenses. Our renewal rates by the way remain extremely high, very very high, historically high rates. So many of our customers are not necessarily \u2013 are not cancelling support and moving everything to the cloud overnight. They are adding cloud capabilities. What would happen invariably is even when they add something in the cloud that they did on premise, they have other uses for many of our licenses that they\u2019ve had before. We would like them over time frankly if we had our way to move everything to the cloud, that would mean probably revenue rates of significantly larger than we are now. But our customers, our base continues to grow \u2013 our customer base continues to grow and our support numbers continue to go up, up obviously 8% just this quarter. Mark Hurd : Yes, I think, what Safra said is right. 8% CD growth for the quarter, renewal rates were very strong again, if you will, flat year over year, meaning they were very, very very good. And again I\u2019ll try to go through this again, so to be clear. Most of the new things that we sold or most of what we sold in the cloud was incremental in terms of certainly SaaS applications. So I think again the way to think through this is you are going to have a very large on-premise environment, I think, for a long period of time but workloads are shifting to the cloud, and that is an opportunity for us as we maintain our on-prem base but frankly grow our market share through this shift of the cloud and we can see it. And it\u2019s exciting. Remember, John, too, when we win a SaaS application, we gain all the hardware, all the operating systems, all the database and all the middleware. When we gain PaaS, we get all the database, all the operating system and all the hardware as well. So I think you are going to see on-prem, I think our position on-premise is actually strengthening on a relative basis to what\u2019s in the market and we are now growing faster with these numbers and I don\u2019t know how many ways to go through these numbers to show the market share we are gaining and the speed by which we are accelerating our market position in the cloud. And I think we had a chance to get both. Larry Ellison : Let me just add \u2013 summarize what Mark said. Our support base, our install base on-premise is going up 8% and will continue to go up. While our cloud business is experiencing hyper growth 50% of revenue growth, 50% revenue growth, may be more than that. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill : Safra, in Q4 did you see a greater percentage of deals in the pipeline that maybe more forecast to go as a perpetual license that meant to shift to a cloud model and therefore that was the weight on the license I think relative to what we all were looking for that, there was a big delta there and just curious if you have any commentary. And then maybe for Mark, as it relates to similar cloud initial deal sizes and duration of these contracts, if you could, maybe point to what you are seeing in terms of some of the contract values that you are seeing throughout the year and any changing characteristics that would be helpful? Safra Catz : No, that isn\u2019t how it works. It\u2019s not that \u2013 by the time a deal itself is actually listed in the forecast it\u2019s already qualified as to what it\u2019s going to be. The reality is that conversion rates move in the cloud were very very very high and they are \u2013 to some extent took \u2013 was a big focus, that is what we push in the forecast call every week, that\u2019s what we are talking about all the time and that\u2019s what was very clear. In the forecast overall there were many many different shape deals and types of deals and what exactly will close in the quarter, I never know. I have to use my own conversion and closing historical rate. This quarter showed a marked move towards converting the cloud deals. Those did very well. They far exceeded where we thought they would go. So that\u2019s how it worked out. Obviously it doesn\u2019t show up in the revenues because we don\u2019t book them upfront like license does. Larry Ellison : To your second question, productivity and ASP, your point about pricing both inclined, so our productivity per rep and our average deal size in cloud went up in the quarter, it went up a bit sequentially as well as it went up year over year. There isn\u2019t another dynamic that when you look at our cloud business, you\u2019ve got several factors going on, Brent. You\u2019ve got one, frankly, the products are just better. They are just getting better and the more mature our sales people, we have more of them and they have longer tenure. They are also simply better trained than they were just even a year or two years ago. And so the combination of this is what\u2019s driven the performance in the cloud. And make no mistake about it. There is a keen sales focus on growing our cloud business. Our cloud business is important for all of the regions that we\u2019ve already talked through. Now one other point that we haven\u2019t brought up that I think I\u2019d add to is when you look at where we are heading with the cloud, we are going into a year now where we now get frankly more of our portfolio available at the cloud. So we\u2019ve done just what we descried in Q4 which are these numbers that everybody is all excited about. Frankly, with not our entire product line available to us in the cloud. And not even all of the products that we have localized to all of our geographies. So you have a set of factors occurring next fiscal year this coming, the year we are in, where now we have get more salespeople with more tenure, with more references, with now more of our products in line, online if you will in more geographies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Two quick ones. First, Safra, if I look at sales and marketing, they came in a little bit higher than we had expected. Can you talk a little bit about the dynamics there? Are you actually paying out more on cloud provisions et cetera or is it just that Q4 actually was very successful and we can\u2019t see it in revenue because it was sold on cloud? And the other question on PaaS, what are the use cases that you see on PaaS, is it all test and development or are people actually putting software as the production workloads over on to your cloud already? Safra Catz : So what you are seeing in the sales and marketing percentage is that again, since we are not recognizing the revenue upfront like with license, though we have commissions and things like that with cloud, there is also additional sales expenses that are recognized immediately but they don\u2019t have the corresponding revenue like new license does. So you are just seeing timing differences more than anything else, and that\u2019s impacting a number of our ratios, put that way. Mark Hurd : In PaaS, we have a number of things going on. Yes, your point about dev test is correct, there is a lot of dev test use cases for PaaS. But there is more going on in PaaS than just database, service and just dev test. We have released our first \u2013 really BI solution into the market which is now \u2013 digital analyser which now goes head up against [TapWall]. And we had good success with that product in Q4. So again our competitors are shifting now as opposed to in BI on premise where we would have competed with Cognos or Business Objects. We now compete with [TapWall] and that\u2019s in our PaaS results that we\u2019ve described, also Java as a service was strong in the quarter. The collection of those services were 30%, 40% of our PaaS bookings and yes, dev test other than that, dev test is certainly a very big use case for our customers. Operator : Your last question will come from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Philip Winslow : I think we\u2019ve had a lot on the software side of the business and cloud but we haven\u2019t really touched on hardware much. You guys came in actually a little bit above the midpoint of your constant currency guidance on hardware this quarter. Just wondered if you could comment on the trends you are seeing there, engineered systems versus the non-engineered business. And Safra, I know you didn\u2019t give a specific guidance for the hardware business but how are you guys thinking about that going forward? Mark Hurd : Engineered systems bookings grew double digits in the quarter, very strong, we had over 15, I am doing the stuff \u2013 1500, 1600 incremental systems in the quarter. So very strong in engineered systems as we had very strong growth in North America, very good performance out of one of our Oracle database appliance products. So SuperCluster was very strong in the quarter. We grew in storage in the quarter and this is -- really we are going through a shift in storage now. We released our SAN product FS1 in the quarter which saw some bookings. This is really the first quarter we got any bookings out of FS1 or GFS product, somebody\u2019s renamed that but I haven\u2019t recently \u2013 BS1. I wish they wouldn\u2019t do that to me but so they renamed BS1 \u2013 so I missed the \u2013 but anyway so we had good growth in PaaS \u2013 as well. But \u2013 and then we have sort of server performance that was declines in the quarter and then the growth in the other products that I have described netted to the growth rate that we described. I mean let\u2019s face it, we are the only hardware company growing in the industry. So when you look at the market share numbers, they sort of get to be staggering. We\u2019ve taken over the \u2013 and this is not a question you asked but I am going to say it anyway. In the United States when you look at servers above $15000, the number one company in market share now is Oracle. I believe that will occur region by region by region because of the strength of not just our hardware product line but our software portfolio with it. So it was a good quarter for us in hardware and I would expect that trend to continue. Very similar to John\u2019s question, I don\u2019t think we are telling you that there isn\u2019t a non-premise market. Please don\u2019t take that message when we described. But I think the fact that you can take a workload from your on premise data center and now move it seamlessly to the cloud and back and forth to a data center gives us a tremendous advantage. The configuration we have in the cloud, the configuration we have on premise now can be identical. If they were to move workloads back and forth, use that on our hardware in your data center, use that on the very same hardware perhaps in the cloud. We are the only company in the industry that can do this. And so I think this bodes very well for our hardware business, granted in a declining market. But I believe Oracle will gain market share in the declining market. End of Q&A Ken Bond : Thank you, Phil. A telephonic replay of this call will be available for 24 hours.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to now turn the call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ken Bond : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Oracle\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.

Before taking questions, we will begin with some prepared remarks. With that, I will turn the call over to Safra. Safra? Safra Catz : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks, Ken. I am actually offsite today, so hopefully this phone will work out. If you don\u2019t hear me, I may have to reconnect, but I do have obviously Ken Bond on the call and Corey West, our Chief Accounting Officer is also I think in the room with Larry and Mark. I am going to focus today on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I will then review guidance for Q2, and I will actually give some guidance for the entire fiscal year, and then I will turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments. As you know, we didn\u2019t provide you a stellar guidance for Q1 given the high volatility in exchange rates we are seeing at the time. As it happened, Q1 currency headwinds were actually 2% worse than we expected. The currency impact for both total revenue and hardware revenue ended up being 9% and for software and cloud revenue was 8%. Now, we do get benefit on the expense side, but because many of our expenses are in the United States, we get a very small benefit and of course our expenses are significantly lower than our revenues, and so our operating income was actually impacted by 12 points. Earnings per share was $0.06 lower, because of currency, $0.01 worse than we anticipated. With currency still volatile, we will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls, so we can have some measure of consistency and also share with you how we look at the business. We have also changed the presentation of our income statement to better reflect how we look at the company now that cloud has become a significant contributor to revenue. Our software business is really two parts of one business : the on-premise software business, which is steady and growing modestly and the cloud business that is in a high growth phase. We thought it made sense to show the components grouped together in our income statement to make it easier to see the progress we are making in the cloud. The largest part is on-premise software revenues, which is made up of new software licenses plus software license updates and product support. On-premise software revenue was up 4% for the quarter to $5.8 billion. The largest component is software license updates and product support, which was up 8% for the quarter to $4.7 billion, with attach and renewal rates running at their usual high levels. We expect the on-premise software business to remain steady. Over the full year, I expect we will see modest growth comprised of continued growth in software support revenue that offsets any declines in new software license. Moving on to cloud, we start with SaaS and PaaS and then add infrastructure as a service to report total cloud revenues, which were up 34%. Within the cloud business, we continued to see excellent momentum in SaaS and PaaS, with bookings growth of 165% this quarter on top of the 54% growth from Q1 of last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $452 million, up 38% from last year. The triple-digit bookings growth that we have been experiencing will translate into significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue in the second half of the year. You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 70% in U.S. dollars this quarter on top of the 100% growth last quarter. Also, the gross deferred revenue balance is now merely $1 billion and was up more than 100%. We have put the billings numbers up on the website for you to see in detail. Our significant success in cloud bookings will not only help accelerate our revenue growth, but it will also benefit our margins and earnings over time. Cloud revenue, as you know, is recognized ratably while new license is recognized all upfront. This timing difference has the effect of lowering near-term operating margins and earnings per share, but over time will increase both. As our SaaS and PaaS bookings have continued to accelerate, capital expenditures for the quarter were higher compared to last year. The bulk of them are largely complete and you can see this in the $150 million sequential decline in CapEx this quarter. I expect CapEx for this year will be materially lower than last year as we utilize the investments that we have already made. We are well aware of the near-term impact to gross margins that this build-out cost has had on the cloud business, and I think that Q4 of last year marks the bottom for SaaS and PaaS gross margins. Q1 cloud gross margins were up slightly on a sequential basis, and I think we will see another modest improvement in Q2. But as our cloud business scales up, we expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will be around 60% by Q4 and then 80% over the next two years. The balance of our cloud revenues come from cloud infrastructure as a service, which was up 23% to $160 million. The gross margin in this business was up sequentially to a record 45%. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rate, along with significantly higher gross margins, we expect infrastructure as a service revenue will grow at a single-digit rate and maintain a steady margin profile over time.  As I mentioned, there are two parts to our software business that can be looked at separately, but should really be considered together, the on-premise software business, which will grow modestly and serves as a tremendous base of loyal customers using our leading product. The SaaS and PaaS revenues will grow rapidly and will quickly become a significant contributor to revenues and profit as we help those same customers transform their businesses over time. In total, we will see growth in the total software business begin to increase this year as cloud revenue grows as a percentage of the total software business. Finally, total hardware revenues grew 6%, which included hardware products revenue of $570 million and hardware support revenue of $559 million. Total revenue for the quarter was up 7% from last year to $8.5 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion and the operating margin was 41%. Sales and cloud investments, along with the integration of MICROS, each impacted operating margins negatively by about 1%. A non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter \u2013 the non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25%, which was 3.5 points higher than last year. The GAAP tax rate was 24.4%, which was 5 points higher than last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.53 in U.S. dollars and GAAP EPS was $0.40 in U.S. dollars. As I said earlier, both were $0.06 lower due to currency. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $11.8 billion. We now have nearly $56 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $14 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.1 billion, up 10% in constant currency. This quarter, we repurchased more than 75 million shares for a total of $3 billion, up from our fiscal year \u201815 run rate of $2 billion a quarter. And given current market conditions, we expect to buy even more in Q2. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than 220 million shares for a total of $9.1 billion and paid out dividends of $2.4 billion for a total that is nearly 100% of free cash flow. Now, to the guidance, as I mentioned, I am going to give you guidance for Q2 and then for the whole year. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition. And clearly, customers are migrating to the Oracle cloud. Over time, we expect the cloud will result in more revenue and profit for Oracle as we take share from legacy on-premise competitors, other cloud competitors who are limited to point solutions and the labor suppliers who can\u2019t possibly offer what we have already built. Of course, I am seeing many of the same financial news reports that all of you are about the whole world. And so I think it is still best to be prudent here. Additionally, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates and significant currency headwinds. I am going to give you constant currency guidance, but if exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see a currency headwind of about 6% on revenue and $0.05 on earnings per share. But again, it could be significantly worse. Maybe if we are lucky, it could be a little bit better. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. So, here it goes. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 36% to 40%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 5% to 9%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow from 0% to 2%. Total revenue is expected to range from a negative 2% to a positive 1%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. Now, this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example, it may end up being different. Looking further out, we expect to see a material acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue. As a result, I am providing full fiscal year guidance for some key items. As before, my guidance on the full year is in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow around 50%. On-premise software is expected to grow approximately 1%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 3% and 4%. Finally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to materially improve in the second half and exit the year at around 60%. With that, I will turn it over to Larry and Mark for their comments. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. This is Larry. Over the last three years, we have been in the startup phase of our cloud business. We have developed services at all four layers of the cloud, a complete set of enterprise SaaS applications, plus our database and middleware platform services, plus compute and storage infrastructure services, and an expanding set of data systems. We have deployed those cloud services in 19 data centers and 14 countries around the world. During this startup phase of our cloud business, we have increased our data center service delivery capacity from 0.5 megawatt to 45 megawatts. That\u2019s a 90x, not 90%, a 90x increase in our data center capacity in three years. We have installed over 40,000 physical devices, a 100,000 virtual machines and over 8 petabytes of storage. We now have in place the physical infrastructure to dramatically expand our cloud customer base. We are entering the rapid growth, scale-out phase of our cloud business. We are adding thousands of new SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and data customers to our existing data centers. With all that customer growth on top of our existing infrastructure, we expect that our cloud margins will double from 40% to 80% over the next two years. Mark, it\u2019s your turn to tell everybody about all those great customer adds we had during Q1. Mark Hurd : Thanks. By the process of elimination, this is Mark actually speaking. So, I thought I would do two things right to the Larry\u2019s point, tell you about some wins, but also give you some facts about the quarter. Revenue grew 38% year-on-year, 8% quarter-on-quarter. Billings grew 70%, again growing much faster than Salesforce and Workday. Bookings were $191 million, a 165% growth. And like I always do, I want to tell you the number of customers we added. We added 612 new SaaS customers in the quarter, brand new logos. 616 expanded their SaaS business with us in the quarter. In HCM, it was 166 new customers, more than double what Workday added. In CX, 280 customers. In ERP EPM, it was 200 customers, double last year. That is also more than Workday\u2019s lifetime sales. We now have 1,350 customers in our installed base. More than 300 are already live, including 100 that went live in just Q1. What\u2019s taken Workday eight quarters to do, we did in one quarter. We never see SAP. PaaS, we added 800 new PaaS customers in the quarter, 2,500 in just two quarters. Bookings over $65 million. Now, I think we have a shot in Q2 to book more PaaS than we actually did in Q4. I think we have a shot. That\u2019s how fast we see our pipeline growing in PaaS. I am going to wrap up and then I am going to read you some news, but I just want to connect a few dots between what Safra and Larry described on the Oracle SaaS, PaaS cloud. We are currently at a $1.8 billion run-rate in revenue. If you include IaaS, it\u2019s $2.4 billion. We will book between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in SaaS, PaaS ARR in the fiscal year. Gross deferred revenue has grown from $475 million to nearly $1 billion in the year. Billings are growing 70%. Gross margins are headed to 80%. SaaS, PaaS will be a very large and very profitable business for Oracle. Now, in addition, I just want to give you some brands that we got in the quarter just so you have a feeling for who these \u2013 all these people are that are buying solutions from us. So, first let me hit HCM. A few wins, CEMEX, they are an Australia fusion HCM. We replaced Workday at CEMEX in the quarter; Cypress Semiconductor; GDF Suez; Limited Brands; Nationwide Insurance; Restoration Hardware; Rutgers University. We expanded our HCM clouds at Omnicare, the Navy, Westpac Bank. In ERP EPM, Athena Health, Chicago Sun-Times, these are all new customers by the way. Fox Home Entertainment, U.S. Department of Energy, LendingClub Corp, Lenovo, LG Electronics, Rutgers University. By the way, you will hear a few names twice, which is because they bought multiple pillars at the same time. In sales service cloud, Fox Home Entertainment, Royal Mail, Sallie Mae, SIRIUS XM, Toshiba Medical, Wesfarmers, expansions at Cigna, Motorola, Nikon, Polycom, Virgin Atlantic, Westpac. In our marketing cloud, Aer Lingus, General Mills, JeansWest, Telstra, Verizon, expansions at Booz Allen Hamilton, Forever 21, National Instruments, NetApp, Pier 1 Imports, Public Broadcasting System, TaylorMade Golf Company, Time Inc. I am going to stop, but I wanted to give you a flavor for not just the number of customers but the quality of brands that are buying from us at the same time. Ken, with that, let\u2019s take whatever questions anybody has got. Ken Bond : Great. Thank you very much, Mark. Operator, if you could please instruct the audience for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Phil Winslow : Hi, thanks guys and congrats on another great quarter in the cloud with that 70% billings growth and also thank you for the commentary on the gross margin there going forward, that was really helpful. I just wanted to double click on the cloud for a little bit, SaaS and PaaS, Mark you gave us some commentary on the PaaS side for Q2. And obviously, it sounds like that\u2019s ramping. But if you focus in in on the SaaS side, what trends are you seeing there, HCM versus financials, maybe trends on adoption you can see there and go-live, any sort of color would be great? Mark Hurd : Well, listen, I hate to compare our pillars, because individually, they are all doing quite well. So, I don\u2019t want to compare them against each other. But it\u2019s clear to me the ramp in ERP is its strength. I mean, when you look at the number of customers we\u2019d be able to bring on board, remember, this is really our fifth quarter really in the business in the cloud. When you think of 1,350 customers that are now under contract, I think it\u2019s \u2013 Larry can do this better than I can, but in roughly 23, 24 years, we are sort of already at, I don\u2019t know, 10% of the on-prem base. It\u2019s now in the cloud in terms of just sheer number of companies, and our pipeline is just full. So, ERP, we are highly differentiated and we are way ahead of wherever it is you think is number two, and it\u2019s extreme \u2013 I think it\u2019s a combination, Philip, what we have talked about before. It\u2019s \u2013 our products have done nothing, but gets better and better and better. We are on now Release 10. Release 11 is now coming out, so our products have gotten better. Our people \u2013 we have got more people. They are better trained and we just have now a lot of go-lives and a lot of references and that\u2019s true across each one of our pillars, Phil. Larry Ellison : Yes. I would like to add a couple of things. One is that the products that we have are being translated into more and more languages and updated for statutory compliance in more and more countries. So, there are more markets we can sell them into. And we are adding supply chain and manufacturing with this release in ERP. So, we have \u2013 there is really nobody with a comprehensive suite of enterprise software products. And now \u2013 and we are able to sell it internationally. So, we think we have a huge advantage. I don\u2019t know who you consider the competitor in ERP. Again, every quarter, I mean, if Workday is the competitor, every quarter, we sell \u2013 Q1 is our smallest quarter and we sold more deals in Q1 than Workday\u2019s sold ERP deals, and Workday has sold since their company began. We view that every single quarter. So, our relative strength, I think as Mark said, I think all of our pillars are doing well. But on a relative basis, whoever is number two in ERP, they are a long, long way behind. And by the way, ERP is the largest segment of application in the cloud. That will be just like \u2013 people \u2013 SAP was the leading on-premise application software vendor in the last generation of applications, because they were number one in ERP. The leading vendor \u2013 applications vendor in the cloud this generation will also be whoever wins the ERP work. Mark Hurd : Yes, Phil, we have fallen into the trap that I didn\u2019t want to fall into as comparing pillars and you can tell how excited we are about ERP. But frankly, if you were in our marketing cloud business, you would be really excited. When you start running off the names that I run off in marketing cloud, we are highly differentiated and we are winning. We have done well in B2C. We have done well in B2B. You add what\u2019s now occurred in service. I mean, we are starting to see again significant service growth in our service cloud and our sales cloud, while again small and very different than ERP, up against a big competitor. Our service cloud is showing very strong growth. And so if you looked in each of our pillars, we have added on some really cool stuff here, just while I am on a roll here. We have added on a very cool data as a service business. So, our data as a service business, what\u2019s come to us with our BlueKai acquisition and our Datalogix acquisition is now another component of our marketing cloud, and that had tremendous performance in Q1. So, it\u2019s really a story across sort of all of our pillars. ERP is of course exciting, because to Larry\u2019s point, it\u2019s the biggest pillar in terms of total available market and one that has a lot of pull. It pulls a lot of HCM. When we win an ERP, our connect rate of HCM to ERP is pretty high and growing, but the success is broad-based and that\u2019s sort of the enthusiasm you hear keep coming from us as we talk about what we see happening across our SaaS business. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits : Hey, guys. I wanted to switch over from apps to database. I want to ask you broadly. I know the 12c is being adopted faster than 11. Can you give us an update on the adoption of multi-tenancy and in-memory options? And from a cloud perspective, how much traction you are getting with the SaaS providers and maybe we could say for database as a service, how is that working as part of the broader platform as a service offering? Larry Ellison : Okay. So, we have never had any of our options for the database, have an update as fast as we are seeing with multi-tenancy and in-memory. We never experienced people that want to get these two particular pictures turned on. And this is in our on-premise customer base. As you know, most major SaaS companies run Oracle. SAP runs Ariba on Oracle. SAP runs SuccessFactors on Oracle. SAP runs Concur on Oracle. NetSuite runs on Oracle. Salesforce runs on Oracle. And all of them are able to deliver more efficiency in terms of query processing by turning on the in-memory feature. All of them are able to, by more efficiency they use less hardware and they deliver better performance. So, they lower their internal cost and deliver their performance. All of them are much more efficient in the usage of hardware resource by turning on multi-tenancy. Now, these guys have multi-tenancy built into their application. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t layer things. So, they have multi-tenancy at the application level, multi-tenancy at the database level, and then multi-tenancy at the operating system level, which is called VM. All of those things kind of conspire together to more efficiently utilize your hardware, provide better recovery in security systems. So, we see the demand from our traditional on-prem customers and the new generation of cloud customers for these two new options unlike anything that\u2019s out before. Ken Bond : Next question, fine Michael, go ahead, Michael. Michael Turits : Yes, just if I was curious as to two things. One is how is database as a service fitting in with your broader platform as a service offering? And is there any slowing of database and expectations of Release 2 for 12c? Larry Ellison : I don\u2019t think \u2013 as you know, if you buy the database now and you get all \u2013 and you maintain support, you get all the subsequent versions. So, no, I don\u2019t think there is any slowing. However, we are encouraging people to run all their dev tests, all their development and test in our cloud as opposed to on-prem, which does imply a shift from database on-prem to our database service. That\u2019s what we want them to do. We think that lowers their cost and raises our revenue and profits. We think it works very well for us. So, you really have to look at those two businesses added together. And I think that\u2019s what Safra is saying in her presentation. You can\u2019t look at database on-premise separately from PaaS, to database as a service. It\u2019s really that some of those that have to grow. Some of those have to grow at the top line level and that some of those have to grow in terms of profitability. And we see that happening right now. So, we think PaaS, yes, some people will like to buy database as a service as opposed to running dev test on-prem, but we think that\u2019s a good thing. We think we \u2013 they get a more efficient service. They spend less. We get more. Mark Hurd : I think one thing Michael that I would add to it is that from a customer\u2019s point of view, these decisions aren\u2019t necessarily binary. I mean, that I am going to run database as a service as opposed to database on-prem. What the major differentiation for Oracle is nobody else can do is that we can actually do this on-premise for you and do it for you in the cloud. And we can do it at the exact same time. We can deliver to you a capability in the cloud and we can go over the exact same capability to you on-premise and move those workloads back and forth, whether that\u2019s database as a service, some dev test and then dev test in our cloud into your data center to run your production applications. It\u2019s important to understand this is a huge differentiator that only this company can deliver. We are not just cloud. We have a fantastic hyper growth cloud with on-prem capability that nobody else brings the two together like Oracle. Larry Ellison : For example, we have Exadata as a service that we are rolling out at Oracle OpenWorld. So, we have Exadata as a service in our cloud. And we obviously sell Exadata as a machine to run on-premise, the most modern way, most cost effective way to run our database. So, you can run part of your database workload on-prem on that Exadata platform. Part of that database workload in our cloud on that Exadata platform and our management tool. When you are running your data center assets and our cloud assets, the person who is running that thinks that\u2019s one pool of assets with one set of management tool that allow you to run your Exadatas and the Exadatas in the cloud together, move data back and forth, move workloads back and forth. There is \u2013 this coexistence of cloud and on-premise computing is going to be a decades-long process, if not forever. But during this long period of coexistence, we think it\u2019s very important to have absolute compatibility between on-prem and in the cloud. And Mark makes \u2013 Mark points out our biggest differentiator in this business. We have great on-premise technology with some of our fancy appliances like Exadata, Big Data Appliance, Exalogic and go on and on and we offer those that same advanced technology in the cloud and we lace it together and make it look like one set of assets. Mark Hurd : At the risk of over-answering your question, I am going to stop here. By the time we get to OpenWorld and Larry presents on Sunday night, we will have now fundamentally all of our software assets redone for the modern cloud. So, the ability to do what Larry said is not something that\u2019s 5 years away, 4 years away, 3 years away, we can start delivering Exadata as a service and these are opportunities that Larry described now. Michael Turits : Thanks, Larry. Thanks Mark. Ken Bond : Thank you, Mike. Next question please. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Thank you so much. This is a question for Mark. I was just wondering if you could share with us, if you were to characterize what inning we are in of the SaaS transition if you could kind of help us think about that? And also when do you think we start to see \u2013 I know you mentioned some commentary about momentum in PaaS, but when do we see that become a material part of that SaaS, PaaS revenue line? And then I guess the follow-up to that would just be, you touched I think on Phil\u2019s question about the SaaS competitive dynamics, but can you walk us through how you are thinking about the competitive environment for PaaS as well? Thank you. Mark Hurd : Okay. So, that was one of those. Let me give you a question, six parts type thing. Heather Bellini : Exactly. Mark Hurd : Heather, I will try. So, in the baseball analogy, I don\u2019t know, top of the first. We are in the very beginning stages. It depends a little which pillar we are talking about. Heather Bellini : Well, for SaaS first and then for PaaS. Mark Hurd : Server SaaS and I am talking about SaaS and I am talking across each pillar. I mean, the ERP opportunity has just started. Now, what happens that we are ramping incredibly fast. I think if I had said four quarters ago and said, hey, I think we will have 1,350 customers signed up to run in our cloud in about four or five quarters, you should go seek some help, because it won\u2019t happen like that. It has. That said, we are only now getting to the point, Heather, where we actually have all the references required, we have got our sales force scaled. I think we are in \u2013 and by the way, to Larry\u2019s point, I thought Larry made a great point. We are releasing a lot of new products. It may not \u2013 you may not come across that way, but with the next release, we now release products that are localized for many, many more countries, markets that frankly we just weren\u2019t in given six months ago in addition to the fact that an ERP we are releasing supply chain manufacturing now. So, we can now look after manufacturers as well. I made a comment about what we have added now in marketing in terms of our data cloud that we have now supplemented our marketing cloud with. We have new releases coming in service cloud. So, there is just a whole suite of products. I would tell you top of the first, this is a multiyear long, long gain. We just happen to be extremely well positioned as the only one who has a suite of products and the only one that has best-of-breed products that are in a suite that can then combine it, to your point, with a PaaS capability that allows you to extend those applications without destroying the upgradeability of the application suite that you bought. So, it\u2019s great \u2013 our pipeline a year ago at SAM, I made a statement about the size of our pipeline. Probably nobody remembers it because it seems like a long time ago. Think about since then, our pipeline in SaaS, this is our annualized pipeline, has more than doubled, more than doubled off of a really big number. So, now you have got a pipeline scale. And the great thing is I know nobody thought it at the time. You have seen it now come through the pipeline and turn into bookings. And my expectations are very favorable as I have indicated about what SaaS bookings are going to look like for the rest of the year. Ken Bond : Next question, please. Operator? Operator : Next question will come from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital. Ross MacMillan : Thanks a lot. Safra, I would like to drill into your comments on cloud gross margins and the expansion that you are expecting as we exit this year and look further out, pretty significant. And I guess the question is, is that really just driven by revenue scale? And is there a certain level of revenue scale in PaaS and SaaS that you need to achieve the target 80% in two years? Thanks. Safra Catz : Okay. Well, it\u2019s actually going to hit in many ways on \u2013 in both revenue and expenses, because we have, as Larry explained, we have invested immense resources in building up our infrastructure. And as I mentioned on the call, our capital expenditure numbers have been very, very large as compared to what we are used to historically. And so we have put out those expenditures and we have started to amortize them. However, in the second half of this year, our capital expenditure numbers are going to be significantly lower, even significantly lower than even this quarter. You will see, I believe, at least another $100 million decline and then a continuing reduction. And the reason that matters is because what you will simultaneously be seeing is a massive amount of revenue which can finally be recognized. That is going to start in true earnest in the second half of the year, in Q3 and Q4 while simultaneously we will not be adding capacity. In fact, we will be spending less than we historically have spent on capital expenditures. We will be back to numbers that you would have looked at and seen in fiscal year \u201814. So, as expenses \u2013 and in addition, you understand, it\u2019s not only capital expenditures, it\u2019s all sorts of staffing and labor and tools, etcetera that have all been put in place. And we will not have to add them while the revenue is going to start flowing both out of the balance sheet, which is extremely apparent and you will be able to look at it in detail in the Q filing that we should do either at the end of this week or at the beginning of next and in our new sales. So, that\u2019s what it is. Revenue up, expenses stabilizing, and actually going down. Ken Bond : Thank you, Safra. Next question. Ross MacMillan : Thanks, Safra. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Kash Rangan : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. My question is for Safra. Safra, how do you view the investment trade-off between the license business and the cloud business, because I think it\u2019s pretty apparent to us that one business has higher growth but lower margin? And when I parse your comments, it looks like CapEx is going to come down for the cloud business. So, are we at a point where the license business has trough and it\u2019s not going to decline anymore and that the profit growth out of the cloud business will start to add on? And that this year, in some sense it\u2019s the trough in your operating profits. A lot of the other software companies have been attempting to make this model transition, have been resetting their numbers for the license business by their own volition is coming down troughing and then the cloud business starts to pick up. So, where is \u2013 how should we look at Oracle in the context of a shift that\u2019s happening? Thank you very much. Safra Catz : Sure. Well, first of all, the way we look at the on-premise business and I am not sure I am entirely understanding your question, but there is the new licenses, and of course, our massive installed base of license subscription. We look at that as the on-premise business. And that business is steady, growing slightly, very profitable of course, because we are at scale. We still make a lot of investments in that area. However, you should be thinking about the cloud business as another way for us to offer that same software to our customers in a different way, where we are actually hosting the software and doing a lot more of the labor. And because we will have economies of scale, they could not possibly have as individual customers. So, really it\u2019s all one business. However, more and more, when we provide it as a cloud provider, we are providing the hardware, the software, the labor all in a package and that gives us a significantly larger amount of their wallet share. Simultaneously, the customer is actually spending less overall, because we can supply this package in a very economical way. But also since all of it is our own differentiated intellectual property, we can do it at much higher margins. And the more scale we get, the more profitable we will be. We have been in a startup mode in this whole area. We have done it basically within our profit envelope. However, this extremely quick transition, which you are truly seeing the pivot in this fiscal year, which is the reason we are breaking it out for you and really breaking our own rules of guidance where we are actually giving you a full year guidance so you can see how we are coming out of it. Kash Rangan : So Safra, I want to conclude this and take this the financial implication, could this year be the operating profits? And then as a result of the nice investments, we start to see the operating income of the company start to grow from next fiscal year? Safra Catz : I believe it is, yes, absolutely. Kash Rangan : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Ken Bond : Next question please. Kash Rangan : That\u2019s it for me. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill : Thanks. Mark and Safra, I think your investors understand this transition to cloud is going to take time, but the ramp is definitely taking longer than some of the financial forecasts you have given the last several quarters. And now you are calling for a weaker first half, but a better second half. I guess just what\u2019s underpinning your confidence that this ramp is going to happen in the back half? Safra Catz : Frankly, it\u2019s not possible that it does not happen. These are \u2013 there is a lot of revenue on the balance sheet that will be recognized in the second half. It cannot be. It is appropriate to do that to the extent that in some cases, customers have been through their promotion period and also we just have booked so many contracts that are ramping up and billing and starting to bill, there really is \u2013 it\u2019s not avoidable. It is inevitable that Q2 is \u2013 that have to \u2013 second half is going to be very significant. Mark Hurd : Brent, I just to add to it, first, we have the contract. Second, when you look at the balance sheet, you see the $1 billion of deferred, you can just do the math. So, we have the contracts and so it\u2019s just not, to Safra\u2019s point, it\u2019s not a guessing game. Brent Thill : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Just to follow-up on the license guide, Safra, for the full year, you mentioned that, that will stabilize versus what you saw last year in terms of the decline. What was giving you the confidence there that, that will stabilize versus what you saw last year? Mark Hurd : Well, I have my forecast. I have my closure rates that I am expecting. Remember, it\u2019s not new license only, it is a software. It is our software installed base with extremely high renewal rates that continues when we sell new licenses in addition to our base then we get additional growth. Again, it\u2019s \u2013 the only question is what level is decline we have in new license. We are being conservative. There is always risk that it won\u2019t be. But again, new license has gotten to be a smaller percentage of that whole on-premise business. And we are doing the same type of estimating that we do, do our best with all the data we have. Brent Thill : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Safra, I wanted to stay on that point a little bit. So, if you look at the license number that we see at the moment, it was like last quarter was minus 10, this quarter was minus 9. And obviously with the cloud transition going on which impacts you negatively, can you talk a little bit about other factors that might impact us and we all heard about the issues around China, etcetera. So, maybe talk a little bit about what you see in the different regions that might impact that growth number as well? Thank you. Safra Catz : Sure. I mean, look, there is no question that internationally, there is quite a lot of chaos to say the least. And the currency impact of countries that we have been doing very well is not helping. Even though my Latin America team is executing out of the park in constant currency, the devaluation of the different currencies in LAD, for example, are very negatively affecting my U.S. dollar results. Obviously, there is quite a lot going on in Europe in different parts and both that and currency. I feel that Asia-Pacific for us is actually stabilizing. China is not a big country for us historically. So, that\u2019s less of an issue for us directly, but the countries and businesses that are impacted by the China trade like Australia, Canada, Brazil, those can be at risk. So, I am not an economist. I \u2013 these things are impacted by especially transactional business like new hardware sales or new license sales are impacted by these regional issues. But in general, on-premise software, which is dominated by software updates and product support customers renew because that is software that is very important to them and is doing the most important work in their companies, governments or non-profits. And so that is obviously very, very steady for us and continues to do well, but the transactional business is at the same potential risk. However, the cloud momentum is so strong that overall, we expect very significant growth and that is from contracts already in hand in most cases. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : And our final question today will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. John DiFucci : Thank you. Safra, I would like to better understand something I thought I understood, but it\u2019s how exactly your bookings of SaaS and PaaS convert to revenue. For instance, bookings \u2013 PaaS and SaaS bookings last quarter were somewhere around $425 million. And if you assume this was signed towards the end of the quarter, I would expect cloud revenue SaaS and PaaS to grow sequentially by about a quarter of this number or by about $100 million, but it only grew by little more than $30 million. And I am just curious is PaaS, because it sounded like PaaS was like a real big quarter last quarter. Is the revenue recognition like SaaS, where it\u2019s recognized immediately in the same amount over like the three years of the contract or is it recognized a little differently where it\u2019s recognized as the customer consumes the technology? What am I missing here? Safra Catz : You are actually not missing anything. You are exactly asking the right question. And unfortunately, the answer is it depends because depending on what kind of agreement the customer signed, they may have signed a metered agreement, which means it will be recognized as they use it. However, it will expire after a certain time period if they don\u2019t use it, when that is what we call metered. On the other hand, to the extent that they have a subscription, then let\u2019s say, one month\u2019s worth is recognized and then another month whether they use it or not. So, SaaS is almost always a subscription. PaaS can be either metered or a subscription. And so it is recognized differently and that\u2019s it. John DiFucci : That actually makes a ton of sense. It\u2019s really helpful. But just one quick question follow-up to that, once if it\u2019s a metered PaaS deal and it expires, at that time, given the contract terms, the customers, does that you recognize anything remaining on that contract at the time of expiration? Safra Catz : If it\u2019s expired, let\u2019s say, they bought $100,000 metered, you could almost consider it a gift card. If they use it all on the first day, I book it alright then. If they don\u2019t use it at all, I book it when it expires. John DiFucci : Perfect. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks, Safra. Mark Hurd : John, I will just add on SaaS, just to make sure you understand what\u2019s happening as we get to Q3, because Safra talked about Q3 and Q4. So, when we entered the SaaS market, we had a series of promotions, meaning that you would get some time to install. Our strategy was to give you an incentive when you bought that you had time to then implement and that promotion had a certain amount of time associated with it. Obviously, that was part of building up our reference base. Secondly, as we built up our reference base, we actually shortened the promotions. So, that actually \u2013 it actually went down by half the period of time. The two sets of promotions over the last couple of years, just by coincidence, coterminously end at the end of Q2. So, the percent of the bookings that were on those types of promotions both end at the end of Q2 of this fiscal year. So, that\u2019s why one of the reasons in SaaS, why you will see a jump in revenue that also will not be explained by bookings. So, again, while you said I couldn\u2019t explain Q2 to bookings, you won\u2019t be able to explain exactly the alignment of the increase in revenue based on the bookings either, because underneath it is this promotions. So, there are multiple dimensions here. There is just promotion dimension. There is the dimension that Safra described, which is about 1% of our PaaS is metered and 1% of our PaaS is subscription. So, there is a couple of different ways you can consume the PaaS. In addition to it, it takes a certain amount of time for us in some cases, I told you about a win, for example, last quarter at HSBC, a very large ERP in the cloud win. It will take us several months to fully provision that ERP for HSBC. So, it\u2019s those factors together that formulate the conversion of the booking to revenue. John DiFucci : But just to be clear, Mark\u2026 Mark Hurd : And one more time why we are so confident? We have the contracts. We know the expiration of the promotions. We know exactly when the PaaS expires. And in addition, you see all of that as it relates to deferred on the balance sheet. John DiFucci : Great. And just to be clear, Mark, once you start \u2013 you are really giving in the SaaS, the SaaS examples you gave, it\u2019s still once it starts to be \u2013 you may delay the beginning when you should begin to start recognizing the revenue, but it will be recognized as a subscription so evenly over the term? Mark Hurd : Yes, it is. It\u2019s a very important tool, John, because instead of discounting, you actually renew against a higher rate and the promotion is basically a window by which you have time to get installed. And it\u2019s a very important tool as you are building up a reference base. And that\u2019s what we have done. Now, the promotions over that period of time, call that a two or three-year period of time have declined and declined and declined. So, the amount of promotion that\u2019s available in our SaaS portfolio today is materially smaller than it was two years ago and materially smaller than it was a year ago. And so what happens is we think the confluence of events really come together in Q3, which is where you see this pop in our revenue. And then from there, you will begin to see a more ratable alignment of bookings to revenue sort of save the one point about the PaaS consumption that Safra was making. John DiFucci : Okay, great. That\u2019s all really helpful. Thanks Mark. Mark Hurd : Thanks, John. Ken Bond : Thank you, Mark. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department for follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for closing. Operator : Thank you for participating on today\u2019s conference call. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect and we thank you for your participation.",

John DiFucci - Jefferies Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital Brad Reback - Stifel Nicolaus Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI Joel Fishbein \u2013 BTIG Operator : Welcome to Oracle\u2019s Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Release. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Ken Bond : Thank you, Holly, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports on our 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we will begin with a few prepared remarks. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2, I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q3 and Q4 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As you can imagine, we\u2019re very pleased with the quarter. Total revenue exceeded my guidance, driven by the combined strength of our cloud business, as well as better than expected results from the on-premise software business. Earnings per share were also above my guidance coming in $0.04 better than the midpoint of the constant currency range I provided last quarter. Q2 currency headwinds were mostly as expected around 6% in most categories, including total revenues. However, the currency effect to earnings per share was $0.06, $0.01 more than my guidance. We will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls, so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarter, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. Considering the progress we\u2019ve made in our transition to the cloud in the subscription business, from now on, I\u2019m going to start with our SaaS and PaaS business. We continue to see excellent momentum there with bookings growth of 75% for this quarter on top of the 147% we reported last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $487 million, up 38% from last year, 39% in GAAP. Sequentially, SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 8%, and we expect the sequential growth next quarter will be even higher. The bookings growth that we have been experiencing will now translate into a significant acceleration in SaaS and PaaS revenue growth in Q3, where we could hit 50% revenue growth and in Q4 where it should be even higher. You can also see the coming revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 68% in U.S. dollars this quarter. On top of the 70% growth last quarter, also the gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.1 billion and was up a 135% in U.S. dollar. We\u2019ve put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail. The balance of our cloud revenues come from cloud infrastructure as a service, which was up a 11% to a $165 million. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will see much higher growth rates, we expect infrastructure as a service revenue growth, which is currently dominated by our hosting business will be more moderate for now. Total cloud revenues, which is Saas, PaaS, and IaaS were $652 million, up 30%. As our cloud revenue continues \u2013 as our cloud revenue business continues to scale from the growth we are experiencing, it is beginning to benefit our margin, as I previously predicted. The Q2 gross margins for SaaS and PaaS was 43%, up from 40% last quarter, and we\u2019ll see further improvement in Q3. I also expect the Q4 exit rate gross margin for Saas and PaaS will be around 55% to 60%, and from there we\u2019ll be targeting 80% in fiscal year 2018. The gross margin in the IaaS business was up slightly to 45%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $195 million, or $251 million lower than Q1. And I expect the cloud-based cloud-related CapEx for the full-year will be lower than last year, as we utilized the investments we have made. On-premise software revenues, including new software license and software license update and product support was unchanged at $6.4 billion. Software license update and product support revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5% from last year and up 1% sequentially. Attach and renewal rates are running at their usual high level. New software license revenue was $1.7 billion, down from last year, but a bit better than I expected for the quarter. Over the full-year, I expect we will see modest growth in our on-premise software revenue comprised of continued growth in software support that more than offset declines in new software license. Finally, total hardware revenue was down 10%, which included a hardware products revenue of $573 million and hardware support revenue of $550 million. Total revenue for the quarter was unchanged at $9 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.7 billion and operating margin was 41%. I believe this for the fiscal year, we are currently in, we are more than halfway through what will turn out to been the trough year for operating income. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% and the GAAP tax rate was 17.6%, as we saw some one-time non-cash benefit. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.63 in USD and GAAP EPS was $0.51 in USD. As I said earlier, non-GAAP EPS was $0.06 lower, due to currency. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $11.3 billion. We now have more than $52 billion in cash and marketable securities, net of debt, our cash position is over $10.4 billion. Short-term deferred revenue balance is $7 billion, up 9% in constant currency. This quarter we repurchased more than 86 million shares for a total of $3.25 billion and over the last four years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 16%. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased more than $250 million share for a total of $10.3 billion, and paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is more than a 110% of our free cash flow. I\u2019d also like to formally welcome Raymond James to Oracle\u2019s Board, she is a great addition. Now to the guidance. I\u2019m going to give you guidance for Q3 and then some preliminary guidance for Q4. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition and clearly customers are rapidly adopting Oracle. As you know, we\u2019re expecting to see a material second-half acceleration in our SaaS/PaaS revenue, based on our bookings growth and the expiration of customer promotion. My guidance will reflect this making it easier to see that we are taking share in the industry. Since we have a clear trend and visibility through the end of our fiscal year, I\u2019m going to give not only Q3 guidance, but also some guidance for Q4. My intention is to share with you what we are seeing in our business now that we have a line of sight to it. All my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. We expect to see continued volatility in exchange rate. I\u2019m going to give you constant currency guidance. But if current exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see currency headwind of 4% on revenue and $0.03 to EPS, which is significantly less than Q2. So onto guidance. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 49 and 53%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow between 3 to 7%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow 3 to 4%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from zero to positive 3. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.63 and $0.66. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%. Of course, if this quarter is any example it may be \u2013 it may end up being different, probably better. Looking further out to Q4, we expect to see continued acceleration in SaaS and PaaS, as well as a return to EPS growth year-over-year. My guidance for Q4 is also in constant currency. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow between 69 \u2013 65 and 69%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow 1 to 5%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 2 and 4%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 1 to 3%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.83 and $0.86, which is a significant increase compared to last year\u2019s $0.78. As I said before, I believe fiscal year 2016 is a trough year for profitability, as we move to the cloud. As such, I expect to see strong EPS growth in Q1 and beyond. My Q4 EPS guidance assumes the same non-GAAP tax rate as Q3 at 25.5%, but that\u2019s probably too early to get a real beat on. Finally, SaaS and PaaS gross margins are expected to improve in both Q3 and Q4 exiting the year between 55% and 60%. I will, of course, revisit Q4 guidance with you as part of the Q3 earnings call. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark for his comments. Mark Hurd : Thanks much, Safra. So in the spirit of giving you just a blizzard of numbers, I\u2019m going to extend that. Because our strong cloud bookings deferred revenue growth will lead to revenue acceleration in the second-half and next year, we talked about a 38% year-on-year double-digit growth. Our billings grew 68%, and again, this give you a number, Salesforce grew 21% and Workday 41%, we grew 68%. Bookings $284 in USD. In cloud 75% growth. Let me give you some customer numbers. We added 857 new SaaS customers in the quarter, 720 customer expansions. Our installed base is now over 10,000 customers. Over 3,000 of these are Fusion and almost 50% of our bookings in dollars are now Fusion. In HCM, we added 211 customers, growing faster than Workday, CX 409 customers. In ERP, we added 311 customers. We are now over 1,500 customers are installed base. 450 are now live, 5X Workdays, 90. ERP and EPM more than half of our Q2 wins did not have Oracle on-premise apps, mean that in one quarter, we sold more net new customers than Workday did in its lifetime. In PaaS, we added 1,343 new PaaS customers, 4,100 now over the last 12 months. Bookings are 100 million in USD and 75% of what we sold is now subscription, non-metered, 25% metered, our PaaS business is scaling nicely. Now, I\u2019m going to review a bunch of names. I just want you to get a context for sort of the brands we closed in the quarter. In ERP, Blue Shield of California, DHL, FDIC, McKesson, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric, [indiscernible], a very large phone company in France, a very large industrial manufacturing company, perhaps the largest in the world with over a $130 billion of revenue. In HCM, AAA, Allergan, City of Aspen, Crocs, think of many of these now that I\u2019m naming again beats against Workday, Exelon, Kaiser, McGraw Hill, Genesis actually a replacement of Workday, Brocade, More HCM, the United Nations, Stanford University. In CX, AmBev \u2013 CXP and being customer experience, AmBev, Expedia, Halliburton, Lufthansa, Maersk, Motorola Solutions, Sears, Toshiba Mitsubishi and United Airlines. In PaaS, Anthem, IKEA, Kaiser, Kia Motors, Maersk, Qantas, Symantec and Windstream, I could have named a lot more. I just wanted to give you a flavor for what we did in the quarter. Just to wrap up and connect a few dots for you on the Oracle Saas/PaaS cloud, we are currently at a $2.6 billion run rate in total cloud revenue. It\u2019s likely our quarterly run rate will exit the year around $3.2 billion, and we\u2019ll grow further after Q1 bookings. We will book roughly a 1.5 \u2013 more than 1.5 million in ARO this fiscal year, 1.5 billion, sorry, thank you, billion. If we continue to book the way we expect, we should see our first $1 billion quarter for SaaS/PaaS revenue next year. Gross deferred revenue is now nearly $1.1 billion. That is up 135% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter. Gross margin improved sequentially, as Safra described 40% to 43%. We\u2019re headed to 60%, and then as Safra described on to 80%. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Lawrence Ellison : Thanks, Mark. I don\u2019t have nearly as many numbers. I\u2019m moving right up to 25,000 feet and talk a little bit about strategy. Oracle\u2019s strategy is to differentiate our cloud products from our competitors. In SaaS, we differentiate by delivering the industry\u2019s most complete suite cloud application. In customer experience, we offer a CX suite made up of sales, service, marketing, e-commerce, and a lot more. In human capital management, we have an HCM suite made up of human resources, recruiting, training and so on. In Enterprise Resource Planning, we are delivering an ERP suite net of a financials, supply chain, manufacturing and all the rest. Oracle is the first company to mark it a complete cloud ERP suite from mid-size and large enterprises. By pioneering this market, we have become the ERP market leader with over 1,500 cloud ERP customers. Cloud ERP is now our fastest growing SaaS application suite. In past, we have differentiated by making it effortless for our hundreds of thousands of customers to move their millions of existing Oracle databases and job of programs to our cloud with a push of a button, thereby obtaining the low-cost and ease of use to the cloud without having to sacrifice any performance loss or any securities degradation. We now have a highly differentiated rapidly growing SaaS and PaaS businesses. This coming year, we will deliver a number of innovations in infrastructure to service as well. We expect that our rapidly growing cloud business will drive Oracle\u2019s overall revenue and overall profit growth for years and years to come. Mark Hurd : Thank you, Larry. Holly, could we please move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Thank you so much. Safra, I had a question for you, just based on yours and Mark\u2019s comments about the $1.5 billion plus in SaaS/PaaS PaaS bookings this fiscal year. Is it reasonable then to assume that in fiscal 2017 that we should see SaaS/PaaS revenue growth accelerate versus what you\u2019re guiding too for fiscal 2016? Thank you. Safra Catz : Yes, Heather, in fact it will accelerate very strongly, it can\u2019t help itself. Our bookings are so strong. We\u2019ve had so many contracts already, and we\u2019ll be recognizing those basically regardless of how bookings go and, of course, as you can see our bookings are also accelerating. So but, yes, we\u2019re going to have a phenomenal as far as 2017 in the cloud business. Thank you. Mark Hurd : Yes, you know, it has the right from the start it\u2019s going to be strong, because you\u2019re going to wind up with our Q4 at the revenue rate that that we just gave you some guidance on, you have the bookings on top of it. And when you start Q1 and into Q2, you can already do the math on what the comparison is going to look like. So it\u2019s going to be a strong year and particularly strong start. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Mark Hurd : Next question please? Operator : And your next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. John DiFucci : Hi. Thank you. Safra, it\u2019s nice to see some modest progress in your gross margin goals for the cloud business 43% versus 40% last quarter. But non-GAAP operating margin was at 41% was a little bit low what we were looking for anyway. I guess, can you expand a little bit on the gross margin progress since the end of the year. I mean, this is going to be a steep ramp, and I\u2019m just trying to \u2013 try to figure out how much of this is just based simply on this sort of top line growth you\u2019re going to see as the sales promotions sort of and when you start to see top line grow, that\u2019s going to happen or how much of it, if there\u2019s any just to increase deficiencies as you move along? And then on the operating margin side, I realize, you don\u2019t hedge the income statement, but was this due like could \u2013 like what would have been the impact on excluding foreign exchange effects? Safra Catz : So, okay, so let\u2019s backup. It is all. The bulk of the SaaS and PaaS margin improvement is because we\u2019re now recognizing revenues for which a much, much large revenues for which we have already paid for many of the cost. And so we built up an infrastructure that can handle massive amount of usage, significantly more usage, and we have not been able to recognize revenue, because we\u2019re recognizing it ratably. As we scale, this is absolutely an area where it is inevitable that we \u2013 that \u2013 this improves. In addition, we also have efficiency gains at all times, but that is again because of our larger scale and those are simply current use of scale. But the bulk of it is, we\u2019re starting to be able to recognize revenues for which we have already invested. As how many points, actually the impact on operating income for us was quite significant from a currency point of view. But hold on, I\u2019m doing the math, Q3, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019ve got to actually do it on our margins. I have to do it while you\u2019re talking, while other people are talking, and then I\u2019ll give you the exact answer at that point how much of it was\u2026 Mark Hurd : Yes, we\u2019ll circle back to later in the call here. Why don\u2019t we go to the next question please? John DiFucci : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Ross MacMillan : Thanks for taking my question. Mark, I think by my math of cloud bookings are about $475 billion year-to-date. And so the hit to $1.5 billion for the year, $1.5 billion, you need to deliver billionish or so in the second-half. Just how confident are you in that goal? And then related to that, I\u2019m curious on the platform or database as a service, you commented that non-metered was a higher percentage. I was just curious to get a sense of how you see customer usage trending on the database as a service product? Thanks. Mark Hurd : Okay. Well, let me tell you confident that will be my answer to your question. Our pipeline, I think, I mentioned this at Financial Analyst Day, but I\u2019m going to mention it again. Our pipeline, I can\u2019t come up with a better analytical statement then just huge. And so our pipeline now is multiple billions of dollars, let me give you more color. If I look at the next six months our pipeline of things that are in the next six months funnel, you have a multi-billion dollar funnel and our conversion rate is increased. So that would tell you. And our business has become skilled enough or just to be clear that, it now is behaving like a large business begins to in terms of the scale of funnel, the pipeline, the discipline we have, the conversion rates we have et cetera. So that would be sort of my view on that on. On PaaS, we have had a change to your point of going away from metered to subscription of bookings. So the bookings are now the bulk, as I mentioned is a 75% now subscription as opposed to metered. And I would say the usage of our PaaS has increased not significantly, but sort of geometrically, meaning that it\u2019s gone from when we originally started the usage to jumped up over the last four or six months, I\u2019d say to where the usage is extremely hot, extremely high in terms of the increase of our usage. So it\u2019s very exciting both in the bookings, the type of bookings, and the usage that we\u2019re seeing of what\u2019s booked. Ross MacMillan : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Phil Winslow : Hi, thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter, particularly in the cloud. Mark, you gave some pretty impressive metrics both on the customer account side, obviously in addition to the numbers that we talked about in terms of just cloud billings. But if I focus on the SaaS side in particular here, really just a competitive question here, obviously, you put up some numbers that are sort of multiple times the size of your competitors. When you kind of look application by application, because none of us see every segments are same. Where do you think you\u2019re kind of pulling away from the competition? Where do you \u2013 have you seen sort of the biggest change you think in that position over the past quarter, one, two years, that would be great? Thanks. Mark Hurd : Well, it\u2019s hard to get, I\u2019m going to make this. This is going to be like the fifth time I\u2019ve said this. But I\u2019m going to try it again that in SaaS overall, we\u2019re just better overall. We have more people. We\u2019re well trained. Our products are matured, and we have a lot of references. Our position in ERP is just unique. We don\u2019t have a competitor per se. I use these metrics to against Workday just to describe to you how expedientially far ahead of our sort of only person I can think of that\u2019s built the product. Just to be clear in ERP SaaS, I don\u2019t ever \u2013 I\u2019m not trying to say it or might have somebody she knows or Larry might know. So I mean, don\u2019t see SAP. I now in the market a lot. I don\u2019t see him. So I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re working on, but it\u2019s not ERP SaaS. In HCM, I think, we are continue to just get better and better and better. I mentioned, because I had a blizzard of names that I may have done myself with this service by mentioning so many names. But in the companies we actually replaced Workday. So imagine in a period of time Workday so \u2013 sorry, in HCM, we replaced Workday. So we continue to get better and better and better at HCM, and now we\u2019re beginning to see a lot of deals better where you\u2019re selling ERP and HCM is attached to the ERP sale. So because of ERP being a \u2013 in many ways a very strategic, very sticky sale, we now see our attach rates moving up and up and up where somebody buys ERP and they buy HCM at the same time. The scale of our Fusion products and the reason I gave you that metric for the first time is it is now a very high, it\u2019s not beginning to become a reasonable percent of our total portfolio versus everything that we\u2019ve got, including marketing, which is having a great run as you know. But I add to it the fact that now the Fusion products, which are extremely sticky, almost 50% of our total bookings. So, I mean, I could feel like you keep going down these metrics for you. But I think we\u2019re unique in ERP and getting further ahead, I mean, we\u2019re at a point now we have over 1,500 customers, and we\u2019ll give you a prognostication where we end the year. But I \u2013 it\u2019s going to be well over 2,000, I guess, it did. It\u2019s going to be well over 2,000. We\u2019re getting better and better at HCM. We\u2019re in a leadership position in marketing. I feel good about where we sit. Phil Winslow : Got it. Perfect. Thanks. Congrats, guys. Mark Hurd : Thanks, Phil. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my question. We talked a lot about cloud. But can I talk \u2013 ask about the database business? So 12C is in beta since OpenWorld. Can you talk a little bit about what are you seeing becoming closer to release two now hopefully. What are you seeing out in the market? Thank you. Mark Hurd : Well, we see our customers with a much higher uptake of 12.2 simply because they have two key features that are very important to our customers. One is the In-Memory aspect of the database, where now have the PaaS\u2019 In-Memory database. And the way you take advantage of that, you take any existing Oracle application and you run it without change on 12.2, and it runs much, much fast \u2013 it runs in memory without changing. So other people say, we\u2019ll use market in-memory database. We have to rewrite the application. In this case, you don\u2019t have to rewrite the application, you press the button. We run much faster and by the way we went faster in the competition. So we have a lot of our customers wanted to take advantage of in-memory acceleration, that\u2019s one of the reasons they buy the new version of the database. The other thing is multi-tenancy. They\u2019d like to do a lot of consolidation there, but a lot of small databases. They\u2019d like to run on one machine and you can do that much more efficiently by running the Oracle database with multiple tenants. You consume less hardware resources that\u2019s easier to manage. You can backup a whole suite of databases as a group of databases is one, it\u2019s thoroughly automated. So that\u2019s the other major reason we see a very rapid uptake. And finally, we\u2019re seeing our customers, as our PaaS business begins to increase in adoption. The customer wants to run the latest version of the database in the cloud and they want to match that up with the latest version of the database in their data center. They want to run this basically the same technology, both in our cloud in our \u2013 and their data center. And that\u2019s one of the unique value propositions that we offer our cloud customers the same exact technology on-premise and in the cloud. And those things will then co-exist for years and years to come. Then the customers are seeking up their version. We have a latest version in the cloud. They want the latest version on-premise. That\u2019s also accelerating the adoption of the database on-premise. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel Nicolaus. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. If I look at the results geographically Asia and Europe look to be pretty solid especially given what\u2019s going on in Asia. North America seem to lag a bit. Were there any specific items that led to that underperformance? Mark Hurd : No. Safra Catz : No, you are also looking at the Americas, no. So, for example, hardware revenues particularly problematic for us in Latin America seems like that. So while you look at the Americas, you are actually seeing Latin America, which has issues, of course\u2026 Mark Hurd : With Brazil. Safra Catz : Brazil and North America, Canada, altogether. Mark Hurd : Yes, U.S. was fine. I think to your point, Asia was strong. We\u2019ve been doing our team as we talked about this before. We\u2019ve been doing a lot of rebuilding in Asia and then has really shown promise for us and the results reflect that in the quarter. Europe had a solid quarter overall excellent results from the cloud and U.S. was fine, we would be able to describe it. In the Americas, as Safra\u2019s point, you have the inclusion of Latin America, which is a great organization. It\u2019s done a great job. They\u2019re gaining share. In fact, if I look at every sort of metric we have in Latin America, we gain share in virtually every category we compete in the Latin America. But within the context of the quarter, the situation in Brazil is tough, which is reflected in these overall Americas results that you\u2019re describing. Brad Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. Mark, I just want to double click on the strength in Fusion ERP, I guess, if we could. Just given how far in front you seem to be in that area. Are there any specific verticals or geographies that are sort of outsized in terms of how you guys are doing? And I was also curious about how much of the strength is sort of you guys going into the mid-market in a bigger way or the mid, upper, mid market in a bigger way? Are you actually starting to see some broader G 2,000 deals as well in terms of the ERP product? Thanks very much. Mark Hurd : Well, my inclination to answer to your question, yes. But let me try to describe sort of what\u2019s happening. We talked a bit this a little bit at financial Analyst Day. The good news about ERP or ERP suite is it\u2019s still not available, it\u2019s just going into other geographies. So with the last release we had, we now brought on manufacturing and supply chain. We\u2019re now releasing the product for sale in some like, for example, in Brazil and some European countries. So we actually get some geographic expansion with the last release we had. So this is actually good news. The strong in this case actually get stronger. We actually now have material number of references. I think I mentioned, but I\u2019m going to try again. We have over now 450 customers wide. This is a big, big metric. Our market also expands in a couple of ways with ERP, which makes it so important. We get two increases on our total available market, one is what you mentioned, the fact that we actually get to go down market now. And, yes, we do have broad market expansion. We get to compete for companies that otherwise would never have had 90 staff couldn\u2019t have assembled in ERP system, we now get to compete. We also now remember when were in an ERP system, we were in the hardware we win everything, we win the whole stack. So our TAM really goes up on total available market on two dimensions, the total stack in addition to our ability to compete down market. Now that\u2019s broad based, I \u2013 that\u2019s why I specifically used the names I did. Our success is not unique to mid-market or up-market, it\u2019s really both I mentioned the name of the biggest tele \u2013 I didn\u2019t mention the name very, very big telephone company in France very big industrial company, these are huge companies at the same time as we have $50 million company that are moving to our cloud ERP. So it is broad-based success across geographies. But the good news, I believe, I think we\u2019re just really getting started. Kirk Materne : Great. Thanks. Happy holidays. Mark Hurd : Thank you. Same to you. Operator : We do have time for one follow-up question. And final question will come from the line of Joel Fishbein with BTIG. Joel Fishbein : Hi, Larry. At Analyst Day you talked about building second-generation data center architecture that should improve Oracle\u2019s overall competitive positioning. Can you give us a little more color on what changes you\u2019re making and when this will be rolled out? Mark Hurd : Well, again, I said we\u2019d \u2013 in my short remark before we start the Q&A I said that we will be delivering innovations and infrastructure as a service. And we have a next-generation data center that we\u2019ve been architecting and building, in fact, with actually put out the data centers actually kind of up and running. There are actually three data centers what we call on availability zone, they\u2019re all connected by a fiber-optic ring. And the thing we\u2019ve really that we focused on a number of things, obviously availability, performance, but security are all things you would expect us to focus on. The big surprise \u2013 the big surprise, as we think, we would be by far the lowest cost provider of infrastructure as a service. We think we\u2019ve been in this business a very long time. We\u2019re very focused. This is our data \u2013 this is data center version two. We\u2019ve been doing this for a while now. And we think that our cost of delivering infrastructure as a service in the cloud much, much, much lower than anyone else\u2019s cost with this new architecture. And with these new data centers, we\u2019ll be passing that on to our customers. Joel Fishbein : Great. Thank you. Safra Catz : Okay. I just needed to answer, I think the question is quite similar. I think it\u2019s about from here about 3.5 to 4 point, something like that, okay? Joel Fishbein : Thank you, Safra. Ken Bond : A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for closing. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect, and we thank you for your participation.",

As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ken Bond : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking call, we will begin with a few prepared remarks. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3 then I will review guidance for Q4 and I\u2019ll provide some color even on Q1 and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As you can imagine, we are pleased with this quarter. Total revenue was inside my guidance, driven by the fantastic performance of our SaaS/PaaS business, which was well beyond the high-end of my guidance. Earnings per share was a penny above the high-end of my guidance even with the currency headwinds being a penny worse than expected. Q3 currency headwinds were largely as expected around 4% in most categories including total revenue, but as I just said, the currency effect to earnings per share was a penny worse than expected at $0.04 more than instead of the $0.03 I guided too. We will continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls, so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters as well as to reflect how we measure the business. I\u2019m going to start with our SaaS and PaaS business, where we continue to see excellent momentum. Bookings grew 77% this quarter and that\u2019s on top of the 129%, we reported last year. SaaS and PaaS revenue was $585 million, up 60% from last year. Sequentially, SaaS and PaaS revenue grew 21% with PaaS up more than 150% sequentially and our data-as-a-service business continuing to take off. Our sustained SaaS/PaaS bookings growth is now translating into significant acceleration of our SaaS/PaaS revenue growth. And in Q4, we could see double-digit essential revenue growth again. You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $1.1 billion and was up 96% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 32% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail. The balance of our cloud revenue comes from cloud infrastructure-as-a-service, which was up 2% to $152 million. While SaaS and PaaS revenue will be much \u2013 we\u2019ll see much higher growth rate. We expect infrastructure-as-a-service revenue growth will be more moderate for now as it is currently dominated by our hosting business. Total cloud revenues, which is Saas and PaaS revenue as well as infrastructure-as-a-service revenue were $737 million, up 43% from last year. As our Saas and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q3 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 51%, up from 43% last quarter, and we will see further improvement in Q4 and from there we will be targeting 80% over time. On-premise software revenues including new software license and software license update and product support was unchanged at $6.3 billion. Software license update and product support revenue was $4.7 billion, up 5% from last year. Attach and renewal rates are running at their usual high level. New software license revenue was $1.7 billion, down from last year as customers continue to direct new spend to Oracle Cloud Services. Over this fiscal year, I expect constant currency on-premise software revenue will be positive, comprised of continued growth in software support that offsets decline in new software license. Finally, total hardware revenue was down 8%, which included hardware products revenue of $604 million and hardware support revenue of $531 million. Total revenue for the quarter was up 1% at $9 billion. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion and the operating margin was 42%. I continue to believe, assuming no more wild currency swings that this fiscal year that FY 2016 the one we\u2019re in will turn out to have been the trough year for operating income. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22.6% and the GAAP tax rate was 21.6% as we saw some catch-up benefits largely related to the U.S. R&D tax credit. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.64 in USD and GAAP EPS was $0.50 in USD. As I mentioned before, had the dollar not strengthened, the GAAP and non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.04 higher. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.1 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $368 million with just a bit over 15% being cloud-related. And I expect that cloud-related CapEx for the full-year will be dramatically lower than last year as we utilize the investments that have been made. Now the non-cloud CapEx was dominated by real estate lead by the Austin, Texas campus, we are building to support our cloud sales organization as well as moving and consolidating teams and other lines of business currently in other locations. Free cash flow, over the last four quarters, was $12.5 billion. We now have nearly $51 billion in cash and marketable securities, net of debt our cash position is nearly $11 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $6.9 billion, up 11% in constant currency. This quarter we repurchased nearly 61 million shares for a total of $2.2 billion and over the last four years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 16%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by $10 billion, the board also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Over the last 12 months, share repurchases have totaled $10.5 billion and we have paid out $2.6 billion in dividend for a total that is nearly 120% of our free cash flow. Now before I turn to guidance, as many of you know, the move to cloud is a generational shift in technology that is the biggest and most important opportunity in our company\u2019s history. We embarked on this transformation over 10 years ago, when we began rewriting all of our software to enable our customers to leverage our solutions as cloud solution. We now have the most complete set of cloud services in the industry with more than $11,000 of our customers around the word already using these cloud services to help run their business. We ourselves have been going through an operational transformation which I\u2019ll actually be sharing more of in our in-house town hall that we\u2019ll be having for our own employees later today. But we are really aiming to be the easiest company in the business to do business with and you\u2019re going to see some very good positive changes that we think our customers will love. Now, as I said, we\u2019re not quite at the end of the beginning as we\u2019re actively working to transform our entire business, but I think you\u2019re going to see the results. And we are far enough along that our financial statements will begin to show our success with accelerating revenue growth, operating margin expansion over time leading to very solid EPS growth. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition and clearly customers are rapidly adopting Oracle. My guidance will reflect this, making it easier to see that we are taking shares in the industry. Now to the guidance, I\u2019m going to give you the guidance for Q4 and then some preliminary comments for Q1, all of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. We expect to see continued volatility in exchange rate. But I\u2019m going to give you constant currency guidance. But if current exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, we expect to see currency headwinds of about 2% on revenue and about $0.02 on EPS. So onto the guidance for Q4. SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow 57% to 61%. Cloud IaaS revenue is expected to grow negative 1% to positive 3%. Total cloud and on-premise software is expected to grow between 1% and 2%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from negative 2% to positive 1%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.82 and $0.85 up from $0.78 last Q4 depending on the mix of the revenues and tax rate. Looking further out for Q1, SaaS and PaaS revenue growth should be higher than the 59% mid point of my Q4 guidance. SaaS and PaaS gross margin are expected to be higher than Q4 gross margins. Q1 non-GAAP EPS growth should be very solid. I will revisit Q1 with you as part of the Q4 earnings call in June. With that, I turn it over to Larry for his comments. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra, and hi, everybody. Oracle is now selling more new SaaS and PaaS annually recurring cloud revenue than any other company in the world including Salesforce.com. We are growing much faster than Salesforce.com more than twice as fast. Because we sell into a lot more SaaS and PaaS market than they do. We compete directly with Salesforce.com in every segment of the SaaS customer experience market including sales, service and market. But Oracle also competes in huge SaaS markets, were Salesforce.com does not compete at all, such as ERP and HCM. It took many years for Oracle to develop the most complete ERP suite in the cloud including Fusion Financials, procurement, supply chain, logistics, manufacturing and much, much more. That long effort is now paying off. Oracle Fusion ERP is the overall market leader in the enterprise cloud ERP market. We have more than 10 times the number of customers than Workday. I should say we have more than 10 times the number of ERP customers than Workday. And ERP has always been a much larger market than CRM. Salesforce.com is missing all of that ERP market opportunity. The breadth of our ERP HCM and CRM SaaS product portfolio combined with the technical superiority of our underlying SaaS cloud services should enable us to sustain our rapid cloud growth for a long period of time. And that in term should make it easy for Oracle to pass salesforce.com and become the largest SaaS and PaaS Cloud Company in the world. With that I\u2019ll pass it on to Mark. Mark Hurd : Thanks Larry. First I apologize for my voice today. Yes, I\u2019m going to do my best to get some information out here even though with my voice. SaaS PaaS deferred revenue of 96% that Safra mentioned, is growing three times the rate of salesforce and twice the rate of Workday. We\u2019ve booked $310 million in ARR in the quarter, 77% CD growth in Q3, up sequentially from 75%. Our PaaS bookings were $106 million in USD. Our pipeline is huge, SaaS, PaaS. We\u2019re on track for a $1.5 billion of ARR bookings. Customer caps, SaaS, we have 942 new SaaS customers in the quarter. Over half were Fusion wins. We had 783 customer expansions in the quarter, an all time high. Our installed base of SaaS customers is now 11,000. CX, we have 465 customer wins in Q3, more than 500 expansions. HCM 213 new customers in Q3. Over the past two years, we have nearly doubled the number of customers of Workday and we are seeing a lot of Workday defections. In ERP, 334 customers in Q3, a 175 did not have Oracle on-premise apps before they bought. We are clearly taking share; our installed base is now well over 1,800 customers. Together Fusion HCM and ERP had more go lives in the last six quarters, than Workdays life time total. And I would like to use the word in the competition for ERP customers between us and Workday it is a slaughter. Go lives in the quarter, we had \u2013 closing in on 1,500 customers. That are now wide on fusion. Our Q3 was our best go live quarter ever. In PaaS, we had 1,143 new PaaS customers. Our installed base now has nearly 5,000 customers. Well, that\u2019s a big number from starting from zero; it is still an enormous opportunity with 310,000 on-premise database customers. This business is going to be extremely large for us. Our renewals continue to improve our renewal rates were higher than previous year. Now, I\u2019m going to give you a few customer wins, just so you have some context of names and brands in the quarter that committed to our solutions. Infusion HCM cloud I\u2019m going to readout some names, Acasta, Adventist Health, Blue Shield of California, Cooperative Group, GeneRally, Real Networks, Sisters of Charity Health System, SuperValu, Technip, Vanderbilt University, Yum! Brands, ERP, Adventist Health, American Institute of Physics, Bluebird Bio, Boston Market, Culinary Institute of America, Cal State University, Dresser-Rand, Harvard Medical Facility, Japan Airlines, Orange in France, SuperValu, Scholastic, SunEdison, Vanderbilt University, The University of Kansas, Velpro, Yum! Brands, in Sales Cloud, Adventist Health, Cigna, GE Intelligent Systems, Kaiser Permanente, Lego, Omron, Real Networks, Suncorp, Telecom Italia Brazil, Travelport, Trenitalia, in Marketing Cloud AIG, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canon, Citigroup, Quintin Foundation, Coach, Dish, Forever 21, TeleServices, Landmark Group, Lego Company, Morningstar, Nestle, Princess Cruises, Quicken Loans, Snapfish, Vodafone. Now, I only named those for you and you heard many names mentioned multiple times. And I did that on purpose so you understand some of the cross pillar opportunities that exist as we go forward that when we see the connection rate between ERP and HCM, sales cloud and marketing cloud, which we think are amazing opportunities going forward as Larry described. We are the only one in the market with the breadth of portfolio that we have today. With that, we\u2019ll take your questions. Ken Bond : Operator, you may begin the Q&A portion please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you, guys for taking my question. Mark, I was wondering if you could share with us your new cloud ARR goal of $1.5 billion that you have for this current fiscal year. I believe you are at close to $800 million now, which would mean obviously you need to sell about $700 million or sign about $700 million in Q4. I mean notwithstanding you just gave us a lot of good data points on customer wins in the quarter, but can you give us walk us through what gives you confidence in attaining that number and then my follow-up would just be to that, any early thoughts on what ARR could look like next year, could it be above the $1.5 billion for this year. Thank you. Mark Hurd : Sure. First, I mean I feel Heather no difference than I did maybe year and half or so, ago when we talked about the leading indicators for our growth in SaaS PaaS and starts with our pipeline. The fact that we have that \u2013 our pipeline going into Q4 is the biggest we have ever had. As I said in my prepared comments it is I think I used the term huge it is a big pipeline. Second for us is our billing to convert that and our conversion rate. And what you really have to track is the relative growth rates in each quarter and obviously our expectation that we\u2019ll have a strong Q4. As I said before I\u2019m going to reiterate again. We\u2019re going to do nothing but just get better and better at this business. We have obviously a large quantity of people in the salesforce. We staffed our salesforce two or three years ago. We have trained them. We\u2019ve now trained them multiple times. We now have references not only deals that we have closed, but as I mentioned our go lives are now scaled up. And so the ability for us now for breath of references and the fact as I mentioned that we sell across multiple pillars will give us, we just make a tremendous opportunity, so we\u2019re very, very encouraged. To next year, I am not going to give you, next year guidance other than your point of should it be higher. I think the answer is absolutely yes. Heather Bellini : Thank you very much. Mark Hurd : Thank you. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits : Hey, guys, and perhaps Safra in particular thanks for taking the question. It\u2019s a follow-up really for blizzard Heather said that, bookings side, but maybe on the revenue side, given that SaaS and PaaS bookings have been so strong 2016, any early thoughts on what SaaS PaaS revenue could grow than the growth could be like in 2017 and could be higher than it was in 2016. Safra Catz : Yes. Well, I think what you are obviously saying, I\u2019ve already given your little bit guidance on Q4 SaaS/PaaS revenue and telling you the Q1 would be even higher. I think that this is we\u2019re in an extremely virtuous cycle with the business now, because success breeds even more success. We have so many customers\u2019 lives we have so much interest from our customer base, and from prospects, et cetera, that as we deliver on our orders that we already have and get even more orders we\u2019re very, very upbeat on the growth rate. Additionally, I think as we work through some of our metered purchases over the years, those are all going to be turning into revenue as utilization continues to go up. So we have both the subscription business, which just continues to grow. But we\u2019ve also working our way through metered bookings which turn into revenue when they\u2019re utilized. So we\u2019re very, very upbeat about our position in the cycle. Michael Turits : [Indiscernible] Mark Hurd : By the way, metered revenue was a highlight in the quarter for us. The usage a steady incline in usage was even higher than what we\u2019d modeled. It was very encouraging. Safra Catz : Did you ask a two-part question or was that it, did I cover? Michael Turits : Well, that was half two-part, the other two \u2013 the other half way would be on the margin side on cloud, I think you said that you are still working towards 80% gross margin\u2026 Safra Catz : Yes. Michael Turits : \u2026talked about. So is that what\u2019s really contributing to this being the trough here on a dollar basis and what could we see going forward? Safra Catz : Well it\u2019s really sort of everything coming together. So revenues going up, spending as you could tell our in the cloud capital expenditure is really, really tailed off and we are using all of that infrastructure that we put in. So when you\u2019re not spending more, but your revenues are coming in at these kind of levels and the whole business also \u2013 we also have a situation where the revenue for the whole company starting to go up. Then operating income is going to improve. But our SaaS and PaaS margins are on their way up they\u2019ve been really flying high as we said they would than over the last two quarters. And we expect that to continue as revenue continues to go up and expenses do not go up as much and that\u2019s what is going to happen and its happening. Michael Turits : Great Safra, thanks very much. Safra Catz : Thank you. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : Hi, first of all [indiscernible] for you Safra, you said back in September the top income would trough this year and six months later. You seem to be delivering, so congratulations making that commitment real. Larry, question for you on the database side, when you look at today the market landscape there\u2019s AWS that wants to go after your business, Microsoft just announced a SQL server running on Linux, and everybody seems to be offering CREDA program, swapping out your Oracle license for their license. Why are they doing this Larry? Is it just because the field that industry views Oracle as this big giant that is less flexible with pricing lot? Is that right, is that the industry feels like they need to take you guys on? I just want to see the comparative flare-up when you \u2013 to see how you look at this and how do you \u2013 how should we be thinking of Oracle\u2019s presence in the database market a few years from now, given these threats? And I guess, there\u2019s a follow-up, Safra, is there a database as a service model transition happening? How worried or not that licenses and databases could continue to move with the cloud like the Adobe [indiscernible]. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Ken Bond : Well, our PaaS business grew at a 150% this past quarter. So our customers, I mean, it\u2019s interesting that Microsoft is now offering people\u2019s server on Linux. But people want Oracle in the cloud. People have a huge investment in Oracle products. I mean, people are coming after us, because we are by far the market leader in database. If you\u2019re in the database business, the only when you can come after is us. So, of course, Amazon, they\u2019re going to be in the database business too is coming after us, and of course Microsoft wants to be bigger in the database business, they have to come after us. We\u2019re the biggest player. We see our customers, literally millions of applications and millions of users of those applications built on top of the Oracle database, wanting to move those applications into the cloud and we do that very well. Our PaaS service is even easier to use and better than Oracle is on-premise. So we see the next generation of our database business predominantly in the cloud that will still sell an awful lot of that software on-premise. The beauty of what we offer is the same exact database experience on-premise and in the cloud and the ability for our customers to move a workload from on-premise and into the cloud, and move data from on-premise into the cloud with the push of the button. That\u2019s something that Microsoft can\u2019t offer. We have a huge installed base that wants to migrate to the cloud, but still wants to have an on-premise infrastructure. And we provide graceful compatibility and coexistence with what\u2019s in your data center and what\u2019s in the cloud, as you begin that decade-long migration to the cloud. We\u2019ve made a bunch of \u2013 sorry for the long answer, we\u2019ve made a bunch of enhancements to our database including multi-tenancy and memory, a lot of advanced security to make it easier and favor to go to the cloud. We think that gives us a huge competitive advantage and that our customers aren\u2019t going to leave us quite the contrary, our customers are going to move a lot of what they have to the Oracle cloud. Kash Rangan : And the one to Safra, please model transition and databases. Thank you. Safra Catz : Well, the way I guess you should think about it is we would be thrilled if everyone of our Oracle database customer came over to our cloud instead of running it on-premise. That would be fabulous. Now do we expect many of them? Many of them clearly are doing it. But we have such an enormous installed base that some of them will put new applications in the cloud, or different types and development in the cloud or a combination or a hybrid. But we would be delighted. You should think about it as if our customers move to the cloud, that means that they not only of course pay us for the software, but we also offer them a service where we own the hardware and we manage, and we do all the labor, and so even though they end up paying us more than they would have historically, just for a support license, a support fee, but they themselves are customers end up spending a lot left, in total because of the massive economies of scale we have in running the Oracle database for them. That they would not have on their own. So it would be delightful, if they\u2019d all move. But some are moving and many are moving, which is wonderful. But I think this will take quite a long time and some will stay on-premise, in definitely and that\u2019s entirely their choice. Ken Bond : Thanks Kash. Kash Rangan : And can I and let me add one more thing. Ken Bond : Thank you, very much. But let me add one more thing which is a lot of people over the years have come after us in database. The problem is if you want to move to SAP HANA, you have to rewrite your application. If you want to move to Amazon database, and they have a couple, you have to rewrite your application. That is just a huge barrier for our customers. Our customers want to run their existing applications faster and more securely in the cloud. They want to make an easy transition. We\u2019re very comfortable we get depend our leading position in the database market. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Next question please. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. John DiFucci : Thank you. I know there is a lot of moving parts at this point in your model. And I\u2019d like to ask a two part question each side of it and I think these both go to market. First of all, license was a little shy of what the Street was looking for realize that\u2019s stuff you don\u2019t guide license, but the cloud was a lot stronger. So is it fair to assume the cannibalization is happening at a more aggressive rate than when Mark, last gave us a numbers on it. I think market Oracle open world to say that I think at that point 0.8% of the maintenance for SaaS, just SaaS a transition to cloud. And then on the cloud side, I believe you are seeing some of your first renewals of deals that were likely signed early on amidst like significant promotions at attractive rates. So I think the consensus assumption or at least my assumption would be that those renewal rates would be pretty low. But I think you just said that you\u2019re seeing good renewal rates even better than you had seen. So I was wondering if you can comment on that so one cannibalization and second, cloud renewals. Mark Hurd : Okay. So first on the renewal rate what I said in my comments where our renewals rates were up year-over-year. They were up I think I made this statement at last quarter, that they were up almost 500 basis points. So that would just give you some idea of our year-to-year improvement in renewals. John, I would tell you that is as good as our renewal rates are they will get materially better. So the first sets of Fusion HCM, Fusion ERP, those numbers while you are right. They are all promotions, they are not yet to a renewal stage. So they are sticky, think of it is our stickiest application, which will drive very, very, very high renewal rates are not yet baked into the \u2013 now very high in improving renewal numbers that we\u2019ve got. So that\u2019s your second question. To your first question, listen to your point, we\u2019re making that trade every day. If we can trade license for cloud that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. And so to your point, yes, you saw a more momentum in the cloud business than probably, you have models and we look at that is great. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re continuing to focus on this continuing to drive movement to the cloud. And if we do, we get as we model this out again at open world that means more money for us, more revenue for us, long run. So when we can get a booking, a choice of a booking, may be as good as cover this one more time. If we get $1 of booking cloud and $1 of booking in license. In next year we get the support on the license. And next year that dollar we get as a booking, we get another dollar of revenue. So the fact that you see those dollars shift that has an absolute good thing for us, John. John DiFucci : Good. Mark. Are you seeing more people that are on existing maintenance move to the cloud and existing customer versus new workloads? Mark Hurd : I think let\u2019s be clear. Safra said that in her prepared comments that our support renewal rates whereas high as ever so. This really is the points that we talked about earlier, but let\u2019s say it again when people are thinking about debt test as an example, there is a movement of debt test to the cloud particularly debt test of new applications. Am I going to now getting a new license to for debt test for that new application like I\u2019m do in the cloud? And the opportunity to now do in the cloud is what you\u2019re seeing a lot of those new jobs go and that\u2019s certainly through our debt test. John DiFucci : Okay, great. Thank you. Mark Hurd : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Philip Winslow : Hi, thanks guys, congrats on a really strong quarter. A lot of focuses, obviously been on the database side of the house, so far I wanted to focusing on the SaaS side of the cloud. Mark you rattled off some pretty impressive customer win counts and also just names reflected on HCM and the ERP side. If you just like the ERP, EPM customer win rate of the huge quarter look like year-over-year. If you listen to some of your competitors calls they talk about displacements of fusion and some of your cloud applications, which seems to obviously go against what our check saying, what thesenumbers say itself. Hopefully, you kind of clear the area here, what are you seeing competitively particularly ERP, HCM in the cloud? Mark Hurd : Well I mean. I don\u2019t know on the ERP I can keep giving you these counts I\u2019ve heard Workday guys say they\u2019ve got 200. This reminds me when I was originally looking for Hanets many years ago, when I couldn\u2019t find the Hanet I don\u2019t know where there are 200 ERPs from \u2013 don\u2019t even take their number, we\u2019re 10x bigger than them. Now in HCM, I don\u2019t know what to tell you I mean I can give you a few brands I mean there is Southwestern Energy. They had Workday and stopped their Workday implementation and use Oracle. Fannie Mae used Workday no longer does and now uses Oracle. ArcGIS they used Workday and they use Workday in the U.S. They went to a global decision for HR, decided on Oracle and replaced their Workday implementation in the U.S. MoneyGram started off implementing Workday. It didn\u2019t go well, reevaluated and now have Oracle HCM cloud as their core HR for their enterprise. Same thing shows that Molina Healthcare. One of the first implementations of Workday, I think it was in Asia-Pacific, was it Simick in Australia. They now stopped their Workday implementation removed it and installed Oracle HCM. Genesis, who\u2019s technology provider here in the Valley, they implemented Workday stop throw it out, and have been implementing Oracle HCM. BrightSource switched to Oracle upon a renewal opportunity for HCM with Workday. So, I mean, California physicians, I mean, Safra is giving me the\u2026 Safra Catz : Stop\u2026 Mark Hurd : Stop but listen, this is just, I get all this stuff that, I hear all this rhetoric and I\u2019m just trying to give you, these are like real companies. That said, we\u2019re going to stop and we\u2019re going to go implement Oracle HCM. And so, that\u2019s what I see going in the market. And that\u2019s why I continue to read all brand names, so we can get away from words and rhetoric and get down to what\u2019s really happening. So Phil, the numbers in ERP are what they are, the names in HCM and let\u2019s just go, I mean, let\u2019s go back to customer counts. The real customers, I mean, what \u2013 you can do the extrapolation, I know you do of how many customers that they\u2019re getting new in the marketplace versus how many new we\u2019re getting in the marketplace. So, I\u2019d like to just put the names and the numbers speak for themselves. So, that\u2019s my answer Phil. Philip Winslow : Great, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to shift gears a little bit the market like a global market environments a little bit nervous, I\u2019m just looking down at your geographic performance, I see Asia coming back nicely this quarter, and then stable in Europe and in U.S. can you just comment a little bit what you\u2019re seeing out there, and I\u2019m sorry, Mark, to express your voice a little bit longer but that\u2019s probably you. Thank you. Mark Hurd : Okay. I think, what you say is right. I think that Asia-Pacific, I don\u2019t think we want to call that a macro, or make any macro discussions other than \u2013 I think our performance in Asia-Pacific is much improved. I think, we took one of our really experienced leaders in the company. And I think, he is done a marvelous job in rebuilding our Asia-Pacific team, and I think it shows in the numbers. So I think our Asia-Pacific performance isn\u2019t necessarily a macro statement, it\u2019s a statement about the improvements in our execution in Asia. I do think that your comments about the stability in U.S., we\u2019ve had very strong performance in many of our SaaS businesses in the United States. Our ERP performance here, our HCM performance here, had really been very strong. The same thing would hold through in Europe as well. I will say that if there\u2019s anything I would comment on the macro that we do see as \u2013 we do see the issues in Brazil, probably more than anything else. And we don\u2019t generally make macro comments, but I would say we have a \u2013 my opinion, you don\u2019t have to be aware of, but we have a marvelous team in Latin America. You looked over the past several years, but the amount \u2013 this is on my chart of market shares. They have gain market share virtually every single category that we compete in virtually every year for the last five years. Their performance cloud SaaS/PaaS has been superb, but we do see what\u2019s gone on in Brazil, say that, I think the rest of your statements are correct. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. Mark, just a follow-on a little bit on the geographic question. Could you just talk about cloud momentum outside the U.S.? And so what the competitive environment is for some of your SaaS/PaaS products. It seems that you just have some of a distribution advantage against some of your competitors there. I was just kind of curious about the sort of maturity of the markets to accept PaaS \u2013 SaaS and PaaS now. And then just sort of your fleets are going up against in deals. Thanks. Mark Hurd : What was the last thing you said, we\u2019re going up against \u2013 where did you missing\u2026 Kirk Materne : Just competition internationally first on the SaaS/PaaS\u2026 Mark Hurd : Okay. Yes, I think the maturation of the cloud market or if you will the acceptance of cloud market is becoming \u2013 is global. And I think we\u2019ve seen that over the past couple of years. It used to be three, four years ago, when I was talking about cloud in Europe, I would get incredible amounts of resistance to issues around security, data sovereignty, et cetera. Many of those are beginning to go away. Now certainly some of that has been the fact that we now have built out over the past couple of years, data center infrastructure and have so many locations. We have an incredible \u2013 by the way, I can tell you Kirky, you realized quickly why you don\u2019t want to get into this cloud business, because the barriers to entry are extreme when you want to go global.  Many of these customers want to know their data is in their country and that\u2019s much of the CapEx we invested a couple of years ago. That we put in and that\u2019s a big advantage for us. Most of our competitors don\u2019t have that infrastructure deployed around the world that we now do. To your point, we also have a very scaled distribution capability in all of those countries. And I think you have this growing acceptance of cloud at both the SaaS and PaaS layer, that I don\u2019t have a metric on it. I can just tell you that the acceptance level of \u2013 I\u2019m now going to do my Dev test in the cloud. And I\u2019m talking about this happening in Korea, in Australia in Brazil, is now a regular conversation with all of our customers. So, I would say, acceptance is extremely high, but added to the fact that our distribution and our breadth of delivery capability in local basis is at least than a SaaS market, sort of unmatched to me. Kirk Materne : Thanks a lot, Mark. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Brent Thill : Thanks. So, for Larry and Mark just on platform and service. It\u2019s early days, but you\u2019re showing really good momentum here. Could you just maybe give us a sense of some of the next milestones you\u2019d like to hit here in the short-term with PaaS. And Mark, you made a comment about 5,000 of the 310,000 database customers who are running PaaS would assume that your belief is that all of those database customers are original candidates to be running PaaS overtime. Can you maybe walk through the dynamics there? Mark Hurd : Let me go first and then I\u2019ll let Larry follow-up. First, as I\u2019ve said in OpenWorld, I\u2019ll reiterate again, if you look at the IT market, the IT market is 30% Dev test. And I actually believe all of that Dev test over the course of next several years will move to the cloud. And I think people will be looking for the most advanced tools and most modern tools, and most renowned capabilities, and I think that\u2019s us. Our ability to deliver Java, deliver 12c to deliver all of the capabilities that we can today, makes the PaaS market an exciting market that\u2019s, frankly, if you look at numbers more exciting and bigger in scale, and opportunity to do even the SaaS market, and you know how well we\u2019re doing in the SaaS market. So I think, I will not give you milestone Brent, today, as a committed to you and I\u2019ll stick to. I want to wait until we get a full year under our belt here, and at OpenWorld next financial analyst meeting, I will go into the same sort of modeling that we did for SaaS. But make no mistake about it, we\u2019re extremely excited about the scale of the opportunity. The pipeline is huge. And I think you\u2019re going to see this Dev testing. I almost think it\u2019s entirely as a segment, going to move to the cloud and there\u2019s nobody with a better stack of capabilities today. I will let Larry, follow-up. Larry Ellison : Okay. I\u2019m sorry, I dropped off for one second. Could you repeat the question? Brent Thill : The question was about the PaaS market and about the ability for it to be a very attractive market long run for Oracle. Larry Ellison : Yes. Well, definitely we expect that \u2013 just like the maturity of our application business is well on its way to moving towards the cloud, that\u2019s the majority of our database business to move to the cloud. And along with that that should drag a lot of infrastructure business where infrastructure is a service compute \u2013 will computed the service, will run the application, really can run any application, on top of our database which we delivered via platform as a service. So, we are just entering the pure infrastructure as a service market which opens up another huge PaaS play for us. So, I mean, you really did think they are two markets, there\u2019s a SaaS/PaaS market and now which people are running our applications on top of our database. And then there is \u2013 if you will, the infrastructure as a service PaaS market, where they\u2019re running virtually any content application they wrote, on top of our database platform as a service. Those are our both enormous markets and we\u2019re really strongly in the first competing with people like Workday, and Salesforce.com. You will see as \u2013 in that much of our database customers are moving over. You\u2019ll see a much more database customers moving over when they compare our platform as a service with our compute, which allows them to run virtually any application in our cloud, much more efficiently, much more sincerely than any place else. And they\u2019re our big competitor will be the sales forces and the Workday, the big competitor will be amazon.com, but we\u2019re going to play \u2013 we\u2019re playing in both of these markets and PaaS will grow driven by cash and cash will also though driven by infrastructure as a service. Huge opportunities. Safra Catz : Okay. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. The telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department for any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you in the future. Thanks you again for joining us. With that I\u2019ll turn the call back to operator for closing. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal year 2016. I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q1 and provide some color on FY 2017, and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. Clearly, we\u2019re thrilled with our results with the most obvious thing being that we dramatically over achieved again in the cloud. For most companies as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows, the growth rates are continuing to increase. In our SaaS/PaaS business, we reported 20% growth in fiscal year 2014, 34% in fiscal year 2015, and now 52% in fiscal year 2016, and not to get ahead of myself, but we expect to see even higher SaaS/PaaS growth this year. We\u2019ll continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly call, so we can have some measure of consistency across quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This past quarter, the effects of currency movements were slightly less than expected with a 1% to 2% headwind in most revenue categories, including 1% to total revenue and a $0.01 headwind to earnings per share. Cloud, SaaS, and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $691 million, up 67% from last year and well above the 61% high-end of my guidance, and up 17% sequentially. Now, as regard to our cloud revenue accounting, we have reviewed it carefully and are completely confident that it is a 100% accurate and if anything slightly conservative. You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.4 billion, up 64% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 38% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We\u2019ve put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail. And though there will be seasonality to some of these numbers, we\u2019re now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday in every way; revenue growth, deferred revenue growth, and billings growth. As our Saas PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q4 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 57%, up from 40% last Q4 and we expect to see further improvements in fiscal year 2017, and from there, we\u2019ll be targeting 80% over time. Combined with cloud infrastructures as a service revenue of $169 million, which was up 8%. Our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $860 million, up 50% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $7.6 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 4% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were $2.8 billion, down 10%, reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support was down 7%, with hardware systems product revenue of $725 million and hardware support revenue of $558 million. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.6 billion, up slightly in constant currency from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion and the operating margin was 45%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 24.4% and EPS was $0.81 in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 24.6% and GAAP EPS was $0.66 in USD. Had currencies not moved by the way, non-GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.01 higher and GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.02 higher. Now covering the full fiscal year, total software and cloud revenues totaled $29 billion, growing 3% in constant currency. Cloud, SaaS and PaaS were $2.2 billion, growing 62%. Cloud infrastructure as a service was $646 million, growing 11%. On-Premise Software grew slightly in constant currency to $26.1 billion, as continued growth in software support offset could-related declines in new software license. So our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to the point that we expect the dollar growth in SaaS/PaaS revenue will exceed the dollar declines in new software license in fiscal year 2017 and beyond. But more importantly, when you look at our software business, we have an On-Premise business basically growing a bit or flattish and the cloud business layering on top of that growing very fast and growing as a percentage of the software business, and then you can understand why we start growing significantly this year. For the year, total revenues grew 2% to $37.1 billion, and operating income was 15.8 billion and assuming no more wild currency swings this fiscal year, I expect that we will see operating income growth this next year. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full-year was 43% and non-GAAP EPS was $2.61. Had currencies not moved, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.17 higher. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.6 billion, with capital expenditures for the quarter at $180 million. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $66 billion in cash and marketable securities, net of debt our cash position is approximately $12.3 billion, a short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.7 billion, up 7% in constant currency. As we said before, we\u2019re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right s that make both strategic and financial sense. This quarter, we repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 272 million shares for a total of $10.4 billion. We paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is 105% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Now, before I turn to guidance, I would like to provide a brief update on the operational transformation that I highlighted last quarter as we are working to position Oracle as our customers\u2019 strategic partner for the cloud. The first phase called the accelerated buying experience was rolled out in March. It was designed to make purchasing cloud services from us fast and simple and was built using our own configured price quote products, sales and service cloud. We believe that we are the first enterprise technology vendor to use click to accept functionality for enterprise customers and that enables our customers to complete their orders with a click of the button. The results for Q4 were fantastic as nearly two-thirds of our cloud deals were processed using the accelerated buying experience, and we saw the quote to book times reduced dramatically. These results are truly amazing, given the introduced the program in Q4 and salespeople had very little time to get use to it. Our customers could then start using our services faster. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition and clearly customers are embracing the move with us. We now have the most complete set of cloud services in the industry with thousands of our customers around the world are using these cloud services to help run their businesses. We\u2019re far enough along that our financial statements will begin to show our success with accelerating revenue growth, operating margin expansion over time leading to very solid EPS growth. Our guidance will reflect this making it easier to see that we are a force to be reckoned within the cloud. Now, to my guidance. I\u2019m going to give you my guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for fiscal year 2017. All of my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now currency \u2013 the current exchange rates remain the same as they are now. We expect to see a currency headwind of about 1% on some parts of cloud revenues, but very little effect on total revenue and EPS. And while we feel fantastic about our own performance and transformations, I\u2019m definitely keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad and going to be a big conservative in my outlook. Even with that said for Q1, I\u2019m raising my earlier guidance for SaaS and PaaS revenue, which we now expect to grow 75% to 80%. And this guidance reflects a bit of additional revenue from acquisitions and higher guidance for the organic business. Software and cloud revenues, including SaaS/PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software and support is expected to grow 5% to 7%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 5%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.60, up from $0.53 last quarter \u2013 last Q1, depending on the mix of revenues and of course the tax rate. Over the full-year for FY 2017, I expect SaaS and PaaS revenue growth will be higher than the 65%, up from 62% in FY 2016. SaaS and PaaS gross margins should exit Q4 FY 2017 much higher than the 57% reported today, as we show steady and continued improvement through the year. And I mentioned earlier \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, but operating income is also expected to grow in constant currency. And with that, I will turn it over to Larry. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you very much, Safra. In the fiscal year just started FY 2017, Oracle has two specifics points of focus. First, we would like to accelerate our SaaS and PaaS growth and make sure we\u2019re at least double, growing at least double the rate of our closest competitors. And we think we have a fighting chance to be the first SaaS company to make it to $10 billion in revenue. We\u2019re the second largest SaaS company in the world now and we think we can be the largest SaaS company, including our \u2013 by the time we hit $10 billion, we\u2019re going to be the first one there. Why do I think that\u2019s possible? One is, we\u2019re already growing at a very high rate much faster than our competitors, we\u2019ve proven, we can do this. Can we keep it up as our business continues to scale. Safra pointed out something that\u2019s shocking, that as we scale our business, our growth rates are going up. Why is that? The explanation is our SaaS portfolio. We compete in virtually every important SaaS area there is. We\u2019re a major player in ERP and HCM. We\u2019re almost the only player in supply chain and manufacturing. We\u2019re the number one player in marketing. We\u2019re very competitive. We\u2019re number one \u2013 tied for number one in service. And we compete against Salesforce.com and sales automation. But in all of these areas, we compete on Salesforce.com, which is the largest SaaS company is really focused on sales automation and some of the other customer experience aspects. They just bought Demandware. They are making acquisitions. They are growing their business, but they are in the customer experience sales area. They don\u2019t compete in the largest category, which is ERP, also not HCM, again supply chain and manufacturing again and we think that gives us a huge advantage that our footprint is wider. And some of these mid-market companies can simply get in all Oracle footprint run their entire enterprise in the cloud on Oracle. That is something that Salesforce can\u2019t offer and we think that\u2019s going to service very well and allow us to keep these very high growth rate, while we go for that to be first at $10 billion, okay that\u2019s one thing. So we want to be one in number one. We think we need to be number one, we think we will be number one in SaaS and PaaS. Second major point of focus is that, our generation two of our infrastructure as a service data center have been built and stocked with computers, and now we\u2019re beginning to bring our customers into these new data centers. Infrastructure as a service is the third leg of Oracle\u2019s cloud strategy. Obviously SaaS, we talk about a lot, and PaaS, we talk a lot about, because those few businesses are growing very rapidly for Oracle. So what\u2019s going on in infrastructure as a service? Well, we\u2019ve had to move to \u2013 we\u2019ve learned a lot about this business. There\u2019s a huge amount of demand by the way for our infrastructure as a service from our existing SaaS customers and our new SaaS customers and even bigger amount of demand, for infrastructure as a service from our database customers. Our database customers want to move their application into our cloud putting their database on to our platform as a service and then their applications, so a lot of custom applications on to our infrastructure as a service, these two things go together. And we built, again, the second generation data center, which we think is highly competitive with anything out there lower cost, better performance, better security, better reliability than any of our competitors, and there\u2019s huge demand for it, and we\u2019re now starting to bring customers into that. We think that\u2019s another very important driver to Oracle for overall growth. We\u2019re growing fast in SaaS. We\u2019re growing fast in PaaS. Now we need to grow fast in infrastructure as a service we\u2019ve made the investments. We have the right technology with our second generation data centers, and we\u2019re very excited about the potential for Oracle with the combination of PaaS and infrastructure as a service for our huge installed base of database customers and helping them move to the cloud. I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark. Mark Hurd : Okay. Thanks, Larry. Just a few more numbers and we\u2019ll take your questions. Cloud bookings over $600 million in USD, 52% growth for us in CD. As a reminder, last year we grew more than 200%, so for this comparison is or this number is against that comparison. In SaaS, roughly $350 million in USD bookings, in PaaS, over $250 million. Just one point of clarification, our ARR bookings are only for new and expansion. So I\u2019ve had some questions about do we include renewals in our bookings? We do not. Renewals are a separate bucket of bookings kept separate in our reporting. As it relates to renewals in the quarter, our renewals for the quarter were up 200 basis points year-over-year. SaaS/PaaS revenue we grew 67%. We grew 17% quarter-on-quarter. ERP/EPM was 58% growth quarter-over-quarter. In HCM, we had our strongest growth rate in three years. That says our business has gotten bigger. In CX, all sales, marketing and service revenue growth rates were up double-digits. In data as a service, we nearly doubled year-over-year. Platform as a service had another break-out quarter. We nearly doubled quarter-on-quarter. Within doubling quarter-on-quarter, our database as a service business more than doubled quarter-on-quarter. Our SaaS/PaaS billings grew 48% in FY 2016. Our SaaS/PaaS deferred revenue grew 64%. To Safra\u2019s point and I want to say it again grew much faster than Salesforce.com and Workday. Now, I want to come to another set of numbers that are actually probably more exciting, our customer metrics. In the quarter, we closed 1,640 new SaaS customers. Nearly, two-thirds were Fusion wins. We had 917 customer expansions that is an all-time high for us. 273 customers, who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. I want to make sure you understand that connect point. We think that connection will actually grow higher as time goes on. Our SaaS installed base is now roughly 12,000 customers. In the quarter, we had \u2013 almost 700 CX customers in 600 expansions. In HCM, 318 new customers, 900 for the year, nearly 2.5 times that\u2019s what Workday reported. In ERP, we had 808 new customers in the quarter. I just want to make sure, I didn\u2019t misspeak, it\u2019s 808 new customers in the quarter. We doubled the FY 2016 count in Q4. Almost 50% of those customers never had an Oracle path. Our installed base is now over 2,500 customers, nearly 2.5 times the installed base from last year. We have 1,577 customers now live on Fusion. We added nearly a 1,000 go-live this year. In PaaS, we added 2,005 new PaaS customers. Our installed base is now nearly 9,000 customers. In closing, this was a big year for us, not only in revenue, but bookings as well, where we sold more than $1.4 billion in ARR. I\u2019m going to make just a couple predictions for the New Year. We had a big year in bookings in FY 2016. We will have a bigger year in FY 2017. Our pipeline is actually today up more than our bookings in our revenue reported growth rates. Revenue growth of 52% this year, our growth rate will be higher than 65% in FY 2017. And as Larry and Safra both mentioned, as our business gets bigger, we continue to grow faster. So with that, we\u2019ll take whatever questions that you might have. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on your cloud progress. I\u2019d like to drill in specifically into Platform as a Service, two parts to my question. The first is, can you give us some more color on your success in PaaS? And second specifically, can you help us with understanding on how you\u2019re expanding the TAM for your database middleware et cetera, and what are the drivers? Is it newer segments, high revenue attach from existing customers? Any help would be appreciated. Mark Hurd : So, Mark, I\u2019ll start and then I think Larry is going to chip in. No question about that total available market expense because obviously when we win \u2013 just like in SaaS, if we win in SaaS, we actually get all of the middleware, all of the database, all of the hardware, we get really all of the services, so we get this multiple support that when we get an application, the whole stack comes with us. The same thing in effect occurs when we get database as a service as well, with it comes all of the other services that come with it as well. In addition, we get to expand our TAM to a whole new set of customers that otherwise we would never have gotten too. We get now to a whole set of mid-market customers that frankly we just didn\u2019t have an opportunity to sell-through before, because you had to have a datacenter, you had to have a computer, and you had to have a staff, and so now all of that TAM is expanded as well. So with a broader market set we get to and a whole set of market share that comes with it. The other thing is the network effect between SaaS, PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service. So if you have, let\u2019s say, your ERP application and it\u2019s an Oracle ERP application then you want to build a bunch of data warehousing applications on top of the data from your ERP system, in a sense it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to have the ERP system at Oracle and I\u2019ll put the data warehousing situation that Microsoft assure. But if you actually look at the pricing of cloud pricing that one part of cloud that\u2019s expensive is moving data out of data center, that\u2019s one thing they charge you a lot of money for it, and that\u2019s the kind of industry pricing the way it works. So moving data between data centers back and forth, back and forth between our data centers can be quite expensive. So there\u2019s an advantage for our built in products. If we have the ERP data and we have the ERP system, we have a built in advantage by offering our PaaS and our infrastructure as a service as a set of tools to allow you to build your data warehouses in your data marks using that ERP data. So I think that gives us a very significant advantage to us, the interaction between SaaS and PaaS and the interaction between PaaS and infrastructure as a service. I\u2019ll go back to infrastructure as a service. Well, why should they \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t it just move to Amazon. I mean, Amazon has been doing this for a while and they\u2019ve got infrastructure as a service. Well, because we handled the Oracle database much better than Amazon does, we can run very large Oracle databases. We run [at full power that way] [ph]. We just do a better job. I mean, this is not the place for me to give you a technical proof, but we do a better job than they do on the Oracle, they run Oracle databases, but we do a much better job. We run it faster, more reliable and more securely. Well, if I\u2019ve got the database in an Oracle \u2013 an Oracle data center in the Oracle cloud, it makes sense for me to put the application at a computer right next to that, that\u2019s higher performance, much lower cost, because I\u2019m not moving all those data in and out of an Amazon data center and in and out of an Oracle data center. Those things are going to be tend to be co-located. So we think we have some built in advantages being a strong player in SaaS and a strong player in PaaS and making it very \u2013 all of the customers who want to get their infrastructure as a service or their related infrastructure as a service from the same cloud supplier in the same data center. Mark Moerdler : Okay, I really appreciate. Lawrence Ellison : Okay. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Thank you very much. Safra, you mentioned growth in operating income in your prepared remarks. I was wondering if you can help us think about how that translates into growth in operating margins? Safra Catz : We expect operating margins to go up also as this continues. Obviously, cloud margins are going to the roof that\u2019s become obvious, and we expect operating margins to increase. So you\u2019ve got revenue increasing and operating margins also increasing over time and operating income increasing also over time. So we\u2019re very \u2013 this is actually a very, very important time for Oracle financially, because what you see is that, we\u2019ve stopped having reductions in really in any of the numbers and we\u2019ve turned up in every way, including EPS. And I know for a while I was telling you, this is a transition and all that. But we feel like we\u2019re officially at the complete end of the beginning. Meaning, we\u2019re now in the mode of increasing improving EPS up, operating income up, revenue up everything we\u2019ve made the transition and we are moving up from here. Mark Hurd : I\u2019d like to comment something in terms of margins. Our generation two of our data center, okay, what was wrong with generation 1, no one asked. Generation one was more expensive than we liked it. One of the great things about our Gen 2 data center is, we think we now have the best bang for the buck, the best class performance data centers in the world with our Gen 2 data centers. We think we, again, we deliver more performance and cost of any cloud provider, we think that\u2019s another huge advantage for us. And we\u2019ll be scaling our business on this new very, very cost effective most modern of all the cloud networks that\u2019s going to help our margins enormously. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : Hey, Oracle team congratulations on the results as well. Mark, I guess, two sub-part questions for you try to keep it brief. One is, how would you explain the magnitude of outperformance on the SaaS and PaaS revenue growth relative to the midpoint of the guidance, wondering if the milestone criteria are turning out to be faster than you expected, or maybe that\u2019s not the case? And secondly, as you look at your SaaS and PaaS revenues, there are a large number, and I\u2019m curious and also get questions from Investors as to what exactly is the relative size or magnitude of growth rates of the categories vis-\u00e0-vis HCM, ERP and CRM, digital marketing, any color you can give us there that would be fantastic? Thank you. Mark Hurd : Sure. First, there\u2019s no one reason why we beat the revenue. It\u2019s a magnet, it\u2019s all of the reasons. I mean, first starts with, we booked more than we planned sort of point one and we not only booked more, we booked more faster than we thought. So it would improve our linearity as we \u2013 our team has done a great job in cloud from a provisioning perspective. Provisioning meaning, we then sell more \u2013 we sell more faster and then we actually get the customer up and running and live and that has another effect done on revenue linearity. In addition, as I mentioned, our renewals were 200 basis points over prior year and not to say, it was better than we expected, but it was good, it was solid and that helped as well. Then we also had more usage on our platform. And so we\u2019ve had this continued sort of not linear, but geometric increase in the usage of our PaaS platform. So those that are not on subscription, but on here just use more. And so when you sort of add up all of those things and no one thing was 80% of its cash, it was really all of those things together added up to the beat that you referenced. Your second question was the relative growth rates to various businesses. I\u2019ll start with there\u2019s sort of all good. It would be the way I would describe it, and the question becomes degree of good. I gave you a number specifically on ERP in terms of growth rate, and that number, I think, I gave it to your quarter-on-quarter in terms of growth rate. Do you know, what I\u2019ll do? As we get towards financial analyst day, I\u2019ll do more of a break-out pillar by pillar, but they\u2019re just all \u2013 I mean, our performance in marketing, our performance in HCM. In the HCM, I can\u2019t help myself here. On HCM, the performance of our team on HCM was just superb, and I mean that\u2019s a global statement Kash. I mean, if we went back to the days of four or five year ago, it\u2019s just amazing, totally what our product team has done, our ability to release new product, our ability to get it to market, the references we\u2019ve gotten, I mean, we get almost 1,000 new HCM customers this year. 2.5 times the guide we were talking about three or four year ago. I mean it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s still \u2013 it\u2019s just \u2013 it was just a superb quarter for us by pillar. And I think to be honest with you, Kash, I think based on what I told you in my prepared remarks on the pipeline, I think it\u2019s going to get better. Kash Rangan : Great to hear that. Congrats again. Mark Hurd : Thanks, Kash. Ken Bond : Next question operator? Operator : Your next question again will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies & Company. John DiFucci : Thank you. I have a question about the database. You announced R2 of 12c back in Oracle open world, and I believe there was a webcast schedule that was postponed or you were supposed to do earlier this month on the database? I realize you can\u2019t talk about the timing of general availability of R2, but can you talk about, I don\u2019t know generally anecdotes about earlier adopters for R2? And then also your expectations of how this will be consumed by customers between license and cloud consumption, because that help with us regardless of how we think of it, how we\u2019re going to model it? Thanks. Mark Hurd : As you know, R2, a lot of people don\u2019t migrate to the DOT1 releases of our DOT1 \u2013 DOT1 releases of our database. They wait for the DOT2 release. So that it is completely stable. We have two key features in version 12 of our database. One is in memory, the other is multi-tenancy, both of those are in high demand. I think it\u2019s made in version 12 of our database, one of the most rapidly adopted versions in many, many years. The question is what will that adoption look like? I think, you\u2019ll see early adoption in the cloud. I think, cloud is going to lead the adoption. So we now have hybrid customer. Typical customer might have said, okay, I\u2019d like to experimenting with release 12 and I\u2019m going to put it on these product development computers over here. Well, we\u2019re encouraging our customers to look an alternative. Why don\u2019t you just use the latest version in the cloud, and why don\u2019t you do your experimentation and your testing and your application migration to \u2013 and your upgrades in the cloud. It\u2019s going to save you some money, and allow you to get access even faster. And we think that what\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re also offering a version of our cloud hardware, our hardware configurations that it\u2019s while \u2013 because it\u2019s for statutory reasons on a bank and for statutory reasons, I really have a hard time moving this application into cloud, no problem. We\u2019ll take our existing cloud or cloud hardware, the exact same configuration, we will move it behind your firewall, and we\u2019ll let you \u2013 and we\u2019ll completely manage it for you behind your firewall. You\u2019ll buy it just like it\u2019s cloud, in other words, you won\u2019t buy the hardware. There will no upfront cost for the hardware. There\u2019s no upfront cost for the software. It will look exactly like the Oracle Cloud. It\u2019s just the boxes will happen to be sitting on your data center floor behind your firewall. So we\u2019re getting people more options to go to the cloud, making it easier for them to go to the cloud, because when our customers go to cloud, which is what we want them to do, and we want them to go earlier and we \u2013 and other opportunity to get them to move to the cloud as \u2013 with accelerated adoption of 12 DOT2 of our database. That\u2019s how we would like them to consume it. If they go to the cloud, they save money and it\u2019s easier for them and we make more money and it\u2019s better for us. So that\u2019s will be pushing our people. So, again, we\u2019re incented and the customer is incented to get to the cloud as quickly as we can. How fast can we make that happen? We made it happen pretty fast in Q4, and we\u2019re going to keep pushing this fiscal year. John DiFucci : Thanks, Larry. That\u2019s helpful, but just one clarification. When you talk about cloud hardware configurations On-Premise, are you alluding to Exadata, is that what you\u2019re talking about, especially for the database? Lawrence Ellison : Actually, it\u2019s very great. I\u2019m glad you asked the question, not just Exadata. So no, it would be our infrastructure as a service configuration and our Exadata configuration together, which is PaaS. So Exadata is really PaaS, it\u2019s just database as a service is what Exadata is, one we install it as part of the cloud that we manage it for you. So we have a separate box, where you\u2019re running compute and block storage and all of our other cloud services. We basically, it\u2019s like we to open another \u2013 cloud datacenter. Imagine, we open another cloud data center at JPMorgan Chase. I\u2019m not picking on my poor friend Jamie Dimon, but that\u2019s my knowledge. We don\u2019t have a deal to do that at JPMorgan Chase. But anyway, but let\u2019s say they \u2013 I\u2019m comfortable, they got certain statutes and regulators wanted to do this behind their firewall. They\u2019re uncomfortable putting in the public cloud. We would actually create a little mini-version of our cloud datacenter on the JPMorgan Chase floor. We would manage it for. They would not buy the hardware. They would not buy the software. They would just buy a cloud subscription, just like it\u2019s in our cloud. It\u2019s just so happens, we would locate that hardware, which we would manage. We would locate that hardware on their floor behind their firewall for more security. But it was just, again, it would be hard \u2013 it will manage as part of the Oracle public cloud. The hardware identical. The software is identical to the Oracle public cloud. We\u2019re just allowing our customers back option. We\u2019re trying to make it easier for them and give them more options to get to the Oracle public cloud, even if you\u2019re a highly regulated bank. John DiFucci : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Philip Winslow, Credit Suisse. Philip Winslow : Hey, thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter, particularly on the cloud and the customer count number on the database with service side, it was quite impressive particularly. Question for Mark, there has been a lot of discussion out there, the rumors just in the market about your changes to the comp plan or the Salesforce focusing on cloud, not licensing and then others saying that you\u2019re dropping the cloud your compensation structure. So, wondering if you could just comment on if there are any changes to comp program to structure the Salesforce or kind of what they\u2019re focused on this fiscal year? That would be great. Mark Hurd : Sure. There \u2013 really is no change to the \u201cstructure\u201d when you throw that in. So we are actually quite happy with our structure in that context. Now we\u2019ve actually cleaned up a few things. So I\u2019ve made some changes three or four years ago to, which group called on what and there were some things that we\u2019ve done that are \u2013 I would describe them as de minimis in terms of changes, but who calls on what size of account et cetera. So there\u2019s a little bit of that, but frankly not much else. We have made an investment, so as I know you know in what we call Oracle Direct. This is selling really a lot of inside sales with a little bit of outside sales that supplement it and we continue to raise the bar for those things. It is a lower cost of sales. It\u2019s a much modern \u2013 more modern way of selling and these are primary vehicle into what you would think of as SMB. And we continued to expand their use, expand the amount of headcount, invest in tools, we talked last \u2013 I think last quarter about investment we made in Austin, the CapEx we spent to build out that very modern center. So think of more of that Phil, more people, more support for that team and they\u2019re actually calling higher in terms of the size of accounts so they call, it very effective for us, more people. But when you look at our spending, our spending actually doesn\u2019t go up nearly as much as the amount of resource that we get as part of those investments. In terms of the comp plan itself, there is no decrease in cloud comp. That\u2019s just pure nonsense of anything. We believe we pay to all salespeople that would like to make money. You sell cloud at Oracle, you will make more money than anywhere else in the industry and that\u2019s our model and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. In terms of On-Prem comp in just application, these are applications that are not our GBU applications. So think of them as our horizontal applications. We now do not retire quota for a license sale. We retire quota just on cloud. They do receive some \u201ccomp\u201d in the context as it relates to a license sale. But Phil, to understand today in horizontal as licenses, the vast majority of all of our licenses are in ERP. And the vast majority of those are add-on seats within ERP, into our existing base more users. And then within that, we put a special team in place that actually focuses on handling that within our user base. So I understand there\u2019s some noise about it, but I would describe this as a non-event. Philip Winslow : Great, thanks for your clarification. Mark Hurd : By the way, I want to add \u2013 because I just can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t help myself. But as of today, we have all of our sales people who have a territory, they have a comp plan, they have a boss and virtually all of our salespeople, since the end of the year, I want to make sure I say this, since the end of our fiscal year have today been trained on all of our newest offerings. So I have had this goal, Larry and I talked about this for years that we would get to the point that by the time we would start a year, instead of it taking forever. By the way, most companies take a quarter, four months, five months to get all this done. Our objective has been that sales people leave the fiscal year on May 31 that as soon as possible, they get out of the year, they have a quota, they have a comp plan, they have a boss, they have a territory and they\u2019ve been trained on everything we\u2019ve got. And I can tell you as we sit here today, that is almost entirely complete for the entire Oracle Corporation. Philip Winslow : Thanks guys. Mark Hurd : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my question. And I want to move up a little bit and talk about geographies on two aspects. First of all, Mark, can you talk a little bit about the success you have in cloud in the different regions. And then secondly more bigger picture is \u2013 obviously worries about end demand et cetera in the different regions and maybe you can comment on what you\u2019re seeing out there in the field in general for the whole business? Thank you. Mark Hurd : I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve missed one word. Did you say, end demand? Raimo Lenschow : Yes. Mark Hurd : Okay. By region, I think our performance in Asia Pacific was superb. Now that comes from where we\u2019ve been over the past couple of years, but I don\u2019t know that I would describe that as a market phenomena, I\u2019m just going to make my comments in the context of Oracle. I think our team in Asia, which we\u2019ve recruited over the past 18 months did a superb job all through the year. I think it culminated in a very strong quarter. We saw very strong growth really across every line. I mean, license performance was quite strong. Both SaaS and PaaS growth rates were superb, so very positive on Asia. I feel the same way in Europe. I mean, there\u2019s mixed economy over in Europe. We don\u2019t actually talk about it much around here, because I think our performance in Europe has been consistent over the years. I think our performance was emblematic of that through the fiscal year and was good and solid in Q4. So I feel very good about it. I think that\u2019s the way I would describe things outside the U.S. LAD. We continue to deal with all the issues in Brazil. I would say within the context of overall LAD relative to the market, because our team performed fantastic. Our movement of the cloud in LAD is perhaps as fast as anything we have across our company. So \u2013 and then you get to the U.S. and I think in applications our move to the U.S. was the quickest, the fastest, and shows up in the majority of these wins that I talked about are in the U.S. I mean, there\u2019s some very exciting movements. Our business in applications in the U.S. is a cloud business, it is not a license business, it is a cloud business. North America Tech has been strong in terms of its PaaS bookings \u2013 platform bookings. And I would say I\u2019d also like to throw in our GBUs. I have to mention the strength of their performance in cloud. The growth rate in our GBUs was superb, led by both our retail business, our hospitality business, and our health sciences GBU. They had a great win at Pfizer in the quarter and they have really kicked their competitor metadata pretty strong over the course of the year, and I\u2019d like to probably give them the credit for that, they\u2019ve done a great, great job. So maybe more data than you wanted, but that\u2019s my view going across the globe. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Very helpful. Thank you. Mark Hurd : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Bradley Reback with Stifel. Bradley Reback : Hey, thanks very much. Safra, could you maybe give us some sense of what the CapEx requirements for the business should be here in 2017? Thanks. Safra Catz : So, overall CapEx should be a little bit more than it is this year very little bit more. And all of that would be actually from the real estate on our real estate side as we build out our campus in Texas. And also we have a little bit more real estate around the country on the cloud CapEx, which is the one I think you guys have really been focusing on. As you know, in FY 2015, it was quite high. It dropped really dramatically like 30% this past year, and it will go up a little bit, but not anywhere near where it was in FY 2016. So I think, generally, it\u2019s going to be around where it is right now. And any increases are entirely as a result of just some real estate thing that will benefit us for decade really as we purchase pieces of property stuff like that. Mark Hurd : To Safra\u2019s point, our cost per seat or a sales rep is declining. So our cost of housing them are countless that we have to make these CapEx investments, but salary, bonus everything as we move with such into this modern selling effort. We have more people, but our cost per seat is actually declining. Safra Catz : Okay. Bradley Reback : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And our final question for today will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. Mark, just given the new customer count in cloud and seen you\u2019re picking up some momentum in the mid-market, especially around ERP. Can you just discuss what\u2019s driving that? Is it just more focus in \u2013 from a sales standpoint? Is it having sort of our suite offering versus just our best-of-breed products? Just any color on that would be helpful. Thanks. Mark Hurd : Yes, Kirk, I just think it\u2019s all of the stuff. I mean, I think listen, I mean, you can\u2019t start with the fact that we have good products, and we have good products that\u2019s a really big advantage. So that\u2019s sort of point one. Point two, we\u2019ve done a lot of training in our salespeople are frankly better and they come in with good products. They now know a lot more about them and we have references, and when you have those sort of combinations, things go well for you. I think we\u2019ve done a good job, putting our people set this point about the investments we\u2019re making. We put our people in these new modern capabilities that are given them great tools now go to market. Now let me say all this against the backdrop of \u2013 I think we\u2019re actually going to get better of this. So I think when you look at our \u2013 you can\u2019t look at them, I can. But when I look at our pipelines, I remember two years ago, I made the statements that I thought our ARR would be good a couple of year ago and lot of people said why? And it is because our pipeline was up and I can see it mature to the pipeline. This pipeline we have now is the strongest best pipeline we\u2019ve had. And I believe our conversion rate meaning the movement of that pipeline into actually booked orders will actually get better for the very reasons we\u2019re describing, so I\u2019m \u2013 quite optimistic about it. Kirk Materne : Thanks. Ken Bond : Thank you, mark. The telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you in the future. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for closing. Operator *: Thank you. Once again, we\u2019d like to thank you for your participation on today\u2019s Oracle\u2019s quarter four 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Kash Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI Joel Fishbein - BTIG Operator : Welcome to Oracle\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year Earnings Conference Call. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s conference over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, sir. Ken Bond : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations Web site. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. Good morning \u2013 good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1, I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q2, and turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments. Clearly, we are pleased with our results, with the most obvious thing being that we overachieved again in the cloud especially in the United States. As you all know, we have pivoted the organization to go after the cloud and we are outperforming even our most aggressive expectations. This has resulted in our growth rate continuing to accelerate as we scale in the cloud, something our competitors are not similarly experiencing. We continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls, so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movements were more than expected mostly because of the surprise Brexit vote happened after our earnings call, resulting in a 1% to 3% headwind in most revenue categories, including 1% to total revenue and EPS, which was a $0.01 lower as a result. Cloud, SaaS, and PaaS revenues for the quarter was $816 million, up 82% from last year and above the 80% high-end of my guidance. While this excellent growth rate was helped a little by recent acquisitions, organic growth accelerated from both Q4 and Q1 of last year. Actually organic SaaS and PaaS growth rates has accelerated for seven straight quarters. You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.5 billion, up 49% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 49% in U.S. dollars this quarter, up from 38% last quarter. We put the billings numbers up on our web site for you to see the detail. Our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to the point where the dollar growth in SaaS and PaaS revenue exceeded the dollar decline in new software license. Together, SaaS and PaaS subscriptions and new software license grew 16% in constant currency. As our Saas and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin also continues to expand. The Q1 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 62%, up from 40% last Q1, and we expect to see further improvements in fiscal year 2017, and from there, we\u2019ll be targeting 80% over time. Combined with cloud infrastructure as a service revenue of $171 million, which was up 10%. Our total cloud revenue in the quarter was nearly $1 billion, up 63% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $5.8 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels, as our growing installed base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow. New software license revenues were slightly over $1 billion, down 10%, reflecting the continued migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support was down 11%, with hardware systems product revenues of $462 million and hardware support revenues of $535 million. Our engineered systems grew mid double-digit lead by Exadata that grew over 30% in the quarter. For the company, total revenues for the quarter was $8.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.4 billion and operating margin was 39%. I need to remind you that the large debt offering we did last quarter cost about $0.005 in EPS in the quarter. The additional interest was not in my guidance as the debt offering took place after the guidance call. For Q2, I expect the added interest will lower EPS by more than $0.01 without the matching benefit of next week\u2019s contribution to earnings, which will be accretive until the deal closes. G&A expenses were also higher than usual in Q1 because of some legal fees, which will be lower in the second quarter and largely gone by Q3 as a result of the settlement of one case and the end of two trials. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was higher than projected due to the geographic mix of earnings, which is driven by our overachievement in cloud revenues in the U.S., resulting in a tax rate of 25.5 and EPS being a $0.01 lower at $0.55 in U.S. dollars, but still up 5% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 22.8% and GAAP EPS was $0.43 in [USD] [ph], up 11% in constant currency. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.7 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter was $299 million. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.6 billion, up 5% from last year. We now have approximately $68 billion in cash and marketable securities, net of debt our cash position is approximately $14.3 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $9.5 billion, up 5% in constant currency. As we said before, we\u2019re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right valuation that make both strategic and financial sense. This quarter, we repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Okay, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. For those of you curious about NetSuite, I can report that we have now cleared antitrust reviews everywhere, except the United States, where our waiting period expires at the end of September. Now, to the guidance. I\u2019m going to give you guidance for Q2 and then some updated comments for the fiscal year. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. And while we feel good about our own performance and transformation, I\u2019m always keeping an eye on the macro environment, [especially abroad] [ph]. If current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, we expect to see SaaS and PaaS revenue is expected to grow again, 78% to 82%, a little bit more than I guided last time. Software and cloud revenue, including SaaS/PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow 3% to 5%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 0% to 3%. EPS is expected to be between $0.59 and $0.62 in constant currency, were it not for the higher tax rate and interest expense, we would expect EPS to grow approximately 4%, or be $0.06 higher. Over the full-year of fiscal year 2017, I\u2019m raising the outlook for fiscal year 2017 SaaS and PaaS revenue growth from 65% to 67%. I continue to expect the SaaS and PaaS gross margins will exit Q4 higher than the 62% reported today, as our cloud business continues to grow dramatically. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark for his comments. Mark Hurd : Thanks, Safra. First, we just had a great quarter. And I want to thank everybody at Oracle for their hard work, all of our employees. I\u2019m going to give you a lot of numbers. Let me start with booking and revenue growth rates. I\u2019m going to give them to you year-on-year in CD, unless I state otherwise. Cloud bookings ARR was $271 million in USD, a 42% growth. As a reminder, ARR growth last year was 166%. SaaS bookings were $165 million USD and PaaS/IaaS bookings were $106 million USD. As Safra said, Saas/PaaS revenue was up 82%, I just want to repeat the seventh consecutive quarter of organic growth acceleration. Our ERP EPM revenue grew 70% quarter-on-quarter. The seventh consecutive quarter with sequential growth that was greater than 50%. In Fusion HCM, we grew 131%, nearly 4 times the growth rate of Workday. In CX separately, up double digits in sales, marketing, and service. Data as a service was up 75%. Platform as a service up 22% quarter-on-quarter. Overall, we grew 82%, the highest global growth rate at any scale cloud company. SaaS/PaaS billings grew 49% in the quarter, up from 38% last quarter. Deferred SaaS/PaaS revenue was up 49%. SaaS customer metrics. We closed 776 new SaaS customers in the quarter. We have 677 expansions. 125 customers, who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. 346 new CX customers, 488 expansions. A 173 new HCM customers drove that great result, inclusive of 69 expansions. 344 ERP EPM customers and 135 expansions. Our active base is now 2,800 customers with a 1,000 live 10x Workday. Over 50% of our ERP EPM customers were net new to Oracle, that never purchased an Oracle app before. Two-thirds of our new customer wins were Fusion. 334 go lives in Fusion, our best quarter ever. 2,032 PaaS customers that were new in the quarter. Our installed base is now 11,000 PaaS customers. 1,671 new infrastructure as a service customers that are supplemental to our PaaS customers. Together our installed base of PaaS and infrastructure is now at 18,892 customers. As a point of clarification, PaaS and infrastructure customers accounted for each service that they use. In closing, this was just a very solid quarter for us, not only in revenue, but bookings and billings. Look forward to few predictions. Q1 bookings were solid at 42%. I believe, Q2 will be better, could even be much better. Q1 revenue was fantastic at 82%. It\u2019s one of the reasons, as Safra described, we\u2019re raising our guidance from 65% to 67%. And I just want to close by saying, we are the fastest growing scale cloud company in the world. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Larry Ellison : Thanks, Mark. We\u2019re very excited about the rollout of our generation 2 infrastructure as a service data centers. These new data centers give us the significant cost and performance advantage over Amazon Web Services. Plus, our new bare metal offering makes it possible for our customers to lift and shift their entire existing corporate infrastructure, data and applications without any changes whatsoever and move it to the Oracle Public Cloud. You just can\u2019t do that with Amazon Web Services. Lift and shift the entire network, DM, database, data, applications, move all of that across to our data centers without changing anything. So real advantage. So for the first time, we have this big technology advantage in the infrastructure as a service. We expect this will enable Oracle to accelerate our infrastructure as a service business to the same high growth rates that we\u2019re currently experiencing in both SaaS and PaaS. With that, we\u2019re ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. Now, we\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Question for Mark. Mark, the bookings number looked impressive and you hinted at the better numbers in Q2. And \u2013 but you also in press release talked about the $2 billion that you want to achieve for this year, which actually needs a slightly better than 42% growth for the year. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers that drive that strong number and the [indiscernible] acceleration here? Thank you. Mark Hurd : Sure. Yes, I mean, obviously, to your point, we grew 42% in the quarter. I actually, as good as that was, we could have done better, that\u2019s how strong our pipeline is right now. And as I told most of you that as we\u2019ve gone through this cloud transition, we\u2019ve got a pipeline, and we understand now with as more data has come clear to us, how that translates to performance, and our performance continues to get better. And I think it\u2019s all of the things we\u2019ve talked about, not only have we got more salespeople than we had before, they\u2019re better trained. Our customers are more aware. We have more references. We have more go lives and all of that feeds together. In addition, we not only have more products, we\u2019re going to release more products, yet, even this week at \u2013 or next week at OpenWorld. But more of our existing products are available in more geographies. So as for example, as we released ERP, ERP actually has not been available in every geographic market in the world as it now is. So you\u2019ve got a culmination of all of these factors that lead into it, but we are going to have a very strong bookings year, as I described. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : This is Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley and thanks for taking the question. From our perspective, it looks like over the past two years, we\u2019ve seen Oracle make a large push away from perpetual licenses towards attrition-based SaaS offerings on the application side of the business. And now, it appears that that push is shifting more on the database tech side of the business, steering more business towards platform as a service. So one, is that a correct assumption that focuses more on database tech going towards platform as a service? And two, how should investors think about the impacts of that shift in FY 2017, in particular? Larry Ellison : Okay. This is Larry. The \u2013 we started our Fusion applications efforts a little over 10 years ago. So we started rewriting all of our applications for the cloud about a decade ago. And when those applications were ready, we moved aggressively to sell those applications. We believe that\u2019s what customers wanted. They wanted cloud-based applications, not on-premise-based application. We have made a huge investment in rewriting all of our applications. And those were ready before \u2013 and we were ready to move into SaaS application. Before we were ready to move into infrastructure as a service or PaaS, we were just ready sooner. So we pushed back. The interest, again, the interesting thing here is, we are just beginning to move our database customers from on-premise into the cloud. Microsoft has already done a very good job of moving their office customers from on-prem into the cloud, and that\u2019s the basis of the overwhelming basis of their cloud growth. The overwhelming basis of our cloud growth are new customers for applications. So we haven\u2019t started shifting our base yet, which I think is very interesting. We got these applications ready. We\u2019re gaining share right and left, let\u2019s say. We mentioned Workday a lot, because there are primary competitor for HCM and ERP in the cloud. And as Mark pointed out, we have 10 times more customers than Workday has in ERP and we sold more, but those are - half of those are net new customers, okay? So that\u2019s us gaining share in that business. We\u2019re now beginning to move our installed base into the cloud. And this is a lot of expansion. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re going to stop running in premise. We believe this is sort of the next decade. This is a coexistent story. They are going to continue running some of their stuff on-premise and they\u2019re going to move some of their stuff into the cloud and those two things have to coexist. And our unique offerings to our customers and database is the fact that we support the identical software on-premise and in the cloud. And you can move data and workload back and forth very, very gracefully, that\u2019s our PaaS offering. And by the way, if you are a SaaS customer, your application is built on top of our database and our middleware. So you buy SaaS with PaaS. You often buy together, as Mark pointed out. Finally, so PaaS was ready second, we were ready, we were moving aggressively in the PaaS. Now what we\u2019re looking for is the third leg of the stool, which is to push into infrastructure as a service, where we have an all new and very [indiscernible] competitor Amazon.com, but we think now with our new generation 2 data centers we have a big competitive advantage over Amazon.com. And people will be buying our PaaS and our infrastructure as a service together. So we sell PaaS twice. Sometimes we package PaaS with our application SaaS together. And this new business is selling PaaS with infrastructure as a service, where they\u2019re building a lot of custom applications or moving existing applications into the cloud. What I think about it is, our SaaS business has got a new business or lot of new customers. We\u2019re just beginning to shift our installed base from the on-premise into the cloud, which is enormous potential for us. And we think we make a lot more money by moving customers off-premise into the cloud, because we do a lot more things for the customer. We help the customers save money, but we also provide with our database storage and networking and compute and all of the associated support service. So we think, again, this is beginning of still more rapid growth for Oracle. Mark Hurd : One thing, I would not want you to walk away with, as you said, shifting from SaaS to PaaS. We\u2019re not shifting. We\u2019re supplementing, I mean, this is in SaaS, we have more energy and more momentum than we\u2019ve ever had. We\u2019re are now taking our foot off of that accelerator. We are supplement \u2013 by the way, let me just be clear to Larry\u2019s point, if we could push a button and move all of our on-prem Oracle database customers to PaaS, we would do it. It is economically beneficial to us. Secondly, we think it\u2019s the way customers also want to buy now. But there is this transition that Larry talked about that we are going through. So but I don\u2019t want to do think SaaS and PaaS have some inner relationships to the energy [indiscernible]. We have separate actually sales organizations to do both. Our energy is on both, we think both are tremendous opportunities about to be supplemented by our infrastructure offerings that Larry referenced. Keith Weiss : Thank you, guys. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian : Hi, great, thank you. It\u2019s Hindlian. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the momentum in the cloud, Larry, Safra, and Mark. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what is driving some of the success you\u2019re seeing there? I know you mentioned conversions on the pipeline are strong and reference customers are now live, but are you seeing any success around the streamlining of cloud purchases through the new accelerated buying experience, or is this more sales compensation changes, and of course, product functionality improvements that\u2019s driving the success in the cloud? Some more comments and color would be very greatly appreciated? Safra Catz : Well, for sure, I think it really is very much all of the above. So let me just address the accelerated buying experience, because the most important part of it is that, we end up being able to service our customers much more quickly, much more efficiently. Our salespeople become so much more productive, they can spend more of their time, really the bulk of their time with the customers outwardly facing, making them successful instead of inwardly facing, dealing with our own back office. So this has really unleashed a massive amount of productivity. Obviously, having many references is critical for the success of software service, because customers all talk to each other and the happier customers lead to more happy customers, which is by the way one of the reasons we love Oracle OpenWorld, because tens of thousands of our customers come and they share their positive experiences and that just gets more and more customers excited and participating. And then, of course, the sales force has an enormous amount of success, which ends up leading to just more success, more productivity. The entire thing, this is very, very virtuous cycle, all of which starts with having the best product. That\u2019s really the bottom line, ultimately. As Larry mentioned, we spent a decade, frankly, it\u2019s a little over a decade in building these products. We had leading products to begin with, but we started and rewrote them all, focused exclusively \u2013 really focused on the cloud and that\u2019s what ultimately shows through. Sarah Hindlian : Thank you, Safra. Safra Catz : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. John DiFucci : Thank you. I\u2019m going to ask another question about the cloud. I mean, when we look at your traction here, and it\u2019s been much better than we would have thought, especially in this quarter, which usually is seasonally slow quarter. I mean, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a company of scale move to cloud with the kind of gusts that we\u2019ve seen here. As Larry mentioned, the cloud move here was mostly new \u2013 I think you said customers, but I think you meant new workloads. I mean, when should we expect to see more customers actually transition current workloads from on-premise to the cloud? And how is this going to affect the aggregate bottom line in the near-term? Larry Ellison : By the way, we met new customers, not the new Workload. [Multiple Speakers] Mark Hurd : He did a mistake. He met new customers. And then we did say and I\u2019ll give you a flavor in the quarters and I didn\u2019t do this for the interest of time. But just give an idea of new customers in the quarter and just SaaS ERP, I mean, we closed Adventist Health, [indiscernible] Rico, Sachs, Tesco, Texas Instruments, UCLA Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center\u2026 John DiFucci : So were these customers never customers of Oracle before? Mark Hurd : They are current app. I mean, [Multiple Speakers] application out there. John DiFucci : Okay. Mark Hurd : We just make a distinction between moving an existing application customer from, let\u2019s say, an Oracle e-business big customers Oracle Fusion ERP and the cloud. John DiFucci : Got it. Mark Hurd : We\u2019re just taking an SAP customer and moving them from SAP to Oracle Fusion application. And I think coming back to the point Larry was making earlier. Most of what you see in our cloud revenue number is customers that more than 50% were customers, who were not an Oracle application customer, before they became an Oracle SaaS customer. So these are really new customers. And then to your point, that are bringing new workloads that we had not before. The exciting part, which again, I\u2019ll go back to what Larry said was, the core of our on-prem user base, particularly in the database arena has not moved. And that is a huge opportunity for us, that\u2019s only people that can move them to the cloud efficiently and effectively or us. John DiFucci : Right. Mark Hurd : So that\u2019s why this is such an excess. We get \u2013 maybe we don\u2019t to as good job as when we did as we feel it here, because what we\u2019ve seen so far is what you would think of, John, is normally the hardest stuff going out and finding net new customers. Larry Ellison : So, John, I\u2019ll just distinguish again what I said before. Microsoft is holding on to their office customers by moving up them on-prem into the cloud. We are not holding on, just holding on to our on-prem customers, moving our application customers to the cloud. We are doing that too. We are holding on to our apps customers by moving them to the cloud. But more than that, we\u2019re gaining more than half of them are net new customers. So that\u2019s very different than what you see is going on in the Microsoft. And our big installed base, which is the database, we\u2019re preeminent. We really haven\u2019t begun \u2013 we\u2019re just beginning in the early stages of holding on to them and moving them to the cloud. So it\u2019s a bit of a different story between us and Microsoft. That exciting prospect of moving all those database customers to cloud, that\u2019s in front of us. And that\u2019s what makes and I, congratulate Microsoft on doing what they\u2019ve done. It\u2019s the right strategy for them. Ours has been, what we\u2019ve said, we want to do that, but we want to do more. And we think we have the opportunity. Safra mentioned another very important metric, our renewal rates are where they\u2019ve always been, which tells you the bulk of our base that\u2019s on prem is still yet to move. And it tells you and support the story about how much from us is just plain net new opportunities, John, for us. John DiFucci : Great, that\u2019s very clear. I did ask the question on the effect of the bottom line too here, at least, in the near-term, because I \u2013 Safra was clear with the impact to some of those extra items to the guidance for EPS relative to what expectations were anyway. But is there going to -- I mean should \u2013 is this going to \u2013 we know it can be suppressive to margins, at least, initially, and we have seen that, but at the same time, it looks like, and this is first time. Larry Ellison : I\u2019m going to let \u2013 I\u2019ll let Safra comment again, but I want to make sure it\u2019s clear what we were saying. This is actually the fact that we\u2019ve done a very good job in the U.S. growing our cloud business, that\u2019s eventually had the strange effect of raising our tax rate, right? John DiFucci : Got it. Larry Ellison : This is the bad news you could get. So we\u2019re in a situation, where I hate to say, we over executed, but that\u2019s sort of how you feel, and yet to be clear, John, our bookings in Europe are very strong. And so this is going to normalize. This is just a point of us putting or moving those bookings into revenue. Mark Hurd : So, as we have more balance between our international cloud sales and our U.S. cloud sales, the tax rate should drift back to where it normally is, when we have the same mix. It\u2019s just now, we have a disproportionate amount of our cloud revenue in the United States. That\u2019s the balance and expect the tax rate to go back. While the bookings balance, it\u2019s just the current period revenue that we\u2019ve got today. But this is overall a \u2013 might be a very good story. And let\u2019s not lose the fact of the other numbers that Safra described very early. Our margins are now at 62% in our SaaS/PaaS margins, which we talked about way back when they were at 39%, as we were investing infrastructure to prepare for what we have now. And so, I think, the margin story, John, is also beginning to solidify, as we continue to grow and put revenue on top of the base. John DiFucci : Great, that\u2019s all. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you so much. This is a question for Safra. Safra, support grew \u2013 software support grew 3% year-over-year, but was flat sequentially. I\u2019m wondering, if there\u2019s any color you could provide here on the trends in that business? And also, if you can share with us how you think about the trade-off between support and cloud revenue, and how you think about the sustainability of that software support stream? Thank you. Safra Catz : Sure. So, of course, you have to remember, we\u2019re going from Q4 to Q1. So our Q1 new licenses are seasonally lowest one anyway, okay? Now, as you know, our focus is now on cloud. And so as new license becomes a smaller number, especially in Q1, it means that it does not \u2013 that the support base does not grow as much. There\u2019s also little bit of currency, but you should ignore that. So that\u2019s the first thing. Now, I know you\u2019re probably worried that all of a sudden support is going to go negative, the base is going to go negative. We don\u2019t foresee that happening, okay, because the base is continuing to grow, even though new license amount is not growing year-over-year as much or is actually shrinking as more of our customers pivot to the cloud. We still sell new licenses, which means the base does continue to grow, and it grew 3% year-over-year. So that\u2019s, I think, I don\u2019t know, you had a few parts to your question, but that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on here. We don\u2019t \u2013 yes, that\u2019s it. Heather Bellini : Great. And if I could just on that point just with the support trends that you are seeing, is this still a year, where you\u2019ve forecasted bottom and operating income? I\u2019m sorry, fiscal 2016 being the bottom, my apologies. Safra Catz : Yes. Yes, it is. Absolutely, absolutely. And I do want to say one more time, again, and also Mark mentioned it, our retention rates, our renewal rates in our support business remain very, very high. So, in fact, they\u2019re a little bit higher this quarter than another quarter. It\u2019s all within a band of very high, they remain that way. Mark Hurd : And so they are high, Heather. But again, I want to reiterate as I said before now in this call. If a customer does move to the cloud, we actually get more money. So we actually do more things for the customer. We now do their hard work. We get all the database. We get all the middleware. We get a multiple on the support dollar. And as our \u2013 so our support dollar goes up, when it converts into a cloud revenue dollar. Back to the margin story we talked about five minutes ago, those margins in the cloud, as we see them approaching the levels that Safra described earlier, this is good news for us. So, yes, the renewal rates are what they are, we predict support to be the way they described. But this is not bad news, as we begin to move our base to the cloud. This is actually good news. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So Safra, just wanted your comment on gross profits. One of the things we look for in cloud transition stories is, when do gross profit start to grow? And clearly after a two-year slump, your investment is starting to pay off, the gross profits were up for the first time in two years, I believe. Can you talk about the disparity between gross profit growth, which obviously quite important and the operating income growth there? Is that bit of a lag effect here? And also if I could ask you, Mark or Larry, on the PaaS side, can you just give us a little bit more color, what kind of projects our customer picking Oracle for when they sign a PaaS deal, particularly, given that you\u2019ve surprised us with the announcement of a number of new customers for the PaaS, that I would have thought that would be just typical Oracle database customers, but looks like something new could be happening, if you could shed some light, that\u2019d be great. Thank you. Safra Catz : Sure. So first, I mean, you really should take directions from what\u2019s going on in our gross profit lines for the most strategic part of our business, which is moving to the cloud and software and software as a service. And that is going to be very much followed up. One of the things we do have that is costing us is that, our hardware business outside of our engineered system is getting smaller. And the expense line has not adjusted equally. As you can imagine us pretty well that\u2019s something that\u2019s very straightforward for us to finish out during the year. And that is our expectation. In addition, you also talked \u2013 or you may have mentioned currency and tax and things like that. So obviously, currency is something I can\u2019t project. And I think after the Brexit vote, I\u2019m pretty sure nobody else has projected it correctly either. So but the way it affect us, just so that you know is that the U.S. and Oracle is ahead of Europe in a move to the cloud and in and outside of the United States. However, as Mark mentioned, the bookings are very, very high. So bookings that were booked in the United States over the past year are turning into revenue already in the United States. Since the number is smaller in Europe, the bookings, the revenue numbers are smaller, the bookings are approaching those of the United States. And those are going to start flowing through revenues. That will, in fact, impact our tax rate and readjust it back to the lower rates that you maybe used to. So that\u2019s going to take a little while and that should go through. In addition, as you know, we do have some significant borrowings, and as a result, we have a very large amount of cash on our balance sheet right now, which is not earning very high result. We are looking forward to closing the next week deal, which we believe to be accretive. And that will also be helpful. Larry Ellison : The other part of your question \u2013 this is Larry is we sell PaaS too it. PaaS is sometimes attached to SaaS. Think of it like Salesforce.com. They have their Force.com platform, where it\u2019s used to extend the Salesforce application. We have our platform that people use to extend our SaaS application. So SaaS, you buy a number of SaaS application or suite of SaaS applications and you buy certain amount of PaaS to extend and build data marks, data warehouses, other things add features and functions use PaaS for that. Also the bigger opportunity is when you buy PaaS and infrastructure as a service together, where you\u2019re either writing brand-new, net new custom applications, or you\u2019re lifting and shifting an existing custom application to our infrastructure as a service and then moving the database associated with that application to our PaaS. That\u2019s actually the bigger opportunity. And you\u2019re beginning to see that start to drive our PaaS business higher, and of course, it will accelerate the growth rate of our infrastructure as a service business as well. Mark Hurd : I\u2019d add just one last thing. Exadata as a Service has been a very strong PaaS offering. So we count Exadata as a service, meaning, you can now get Exadata in the cloud, as you can get it on on-premise. And our Exadata service \u2013 Exadata as a service offering has been a strong PaaS offering. So we actually don\u2019t even add that into the engineered systems numbers that Safra described earlier, and that\u2019s really the strength and popularity of Exadata. We also have pretty good size business now built in PaaS, which is a cloud integration services business inside our platform, as well. So everything Larry said, all the debt has stuff supplementing of our SaaS offerings, Exadata and the data integration services are at the core of our most popular PaaS offerings. Ken Bond : Okay. Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. Mark, given that you guys have a view into both the on-premise and the cloud world. I was wondering, if you could give us some sense on where you think larger, say Fortune 1000 types are in terms of moving their ERP systems to the cloud as well, CRM and HM seem to be past the tipping point. There is some debate as to how fast some of the bigger companies are going to move ERP. And I was just kind of curious what you\u2019re seeing in your pipeline, and is that necessary, does that have to happen for you guys to sort of hit your AR forecast for this year? Just trying to get a sense on where we are in that front? Mark Hurd : The answer to your last question in no. And the answer to your first question is faster than I would have thought two or three years ago. And so some of the names I wrote \u2013 I read earlier are scale companies. When you see somebody like Tesco moving, when you seeing an HSBC moving. When you see some of these brands, and we have all types of brands in our list of ERP companies ranging from GE and others, as I described to sort of newer companies like Left and others that are sort of newer hot mid-market companies they might not even had a set of financials before. And it\u2019s really all of the above. And I think the thing that we get excited about is the reason we talked about Workday, probably, as much as we do is, we see them, at least, for the SaaS offering, our core on-prem competitors historically hasn\u2019t done anything. So when you tried and when you look at their base, their base begins to look for some of the benefits that our base now has the opportunity to take advantage of. We think there\u2019s a possibility for a relatively sizeable market share shift over the years, as we move forward. So I \u2013 Kirk, I do think, you\u2019re going to see how you\u2019re kicking and you see it now of many scaled companies that are of the biggest companies in the world, and you see it a few of them showing up on our list of recorded wins. Kirk Materne : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : And our last question for the day will come from the line of Joel Fishbein with BTIG. Joel Fishbein : Good afternoon. I just have a quick follow-up on a database. Clearly, had a \u2013 have very strong momentum in the cloud application business. Can you give us a little more color on where the database cycle will show up, and what\u2019s the best way for us to measure it. That will be helpful? Thanks. Mark Hurd : Again, next week at Oracle Open World, this Sunday, we are announcing the latest version of our database, and it\u2019s going to be available in the cloud, on Exadata. We think \u2013 I think you\u2019re going to see a very rapid update of the new version. And we expect those customers to consume some of it on-prem, but also a significant amount of thier new database consumption is going to be in the cloud. So I think 12 \u2013 Release 2 is going to move customers to the cloud more quickly than they otherwise might be. Joel Fishbein : Great. Thank you. Safra Catz : Okay. Ken Bond : With that move to close the call please. But before we do that so, let me just finish up with the last couple of comments. Thank you for joining us today. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. The dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the investor relations department for any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you very much for joining us. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for closing. Operator : Once again, we\u2019d like to thank you for dialing in for today\u2019s Oracle conference call. We appreciate your participation, and we ask that you please disconnect.",

Now, I\u2019d like to turn today\u2019s call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, sir. Ken Bond : Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with few prepared remarks. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for the quarter, I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q3, as well as give some direction on FY17 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. Clearly, we are pleased with our results as both total revenue and earnings per share exceeded the midpoint of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud has been phenomenal. We continue to see accelerating growth rates in our cloud business, while our key competitors are slowing down, but more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business is starting to overtake our new software license business decline. Our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue next fiscal year, when the transition will be largely complete. While the investments we\u2019ve made to transition our business to the cloud have limited our ability to expand earnings per share near-term, they\u2019ve been important to ensure that Oracle remains the technology leader. With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business, increasing revenue that results an EPS and cash flow that grow even faster. We continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly calls, so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movement were more than what I had included in my guidance, mostly because of the strengthening U.S. dollar after recent elections in U.S. and Europe, resulting in currency headwind of 1% in total revenue, 2% in some revenue categories and one penny to EPS. The devaluation of the Egyptian currency last month also negatively impacted EPS by a second penny. None of this was in my guidance for the quarter. Cloud, SaaS, and PaaS revenues for the quarter were $912 million, up 89% from last year. You can also see the continuing acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $1.6 billion, up 51% in U.S. dollars; and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 39% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We\u2019ve put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail as usual. When you add together cloud, SaaS and PaaS revenues, and new software license revenue, they grew 5% in constant currency. And by the way, Database as a Service and database new software license revenue together also grew. These are significant milestones in our transformation with the combination of our cloud and new software license businesses added together are growing. As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flow following along. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. Q2 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 61%, up from 43% last year, and I expect to see further improvement in Q3 and Q4. And from there, we\u2019ll be targeting 80%. Cloud infrastructure as a service revenue was $175 million, up 9% from last year. The Q2 gross margin was 37%. Now, that\u2019s lower than prior quarters as we are making the necessary investments to scale out this business. Now, I want to spend a moment explaining it to you, because you\u2019re going to see some effects. What\u2019s happening with the infrastructure as a service gross margin is similar to what we experienced with the SaaS and PaaS gross margin, except that it\u2019s off a much smaller revenue base and thus the margin impact is more at the beginning. To refresh for everyone, when we invested in our SaaS, PaaS business in advance of the revenue scale out, the gross margin declined 16 percentage points before bottoming at 40%; it\u2019s now up to 61%. And as I just mentioned, will climb to 80% over time. Similarly, I expect the infrastructure as a service gross margin will decline future over the next few quarters, as we make investments in the business to hit our expenses immediately while the revenue is recognized over time. But for modeling purposes, I would use 20% as a trough gross margin. Probably, it doesn\u2019t need to go quite that low but just for modeling purposes you can aim there, after which I expect the gross margin will climb to nearly 40% as the business scales probably higher. Total cloud revenue in the quarter was over $1 billion for the first time at nearly $1.1 billion, up 69% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.1 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remained at their usual high levels, as our installed base of customers continues to grow. New software license revenues were slightly over $1.3 billion; now that is down 19%, reflecting the continued emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support was down 9% with hardware systems product revenue of $497 million and hardware support revenue of $517 million. Just so that you know, we are proactively evaluating our expense infrastructure needed to support the on-premise hardware business in light of on-premise hardware revenue declines and the new availability of IaaS for their customers. For the Company total revenues for the quarter were $9.1 billion, up 2% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 3% from last year and operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.5% considerably higher than last year\u2019s 20.4%, which had been favorably impacted by some onetime benefits.  Now, in view of possible changes to the U.S. corporate tax system, normalization of our geographic earnings and other factors, the likelihood effect favorable impact to our tax rate over time is higher but obviously not certain. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.61 in U.S. dollars, the GAAP tax rate was 24.3%, the GAAP EPS was $0.48 in U.S. dollars. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.2 billion. Capital expenditures for Q2 was $757 million with cloud CapEx accounting for approximately 40% of the total with the rest being real estate. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.6 billion, up 10% from last year. We now have approximately $68 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $4 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency. This quarter, we purchased nearly 30 million shares for a total of $500 million, which is less than prior quarter, due obviously to the use of our cash for the acquisition of NetSuite. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve repurchased 172 million shares for a total of $6.7 billion and we paid out dividends of $2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors again declared A quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. Now to the guidance. I am going to provide guidance for Q3, then some updated comments about the whole year. Given recent currency movement, we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates and significant currency headwind. Today again was a very significant day in currency with the dollar strengthening. I am going to give you constant currency guidance, but if current exchange rates remain just about where they are right now, we expect to see a currency headwind of at least 1% on revenue and at least $0.01 to EPS. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that my guidance is as follows. SaaS and PaaS revenues including NetSuite is expected to grow 82% to 86%. Software and cloud revenue including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow 4% to 6%. Total revenue is expected to grow 3% to 5%. EPS is expected to be between $0.61 and $0.64 in constant currency. Now, this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 25.5%, which is considerably higher than the 22.6% reported last year. As a remainder, last year's tax rate was lower, mostly due to the catch-up of benefits related to the U.S. R&D tax credit. Of course, the Q3 tax rate could end up being different. Over the full year FY17, I am raising the outlook for FY17 SaaS and PaaS revenue growth from 67% to 80% with NetSuite now added and continued strengthening in our SaaS and PaaS business. I continue to expect SaaS and PaaS gross margins will exit Q4 higher than the 61% reported today as our cloud business continues to grow dramatically. Lastly, I expect our total CapEx spend for the year will be in the range of about $2 billion with over half of it being due to non-cloud real estate investments that we made this year that we'll not be repeating next year. With that I'll turn it over to Larry -- to Mark for his comments. Mark Hurd : Thank you. As usual, I'm just going to you a lot [ph] of numbers here and try to give you some context on our quarter. Everything's year-on-year in CD, unless I say otherwise. Cloud bookings for the quarter $377 million in USD. And Q2 was the best non-Q4 we have ever had. I'll make a prediction that Q3 has a chance to be our best ever quarter period. SaaS bookings were 270 in USD and positive to structure booking were 160 in USD. Just let me give you some numbers by pillar as it relates to our SaaS, PaaS revenue. We were up 89%, more than 30% higher than Amazon, Salesforce or Workday. ERP had a 104% growth quarter-on-quarter, eighth consecutive quarter with sequential growth greater than 50%. HCM grew 131% again this quarter, that's four time the growth rate of Workday. CX, Customer Experience grew 15% organically, service was up 24%. Data as a Service up 71%. Database as a Service up 700% and already had a $100 million in quarterly revenue. PaaS was up 600% and overall SaaS, PaaS grew 89%. Saas, PaaS billings grew 39% in USD, Saas, PaaS deferred revenue 51% USD. Now, just some customer metrics. IDC recently released their SaaS market share estimate. And Oracle is now the number one market share leader in Enterprise SaaS. In the quarter, we got almost 1,100 new SaaS customers and 1,082 to be exact, and have 810 expansions. In CX, we had 443 new customers, 517 expansions. In HCM, we had 224 new customers and 212 expansions. In ERP, we had 532 new customers and that does not include NetSuite; we had 91 expansions. Over half of the new ERP customers never had an Oracle app before they bought. Our active base now is 3,269 with 1,275 live, over 10X greater than Workday. In total, we now have almost 13,000 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 if you actually include NetSuite. Fusion Cloud is now nearly two thirds of our new customer wins. This is a big deal for us because with 10 years actually writing this code and is now the bulk of our SaaS business. 348 go-lives, best quarter ever, 2,116 customers are now live on Fusion. We got 2,225 new platform customers in the quarter and our install base now sits at 12,168. We got 2,148 infrastructure customers; they are buying standalone infrastructure services. And together our install base of PaaS and infrastructure now sits at 21,219 customers. Now, as a point of clarification, PaaS and infrastructure customers are accounted for each service that they use. Now, let me just give you the names of a few customers in the quarter. I'm going to go through just couple pillars. First in ERP, I'm giving you a list of ERP customers who purchased in the quarter : Canon, Deutsche Telekom, DICK'S Sporting Goods, FedEx, Ferguson, Hasbro, Hill-Rom, Koch Industries, Noble Energy, Ricoh, Skanska, Texas Instruments. I\u2019m going to give you a list of HCM customers in the quarter. Berkshire Hathaway, Cummins, Dubai Airport, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, Netgear, ON Semiconductor, Siemens, Skanska, Sonic Automotive, Tesco, Hertz Corporation. It was a solid quarter for us. And lastly, let me sort of describe where I think we are. We not only have strong revenue and billings as well, but our Q2 billings were solid at 39%; Q3 has a chance to be our best quarter ever. Q2 revenue was fantastic at 89% and we clearly crossed the revenue gap. We are clearly the fastest growing cloud company with scale. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Mark. Historically, I\u2019d measured Oracle performance by comparing our technology and our market share to our two primary competitors, SAP and application, and IBM and infrastructure and database. That changes as we move to the cloud. In the cloud, we measure Oracle against salesforce.com and application, and Amazon Web Services and infrastructure and database. Our cloud applications\u2019 goal is to be the world largest and most profitable SaaS Company. We are growing our cloud business much faster than salesforce.com and we can beat them to the $10 billion mark, but it\u2019s going to be close. IDC already recognizes Oracle as the number one in annual SaaS sales to large enterprise; salesforce.com is number two. We will book more than $2 billion in annual cloud sales this year, much more than salesforce.com. We are catching after them and we\u2019re catching them very quickly. Our goal in infrastructure and database is to be number one running database workloads in the cloud on our infrastructure as a service. The Oracle database has a huge technical and market share lead over the Amazon Web Services databases Azure and Redshift. But much more importantly, the Oracle cloud infrastructure as a service runs the oracle database workloads much faster, more reliantly and at a significantly lower cost than the Oracle database running at Amazon IaaS. We are making a multiyear generational shift to the cloud and we\u2019re well on our way to being number one in both cloud application and cloud database, and we are doing it with very little or no compromise to our earnings or our cash flow. With that, I\u2019ll open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. John DiFucci : Thank you. My question is to Mark. Mark, our field check this quarter led us to believe that cloud traction accelerated beyond what you had been doing which was pretty good, very good. And we thought this might have a negative effect on license, which sort of comes through in the increased decline in license. But with ARR growth of 30%, that doesn\u2019t seem to be indicative of increasing cloud traction. Can you help us resolve this? I mean, what we\u2019re hearing in the field and the numbers, what the numbers seem to indicate, is it simple as 30% ARR growth may not be the 42% last year, but it\u2019s still pretty good off such a large number or there something else going on? Mark Hurd : All right. Let me go into figures and the math to start with. Our pipeline is really big, our wins are pretty big or quite big as well. As I mentioned in my script and I may have gone over it too fast, we had a good quarter in ARR. So, these are the days when 30% growth -- gee, I wish it was higher, I like 30% growth. That said, we can do a lot better and what I said about Q3. So Q2, just to go back to that number is the best non-Q4 we have ever had in terms of bookings. I think there is a chance, and I\u2019ll repeat it again, Q3 is the best quarter we\u2019ve ever had -- we could ever have period. That\u2019s how good I feel about our pipeline, how good I feel about our position, deals that -- I don\u2019t usually talk about deals we\u2019ve won in early Q3, but that\u2019s how strong our position is going into quarter. And my guess, John, is that\u2019s why you hear what you hear from your field check, the deals we won. We may not have contracted it, put on a piece of paper, but we feel really strong about our position. Larry talked about the $2 billion for the full year. So that would be my response, John. John DiFucci : And if I could, just to be clear, when you\u2019re talking right now, you\u2019re talking like there is a lot of terms, like ARR billings, bookings. And I\u2019m going to stick with your ARR number, because that\u2019s what you guys used when you first started talking about this. When you\u2019re talking about this could be the best quarter ever, you\u2019re talking about when you\u2019ve traditionally called the ARR, which is new annual recurring revenue? Mark Hurd : Yes, John, and you\u2019re right. We are passing a lot of different numbers to you. I think we\u2019re trying to be very transparent with all the deferred numbers and the billings and so forth. But the comment I may directly related to new and expansion ARR focus. And that is in the end a very good surrogate for how we will perform. So, I think the big number though back to it is the full year that we described. And so you may see some things in the quarter that go up or down, but the full year $2 billion number is where we sit. John DiFucci : Great. That is very clear, very helpful. Thanks. Mark Hurd : Thank you, John. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Thank you. Can you provide us more details and insight into NetSuite, its impact on Q2 revenue, margins et cetera and its impact on quarter? I really appreciate. Thanks. Safra Catz : Well, we got NetSuite in Q2 about, as I said -- I thought I said it; I didn\u2019t mention, around November 7. So, we didn\u2019t even have a full month. So it\u2019s around 50 million. It\u2019s basically a wash on all the other lines, as you know since we just got it. It\u2019s revenue track is very similar to what it\u2019s been doing, however if you know Net Suite doesn\u2019t grow as fast as our cloud business grows, nor is it as profitable. So overtime we\u2019re going to bring it to where we\u2019re doing and we also hope to accelerate it actually, because our productline is so much broader including the EPM and things like that. So this quarter I could refer to it as a wash, and as we own it overtime, we expect to be able to leverage it and -- but it doesn\u2019t grow obviously as fast as our ERP business does. Kash Rangan : Thanks, and if you could give us over time a little more color on that that would be great, I really appreciate it. Thank you. Safra Catz : Okay, I will. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : You mentioned during the conference call that database and Databases as service together grew again, I think this is second quarter you\u2019ve made that comment. What one of the questions that I get a lot from client and I wanted to ask of you is, are we seeing the positive impacts of the 12C cycle? Is that already showing up in terms of options driving that number higher on the license side in, is Database as service offering -- the new 12C offering driving people to that cloud offering as well or is it still really early days in terms of that cycle and this is just core database growth if you will? Mark Hurd : It\u2019s really early days, and actually 12.2 is only available right now in our cloud in Database as a service, so it really isn\u2019t available on premises yet. So our policy is cloud first and including the release of our latest technologies. So again we\u2019re very, very early on in terms of the 12.2 cycle and it\u2019s impacting our database license system. Safra Catz : So really all of you are seeing just the strength of our database business. A very, very strong business generally because it is by far the best and we\u2019ve been gaining market share now really for years and that just continues because it meets the needs of so many customers. Keith Weiss : Got it. And if I may, just one follow up. Albeit early days, you gave us an update awhile ago on the options, and talking about some of these options being [indiscernible] as well as adopted options that you've received. Has that trend continued or do you continue to see strong adoption of some of those new options on 12C? Ken Bond : I think people, I guess people using these options in the cloud, I think they are very excited about using the both in the cloud and on-premises and I think it\u2019s going to have a positive impact of it, a very significant impact on both our database as a service and our [on-term] license business. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : One question for Safra and one for Mark that\u2019s okay, question for you Safra, with respect to your cloud centers, one of the things we keep looking for is gross profit growth rate and you\u2019ve been able to show that two quarters in a row [ph], I think for the first time we also saw op income growth rate. Are you still confident that on organic basis that you can continue to accelerate op income growth rate and if so, what will contribute to that and one quick one for Mark if I could, did you comment on what the accelerated buying experience program mean for the company\u2019s growth rate future? Safra Catz : Okay well obviously, I think what you\u2019re starting to see, we\u2019ve got a bunch of things going on, they\u2019re all positive. We have revenue growth, we have operating income growth and I think you\u2019re going to see that actually accelerate. So as SaaS, and PaaS really takeoff this is going to show up and as I mentioned -- and as I want to make sure I reiterate from Financial Analyst Day once again, we are expecting double earnings growth in FY'18. So this is -- you\u2019ll hear me say that many times and we are starting to see the upturn. Larry Ellison : Kash, you didn\u2019t ask me a question, I was the only one [multiple speakers]. Mark Hurd : I'm going to try and just say, there is huge economy to scale in this business. So as we scale that\u2019s it's still important that we become number one in SaaS. There is just tremendous advantages of being number one, there is huge economies of scale. It contributes enormous to our profitability in the business both in SaaS, and being number one in data base in the cloud. To your other questions, accelerated buying experience continues to progress. We launched it really less than the year ago, this is our third quarter really doing it. We\u2019ve got about now 70% of our transactions, not necessarily our dollar volume going through. And our customers are just to be very frank, is very well received and is happier. It's just easier to do business and to get a contract with Oracle now than it\u2019s ever been and it's great when customers are happier. Our next target is really to focus around our overall experience in the cloud after the purchase. So ABE or Accelerated Buying Experience is really focused on the actual purchase and the contract. Our focus now is really after that contract and between the contracts signing and the renewal. And to that end on December 1, I announced a group inside Oracle, called the Oracle cloud global service and support group. And it really pulls together all the various organizations around the company that had touched our cloud customers and brings them together into an organizational unit, focused slowly on pleasing and delighting our customers and giving them the absolute best customer experience they can possibly ask for. We want to become and define what the best cloud experience is in the industry for our customers. So think of that as the follow one to be accelerated buying experience that we\u2019ve announced effective December 1. Operator : And now our next question will come from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Market. Ross MacMillan : I had one for Safra then maybe one related for Larry. When you think about CapEx this year guided to 2 billion, a bit less than half on cloud. So that billion run rate, is that the right level of CapEx that we should be thinking about even beyond this year or will it grow as the total cloud grows? And then related to that for Larry, is infrastructure as a service a necessity as opposed to platform as a service? If you are going to be able to migrate existing on-prem database workloads to the cloud? Thanks. Safra Catz : So two things were happening as we grow in both IAS and PaaS, you do get, first an investment period and then you really have economies of scale which we should see. So it will not grow linearly at all. So it will grow as depending on how successful we are, but it's growing up front then it's going to slow down, get used and then grow as a smaller and smaller percentage. And that's what we are expecting as far as our capital expenditure this year we\u2019re obviously very much front loaded, both some of our cloud investment and also our real estate investments, which will not be sort of the big chunk it is right -- as it was this year. Larry Ellison : And the question about infrastructure as a service, is it effectual, the answer is yes, if you want to move existing database workloads to the cloud and minimize the changes customers have to make as they migrate, in other words, make it a graceful easy lift and shift. We can configure our cloud network from that spare network, we can configure other servers to match their capacity -- the capacity of their servers, configure storage, deliver exit data and service, do all of that with virtually no disruption to what they're doing. As they press the button, move their database, move their workloads and it just runs pretty much like the way it ran. They don't have to re-task the application. They can just move it and it will just launch. Then we absolutely need an infrastructure as a service in combination with our platform as a service, we need both of them to do that gracefully. So it is an essential, we've been in this infrastructure as a business technology development phase for a long time. We're rolling it out to our customers again early in days, but it's being very-very well received, of course the litmus test is, can we do it better than Amazon could, could our infrastructure -- big question, can Oracles' infrastructure as a service differentiate itself from Amazon. Can we do it more gracefully, more reliably, less expensively, more securely than Amazon can, and we think we can, and that's going to make us very-very competitive. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindland with Macquarie. Sarah Hindland : Great, thank you so much for taking my question. Safra this one\u2019s really for you, so one of the big things we get asked about and would love some help on is as more and more customers are pivoting to Oracle cloud, it still maintains its very high renewal rate on the maintenance stream and I'd love to know a little bit more about how we should be thinking about the maintenance, stuff that you can support longer time and the trajectory on that line? Even as new licenses are declining you're still selling licenses, so how should we be thinking about that longer time Safra? And then a real quick second one for Mark around the hardware business, and we didn't spend a whole lot of time on that today I would also love to hear how you're thinking about that business longer term as well. Thank you guys. Safra Catz : Okay, so you're right in that our renewal rates remain very high, however as you know we don't renew a 100% of our licensed updates and product support and as the new software license number gets smaller and smaller, it is true that at one point software support will flatten out and actually go down. That's a ways out so far and we actually don't have any indication of that because we continue to sell quite a lot of new software licenses. However ultimately we would be -- it would be -- I know it\u2019s hard to imagine a good outcome, but it will mean that we're getting extremely not large number in our SaaS, PaaS number, one that actually is dwarfing not only new software license, but new software license and any kind of decline in the software support network, such that the whole software network which is SaaS, PaaS, new software license and support is all going up and actually accelerating. Mark Hurd : Before, I going to hardware business, our renewal rates in software for the quarter, we usually just tell you they are about the same. To be very exact, they actually went up. So our cancelation rates were down in the quarter. So we have a very strong renewal rate in our software business. Now that said, we are actually, in many cases trying to convert our customers to cloud. So just to be clear, that means for us more money, that means for us more margin. So it is clearly our objective over time is to take the applications business to migrate our on-prem application customers to our cloud applications. I already mentioned our database customers on-prem to our infrastructure and platform. And we believe as you all very well, most of you at least very well know the math. That means for us a larger recurring revenue stream and as our margins continue decline, that means more earnings for us and we think a great experience for us customers, as well. Hardware really more of what we talked about, sort of the reason we haven\u2019t talked about it much, we had a very good engineered systems quarter again. Engineering systems grew and in both bookings and revenue in the quarter that ecosystem continues to be very successful, very profitable for us. There is a great job for us, we had declines and what we think of as our traditional server business and those declines offset the growth in engineered systems. So it's really the tale of two product lines, engineered systems growing, the traditional server product lines, declining. Now this is a last quarter, this being Q2 that you will see the declines because of the acquired GBU products. So we brought the couple of micros, for example a couple of years ago, a year-and-a-half ago, it had a bunch of third party products that we actually stopped and that\u2019s actually hurt the growth rate of the hardware line, that begins to -- and as we go Q3. So those are sort of the three factors the third party products in our micros business, growth in engineered systems and decline in the traditional servers. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits : This is a question that\u2019s mostly for Safra and for Mark. New software licenses declined 19% constant currency. Does this mean that license declines could continue to steepen going forward and maybe I\u2019ll answer the second part of my question at the same time, which is database as a business overall grew. So if you could talk to us about how database license did within license overall. Safra Catz : So let me at least get started with that. No, I actually I\u2019m not expecting next quarter for it to decline, even at the 19% range because the big decline has been in the application side as SaaS had really overtaken our app business. And as apps has gotten starting smaller, the base itself is not decline -- is small, that when it declines it has a smaller impact on our overall new software license. Now ultimately at one point, you\u2019ll see the same happening in database, but the reality is, you\u2019re not seeing it in database at this time, because our installed base of usage continues to increase at all level on-premise and in the cloud simultaneously. Larry Ellison : Once again, there will have to be an interruption, but I'll use this as a great opportunity to answer it anyway. So let me be clear. So if you convert, if you move from the Oracle business suite on-premise and then you take up Fusion ERP in the cloud and we encourage you to do that, right, and we want you to do that. You cancel your support for the Oracle ERP on-premise, what we call the e-business suite and you\u2019re start paying as a monthly fees for Fusion. So even support, not only does new license go down, but even support go down as you make the shift and we want you to do because we make a lot more money in that way.  However in database, if you bring database to infrastructure as a service, you need to own the database license, you never cancel your database license and support. That goes on forever. So as people migrate let\u2019s say you take the Oracle database to Oracle infrastructure as a service, you still your support and if you need more, you but more -- license more database. Let\u2019s say you take the Oracle database to Amazon. Well, you need your Oracle database and we need more of it, you got to buy of it and license more of it and you have to keep paying support. So they are very different businesses, their profile is vary very differently. So as Safra said, a lot of license decline is attributable to our applications business which is getting -- with the on-prem application business is getting smaller and smaller. The database business, license business looks as growing. So this are very -- these will reach -- both these businesses will react very differently in the cloud. It\u2019s not an unlikely outcome that our database license system goes on forever and the associated support goes on forever even though customers are running that database now not on their own computers, but on our infrastructures as a service or Amazon\u2019s infrastructures as a service, or Azure\u2019s infrastructure as a service. So you have to model these two businesses entirely differently. Michael Turits : Thanks Larry, didn\u2019t mean to leave you out. Larry Ellison : I know you get -- I know I\u2019m getting old. And this is complicated stuff and I realize you don\u2019t want to wear me out during the call. So I appreciate your consideration. Operator : And our final question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Thanks for taking my question. And it's great to see your CTO so busy on the call. My question is actually for Mark. Mark, can you talk a little bit about what you see in the different regions? You talked about the products, but just wanted to hear how you see the regional performance. If I look at the numbers, Asia was very strong, U.S. and Europe moderated a little bit. Can you just talk what you see in terms of end amount there? And then Safra, did I understand, did I hear you correctly that you talked about double-digit EPS growth in 2018? Just wanted to clarify that. Mark Hurd : Okay, by the way just to be clear to the CTO\u2019s earlier point, as it relates to apps and applications business, we actually don\u2019t compensate our sales people for applications on-premise, so just to be clear to connect these dots in terms of how we actually operationalized the company. Our sales people in the applications ecosystems sell FAS. So if they sell -- we have small swat teams in our, what we would call Oracle direct organization, that help our existing users by incremental seats if they need to, to their existing on-premise applications. So I only say that to you because, all of this is planful on our part, our objective is to move to SaaS to get as clear about our direction in SaaS and its resulted in this leadership position enterprise SaaS that we discussed that earlier. So this is all very planful on our part. So your question about the regions. All of our regions, the region that had the toughest turn in the quarter was Latin America, and Latin America has been historically and still is one of our best regions in terms of our performance of our team, et cetera, but they are going through all of the things that you all know about, in Brazil, some of the issues that have cropped up now in Mexico. But now at the same time as Latin America has had a little bit of tough cards, they are gaining significant market share in that market. So I -- while the numbers of Latin America are perhaps not as good as we all would love, or have been in the past, their relative performance compared to their peers is fantastic. So I am actually very proud of them in spite affected the absolute dollar value to state. Save that, our Europe and North America region performed roughly as I would have expected, I continue to believe our European organization has done a tremendous job over the past several years, they in addition have done tremendous rule over to the cloud. Their absolute bookings on an overall basis just taking license and cloud combined grew, so very significant. I\u2019m pleased with North America as well, they were roughly as we expected. On the flip side, I would say Asia has been superb. I think Asia has done a nice turn around. It wasn\u2019t a couple years ago, we have been in call and get questioned about some of the performance in Asia, we weren\u2019t very happy with that, we made some changes and the performance in Asia on virtually every metric we see, talking about hardware, SaaS PaaS, infrastructure and license, has been very favorable. So I'm very pleased with the results in Asia. Safra Catz : Yes sir, I wanted to just make sure, you did hear me right we are expecting to have double digit earnings growth next year. Raimo Lenschow : I am looking forward to that. Safra Catz : Okay. Ken Bond : Okay. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours, dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the investor relations department for any follow-up questions from this call. And we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. And with that I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for closing. Happy Holidays. Operator : Thank you for joining today's Oracle's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I'd like to turn today's call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Ken? Ken Bond : Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which include a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.

As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. Finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3, I'll then review guidance for Q4 and then I'll turn the call over to Mark and then Larry. Just so you all know, we're not all in the same place today, so we may all answer at once, so give a chance. Clearly, we are delighted with our results as software and cloud revenue was at the high end of my guidance and earnings per share $0.06, above the high end of my guidance. Our pivot to the cloud is now clearly in full strength. We continue to see outside growth rates in our cloud business, especially when compared with our key competitors who're all seeing slowing growth. But more importantly, the increase in revenue from our cloud business has overtaken new software license business decline on an annual basis. Next year I expect our cloud revenue will be larger than our new software license revenue. The investments we've made to transition our business to the cloud has been important to ensure that Oracle remains a technology leader and we're now beginning to see the benefits in our results. With cloud overtaking new software license revenue, we expect our business to once again exhibit the same pattern we delivered over the previous decade as a license business that is growing revenue with disciplined cost management that results an EPS and cash flow that grow even faster. I expect EPS growth to ramp up throughout next year. We continue to use constant dollar rates on our quarterly calls, so that we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This quarter, the effects of currency movement were largely in line with my guidance of 1% currency headwind for revenue, $0.01 negative impact to EPS. Cloud, SaaS, and PaaS revenues for the quarter were $1.1million, up 86% from last year. You can also see the continued strength of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $2 billion, up 75% in U.S. dollars; and SaaS and PaaS billings grew 111% in U.S. dollars this quarter. We've put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail. When you add together cloud, SaaS, PaaS revenues, and new software license revenue together, we grew 11% in constant currency. This is a significant milestone in our transformation where the combination of our cloud and new software license businesses added together are growing. As cloud becomes an even larger percentage of the total, the growth will only accelerate with earnings and cash flow following along. As our SaaS and PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q3 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 65%, up from 51% last year, and I expect it to be about the same region in Q4. I expect that our total Saas and PaaS gross margin will continue to trend toward 80% overtime. Cloud infrastructure as a service revenue was 178 million, up 19% from last year. The Q3 gross margin was 30%, as we continue to make the necessary investments to scale out this business. As we make additional investments, the expenses and immediately while the revenues recognized overtime, so the gross margin in this part of the business could decline to roughly about 20% over the next few quarters. After which, I expect gross margin will climb to more than 40% as the business scales. Total cloud revenue in the quarter was approximately 1.3 billion, with growth modestly accelerating to 72% in constant currency from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were 6.2 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remained at their usual high levels, as our installed base of customers continued to grow, in fact they actually increased. New software license revenues were nearly 1.4 billion, down 15%, reflecting the continued emphasis on and migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support was down 9% with hardware systems product revenue of 520 million and hardware support revenue of $508 million, again reflecting our focus on the move to the cloud. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was 9.3 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was 3.9 billion, up 4% from last year and the operating margin was 43%, up from 42% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.6%, as the rate was favorably impacted by some onetime benefits and some other factors, including favorable geographic mix this quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69 in USD, up from $0.64 and up 8% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 17% and the GAAP EPS was $0.53 in USD, up from $0.50 last year. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was 13.5 billion, which is lower because of the rapid growth we're seeing as we transition to cloud and having an impact on our working capital. Our operational metrics like DSO and Days Payable are stable, so it's just largely an effective growth on working capital and timing. Capital expenditures for Q3 were 440 million with about third of it from real estate, while most of the rest was cloud build out and internal use. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was 11.8 billion. We now have approximately 69 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately 5 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is 7.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency. This quarter, we purchased approximately 30 million shares for a total of 500 million. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 124 million shares for a total of 5 billion and paid out dividends of 2.5 billion. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 27% from $0.15 to $0.19 per share. Now let me go to the guidance. Because we expect to see continued volatility in exchange rates, we do also expect to see significant currency headwind. I am going to give you constant currency guidance, but if the current exchange rates remain the same throughout the quarter as they're right now, we actually expect to see currency headwind of 2% on revenue and $0.02 negative impact on EPS. These currency headwinds are higher than last quarter, meaning that most of your Q4 estimates do not yet reflect the incremental revenue and EPS headwinds of an additional negative impact of 1% and $0.01 to EPS. All of my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis. With that my guidance is as follows. SaaS and PaaS revenue including NetSuite is expected to grow 69% to 73%, effectively raising my full year guidance from 80% to 81% for the year. We're beginning to see an increasing and favorable attach between our PaaS and IaaS order. So I'm going to provide guidance on IaaS as well this quarter. IaaS is expected to grow 25% to 29%. Software and cloud revenue including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software support is expected to grow 1% to 3%. Total revenue is expected to grow from negative 1 to positive 2. EPS is expected to be between $0.78 and $0.82 in constant currency. Now, this assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%, but of course the Q4 tax rate could end up being different. With that I'm going to turn this over to Mark and then Larry follows him. Mark Hurd : Alright, thanks Safra. We thought Q3 would be strong going in and as you can see it turned out to be just that. I'm going to give you a bunch of numbers hear and try to give you a little bit more insight to the quarter. First, in ARR, we booked 545 million in USD. Every number I'm going to give you was actually in CD, I want to say it differently. 545 in USD, 547 in CD, that is up 73% and the second best quarter we had ever had. SaaS bookings were 322 million in USD and PaaS infrastructure bookings were 223 in USD. Cloud revenue was up 72% and we're now in an annualized $5 billion run rate. Saas, Paas revenue was up 86%. We're the fastest growing scaled cloud business in the world and that is on top, that growth rate is on top of last year's 60%. In ERP, we were up 280% organically and with NetSuite ERP is now our largest pillar. Fusion HCM was up 106%, that's more than three times the growth rate of Workday. CX was up 16% with marketing and service both over 100 million in quarterly revenue. Our vertical is up for 109% and also over 100 million in quarterly revenue. Database as a Service was up 427%. Our database business including all of our on premise businesses net revenue. PaaS was up 375% year-to-date, with cloud services up 300%. As Safra mentioned Saas, PaaS billings were up 111% in USD, Saas, PaaS deferred revenue was up 75% in USD. Now, some customer metrics, 1,125 new SaaS customers in the quarter, 908 expansions, 210 customers who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. CX, we had 480 new customers and 586 expansions. In HCM, we had 206 new customers and 217 expansions. In ERP, we had 564 new customers that did not include NetSuite; we got 120 expansions. 50% of our new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before they bought this quarter. Our active base of ERP customers is now approaching 3,700, 1,465 are live, 10X Workday. In total we now have 13,103 customers in our SaaS active base and 25,000 with NetSuite. Two thirds of our new customer wins were for Fusion. 243 Go-Lives for Fusion, 2,444 customers are now live on Fusion. We have 2,380 PaaS customers in the quarter and 2,586 new customers buying standalone infrastructure as a service. As a point of clarity, PaaS and infrastructure customers accounted for each service that they buy. Lastly, this was an excellent quarter. Bookings, billings and revenue were all extremely solid. Now, a few predictions, Q3 bookings growth was strong, as I mentioned 73%. We will book at least 2 billion in ARR this year. Q3 revenue growth was impressive at 72% and with revenue now and an annualized run rate of 5 billion; we're clearly the fastest growing cloud company at scale. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Mark. Let's say, generation two of Oracle's infrastructure as service cloud now has the ability to run customers' largest databases, something that is impossible to do using Amazon web services. Amazon can only run relatively small Oracle databases in their cloud. Gen 2 of Oracle IaaS also delivers ultra high database performance and form caller reliability in the cloud. Many Oracle workloads now run ten times faster in the Oracle cloud versus the Amazon cloud. It also costs less to run Oracle workloads in the Oracle cloud than the Amazon cloud. As a result some of our largest customers' are negotiating huge infrastructure as a service contracts to move all their databases to the Oracle cloud. You can expect some of those big deals to be announced in the coming weeks. Fast growth in the infrastructure as a service business is new for us. We've done well on SaaS and in PaaS over the past few years, but this is the first time we've ever had a technology lead in infrastructure as a service. We're now in position to help our hundreds of thousands database customers move millions of Oracle databases to our infrastructure as a service cloud. SaaS and PaaS are large, rapidly growing businesses for us. Together SaaS and PaaS grew 85% this past quarter. But soon infrastructure as a service will be growing even faster and before long infrastructure as a service will become Oracle's largest cloud business. In summary, all of Oracle's cloud businesses are growing rapidly and IaaS will be leading the way in the future. Thanks. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Holly, if we could prepare the audience for the Q&A portion of the call now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Thanks, very much and congrats on a very nice third quarter. My question is for Mark. Mark, obviously a really nice quarter across the board, but particularly from cloud bookings perspective, can you talk about what changed if anything in the quarter versus the second quarter either in terms of the macro backdrop or better execution and just relatedly we'll be interested in what you're seeing in the pipeline that gives you further confidence in that $2 billion ARR target. Thanks. Mark Hurd : Kirk, I thought good about Q1, I thought good about Q2, I feel good about Q3, I didn't feel any major change. It's just really the timing of wins, bookings closed. We had a very strong set of quality wins. I mean if you win into HCM, I mean just to give you some idea Kirk, we closed America Movil in the quarter, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Ford, Emerson, Hilton, Hyundai Motor, Jefferies, Rogers Communications, I mean we had a very strong set of logos in the quarter. I mean in ERP, we closed ClubCorp, Cummins, Lufthansa, Dish Network, I mean it was just a - I could go on. I don't have time to tell you all of these deals. But we saw it going in, we felt it would happen. It did and I think our team executed well. I would say Kirk that there was no - it wasn't geographically centered and it was pillar centered. As I mentioned earlier we had credible growth in ERP 280% organically, we had a 106% growth in HCM, we had strong in our sales automation business and it wasn't unique to one geography, so in the quarter broad based, cross pillar, cross geography. In terms of going forward, our pipeline is big. I mean I said before, I'll say it again. Our pipeline's growth, if you looked at it year-over-year resembles all of the growth rates you've heard in terms of what you've seen in terms of our bookings growth this quarter. And I think our execution just continues to get better. I'll also add in the quarter that NetSuite's performance accelerated. So from the last reported quarter in terms of bookings growth, their growth in the quarter, which for them was an odd thing because they're not used to having December, January, February quarter, but when compare it apples-to-apples, they grew faster than the last reported quarter in terms of bookings as well, so it's a very good quarter for us. Kirk Materne : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much. Mark, you must be wearing a suit and Larry, maybe you're wearing a sweater because you're talking tech and Mark is talking application, so I'm going to direct my applications question to Mark if you don't mind. Mark, can you talk about what's ahead for cloud SaaS, obviously there is manufacturing, order entry, supply chain, those kinds of things that could book to the cloud. How should we think about the cycle ahead in that regard? Thank you very much. Mark Hurd : It is a big change for us in ERP. This is not the world of two providers and I was talking about upgrade cycles. What happened to us in ERP and I go back to the fact that 50% of our customers in the quarter were just brand-new. So, they never had bought ERP from us before. Ad what happened is our total available market has just become incredibly large. If you looked at the persona of our customers that are in the ERP cloud today, they were not - most of them, more than 50% of them today were not in Oracle ERP customer her before they bought from us. So, I don't think, cash, it's really more of a cycle. I think it's really more of just an inflection point for us in terms of - we're now at a place where we have almost 4,000 customers in ERP SaaS. Many of our on-prem customers have not moved and yet we're in a position where we can go get a whole set of customers that we never had access to before. Mid-market customers, we can do that globally and we can go now for customers that want to move to a SaaS application in the cloud and get all of those benefits. Frankly, our competitors' user bases have all opened up to us. And so, I don't see it quite as a cycle of that. I see it as a big change in the opportunity for us in terms of the total available market we can go after. Larry may have a comment or two he would like to add as well. Larry Ellison : No, again, I couldn't agree with Mark more. Our ability now to service much smaller customers than we could have serviced in the past is because the cloud allows you to deploy ERP in much, much lower costs. You don't have to have ERP. You don't have to build the data center. Obviously, you don't have to hire programmers. You don't have to hire a bunch of data operations people. We do all that for you, and therefore the available market has at least doubled what it used to be. And we're also beginning to see, as Mark said, SAP customers moving their ERP and some very, very large SAP customers looking very closely at our ERP systems. So, we expect to have some big wins in the SAP install base, so we're definitely going out from there in the coming month. Ken Bond : Next question, please. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thank you and congrats from me as well. I had a question around 12C. So, you have 12C now in the cloud for a good few months and I saw last week that it's now available on-premise. Can you talk a little bit about the early feedback from customers you saw and released to in the cloud and what did it mean - what does it mean now that it's available on-premise? Obviously, in the olden days that kind of spiked a little bit of an uptick in the database license growth, I'm just wondering how we have to think about it now in the new cloud world. Thank you. Larry Ellison : I will give you one thing that's important to note that our cloud business, our license business per database is growing. So, our on-prem database business continues to grow. I'm not talking about the board, I'm talking about new licenses. That business is growing and grew this past Q3. An awful lot of our customers are planning to move their database workloads to our cloud, but they're going to bring their own license. In other words, they own a bunch of Oracle license and they're just going to move those licenses to our infrastructure as a service. So, we expect our database license business to continue to grow. That should continue to respond kind of as it had in the past. In other words, the cool new features become available faster in memory processing, the ability to take an existing single tenant application and automatically turn into a multi-tenant application to be very attractive to our customers and our ISDs, they will buy more licenses, they may then in turn bring those licenses to the cloud. So, we expect our on-premise or better said, our database license business to continue to grow and accelerate because of 12. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Mark Hurd : Just as a follow-up because I know what Larry meant, it's our database business grew, support plus license plus database as a service, those three categories together, our database business grew in the quarter. Next question? Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow : Hey, thanks guys and congrats on a great quarter. I really wanted to focus on in particular on the PaaS line, because obviously you guys put up a huge ARR quarter there. Safra, you mentioned increasing the PaaS, sort of IaaS to PaaS, part of our thesis has been, since you rolled out the new Datacenter 2.0 model on IaaS, that increasing attach there would then drive acceleration in the PaaS business. So, the question to, I guess, all three of you and I'll jump off, is what are you seeing since the announcement of - you had opened world on the IaaS side and how is that impacting? How do you expect it to impact the PaaS business? Mark Hurd : Well, I mean, Phil, there is a lot of questions you had in one question there. So, I mean I think the point we've continued to try to indicate is that we've seen a continual connect first PaaS to SaaS. So, we've got a bunch of SaaS customers who typically buy an application and now we're starting to get up into where we see 20%, 25% connectivity. When somebody buys the SaaS application, they buy PaaS. I think part of what we're talking about with attach with infrastructure is it becomes a bit harder to differentiate in some cases what is a pure infrastructure and what is PaaS, because the customer now buys the computer, buys the computing, buys the storage, et cetera along with PaaS and so you begin to get upward and to a degree of the infrastructure business and the database business, but no question about it. We continue to see the attach rates continue to incline of PaaS to our SaaS business, which I think was your - at the core of your first question, Phil. Philip Winslow : Yeah, sort of the [indiscernible]. Safra Catz : Yes. For our database customers, when they come in, they can order PaaS. They can bring or they can bring their licenses, use IAS and as a general matter when they are running a database where they got something else too and so they're going to need some IAS to actually run their application when they're not our SaaS application. So, we're seeing these together very often. And so, I figured as we've now moved - as we're moving to our more advanced IAS from what you used to have, I thought I would break it out for you to see it. Philip Winslow : Great, thanks, guys. Safra Catz : Okay. Ken Bond : Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies and Company. John DiFucci : Thank you. My question is for Safra. Safra, you've previously talked about double-digit constant currency earnings growth for next year. You had meaningful outperformance this quarter and your guide was better than where the street is. I guess you also mentioned in your prepared remarks about EPS ramping through next year. I guess just to clarify, do you expect to still achieve double-digit growth? And is that exiting the year it'll be double-digit growth or are you talking about for the entire year? Safra Catz : So, I expect that when you look at the entire year, it will be double-digit growth, but it will start smaller and get bigger as we get through the year. So, Q1, I don't know right now. It's a little too early. We'll talk again as to what I'm going to see. Things look nice. But I'm going to - we'll talk again in June on Q1. And I think by the end of the year, the only question is, which quarter would drive into double-digit? And it's a little too early to tell but I expect to see it for the year. John DiFucci : Okay, okay. Great and just if I could a quick follow-up on a related profitability note, the one thing in the results this quarter was cash flow actually declined from a year ago, I think, this quarter. You mentioned in your prepared remarks working capital and timing issues. Can you just provide a little more detail on what you mean by that? Safra Catz : Yeah. I mean there is really nothing in it. It is pretty much just timing of when we paid stuff and things like that. I mean we would be filing our Q, our plan is to filing on Friday. You can spend the weekend digging through it. We dug through. There is nothing interesting going on whatsoever. We're growing and it's really just timing of different working capital impacting account, really nothing in particular. John DiFucci : Okay, great. Looking forward to that weekend. Thank you. Ken Bond : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Thank you guys, for taking my question and a nice quarter. A new one for Larry just to clarify sort of the positioning on infrastructure as a service, when we think about sort of Gen 2 offering, is the positioning a platform for your customers to run workloads primarily or was it just more of a general purpose platform that you expect to go head on with AWS and Azure for general purpose type workloads? Mark Hurd : It's absolutely a general purpose workload, because Oracle database is a backend. We have no idea what that application might be. It could be on our backing application. It could be our DNA, basically our matching application. There are millions or tens of millions of Oracle applications running. They're going to have to move the infrastructure as a service and the backend will probably run all the databases in PaaS, but we have to have a completely generalized infrastructure as a service offering that we built and we think we have performance and cost advantages with our new Gen 2 over both Amazon and Azure. Keith Weiss : Excellent, thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian : Great, thank you so much and congratulations on the quarter, I would love Safra, if you could give us an early indication or any potential impact do you expect on the business model from SaaS B and IaaS B initiating new revenue recognition policies. Whatever you are seeing or thinking there that we should be starting to think about would be helpful. Safra Catz : Sure, for us it's no big deal actually. It's really very much a non-event. I do hear one of our competitors talking all sorts of stuff about it. No, stuff for us to minimize [ph]. Maybe they're trying to talk about something else, but in our case we're not actually early adopting, but it doesn't make a difference really. Zero impact whatsoever on cash flows and no impact on what we disclosed to you or any of the things that these other companies talking about. For us it's really nothing. Sarah Hindlian : Alright, thank you. That's very helpful. Operator : Okay. And our final question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Great, thank you so much for taking the question. Just one is actually for Larry. I was wondering if you can share with us, it does appear that the company is coming to an inflection point in regards to your transition of the cloud and given the results from today and your commentary about Q4 and the earnings growth for next year, how long do you think this could run? Larry Ellison : Well, we have a very, very large database business. We have hundreds of thousands of database customers and we have millions and millions of applications that run on the Oracle database. Most of those databases and most of those customers will move most of their databases and most of these workloads to the cloud. And we think our cloud will be - right now we have a huge technology lead over both Amazon and Azure with our new Generation 2 infrastructure as a service. We can deliver ultrahigh performance. People have been buying these Exadata Database Machines and are getting used to running very large databases very, very fast and we can deliver comparable ultrahigh performance at very, very low cost in our cloud. So, we think how long does it take to migrate several hundred thousand customers and several million databases to the Oracle cloud and I think the rate of migration is going to accelerate over the years, but it's going to be at least a five-year run of very, very rapid growth as our database business begins to move. You've seen what it's like. Our application business began to move to the cloud several years ago and - but that's a little bit different. I mean we built all new application and they migrated from an old application, either an SAP application or an old PeopleSoft application or E-Business Suite and they migrated to our new Fusion ERP suite. That's a very different than simply lifting up an Oracle database workload and moving it over to Oracle. The application goes to infrastructure as a service and then the database goes to platform as a service. That's the faster process, but a much larger install base. Again my estimate is that business will move over - the majority will move over the next five years and that's going to give us enormous growth rates over that five-year period. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Ken Bond for closing comments. Ken Bond : Thank you everybody and thank you Holly. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issues earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department for any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you. With that, Holly, I want to turn it back to you for closing. Operator : Once again, we would like to thank you for participating on today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I\u2019d like to turn today\u2019s call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Ken Bond : Thank you, Kimberly. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Oracle\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before we take questions, we will begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had a tremendous quarter in just about every way as cloud revenue, new software license and earnings were all much better than expected. The adoption by our customers of our products and services is at an all-time high. But before going into more detail about Q4, you can also see that we have made significant improvement in our financial reporting to align with how we are running the business now. The cloud has become our predominant growth vehicle. As you can see in our press release supplemental pages, we have given you tons of detail. We have given you the detail in our new presentation format and we have also provided the reporting in our old format going back through fiscal 2016 and 2017. So, you can see the numbers the new way, the old way all including history to help your transition this quarter. I will first walk you through the reporting changes, then go over to Q4 results using the new format and recap Q4 using the old format for comparability to my previous guidance. Then, I will sum up fiscal year \u201817 results using the new additional detail before moving on to my guidance for Q1. So, please be patient as I am going to be giving you a lot in numbers today. But as I said, it\u2019s all in the press release tables that are on file. So, you don\u2019t have to catch every number. After all that, I will turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. In making these reporting changes, we are now reporting SaaS revenue separately as our tremendous growth resulted in SaaS revenue crossing the $1 billion a quarter threshold in Q4, having grown 76% in constant currency. We have also combined platform and Infrastructure-as-a-Service as the synergies and cross-selling between these two businesses is very high and this is also how we are measuring our internal organization. On Page 10, you can see GAAP applications revenue, which is SaaS and on-premise application software revenues and further down the page GAAP platform and infrastructure revenues, which is the PaaS and IaaS and on-premise revenues. For hardware, we have gone ahead and consolidated hardware products and hardware support into a single line item of hardware. And we have also aligned the expense lines where appropriate. I am now going to go over our non-GAAP Q4 results with our new format and use constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. This quarter by the way the effects of currency movements resulted in a 1% headwind on both total software revenue, including cloud as well as total revenue. Currency movements had a $0.01 negative impact on non-GAAP EPS and $0.02 negative impact on GAAP EPS. Well, clearly, we are absolutely thrilled with our Q4 results as software and cloud revenues were 4 points above the high-end of my guidance and earnings per share was $0.08 above the high-end of my guidance. As I mentioned earlier, cloud SaaS revenues for the quarter were more than $1 billion for the first time and up 76% from last year. Cloud, PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 45% from last year. You can see the continuing revenue momentum of our cloud business in the cloud billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now over $2.4 billion, up 63% in U.S. dollars. Cloud billings grew 42% in U.S. dollars this quarter. And once again, we have put the cloud billings number up on our website for you to see the detail this quarter and frankly probably don\u2019t need to keep doing it since many of the numbers you can derive. As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded. The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 65%, up from 54% last Q4. We expect to see further improvement in FY 18 and remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins over time. Now, the gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 47%, down from 54% last Q4 as we invested in our geographic build-out ahead of the bulk of the revenue recognition. When we approach scale, I expect to see improvements in gross margins there too. Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.4 billion, up 66% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $7.5 billion essentially unchanged from last year and while new software license revenues were $2.6 billion, down 4% reflecting the increasing preference of customers for cloud. Software updates and product support revenues were $4.9 billion, up 3% reflecting the continued high attach and renewal rates that showed the stability of our installed base of on-premise customers. Total software and cloud revenues were $8.9 billion, up 7% and 4 points above the high-end of guidance. In addition, the total on-premise software and cloud revenues for both our applications and platform and infrastructure businesses are growing very well now. Applications total revenue were $2.9 billion, up 10% non-GAAP, 8% GAAP, and platform and infrastructure total revenues were $6 billion, up 6% both GAAP and non-GAAP. In particular, our database business in aggregate grew 8%. Hardware revenues were $1.1 billion, down 12% and services revenue were $894 million, up 4%. Total revenues for the quarter were $10.9 billion, up 4% from last year, non-GAAP operating income was $5 billion, up 7% from last year, and the operating margin was 46%, which was up from 45% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20% as we saw some one-time benefits and EPS was $0.89 in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 14.1% and GAAP EPS was $0.76 in U.S. dollars. Because of currency movements, non-GAAP EPS was lowered $0.01 and GAAP EPS was lowered by $0.02. Q4 using our old format against my guidance, you can see that SaaS, PaaS revenues were $1.2 billion, up 75% and above the high end of the guidance I gave last quarter. IaaS revenues were $214 million, up 29% and at the high end of my guidance. Now, moving on to the full fiscal year software and cloud revenues totaled $30.4 billion, growing 6% in constant currency with $24 billion or 79% of that being recurring revenue, up from 75% last year. Cloud SaaS was $3.4 billion, growing 70%. Cloud PaaS and IaaS was $1.4 billion, growing 63%. Total cloud revenues totaled $4.7 billion, growing 68%. On-premise software declined 1% to $25.6 billion as the 3% growth rate in software support was offset by cloud related declines in new software license which were down 11%. Hardware revenues were $4.2 billion, declining 10% and services revenue was $3.4 billion, up 1%. Total company revenues for the year grew 3% to $37.9 billion and operating income was $16.2 billion, up 3%. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year was 43%, up slightly from last year. Non-GAAP EPS \u2013 earnings per share were $2.74 in U.S. dollars, up 6%. Because of currency movements non-GAAP EPS was $0.03 lower. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was \u2013 it was $14.1 billion, up 3%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $525 million. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.1 billion. I expect our cloud CapEx spending to be about $1 billion next year, roughly equivalent to this year\u2019s level. We now have approximately $66.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt our cash position is approximately $8.2 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. As we have said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we always have a disciplined approach to finding the right companies at the right time at the right valuation and that make both strategic and financial sense. This quarter we repurchased 11 million shares for a total of nearly 500 million. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 86 million shares for a total of 3.5 billion and paid out dividends of $2.6 billion. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. Now to the guidance, I am going to give you guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for FY \u201818. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency, but assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now currency shouldn\u2019t have \u2013 should not have an effect on total revenues or EPS. So for Q1 cloud revenues including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS are expected to grow between 48% and 52%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 4% to 6%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.59 and $0.61, up from $0.55 last Q1. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%. Of course the tax rate could end up being different. Over the full year of FY \u201818 I expect continued high growth in cloud revenues with cloud revenues materially surpassing new software license revenues. Operating income growth will accelerate and the continued expansion of cloud gross margins and the return of operating margin expansion. Over the last two quarters we exceeded the high end of my EPS guidance by $0.14 and as we begin FY \u201818 our compare is now that much higher. But even with this higher compare, I expect EPS growth will be double digit next year. As I mentioned earlier we will continue to invest in capital in our cloud data centers expansions, but I do expect our overall CapEx will be lower as the CapEx for real estate should be somewhat lower. With that, I will turn it over to Larry for his comments. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. Last fiscal year we sold more than $2 billion in cloud annually recurring revenue. This is the second year in a row that we sold more cloud ARR than salesforce.com. We are now well on our way to passing them and becoming number one in the enterprise SaaS market. Our rapid SaaS growth is the driving force behind Oracle\u2019s revenue and earnings growth in Q4. The reason we are confident that we will pass Salesforce is because we have a three-fold SaaS application suites for ERP, for HCM and for CRM including financials, procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, human resources, payroll, marketing, sales and service. Salesforce in contrast only competes in three of these nine market areas. Furthermore, Oracle is now the clear leader in cloud ERP. And ERP is by far the largest application market, not CRM. In addition to our demonstrated strength in SaaS, Oracle also competes in Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service. Here our primary competitor is Amazon AWS. During this new fiscal year, we expect both our PaaS and IaaS businesses to accelerate into hyper growth, the same kind of growth we are seeing with SaaS. As our customers begin to migrate their millions of Oracle databases to generation two of the Oracle public cloud, the AT&T deal is just the beginning. We expect that our Oracle PaaS and IaaS businesses will grow so fast that they will be even bigger than our SaaS business. Over to you Mark. Mark Hurd : Thanks Larry. First, I would like to congratulate Safra for getting through all that material that was a thing to get through. Listen, thanks Larry. Good quarter for us, obviously we tracked ahead of virtually every metric that I track, whether it\u2019s cloud bookings, cloud revenue, EPS, really everything on my KPI list was at a record level. Turning to cloud bookings, $855 million, it\u2019s the best quarter we have ever had, it\u2019s up 43% over what was a very strong Q4 last year. We had a goal of $2 billion in ARR. We finished with nearly $2.1 billion. Next year we will sell more. By the way booking revenue growth rates are given in CD unless otherwise said, SaaS bookings were $486 million, PaaS and infrastructure bookings $369 million. As Safra said cloud revenue growth at 66%, we are now at $6 billion annualized run rate. For total software and cloud, to Safra\u2019s point 80%, roughly 80% of our trailing 12 months revenue is now recurring in nature. SaaS revenue while up 76% was an acceleration from 40% growth last year. ERP was up 156% organically, that did not include NetSuite. Overall ERP is now over $1.2 billion annualized run rate. Fusion HCM was up 96%, most \u2013 more than twice the growth rate of Workday. In our front office solutions sales, marketing and service were all up double digits organically. Our verticals were up 111% and over $140 million in quarterly revenue. Our PaaS infrastructure revenue was up 45%, Database as a Service was up 62%. Our database business including Database as a Service and our on-premise licenses and support were up 8%. Cloud billings grew 42% as Safra said and deferred revenue up 63%, both of those are in USD. I am going to just name a few customers, so you get an idea of some of the customer wins we had in the quarter. I am not going to hit everything. I am just going to hit a few representative customers. I will start a little bit \u2013 I will start with ERP, Allianz, Ball Corporation, BNP Paribas, GE, the Kraft Heinz Corporation, Juniper, MetLife, Minerals Technology, Motorola, Mouser Electronics, NCR, Netflix, Newell Rubbermaid, Orange, Pearson, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Textron, University of Maryland, Vanderbilt University, Volkswagen. In HCM, ABM Industries, AutoZone, Fannie Mae, Fujitsu, Garden Fresh Restaurants, Landmark, Mary Kay, the National Football League, NTT, Raymond James Associates, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Staples, University of Pittsburgh, the University of Texas System, Vanderbilt and a very large investment bank in New York City who switched vendors to our HCM. Those are just a few representative customers across just a couple of pillars in the quarter. Lastly, as I mentioned, it was an overall a very strong quarter, bookings, billings and revenue, all at record levels. We announced an exciting deal with AT&T. And while it provided no revenue at all in Q4, it\u2019s a very strategic win as a reference to all of our customers about the modernization of databases and the movement of them to the cloud. Looking forward just a couple of predictions. FY \u201817 bookings were $2.1 billion. Our pipeline is very large and ARR will be higher in FY \u201818. I do expect our application ecosystem of on-premise that would include licenses and support and SaaS will grow roughly 10% next year. With revenue now at an annualized run-rate of $6 billion and the growth rate of 66%, we are clearly the fastest growing cloud company at scale. With that, we will take your questions. Ken Bond : Thank you. Kimberly, if we can please start the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, congrats on a great quarter. Quick question on the database side, Safra, thanks for the extra disclosure that\u2019s really helpful. I can see that the database license numbers are starting to accelerate \u2013 did accelerate in Q4. Is that already 12C or how do I have to think about them? Thank you. Mark Hurd : Maybe Larry might want to talk about 12C a bit. Larry Ellison : Yes. I think it\u2019s, yes, the new versions of our database are experiencing very, very rapid uptick. We have a number of key features. One is in memory. The other is multi-tenants. And people are moving to the latest version of our database more rapidly than they traditionally do. And we are seeing you saw evidence of that in Q4. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore. Kirk Materne : Thanks and my congrats on a great end to the fiscal year. Mark, I was wondering if you could provide a bit more detail on the strength in the ERP business in the cloud and why that seems to be accelerating? And just as a quick follow-up, I noticed you didn\u2019t provide any customer accounts this quarter by pillar. So, I was wondering if you might have those numbers for us as well. Thanks. Mark Hurd : Yes, I was trying to save time, but sure I am glad to cover. We had a little less than 1,600 new SaaS customers, 1,575 in the quarter. We had 1138 expansions in the quarter, roughly 400 of those customers who bought SaaS, also bought Platform-as-a-Service. So, again the attach rate between apps and PaaS continues to strengthen. ERP, we had 868 new customers. Now, by the way, Kirk, that doesn\u2019t include NetSuite. So, that\u2019s just inside the traditional Oracle ERP business. We had almost 200 expansions. That\u2019s a big deal, because as we start to sell in many cases financials we are now being able to sell supply chain, procurement and manufacturing into that base as well. Another good thing for us in the quarter is roughly two-thirds of the new ERP customers never had Oracle ERP before. So, again this is again 66%, 65% brand new logos to Oracle. So HCM, we had about 325, 326 new customers and 300 expansions and a little over 600 in marketing, sales and service and about 670 expansions. So sort of all-in, we have now about 13,550 customers in our SaaS active base. If you do include NetSuite, that number gets to 25,000. About 75% everything we did in the quarter was Fusion. Again, that would not include NetSuite. So, that\u2019s roughly speaking how metrics worked out in the quarter. I hope that helps. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian : Alright, thank you. I would like to add congratulations too. That\u2019s a really phenomenal quarter around this aggressive cloud transition. And I just had a couple of questions I wanted to address for the team. Safra, I want to start with you, you just reiterated the fiscal \u201818 double-digit earnings growth and I guess I think what\u2019s becoming more relevant is do we think about this as a 1-year phenom bouncing off of the difficult transition or how can we really be thinking about earnings growth beyond fiscal \u201818 into \u201819 and \u201820? And then Mark, my second question is for you, really interested in hearing some of these larger logo wins you cited in SaaS and ERP and HCM in particular and yet you are still seeing and we are still continuing to hear about a lot of traction for you in the mid-market reflected in some of your other comments. So, I am trying to wrap my head around some of these larger logos that we are hearing pickup, especially on the ERP vertical given its sheer size. And I am hoping you can guide us as to where we are with some of those large logos in terms of go-live, pipeline, etcetera? That would be really tremendously helpful. Safra Catz : Okay. So, this is absolutely not a 1-year phenomenon. In fact, what you should see as this goes on is we will have less drag from the transition and the base will continue to grow and so this should really accelerate and understand that in our PaaS, IaaS business, we are not even at scale. So, as we have really scaled that up, profitability is going to increase more quickly and revenues will be built on the base of another recurring revenue \u2013 of the recurring revenue business. So, we have been basically turning and we have had the drag of the move away from our historic business to some extent and revenue recognition that\u2019s not upfront, but ratable. Then all of a sudden, you are going to see less of a drag as that side of the business is smaller compared to our cloud business. So, we are obviously very optimistic we indicated to you all during last year this past year that this thing was coming and it has clearly come in Q4. And this next year and years after that are now going to be building on that base. Mark Hurd : To your other question, yes, we have got some very large active HCM customers. I mean, today, we have got Airtel, I don\u2019t know, they are probably 30,000 users, American Eagle 40,000 users, Fairmont, Raffles hotels, 42,000 users, Siemens 60,000 users, Wells 275,000 users, Xerox 38,000, Schneider Electric over 100,000 and these are big, big customers. And so those are just HCM. So, those are obviously very big scale customers. Now that said in ERP, you are right in what you said. I mean, we have a lot of mid-market \u2013 upper mid-market wins and a lot of new logos to Oracle who were not doing business with Oracle before they made this acquisition and that\u2019s certainly been a fantastic strength. I mean, our cloud is made up of a lot of new logos in addition to some existing customers. Now, in terms of scaled ERP customers though, I mean, Orange is \u2013 they are using financials, procurement, projects, supply chain management, GE Digital, Qualcomm, Hearst, Tesco, Ceasars, I mean, these are just sort of off the top of my head. So, these are big scaled ERP customers. Now to Larry\u2019s point and I will make it a little bit about HCM and ERP, the TAM in ERP is materially bigger than the TAM in HCM. So the TAM in ERP is 3x to 4x bigger in ERP. And additionally ERP drags HCM or can drag HCM in the transaction. So these big \u2013 these big ERP references that we have and obviously with the number we closed in Q4 and are going live now every quarter, more to come. We see an increasing pull of HCM in these big ERP transactions and they are true in the mid-market and in the up-market. Hope that helps. Operator : Our next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies. John DiFucci : Thank you. These are impressive results. And I will let others focus on those details. Mark, I would like if you could talk a little more about the AT&T deal, AT&T as you pointed out in the press release when that came out has been a customer of Oracle and we all know that, so I guess the question is how incremental is this deal to Oracle, is it a price uplift, because you are providing the entire infrastructure with cloud versus just the software or does it also include work \u2013 new workloads. And I guess can you give us any idea about how much incremental business assuming there is some which I think there obviously is, this means for you versus your previous relationship with AT&T? Mark Hurd : Okay. So first I am not going to give you really all of that many detail, from a financial perspective. So as your point that was AT&T a good customer before this up, yes. Is AT&T going to be an even better customer going forward, yes. Is AT&T giving us more revenue than before, yes. Did AT&T give us any incremental revenue in Q4, no. So is this deal ratable over time, yes. Is it a long-term agreement, yes, it\u2019s a very long-term agreement. Let me try to give you a little bit more color. First, it is a long-term deal. AT&T has over 10,000 Oracle databases. They have several hundred \u2013 and you might say John that\u2019s a small percent of their overall databases, but they have several hundred large databases that have 70%, 75% of all of their company\u2019s data. They have badly wanted to get the benefits of cloud, provisioning, a lot of provisioning and all the new features that come with product modernization, consolidation of that infrastructure, yet in many cases they have got regulatory pressures on what they can put in the public cloud and what they can\u2019t. This is an example where we have talked about this before, we take our Oracle cloud machine and we are able now to do all of that with them on their premise and give them all the benefits of the cloud, we manage, we patch, we basically run the cloud for them and we help them get all of that done. And so it\u2019s great a deal as this is. This is even a bigger deal John and what it represents for our entire customer base. This is a bigger deal to us than the transaction. It is the opportunity for us to now do this for hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of customers. The opportunity for us in the quarter and the reason we somewhat put the press release out was AT&T being so effusive about their opportunity now and what it meant for them internal to AT&T. But its just if not more important for us and what we can do for all of our customers. Just to give you a little bit more data, not in any or hardware numbers is we did in excess of 100 Oracle cloud machines in the quarter which or again us bringing all of the capabilities of our public cloud to our customers in their data center. So that\u2019s some details, although not the financial details of the deal. But frankly John, I think it\u2019s just as important what it means to our customers going forward on the bigger picture. Safra Catz : If I could just say one other thing to John, so the issue is really for the folks who have large installed bases of Oracle database and they have done the research of where those workloads should be, they pick Oracle, that\u2019s really what is shown. The folks who could go anywhere and do anything come to us and that\u2019s really the important message. And we are seeing that throughout the customer base and you are going to start to see it in the revenue. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you very much. This question could be for Mark or Safra, I mean obviously the cloud bookings number was very strong and I was wondering if you could just share with us any color on the impact that NetSuite might have had on the growth rate for cloud bookings and also well, I know you are not guiding to fiscal \u201818 cloud or SaaS, PaaS growth, I am just wondering if can share with us, Mark, you commented about having \u2013 doing better and expectation to do better than $2 billion in new cloud ARR, I am just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your confidence level there. And then just for the sake of clarity, since we do get this question from time-to-time, this $2 billion plus number that you mentioned is all new cloud business and does not include renewals, if you could just clarify that for people? Thank you. Mark Hurd : Well, it\u2019s great. You gave me one question with five parts, so I am going to try my best to remember all of your questions and answer first part, bookings. Our new and expansion bookings, they do not include renewals. There are no renewals in the ARR that we report, okay, point one. Point two, how did NetSuite do, I think they did terrific. I think they just did terrific. I think they are very stable. They \u2013 we have seen some acceleration in their growth rates from when they were a public company. I think they have just done terrific. So we are thrilled with the acquisition and we are thrilled with how they are performing. We are thrilled with the synergy inside Oracle. And I want to make sure I am clear that\u2019s not rhetoric. I mean we are really thrilled, but I have no facial expression I can give you, so that you can see it. Our pipeline is big, yes. I mean how confident am I in more cloud bookings this year, extremely, put quotes around extremely, underline it. But that said I think we are going to have a terrific year in the context of terrific pipeline. So I think I covered all your points, Operator : Our next question is from Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow : Hi, thanks and congrats on really a fabulous fiscal Q4 and thank you for the increased disclosure in terms of on-premise breakdown of outsource platform. When I look at your Q4 results in the context of the full year, it\u2019s basically almost impossible to argue that Oracle is not at the reaccelerating revenue growth inflection point in its transition to cloud, Mark would talk about apps, obviously has been growing mid to high single-digits, which is acceleration from last year, you talked about accelerating the 10% this coming fiscal year, so my question to both you or Safra is when you think about the platform side of the business here at Oracle, that\u2019s been growing at low single-digits, where does that business fit in terms of the lifecycle transition to the cloud in terms of just the trajectory of net revenue growth? And I just have one follow-up to that. Mark Hurd : Give us the follow-up first and then we can pace ourselves through the answers. Philip Winslow : If the PaaS side continues to takeoff and now I want to put through in the context of Safra\u2019s comments about CapEx being lower this year, the question I get is that, hey if this transition to the cloud is working, why is Oracle\u2019s call it, operating model different in the cloud, why is Oracle so efficient in terms of it\u2019s \u2013 call it infrastructure spend in the cloud and maybe that\u2019s a good question for Larry actually? Mark Hurd : Great. Okay. Safra Catz : Alright. Well, let me just talk a little bit about PaaS and IaaS together. The old IaaS was as you know a slower growing business. Our Gen 2 IaaS much faster. PaaS much faster, as it gets, it sort of completely overwhelms the base of our old IaaS. You are going to see acceleration, you must see acceleration, because it is inevitable as we do more and more transactions and bookings, which turn into revenues as people bring their Oracle licenses, their Oracle workloads to us, so you are going to see that\u2019s a very big area. Now, as far as margins, remember in our PaaS business or our IaaS business, the system itself is the same. However, what you see though is that there is enormous value in both our automation and in our technology whether different pieces of software that are in there. And depending on the mix, the margin can be extremely high. We have always \u2013 it\u2019s still the Oracle you know in that we watch every nickel around here. And we all sign off on every data center expansion and all the hardware that goes in it. So we really are very, very careful on not getting too far ahead of our revenues, but also benefiting from massive economies of scale. This past year, we did a lot of build-out, for which the revenue has not been showing up yet in the financial statements, but it will be. So, depending on how the different pieces roll in, we expect margins by the time it\u2019s the end of the year, we expect even PaaS, IaaS margins to be better, but we do feel we can do it within our CapEx envelope. Larry Ellison : Okay. So, let me comment. What is different, why do we not have these huge build-outs and then wait for the revenue. We have a just \u2013 we have a system, we build our own hardware. We build virtually all of our own hardware, I mean, not some of the network switches we buy those from Arista. We don\u2019t ship computers to any of our data centers until we have pretty firm orders for capacity when we are constantly measuring how much our data centers are used as our data centers reach, let\u2019s say, a bigger number 75%, 80% utilization. I mean, we have got to some threshold, then we start to replenish and add compute and storage capacity to the data centers. It\u2019s a just-in-time system. Those components will grow and go to Frankfurt or go to London or go to Singapore or go to any of our data centers around the world, but we do it in such a way that once we ship we know that we are going to have a very, very high utilization rate at our data center. So, with the just-in-time shipments and we only ship when they cross something like 75% or 80% utilization at that data center. So, we don\u2019t have a lot of unused capacity. So, if \u2013 let\u2019s just say if our CapEx was double what Safra forecast next year, that\u2019s great news, because then our PaaS revenues and infrastructure revenues would be much higher and make up for with much higher profits. So, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s clear. We don\u2019t make it until in a sense we have already sold it. Mark Hurd : Last point, first of all, just to add to everything Larry said, virtually most of the COGS other than what that Larry identified that fits in the data centers is ours. And then all of our R&D is aligned to all of our COGS and so we have both the advantage of being the major supplier to ourselves in addition to all of the R&D that we have into our technology. So, we get multiple benefits in addition to what Larry described. And Phil, just to be clear I just want to make sure I am clear on my quote, I said roughly double-digits on the application ecosystem growth next year. Larry Ellison : Alright. Let me add one more thing I\u2019ll do it for less. So, we build these storage systems than Amazon doesn\u2019t have and Microsoft doesn\u2019t have. And those storage systems are really a combination of flash and disk stored and we have these huge flash caches in front of the disk. So, from a customer standpoint, they think almost all the data is coming from flash and it has flash response times and flash performance, but we can do that, we can deliver that with hard disk cost. So, we can deliver that at about, I don\u2019t know 20%, the cost of our competition. So, storage is a huge component of what the cloud providers are selling and we just have the better mousetrap. We have a better storage hierarchy system than they do. Therefore, we can provide very, very high performance at a dramatically lower cost to us than our competitors. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Kash Rangan : Hi, thank you very much. Congratulations. I am curious if you could talk about what drove the strength in license revenue this quarter is certainly much better than most people\u2019s expectations. Did you have any products that were faced out or were comped out that you had any sort of pull-in potentially? And secondarily Safra, you talked about long-term SaaS gross margins approaching potentially 80% and if this AT&T deal is a harbinger of more databases transitioning to a PaaS model, what does the longer term outlook for gross margins for the entirety of the cloud business look like? And finally I had to sneak in one for Mark. Any thoughts on the sales force as you approach fiscal \u201818? Any changes, reorg etcetera? That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Mark Hurd : That has to break every rule in the question etiquette thing. I think first, let me go to license in the quarter, there is no standout event. There is no product that discontinued. There was no single transaction. There was no geography I would say North America, I will say, first of all, overall very proud of our sales org in general, but North America was very strong again that I think they did a great job across both of our teams in North America, but we were solid really across every geography. There was just no real \u2013 Asia was strong for us. Japan, I could go on. So, there was no deal. There was no product. There was no geography. It was just really a broad-based performance overall. Do you want to talk about the gross margins? Safra Catz : Yes, okay. So, SaaS gross margins will continue to increase all of this coming year. We will get closer and closer to my 80 goal by the end of the year. We probably won\u2019t hit 80, but we will be pretty close by Q4 in SaaS margin. So, I think that\u2019s good news. As a result, margins for the entire cloud business will be up quite a bit by the end. So, I am very, very happy upbeat and I expect margins to improve a lot. Mark Hurd : I forgot your sales reorg question, that\u2019s again, I saw a couple of notes on that. I mean, it\u2019s just like sort of that we are laying off salespeople. This is all just not true. So, is our sales force shrinking? No. Do we change things in our sales force? Sure. Is there any major reorg going on? No. But remember our competitors change. We have some very simple principles how we run the sales force. We lineup our sales force by product. We line them up by buyer and by competitor. And that market tends \u2013 those dynamics can change or competitors change we have noted over the past several years. So, you will see some shift in our specialization. That\u2019s sort of one point. Second, we are building out as we have told you over the past couple of years big hubs that are doing a lot of our selling. And so we have the byproduct of that is that our sales force is actually increasing in numbers, but our cost per salesperson is actually declining. So, our overall productivity is actually inclining. Those phenomena occur simultaneously. So, anything about \u2013 that you hear about we are reducing our sales force, again big news, nothing that\u2019s going on here. Second, we are increasing our sales force. We continually sort of realign our specializations based on competitor, based on product, based on buyer and we continue to build out and are very happy with the continued progress of our hubbing strategy. So hopefully that answers your question about the sales force. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Thank you guys for taking the question and also very, very nice to FY \u201817. Safra, as we are thinking about FY \u201818, I think a big question investors are going to have is on the license revenue side, the declines that we are expecting \u2013 should we be expecting something more in line with what we saw in Q4 like that 5% range in terms of decline or more so should we be looking at like FY \u201817 the full year like 10% to 15% decline as our benchmark in terms of how that license revenue decline is going to progress throughout FY \u201818? Safra Catz : Hi, Keith. I think this is quite cute. You know I didn\u2019t give guidance on new software license growth, because it\u2019s become less and less relevant. So, I don\u2019t actually intend to give it now, but I will give you a chance to ask another question if you have got one. Keith Weiss : Sure. Shifting gears to repurchases, perhaps the levels of repurchases that were done in Q4 dropped down from what we have seen in like FY \u201816 in the first half of the year probably sort of having to do sort of where U.S. cash is versus overseas cash. Can you give us an idea of how you guys are thinking about those repurchases into play? Safra Catz : Sure. Absolutely. I\u2019d love to. So as you guys know as I told you we spent quite a bit of money on that suite and so I needed to pay that back. And I have got a couple of quarters of still paying that back and as a general matter we like to buyback quite a lot of our stock, significantly more than at the 500 million a quarter that we have been on since we bought NetSuite. So one side paid all that back, assuming that I don\u2019t buy anything else big, I expect that we will do what we always do which is send the money back to you all, because its your money and so we will buyout your partners and so share repurchases should go up. However, our stock price is going up also, so we may be spending more, but lucky us, lucky all of us stock price is going up which means sometimes I will get less share. So one side pay back NetSuite, I do expect to spend more than 500 million a quarter assuming I don\u2019t buy anything else and anything else really significant. And \u2013 but I don\u2019t know how many share I will get back because of course I don\u2019t know what the stock price will be at that time. Operator : Our final question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Thank you. Congratulations on the strong quarter. So given software support is continuing to grow would suggest that the cloud has predominantly met new workloads from either new or existing customers, we would expect at some point soon your customers are going to start moving existing workloads to the cloud, so a couple of parts to the question, when do you expect Oracle apps and Oracle database for revenue to start moving to the cloud, which moves first, what do you expect the impact will be and lastly which of the \u2013 what of the migration is baked into your confidence in FY \u201818 cloud ARR? Mark Hurd : Okay. Well, all it\u2019s baked into our view. So there is no new news here. So let me flip the metric on you. If 65% which is not an uncommon number we have given you over the past several quarters is coming from net new logos, then the flip of that is 35% is coming from our existing base. So we have seen our existing base move. They have just to your point moved slower than what the new logos have. I actually think this is a good thing, because I believe that we will get all of our existing customers\u2019 on-prem, roughly speaking moving to our cloud infrastructure over time. Now, in addition when we do move and I want to make sure I am clear and say it again we now have a lot more data than I would have had 2 years ago. When a customer who is on-prem paying us support moved to the cloud, they pay us more money. They don\u2019t pay us one to one, they don\u2019t pay us two to one, they pay us more like three to one. In some cases more than three to one. In some cases we also get the attach of platform to the SaaS that we get as well. And that is not included in the three to one that I am giving you. So we are actually very positive about the fact that if people move from our application support to our SaaS revenue, we get more money. And to Safra\u2019s point about what\u2019s going on with our gross margin, we now produce better performance at the bottom line, because we get more revenue at a very high margin rate. So I expect that to continue as we get more references Mark. In ERP etcetera, you are going to see that accelerate. We want that to accelerate and that acceleration is a good thing for our customers and it\u2019s a good thing for Oracle shareholders. Now, the reason we made the deal that we made a big deal we made over AT&T is because of the implication that has on our database business, that is a \u2013 and Safra couldn\u2019t have said, but this is now a customer who is now a reference in the public domain explaining why. And now I think you will see that same migration as time goes on we have more customers like them who are in the middle of the process of moving now. And I give you an example of how much infrastructure was bought in Q4. Oracle cloud machines just as a \u2013 that is one surrogate, but what\u2019s happening and if that occurs we will get more revenue as well. And I predict we will be able to deliver higher levels of service, more functionality, more capability, more modernization as we do it. So I think you begun to see the application business, we love what we see in the applications business so far. And I think you at the beginning have seen it in the database business as well. Ken Bond : Thank you, Mark. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thanks for joining us today. And with that I will turn the operator back to the \u2013 call back to the operator for closing. Operator : Thank you for joining today\u2019s Oracle fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

Now, I\u2019d like to turn today\u2019s call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead sir. Ken Bond : Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Oracle\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.

As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we will begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q2, and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As you can see, we had another good quarter. Customer adoption of our Cloud products and services continue to be very, very strong and our on premise business remains very resilient. The result was that total revenue where at the high end of my guidance and earnings per share beat my guidance by $0.01. Today, I\u2019m going to do what I always do, which is use constant dollar growth rates on this call, so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. The effects of currency movements in Q1 were a little better than expected with a 1% tailwind to total revenue. Total Cloud and software revenue were $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency and 9% in US dollars. GAAP applications total revenue were $2.6 billion, up 17% and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenue were $4.7 billion, up 3%. Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 61% from last year. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 28% from last year. As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded. The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 67%; up from 59% last Q1. We expect to see further improvement in FY 2018 and remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins, possibly as soon as sometime in FY 2019. The gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 44%, down from 58% last quarter as our geographic build-out goes forward in response to demand, but ahead of the bulk of the revenue recognition. When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in PaaS and IaaS gross margins. Total Cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 51% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $5.9 billion, up 1% from last year reflecting continued high attach of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of on-premise customers. Hardware revenues were $943 million, down 6% and services revenue were $860 million, up 5%. Total revenue for the company were $9.2 billion, up 6% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 10% from last year and it\u2019s been a while since we last reported double digit operating income growth as we undertook the Cloud transformation that affected our income statement trading upfront revenue recognition of on-premise license revenue for recurring subscription Cloud revenue. With Cloud now in larger and more predictable share of the revenue mix, I expect that we will see additional strong operating income growth. The operating margin was 41%, which was up from 39% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25%, which was over a point higher than my guidance, negatively impacting EPS by $0.01 or so and EPS was still up 12% in USD and 11% in CD to $0.62. The GAAP tax rate was 14.5%, and GAAP EPS was up 19% to $0.52 in US dollars. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was 14.8 billion, up 8%; and free cash flow over the last four quarters was 12.6 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were 473 million. I expect that Cloud CapEx spending will be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS, IaaS build-out that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, should we see higher than expected ARR growth we would expect to see higher CapEx investments as well. We now have nearly $67 billion in cash and marketable securities, but net of our debt our cash position is about 13.6 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is 10.3 billion, up 9% in US dollars. As we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter we repurchased 10.2 million shares for a total of nearly 500 million. We are currently planning on bringing that rate up significantly for Q2. Over the last 12 months we\u2019ve repurchased 46.6 million shares for a total of 2 billion. And we also paid out dividends of 2.8 billion. The Oracle Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. Now to the guidance, and I\u2019m going to give you guidance for Q2 and my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. However, there has been some currency movements and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue and $0.02 positive on EPS. So here we go, Q2, Cloud revenues, remember these are constant currency numbers so you are going to be adjusting them for US dollars. Cloud revenues, including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS are expected to grow 39% to 43%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.64 and $0.68, up from $0.61 last Q2. That puts the USD number in the range between $0.66 and $0.70 at today's exchange rate. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere between 23.5 and 25.5 of course as usual tax rate could end up being different as it was this quarter. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark for his comments. Mark Hurd : Thanks Safra. A strong quarter for Oracle across virtually every metric that we track. In USD total revenue was up 7, operating income was up 11, and EPS up 12. In Cloud bookings it was a strong quarter. Overall, growth was above 40%. That was an acceleration from our growth rate last year. By the way all the numbers are in CD unless I say otherwise. Revenue up 51% now at $6 billion annual run rate. 80% of our TTM trailing 12-month software and Cloud revenue is now recurring. Now I\u2019m going to give you some SaaS revenue numbers by pillar. We were up 61% as Safra said accelerating for the 55% growth last year. ERP was up 90% organically. Overall ERP is now over 1.3 billion annualized run rate. Fusion HCM up 109%, more than double the growth rate of Workday. [CX] [ph] all of our categories sales marketing and service were up double digits organically. Data as a service was up 53%. The business is now over 0.5 billion in annualized run rate. Our verticals were up 20% and compared by the way of a 115% growth last year. And as good as all these SaaS numbers are, our application ecosystem and let me go through again what that is, that\u2019s our on-premise license, on-premise support and SaaS was together up 17%. When you look at any industry growth metric of the application to industry you will find numbers like 1, 2, 3 in the marketplace and market share gains we have are astounding. The PaaS infrastructure revenue was up 28%, business analytics were up 130%, data integration up 221%. Our database ecosystem, including the same metrics I described earlier, database\u2019s service, on-premise support, on-premise license was up 3% USD in-line with industry market growth. The origin compute industry as a service were both up triple digits. Cloud deferred revenue was up 53%. So as I described it was a solid quarter for us in top line growth of 7% USD in revenue and 12% EPS growth in USD. A couple of predictions. I expect Q2 cloud booking growth to be strong or stronger than our Q1 growth rate. Our Cloud bookings were executing well on a very big and growing pipeline. We expect the Cloud FY 2018 full-year cloud booking growth to be quite strong. Revenue growth now on annualized rate of $6 billion or growth rate of 51% and we are the fastest growing in Cloud Company at scale. I do want to read out to you a few logos and wins we had in the quarter just to give you some context for some of the companies that we are selling product to and I'm just mentioning a few, but in HCM this is HCM Cloud SaaS, 711, Aon, [Aries] Group, Baptist Health of South Florida, Cantor Fitzgerald, China State Construction Engineering Corporation, Cook County, eBolt [ph], Habitat for Humanity, Liberty Mutual Insurance, state of Nebraska, SUPERVALU, the Southern Company, an unnamed large financial services firm in New York that\u2019s also different from the large unnamed financial services firm we sold to in Q4. Just a few ERP names : Advance Auto Parts, ADEO, Coach, Eurostar International, GlaxoSmithKline, Grupo Bimbo, Hilton, Honda Motor, Modine Manufacturing, Nestle, Tata Communications, United States Steel, World Fuel Services Corp. I could go on. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Mark. On October 1 at Oracle OpenWorld, we'll announce the next generation of the Oracle database. When we deliver it by the end of this calendar year Oracle will become the world's first fully autonomous database. Based on machine learning this new version of Oracle is totally automated self driving system that does not require a human being either to manage the database or tune the database. Using artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error enables Oracle to deliver unprecedented reliability in the Cloud. We will be offering public Cloud SLAs, service level agreements for the Oracle database that guarantee 99.995% systems availability time. 99.995% availability means less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year. To achieve that level of reliability, Oracle has to automatically tune, patch, and upgrade itself, while the system is running. AWS can't do any of this stuff, but perhaps the most interesting aspect of autonomous systems like self driving cars on our new self driving database are the economics that surround total automation. Self-driving cars eliminate the labor cost of driving, plus the high cost associated with human driving errors. Self driving database eliminates the labor cost of tuning, managing, and upgrading the database plus avoiding all of the costly downtime associated with human error. Self driving taxis are much cheaper to operate then taxis with human drivers. Running Oracle's autonomous database is much, much cheaper than running traditional human driven databases like Amazon's Redshift. Customers moving from Amazon's Redshift to Oracle's autonomous databases can expect to cut their cost in half or more and Oracle will be providing SLAs that guarantee those cost settings to customers that move. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Holly, we could now queue up the group for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Sarah Hindlian, Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian : All right great thank you very much. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. The on premise business is definitely doing better, but we are obviously seeing and hearing more about very large marquee customer wins across your Cloud portfolio and now your app business is actually growing 17% constant currency, which implies you're taking market share, so I\u2019m wondering what you\u2019re seeing in terms of momentum in that Cloud portfolio and where are you see that heading and if there\u2019s really any benefit coming in from these large reference customers? Mark Hurd : Sure. First of all, one thing you said about implying we're taking market share I just want to make sure it is clear we are. So it\u2019s - and that\u2019s why I have been trying to give this number over a longer period of time that the apps marketplace is growing low single digits, and obviously we have been up and doing this for a long period of time in terms of growing at this rate, but there is no question to your point that when you can come out with references like we have publicly with Bank of America, AT&T and others, it makes the next opportunity easy when you can reference customers at that level. So, I think again and we have said this before, but probably better saying again that this sort of every aspect of selling in the Cloud, I think that the company holistically is getting better at. We\u2019re better, our products are better, our sales force is better, our ability to implement is better, our ability to do all of these things is just continued to improve quarter by quarter by quarter and manifest itself in the type of results we\u2019re talking about this afternoon. Larry Ellison : Yeah, I will just add. If you look at the growth rate of our applications business in the Cloud, in excess of 60%, and you compare that to either Workday or Salesforce, the two other major players - application players in the Cloud, they are not even close. So we\u2019re much bigger than Workday in applications and we\u2019re growing faster, must be taking share. And then our primary competitor in both HCM and ERP Salesforce has been at it for 15, 16, 17, 18 years they\u2019ve been at it for a very, very long time, but we sell more new applications customer then they do every year and that may be clear. We sell double what Salesforce sells in absolute dollars. We did it last year and we will do more than that this year, and we are growing - and we're catching them very, very fast. So, to just reinforce what Mark said, we are taking share. We\u2019re taking share across the entire applications ecosystem and we\u2019re taking share from our Cloud, primary Cloud customers - of Cloud competitors as well. Mark Hurd : Sorry, just to add, sorry to elongate the answer, but we're going to talk more about this at Financial Analyst Day after Oracle OpenWorld concludes. But again our support business and applications, when we do move a customer from our support business to our Cloud business we\u2019ve now done several of these and we get materially more revenue. We talked about this before, but it bears saying again because we sort of stopped talking about it, we get at least three times more revenue on a like-for-like basis when a customer moves from on premise support to our Cloud, and we really just, just begun to move that user base. Most of what\u2019s in our application Cloud growth that Larry just talked about is new logos. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan, Bank of America. Kash Rangan : Hi, congratulations. One question for Mark and maybe one for Safra. Mark can you talk about the new disclosure that came out in 8-K, you talked about some really ambitious plans for your SaaS business at $10 billion in revenue, PaaS and IaaS at $10 billion as well, can you talk about - what kind of timeframe are you likely to achieve this and how much of this is from acquisitions versus organic? And question for you Safra, if you're able to achieve these ambitious targets laid out, how should we think about the margin structure of the company? That's it from me. Thank you. Larry Ellison : Kash let me just jump in here and say that we also have an $80 share of stock price target that\u2019s part of the comp plan. We also have a target that says we will be double the market cap of IBM, double the market cap of SAP. I mean there are a lot of targets here. In terms of margin, we have a Cloud margin target that I think is 80%.  So, actually we are well on our way to achieving in SaaS - SaaS Cloud margin target, so we expect the margins in our businesses to go up, the stock price to go up for us to distance ourselves from our, if you will, our legacy competitors and join the ranks of the new generation of the Tech companies like, as Microsoft has done and smaller companies like Salesforce and Workday. That's where we position ourselves. So we think these are stretched targets and it will take several years to achieve them, but we think we are well on our way. We obviously believe they are achievable, but it will require sustaining the kind of performance we have delivered over the last several quarters. Kash Rangan : And acquisitions Larry in this forecast, are they material or is it all [indiscernible]? Larry Ellison : There is no one left to buy. And it's not like there are a lot of obvious, as we focus on the Cloud, there are a bunch of obvious targets, we can go out and buy. So we\u2019re seeing our best growth in technology that we have developed internally, our fusion ERP, fusion HCM which is the midmarket and the high end of the ERP and middle market and high-end of HCM. These are all internally developed systems. They are - HCM and ERP I think, our blended rate is growing triple digits. The size of these markets are enormous and we think we will be able to ride that horse, pursue that organic growth and meet our targets. So, I think it\u2019s going to primarily come from internally developed technologies, the growth of those technologies and us gaining dramatic amounts of share and applications in the Cloud, and with our new autonomous database also in Platform-as-a-Service and infrastructure as a service. We have to get all cylinders firing, but the bulk of our technologies will determine our success. Things like our database and our fusion applications we all organically internally developed. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Great, thanks very much and really nice quarter guys, especially for Q1. I have got a question for Mark and a quick follow-up for Safra. Mark, the apps ecosystem is off to a really strong start with 17% growth in the quarter, but with comps getting tougher in the back half of the year as you lap NetSuite, do you still feel that the apps ecosystem can achieve your double-digit goal growth goal for the full year? Mark Hurd : Yes. I think that I've said this I think at the beginning - towards the end of last fiscal year that I believe we grow roughly double digits in our applications ecosystem and this Q1 did nothing more than reinforce my belief. This is what we - as good as it was it is what we thought would happen, and I believe you will see that for the full-year. Our pipeline shows that everything else we have got shows that this will happen. Brad Zelnick : Great thanks and just for Safra, Safra mapping Cloud ARR to revenue has been fairly straightforward for SaaS, but less so for PaaS and IaaS is there any color you can give us just to help understand the revenue trajectory for PaaS and IaaS? Thanks very much. Safra Catz : We\u2019re actually holding over 10 more points on the PaaS IaaS right now because we\u2019ve had a lot of orders and we are deploying them and we will only start recognizing them as they deploy. First of all, all of our Cloud customer is a very large amount of it, it hasn't been fully out deployed. So you are going to start seeing these match up a lot more as we go ahead and deploying get those up and running and alive. I don\u2019t know Mark, you want to add anything or\u2026 Mark Hurd : Yes it is exactly right what Safra said. We just - I have good news, good news is we have a large on provision backlog and so we will get that provision and you will start to see that fold into our Q2 and Q3 numbers as we get that provision. So the good news is we\u2019ve just got a lot of PaaS to go provision and I wish we got it all provisioned in Q1, but we didn't. So that\u2019s really the work that has been done. Brad Zelnick : Great. Mark Hurd : Thanks Brad. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Adam Holt with MoffettNathansonhand. Adam Holt : Hi everyone. It\u2019s good to be back on an Oracle call and to see you all executing so well. My question is on the Cloud business and how that relates to the strengths on premise. We are obviously very strong in both applications and infrastructure on premise in the quarter, do you think that the hardening of your Cloud infrastructure and the strength in your Cloud applications business is actually starting to have a positive impact on, on premise revenue and how do you think that dynamic plays out going forward? Mark Hurd : Well the applications business and the Cloud business, the applications business and the tech business transitions from on-prim to Cloud are very different. As we move our application customers from on-prem to Cloud we\u2019re asking them to migrate from the e-business suite to fusion. As they move from our HR, we are asking them to migrate from Oracle HR or PeopleSoft HR to Fusion HR in the Cloud. So they are really changing applications. In the case of our technology business where you are running the Oracle database on-prem we're just asking you to lift or move your data into our Cloud. There really is no technology transition at all. So you really cannot to look at these transitions as being similar things. The interesting thing - on a very different, let's say Microsoft, Microsoft they took their existing Microsoft Office customers and moved them to the cloud, so you can save documents in the Cloud, where documents or filled documents, you move them to the Cloud. That\u2019s what\u2019s meant by Office 365. That\u2019s very close to our database business, where we are just beginning to move them to the cloud by just taking existing applications, actually the new version of our database as I mentioned is greatly enhanced in the Cloud and there is real motive to move it from on-prem into the Cloud here. Lots and lots of benefits, but it\u2019s not a technology change. In our apps transition you actually move to a whole new technology stack. It looks like almost moving into to a new vendor if you will. You move from Oracle E-Business Suite or PeopleSoft Financials and JD Edwards all of these on-prem customers that we have is on-prem business we have and you move to the fusion financials. That was a, that recorded a new implementation retraining your people and we did that, but that transition, as Mark just said, is just beginning. Most of our fusion ERP customers our fusion HCM customers, our new logos, and we don't expect when people move from their database from on-prem in the Cloud. We don't expect support to go away. We expect them just bring their licenses into our Cloud and you\u2019re paying support, you have the license, you own the license, and now you run it in our Cloud and you pay us additionally for running our Cloud just like you move the Oracle data business in the Amazon, while you pay them additionally. So, it is simply lifting up your existing license, therefore you keep paying support. You keep paying support, and you add on to that. Infrastructure is a service where platform is a service fees associated with running it in our Cloud. So we think that\u2019s a much easier transition for us. Then the transition we\u2019re making on the app side of the business. And look how well the transition on the outside of the business is going. Q - Adam Holt Terrific, thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Kirk Materne : Thank you very much and I will add my congrats on the quarter. Mark, obviously a lot of momentum in the ERP right now, I was wondering when you look at where the market is today, if you think we\u2019re getting closer to more of a tipping point in terms of larger customers setting up to make decisions on moving their ERP systems to Cloud over the next 12 to 18 months and when you talk to customers what are some of the reasons or I guess feedback you are getting that gives you confidence in terms of taking market share in this cycle if we are about to go into one? Thanks. Mark Hurd : Yeah, whilst you were getting a lot of - we had strong growth we had another acceleration in terms of logos. We had acceleration of ERP logos this Q1 versus last Q1, so we had more closures in terms of number of accounts and we had bigger companies looking. So it\u2019s significant to the point of your question. We also have more modules coming online. So, if you look at what we have got an ERP now, we have more localizations across more geographies, and we now have a full suite of the ERP supply chain, procurement, manufacturing, now budget and planning all available. So it\u2019s the full suite now across almost all of our geographies. To Larry's point, I think it\u2019s worth stating, a lot of our ERP customers, now our new logos. Lots of new financials customers and lots of companies that to be very - we would have never sold to 5 or 6 years ago, companies that are really named, but when you come to Oracle OpenWorld you will see another string of customers who never had an Oracle application before until they bought Oracle financials in the Cloud. So it\u2019s that. Then in addition to that, I think what really helps us is the fact that we are the only suite provider. So the fact that now a company instead having a bunch of point solutions can have a suite of applications and the opportunity for us to now bring HCM and ERP together to a customer gives us an incredible advantage across basically all of our customers. So you see now and the names I wrote - I read off to you, lots of what I recall high-end midmarket, low-end enterprise customers that are really the common persona of who we sell to, most of them new logos. I think you will see that continue as we go forward. The best news I can give you is that as we start to bring our larger customers over, Oracle will get materially more revenue as we move that support because we do everything for them. We do the hardware, we do the operating system, we do, it\u2019s our data centre, we do really everything for them, and we get the extra revenue as a result of that. Kirk Materne : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Phil Winslow : Hi, thanks guys and congrats on a great start to the year. I just wanted to focus on the platform and infrastructure side in particular and as you look over the overall numbers, you are still putting up very healthy growth rates here, both obviously in the Cloud with the PaaS offering, but also on premise. Mark or Safra why don't you just double click on just what you are seeing on premise side even as that PaaS is ramping that\u2019s keeping that business growing and question to Larry, obviously we\u2019re excited to hear about the new features of coming at OpenWorld, but when you think about the Oracle PaaS offering versus other infrastructure service plus DBMS out there, why is it that the Oracle Cloud can lower cost more than these competitors and therefore make it gain share there? Mark Hurd : Okay, they are pointing to me, I guess they want me to go first. The reason we can lower cost is we just automate more. There is a big difference between, what Amazon basically does, what they pioneered was this notion of, we will rank you based on what you use, compute, and storage and you can kind of bring whatever - and they offer a couple of databases, they offer Aurora, which is MySQL, their version of MySQL and they offer Redshift, which is another - their version of an open source database. They have made some changes to it, it is no longer Open Source. It's from Amazon for queries and OLTP. But these are technologies that are not automated. These are if you will old fashion technologies and a new fangled Cloud data centre, and available for record. So it\u2019s kind of an interesting new business model, but their database technologies are not very advanced at all. They have just picked them up at Open Source. And our database, our - especially the latest generation of database totally automates everything. So you don't - you push a button and load your data and you\u2019re done. You don't have lots of tuning parameters and lots of things to set up like you do with Amazon. Amazon requires a lot of labor to set up an online transaction processing system based on Aurora. That\u2019s a lot of labor, it is MySQL, it is a code that we maintain. We know it very, very well, very different than Oracle. You press a button, load your data, run your analytics. It tunes itself, it backs itself up, it patches itself, it never goes down, and it\u2019s much, much faster. Like you are saying it\u2019s much, much, much faster and then someone will say, we don't need that speed. Let me translate. If it\u2019s much, much, much faster and if it does in an hour what Redshift does in 10 hours it is one-tenth of the cost of running at Amazon because we charge the same amount for Aurora. So we take out the labor cost and because we consume less CPU and we compress the data and we consume less storage it is much - we are much more frugal about using compute and storage resources, and we eliminate the labor cost and the associate, the cost associated with human error. So we are not even trying to do the same thing as Amazon. Larry Ellison : To your other question Phil, listen I think there is a strong interest across the board. I mean listen, we have got obviously new features that come with release 12, you know that all those with multitenant within memory, etcetera, obviously our security options are very important given the world that we live in today. We have a desire for many of our customers to get out of all this work, to get out of patching to look at to modernizing their infrastructure. You may have heard what AT&T talked about, there will also be an Oracle OpenWorld and you will hear a lot more directly from them. But the need to not just consolidate not just get the new features to modernize those applications, but to get out of all this work to the point that Larry has described you know about now the fact that I can\u2019t deal with the amount of time it takes to patch all these hybrid environments that I have got. Now somebody - Oracle is going to do that for me, and then we are going to modernize the database, and now they are going to give me all these features, but you're not going to take all that work off my shoulders. So there\u2019s a tremendous amount of this. Now to Larry's other point, remember most of our customers stick with some somebody like AT&T. They have over 10,000 Oracle databases in that company, 10,000. So you're going to have a handful of those big ones move to the Cloud. There is still going to be up quite a few of those that stay on premise for a period of time. So that work is just a lot of work for us to help and this is the beginning of a whole string of customers. They are going to go through this process to modernize those database environments. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of John DiFucci, Jefferies. John DiFucci : Thank you. Thanks. I have - Safra, I have a quick, just a very quick question on the guidance and then if I could ask another question, just a clarification, you said total revenue could see, I think a 3% benefit on top of the 2% to 4% guidance you gave for total revenue right, I think I know the math is real easy here, but I just want to make sure that implies, I believe a 5% to 7% reported revenue growth if you get that 3% FX affect? Is that right by doing that math? Safra Catz : For USD, I\u2019m going to go through the entire thing in USD for you guys because you\u2019re not the only note. In fact, you're not the only note. So, I\u2019m going to go through it. For total Cloud 41% to 45% John DiFucci : Okay. Safra Catz : It really comes out like 4.5 to 6.5, but I\u2019m going to say 4% to 6% and in total revenue and then EPS $0.66 to $0.70 and making EPS growth somewhere between 7% and 13%. Okay. John DiFucci : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. But I'm the only note you need to read. But that\u2019s okay. Safra Catz : Yes they are all like. And it\u2019s a fair question because there are a bunch of rounding, it is 5 to 7, 4 to 6 it\u2019s somewhere in the middle there, so I am always being conservative so I will say 4 to 6 on this call for you, but you know me. Okay. Was there another question? John DiFucci : Yes, just a quick one, it is great to see the model work in the SaaS business with scale driving leverage here and I know you\u2019re going to say, we\u2019re also going to hit leverage in the PaaS and infrastructure as a service business or scale. Again I know there is a lot of variables here, but can you help us when we\u2019re looking at, when we might see this happen, when we might see this turn either the timing in next year or the year after or even the scale when the business hits approximately what scale? Safra Catz : Okay. So it\u2019s a little bit complicated because there is a mix between IaaS and PaaS. PaaS in particular is extremely, extremely, extremely profitable and however there\u2019s really a question of when the revenues get recognized and how much investing I have to do and how we line those up. So, we are just like you signed SaaS I know that it\u2019s a time, it seemed absolutely impossible that we would have the kind of margins we now have an SaaS, it seemed impossible and yet they came and now we\u2019re closing in on hitting, so much so that I actually went ahead and gave you some time next year for that hitting.  PaaS and IaaS are very much at least at this point in the expansion period. We expect this to be a very large business that we remain very conscious of the margins, and so we\u2019re trying not to invest too much ahead of revenue recognition, but as you see in this quarter alone we have a law that has yet to be deployed, fully deployed even though it\u2019s fully provisioned even though the equipment is all bought and being capitalized. So this is really, I can\u2019t give you an exact time because we\u2019re going to be very much monitoring demand and reacting to that. And for us it is much more important that we expand quickly, of course mindful of margin dollars. Sometimes not as mindful necessarily of any intra-quarter margin percentages. So, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Mark Hurd : I think there is no mystery to this, right. This is just like the SaaS business, you have to build out some initial infrastructure to get started. You have to build it, and unfortunately you have to put it at online before you can sell it, and that\u2019s what this is. There is a start-up cost to getting in these businesses. We are PaaS that in SaaS. We are deployed in now virtually all of the critical geographies and we now have scale in most of the critical geographies. And so you see it just show up in the margin rate as it has. We\u2019re going through that same process in infrastructure. The great news for us now, we know how this works. We know how to get it done, we know to measure it, we know how to get from here to there, and so you will see the same results. So it\u2019s just a factor of time and scale in bookings in Safra's last point, the ability then for us to get a provision so we can then recognize the revenue. So this is going to happen John. John DiFucci : Okay, thank you. That all makes sense, but should we expect that we might need more scale? I mean would it develop similarly how PaaS SaaS did or would we expect to hit certain margins we would have to get even greater scale in this business? Mark Hurd : No. I don't think there\u2019s any material difference in the context of scale. There is the same fundamental that\u2019s what I was trying to go through. You\u2019ve got to start up cost, you got to get a data centre, you got unused capacity to get started, and then the increments of capacity to bookings comes at a very attractive margin rate. So think of it, you have a baseline of acts. And then I get, and then I have a little bit of capacity per booking so to speak. It\u2019s not exactly how it works, but for the sake of your analytics how it works, and we know what that increment of capacity is for that booking, and then it is just a question of scale from there. So you take the unused space and then for each booking you get so - a couple of few cents on the dollar that you have to add internal capacity, and it just becomes the time it takes to get to scale. That's it. John DiFucci : Great, very helpful. Thanks. Operator : And our final question for today will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow, Barclays. Raimo, your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Maybe in anticipation of the Analyst Day, so I would like give a more broader question, Larry you started to use kind of, AI to kind of come up with the autonomous database, can you talk a little bit about like what more or how are you kind of see this whole thing evolving? Because there's obviously a lot of noise, a lot of hype around it. Some of the other competitors of you has come up with fancy names here, how do you guys see this play out for you guys? Thank you. Larry Ellison : We are using machine learning all over the place. I mean everything from the very highest level to - in our HR systems, our recruiting systems to look at a bunch of candidates. And it is kind of inspect the data of people that this company has hired that had been very successful and people have been less successful. So we can actually start to bucket the candidates. You know this group, you have got 200 people you are looking at hiring, 50 over here look very much like the 50 people that you hired over the last five years that have been enormously successful for the company. And that\u2019s the matter machine learning, using machine learning to just look at the profiles of individuals, companies hired over a period of time and make recommendations of how to prioritize candidates that they\u2019re looking at making offers to. All the way from that level to our new security systems, which are going in now, where we are doing a log inspection, where we\u2019re looking at people and the logs we look at unlike anybody else, we are in the applications business, we are in the database business, and we\u2019re in the Cloud infrastructure business looking at network logs and operating system logs, and storage hardware logs, we\u2019re also looking at database logs, we're looking at people trying to log on to application systems and the passwords they are reducing. We have all of these logs. And we are processing all of these logs in our Cloud to for example trying to find people who are going to attack a database and steal passwords, and steal data. And we think we do this better than anybody because we look at more data. We look at application data, in other words we certainly know that you're CFO is in the Ukraine trying to log on 50,000 times in the middle of the night. Maybe you're CFO is not vacationing in Ukraine and that\u2019s not her, and there could be a problem someone is trying to break in. We look at that level of data all the way down to IP addresses. There are strange IP addresses trying to figure out, we look at strange SQL terms, anyway we do - we look at 10 times more log information then someone like Splunk, who has been inspecting IP addresses, but not log in information. So, we get a much better picture of all the activity of what\u2019s going on inside your data centre and use machine learning to inspect this vast amount of data and see if someone is in their reconnaissance base of prior to an attack where we can shut them off while they are just looking around before they actually attack anything and then start stealing passwords and start stealing data. Again, that\u2019s also all machine learning. We\u2019re offering that technology - again in OpenWorld we\u2019re offering, the customers can ship their logs from their data centre and into our Cloud and we will do all of that security reconnaissance and security work for them. And the more of this information we have the better equipped we are to find a malware. You find malware showing up let\u2019s say Germany, and we know what it looks like and suddenly we have worldwide alerts because - worldwide alerts to recognize that the malware that should show up in California or at a - and as we know there is a lot of securities getting more and more important these days. The events at Equifax, very unfortunate. Events at Equifax is not going to be an isolated incident. You are going to see more and more things like this. You saw at the government's office of personal management, which was disastrous for our intelligence community. We\u2019ve got to do a better job, we got to do a better job of securing not only our Cloud, but our customer's data centers getting all of that log data using machine learning to - and basically what is a cyber war that\u2019s going to be on going for a long, long time. So everything from helping companies using AI to help companies hire the right people to helping data centers both private data centers and public data centers protect against intrusions. It\u2019s an important new technology and it\u2019s the centre of what we are doing with database automation, security and our applications. Raimo Lenschow : Alright. Thank you, Larry. Ken Bond : A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the investor relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Holly for closing. Operator : Thank you. Thank you for joining today's Oracle's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call.

Now I\u2019d like to turn today\u2019s conference over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Ken Bond : Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors. And other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. As a reminder and consistent with prior calls, Safra\u2019s and Mark\u2019s comments today will use constant dollar growth rates unless stated otherwise so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarter as well, as to reflect how we actually measure the business. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revisit our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. Customer adoption of our Cloud products and services continues to be very strong and what we have called our on-premise business remains robust. Bottom line, our transition to the Cloud is going well. Despite the currency benefit being less than my guidance, total revenue was more than the high end of my guidance range and earnings per share was at the high-end even at a higher tax rate than expected. Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 47% from last year. Fusion Cloud revenue was up 56% for the quarter. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter was $398 million, up 20% from last year. But just as a reminder, part of the Cloud PaaS and IaaS business is our legacy hosting services which don\u2019t share the same high growth characteristics as PaaS and next-gen IaaS services. This portion of PaaS/IaaS saw growth of 46% in CD and 49% in USD, while the traditional hosting services, which we are de-focusing, were down nearly 10%. As traditional hosting services become a smaller part of total PaaS and IaaS, the underlying growth of PaaS and next-gen IaaS will be more visible. I want to also take a moment to review the announcements we made in October of bring your own licenses, what we call BYOL and autonomous database. Unlike the applications business where customers move to SaaS subscriptions, stop buying upfront licenses and shelve application support, BYOL customers can leverage their years of investment in Oracle database and technology software and bring those licenses to the Oracle cloud infrastructure instead of cancelling their licenses and support and moving to rent new licenses. With BYOL, we are seeing a strong increase in our technology installed base as customers renew their unlimited license agreement, invest in more licenses and options and renew support. Because BYOL is now available and customers better understand their transition options to move to the Oracle Cloud, technology new software license revenue is dramatically improving from the declines we were seeing previously. We expect this trend to continue as we roll out Autonomous Database as customers license the options and technology they need. We expect to continue to take share in database. Now, total cloud and software revenues were $7.8 billion, up 7% in constant currency and up 9% in U.S. dollars. In fact, we\u2019ve consistently overachieved our software and cloud revenue forecast the last seven quarters. I focus on these numbers, which we refer to as the ecosystem revenues, because that is where all of our software assets come together and you can start to see the powerful dynamics of the business, especially with our BYOL model. Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 39% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.3 billion, up 1% from last year, reflecting stable software license and continued high attach of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of customers. GAAP application total revenues which is new licenses and support and SaaS, were $2.7 billion, up 13% and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenues, which includes new license and support and PaaS and IaaS, were $5.1 billion, up 4%. As for cloud margins, our SaaS business continues to scale and grow and the gross margin has expanded to 66% up from 59% last Q2. We expect to see further improvement in FY 2018 and we remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins. The gross margin of PaaS and IaaS was 40%, down from 44% last quarter as our geographic buildout goes forward in response to demand but ahead of the bulk of new revenue recognition. When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in PaaS and IaaS gross margin. Hardware revenues were $940 million, down 9%, and service revenues were $856 million, essentially unchanged in constant currency. Total non-GAAP revenue for the company were $9.6 billion, up 4% from last year and 6% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 8% from last year, 10% in U.S. dollars. The operating margin was 44%, which was up from 42% last year. The operating margins have now increased year over year for five consecutive quarters and while I can\u2019t promise this will happen every quarter, I do expect that operating margins will continue to expand. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was slightly higher than expected at 25.2%. As a result, EPS was $0.01 less at $0.70 a share in U.S. dollars, up 14% in U.S. dollars, 12% in CD. The GAAP tax rate was 22.1% and GAAP EPS was $0.52. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.6 billion, up 2%, and free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.5 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $599 million. I expect the cloud CapEx spending would be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS/IaaS buildout that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, should we see higher than expected ARR growth, we\u2019d expect to see higher CapEx investments as well. Now we have more than $71 billion in cash and marketable securities but net of debt our cash position is $10.9 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, up 6% in constant currency. This quarter we repurchased nearly 41 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months we\u2019ve repurchased 74.5 million shares for a total of $3.5 billion. We also paid out dividends of nearly $3 billion. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by $12 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. Now to the guidance for Q3. My guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. However, there has been some currency movement and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue or $0.03 positive on EPS. So, for Q3 in constant currency, Cloud revenue including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS are expected to grow 21% to 25%. Total revenues is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.68 and $0.70. That puts the USD earnings per share at $0.71, and $0.73. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere around 24%. Of course with the current and very real possibility of tax reform, the Q3 tax rate could easily end up being very different especially to the extent that there is repatriation. With that, I will turn over to Mark for his comments. Mark Hurd : Thanks, Safra. Really, a solid quarter for Oracle from top to bottom. Just a few numbers. USD revenue was up 6%. Software and Cloud revenue was up 9%. Operating income was up 10%. Net income was up 16%. EPS grew 14%. That\u2019s three quarters in a row where EPS growth has been over double digits. Safra\u2019s point about our apps ecosystem, our application revenue was up 13%. That is a GAAP CD number. We\u2019re growing roughly three times as fast as the market. I\u2019ve seen market numbers of two, three, three-and-a-half, so depending on how you look at those numbers we\u2019re more than three times as fast as the market, maybe for with nearly 90% of that revenue being recurring on a trailing 12-month basis. SaaS bookings was a strong quarter for us. We grew 42% in USD. That 42% accelerated meaning the growth rate was higher that prior year. PaaS revenue was up 47% and over $4.5 billion annualized run rate. ERP was up 66% organically. Overall ERP is now at $1.4 billion annual run rate. Fusion HCM up 77%, more than double the growth rate of Workday. CX double-digit growth with CX now at $1.1 billion annualized run rate. Data-as-a-Service, up 47%. Our verticals were up 19%. That\u2019s on a compare of last year\u2019s growth of 125%. Our technology ecosystem that\u2019s on-premise license, on-premise support and our PaaS and infrastructure revenue altogether was up 4% with solid cloud growth and new software license which was essentially flat in the quarter. In terms of our platform and infrastructure revenue that was up 20%. Now there are couple of things to call out here. As was mentioned first inside our PaaS and infrastructure is the legacy hosting business which is declining. Second, we have Oracle Cloud Machine revenue which is not yet reported, which we discussed last quarter. If you put it altogether the 49% growth Safra mentioned earlier, if all that Oracle cloud machine had been provisioned our revenue growth rate would\u2019ve been above 55% in USD. Business analytics was up 104%, data integration up 88%, storage and compute infrastructure as a service both up triple digits. Cloud revenue grew 41% in USD now over a $6 billion run rate and 80% of that trailing 12 months software and cloud revenue is now recurring. Our cloud deferred revenue was up 33%. Not just closing looking forward we\u2019re executing well on a big and our pipeline is the biggest we\u2019ve ever had and we expect to sell around $2 billion in SaaS ARR over the next four quarters, that being the second half of 2018 and the first half of fiscal 2019. Lastly, this was again another solid quarter from top line growth of 6% USD all the way down to the bottom at 14% EPS growth. I\u2019m going to give you a few customer names, wins, we had in the quarter and I\u2019ll just try to run through these quickly. But I think it\u2019s important for you to hear these brand names. In ERP cloud Adventist Health, AXA, Banco Santander, Pasha Bank, City of Las Vegas, Club Core, Emirates Airlines, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, John Hancock, Johnson Controls, Mattel, News Corp, Wessar Motor, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, The Bank of Nova Scotia, UCLA, Williams-Sonoma. In HCM, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Association Generale, BioWare and Pharmaceuticals, Chicago Transit Authority, The City of Atlanta, Deutsche Post, Emblem Health, Emirates Air, Henry Ford Health Systems, Mars, Shell, Southwestern Energy Company, Treasury Wine Estate, Williams-Sonoma. Just a couple on the infrastructure and platform side, Akamai, Alliance, Arconic, Baptist Healthcare System, City of Palm Beach, CVS, Los Angeles County, Orange, Softbank, Tellier, University of Durham, U.S. Census Bureau, Oil Fuel Services, Z\u00fcrich Insurance Group, a lot of logos. I could\u2019ve gone for a lot longer, but I just wanted to give you some context of the sorts of brands that are buying our cloud technologies. With that, Larry\u2019s got some comments. Larry Ellison : Thanks Mark. This coming January, Oracle will deliver the world\u2019s first autonomous database. We expect this innovative new technology to dramatically accelerate the growth of our PaaS and SaaS businesses and keep our database license business strong as well. People are buying database licenses to run on premise and in the cloud. You can run them either place. Their buying options to run on premise and in the cloud. Based on machine learning, the new autonomous version of the Oracle database is totally automated, a self-driving system that does not require human beings to either manage or tune the database. Using artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error, the Oracle Autonomous Database delivers an unprecedented 99.995% system availability. That\u2019s less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year. To achieve that level of reliability, the Oracle Autonomous Database automatically tunes and upgrades itself without human intervention. If a security vulnerability is detected, the database automatically and immediately detaches itself while the system is running. AWS databases can\u2019t do any of this. Even more compelling is the cost comparison between running the Oracle autonomous database versus running an Amazon database like Redshift. In a series of published benchmark tests the Amazon Redshift database on average costs five times more to run the same exact amount of work as the Oracle Autonomous Database. Let me repeat that. If you take a workload from Amazon running on Redshift and move it over to Oracle, your Amazon bill will drop by 80%. It will cost you five times more to run Redshift than to run the Oracle Autonomous. And this is not total cost of ownership, this is not labor, this is not - this is your Amazon bill, what you pay Amazon to do a piece of work, you can run on the Oracle cloud and pay $.20 on the dollar by moving from Amazon to Oracle. We\u2019re so confident of our cost advantages over Amazon that Oracle will provide our customers with written service level agreements that guarantee, that guarantee moving to the Oracle cloud will cut Amazon customer\u2019s database bills in half or substantially more than half. Ken Bond : Could we please go to Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler, Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Could you give us a better sense of what exactly is driving clients select between Oracle\u2019s private cloud, Oracle infrastructure service, Oracle PaaS, on-premise? Why is it taking longer right now [indiscernible] rollout? And then a quick follow-up question. Larry Ellison : Why it\u2019s taking longer, to provision the Oracle cloud machine, it\u2019s the responsibility of Oracle to deliver the cloud machines and the cloud software and then the customers, then we have to actually install these cloud machines in the customer's data center and hook up to the customer\u2019s network. And every customer is a little bit different. So it takes us a certain amount of time to configure the system on Oracle's side. But the big thing is now the customer has to get the appropriate networking gear and connect the Oracle cloud machine into their network. And that's what's proven to take longer than we had first anticipated. So we have a bit of a backlog on that. But it\u2019s a matter of, again, easy for us to shift. Everyone receives the same cloud hardware. That\u2019s easy for us to do. Everyone receives the same cloud software. But connecting it in the customer data center can vary from data center to data center and that\u2019s what\u2019s taking the extra time. Mark Hurd : Good news, Mark, is we sold a lot and we\u2019re in the process of implementing those as we speak and I tried to give them my comments that we would\u2019ve had a significant improvement in growth rate win if those had been provisioned and they\u2019ll get provisioned shortly. So it\u2019s been a very successful launch for us. Mark Moerdler : Excellent, very helpful. As a quick follow up, what\u2019s the use cases for Oracle Cloud Machine versus infrastructure as a service, et cetera? Mark Hurd : Well, listen, the good thing is it\u2019s sort of all of our technologies when you start it. So we have customers that use it for ERP, for HCM, and it really, Mark, fits more into markets where the industries we have regulatory issues. So if you get into banking and pharma, you have more of these security issues, I won\u2019t go through all of them in detail. And so in many cases, it\u2019s easier for some of the big banks, some of the big Pharma companies and frankly, even in telecommunications where you see it\u2019s easier to get through those regs, we\u2019ll just take all the advantages of the cloud. So let me just go through this, Mark. You get really all of the price advantages, you\u2019re buying variably. We do all of the work, we do all of the patching. The customer really doesn\u2019t touch this so they get the benefits of cloud on one hand while not having to deal with some of what the regulatory issues might be on the other hand. The downside is what Larry went through. We have to actually physically go in and implement this and there\u2019s some extra work that might be done as opposed to just hooking up directly into our cloud. Does that help you? Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Mark, you mentioned in your comments that you\u2019re going to do $2 billion in new SaaS ARR over the next year. I was wondering if you could help us think about how this translates into SaaS revenue growth trend as we look out over the same time period? Thank you. Mark Hurd : A couple of things. One, I was not trying to confuse what I thought this year\u2019s fiscal bookings in cloud would be with rolling four quarters, SaaS, ARR bookings would be. So those are two separate numbers and I\u2019m glad the way you worded it because I must\u2019ve said it right. The $2 billion is a forward-looking next rolling four quarters of SaaS bookings and I think that\u2019s more than anybody is going to be even close to that sort of bookings number but obviously we\u2019ll see. So we think that\u2019s going to be very, very aggressive. What is going to happen on the overall ecosystem? As you probably know, and I know I\u2019ve said before, most of what\u2019s in our revenue base today did not come from our on-prem user base. Most came from competitors or came from companies that really are in their first set of application, midmarket companies, fast growth companies, et cetera. So what I think does happen is just to make sure you understand, I think we said it before, but Oracle actually goes live on cloud financials right at the turn of the calendar year. So our e-business suite base, which is not the predominant piece of our cloud SaaS base, will see this as a big, big move. So we are hopeful when you talk what the entire ecosystem that actually we\u2019ll start to see a higher degree of Oracle\u2019s user base moving. And I want to emphasize again, that is a good thing. We get materially more revenue when a customer moves from support of their existing on-prem applications to now SaaS. And that is roughly three times or more ARR and the three times, I want to emphasize again, is the equivalent of a like-for-like support compared to their new applications in the cloud. So what do I expect to happen in the ecosystem? I think the ecosystem actually grows faster as a result of everything I described. Most of our base today did not come from the Oracle base. The Oracle base now with more and more references to move certainly our latest releases which are now in release 13, more feature-rich than anything obviously we\u2019ve ever had before, Heather, and as that support base moves to cloud, we actually get more revenue and, as a result, the ecosystem grows faster. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : I've got one for Mark and a quick follow up for Safra. Mark, Oracle has been maintaining share when we consider the entire database ecosystem, but we keep hearing competitors and surveys saying customers are moving off Oracle. Can you maybe share some firsthand customer perspectives and frame the value of what lives in Oracle database that isn\u2019t going anywhere versus the type of stuff we might be hearing about? Larry Ellison : I\u2019d like to answer that. Let me tell you who\u2019s not moving off of Oracle. A company you\u2019ve heard of just give us another $50 million this quarter to buy Oracle database and other Oracle technology. That company is Amazon. They\u2019re not moving off of Oracle. Sales force isn\u2019t moving off of Oracle. Our competitors who have no reason to like us very much continue to invest in and run their entire business on Oracle. I don\u2019t know whose moving off of Oracle. Maybe Mark does, maybe Safra does, but Amazon, you\u2019d think Amazon would really want to move.  Let me tell you someone else who\u2019s not moving off of Oracle, SAP. They had that database called HANA they\u2019d like to move to. SuccessFactors, they\u2019ve been trying to move off of Oracle for five or six years. SAP is running on Oracle. Ariba runs an Oracle. All SAP large customers run on Oracle. Amazon continues to buy Oracle technology to run their business. Salesforce runs entirely on Oracle. Go ahead, you tell me who\u2019s moving off of Oracle. Mark Hurd : Brad, thanks for the question. So a couple of points. Listen, I think when this comes up, I\u2019d like to just go back to the math and just go back to the numbers. We\u2019ve got sort of every other database being used just in shared terms is ours. And when you see us throwing up yet again another growth rate above market, it\u2019s just any of these sort of stories, anecdotes - by the way, I\u2019ve heard them for seven years, right? It predates me. So, you know, everybody\u2019s moving off the Oracle database or what you think of this guy or that guy? And the latest guy, somebody told me, what do you think of \u2013 what\u2019s that company? MongoDB. I said the only thing I remember about MongoDB is three numbers : 100, 200, 100. That\u2019s their revenue 100, 200 were their expenses, and 100 was their losses. And so I have that implanted in my brain and the $100 million as a part of $40 billion seems really small to me. I don\u2019t know. Maybe different, your math, your numerate as well. So I just look at our numbers and I look at us growing faster than market and it\u2019s now been going on a while. By the way, an important thing to notice, I don\u2019t really care whether we denominate that in platforms of service or, if you will, databases of service, licenses, Larry went into one example of a license deal, and/or database support. And I think when you look at that aggregated ecosystem, I guess with the stories, I just love somebody show up with something more than a story. Just show up with a number and all we do is keep showing up every single quarter with math that says, okay, could be true but whether Larry is talking about what Redshift, I brought up this other guy. Just look at the list of competitors out there and I just don\u2019t see growth rates that certainly nobody gaining share over us. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not swapping share with each other and maybe they\u2019ve got a story about this or that but when you just look at overall numbers we\u2019re gaining share in database. Brad Zelnick : It\u2019s really helpful to hear you frame it and hear it first hand from you. Just really quick really for you, Safra, can you please remind us of your view on CapEx spending this year? And does the deceleration of CapEx spend in the quarter signal anything around future PaaS/IaaS revenue? Thanks again. Safra Catz : Well, I think our capital expenditures will be very similar to last year. As I mentioned to you last year, we spent about $1 billion in kind of CapEx associated with the cloud. We spent about $1 billion in our real estate expansion. And the way that CapEx works really is there\u2019s a certain amount when we open data centers, and that cost quite a bit to just get started. And then the buildout is a little bit less because there\u2019s abasing starting block. So I think we -\u2013 and what happens is you start to get really major economies of scale as you \u2013 once your setup is basically set up, straight and ready to go. So I see it like last year. A lot of growth, about half of it is in real estate which I don\u2019t expect to continue necessarily as much on that side. So no, no deceleration, just trying to get some economies of scale as we build out. We\u2019ve got some plans but nothing. Now the revenues are coming in so that\u2019s why we\u2019re having the improvements in margins. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Adam Holt, MoffettNathanson. Adam Holt : As you will know, I\u2019ve been highly focused on your maintenance revenue of all things and this was the strongest license quarter we\u2019ve seen in really a long time. Can you talk a little bit, was it just the BYOL that drove the license revenue in the quarter? And shouldn\u2019t the stronger relative license revenue start to drive maintenance a little bit even faster? Safra Catz : Yes, absolutely. So it\u2019s not only BYOL. It\u2019s also in preparation for Autonomous Database. So understand that to get the benefit of Autonomous Database in the Oracle cloud, you bring your own license, but you may also, you will also need depending on which service you need, you\u2019re going to need some of the options in addition. And also, as you bring your own database licenses, you\u2019re going to want to have app server licenses and middleware licenses in order to work with your database. So all of that, that BYOL is a fundamental change and is significantly different from how SaaS works. And that\u2019s what I try to explain. In SaaS, you are now doing a SaaS subscription, you\u2019re no longer using your license. You don\u2019t need to buy more licenses, and you shelve your support. With BYOL, you buy additional licenses, you bring them to our cloud and you continue to pay support. And that is going to be very significant going forward. And it\u2019s already, you already see it in this quarter already. And we announced it in OpenWorld. OpenWorld. Adam Holt : If I could just ask a follow up on that because I\u2019m getting a lot of questions about this and I just want a point of clarification. Is there any kind of a lag between people buying the licenses and renewing maintenance first, and then moving to the cloud? Because I think what some of us are trying to reconcile is the cloud guidance is a little bit slower than it has been. So it looks like something might be decelerating a little bit, and I just want to understand, is there a gap as people maybe buy licenses on premise? And then maybe it\u2019s a quarter or two before they deploy in the cloud? Just trying to understand those mechanics. Thanks so much. Safra Catz : The mechanics are not automatic, so let\u2019s actually set this up. What has clearly happened, and I could already see this even at OpenWorld in talking to customers, they now understand that they will want to have more licenses. So as their unlimited agreements are starting to expire, they could have historically pick up. I\u2019m going to rent all my licenses going forward, there\u2019s no point in owning them, they would\u2019ve certify those licenses and stopped buying additional and renewing unlimited agreements. So what they\u2019ve now seen is there pathway with BYOL gives them complete flexibility of when they are ready to move to the cloud, but that there\u2019s a benefit in owning your licenses and buying more and renewing support. So customers moved to the cloud when it makes sense for them. Autonomous Database, which is coming out in a little while here, that\u2019s going to be an enormous driver for customers to actually move there important workloads to the cloud. You understand? The two are related, but not the same. Larry, I don\u2019t if you want to... Larry Ellison : I'll just chime in very briefly. Yes, they buy the license first, and a lot of customers are waiting for the Autonomous Database to become available. So we\u2019ve seen a big uptick in renewals of ULA, these unlimited license agreements. The sale of certain options that are required for the Autonomous Database, that\u2019s specifically rack and multi-tenant. The multi-tenant option those two options, and the high reliability option is called Active Data Guard. So all of those customers are buying those and then the Autonomous Database then rolls-out and begins to scale in January. So a lot of customers will have their first experience \u2013 the first big move of Oracle customers databases to the cloud really will begin in January. There\u2019s been no big migration anyplace of Oracle databases into anyone\u2019s cloud, including ours. There\u2019s been some, but it\u2019s a relatively very, very small business. This all begins to happen starting in January, where the capabilities of cloud are so much better. Or the economics in the cloud are so much better than what\u2019s available on premise, that we think our customers are going to move very, very rapidly to the cloud. But they are waiting for our Autonomous Database. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow : Safra, just a follow up for you on bringing your license and the subscription revenue versus license. Obviously you talk about the benefit of the license here and we saw in this quarter, and obviously we have seen on the total revenue guidance had a consensus for next quarter, but as Amit just pointed out cloud below. I wonder if you could help us just sort of walk through. It seems like obviously you\u2019re pouring more water into the license bucket, sort of less on a relative basis, than in the cloud. Just because obviously PaaS versus IaaS is probably 40% less for IaaS than PaaS. Could you just help us walk through the math kind of how you\u2019re thinking about the impact of BYO kind of on those two buckets? Safra Catz : So there are a few things going on here. Remember, when you bring your own license to Oracle IaaS, the service you purchase is more expensive than the basic IaaS because you get all of the autonomous \u2013 all of the capability you wouldn\u2019t otherwise get, first of all. But you cannot divorce the margin of just IaaS without remembering that both licenses are being purchased, and support is continuously paid.  That\u2019s why you heard me say, maybe you heard me say, the so-called on-premise license, because it\u2019s actually now that we\u2019ve launched BYOL, it is actually a misnomer because the customer \u2013 it\u2019s currently categorized on our income statement as on-premise software and support, for that matter. Those are called on premise, but there\u2019s nothing on premise about them. You can bring them to the cloud. So you have to understand how much money in that pool because with SaaS on the applications side, remember, we don\u2019t sell you a new license, you no longer renew your support, and you start renting SaaS licenses and the service all bundled together. So in this case, to the extent that - and, by the way, I just want to be clear, customers have the option if they don\u2019t want to bring their own license, to buy, to rent licenses through PaaS. That\u2019s also available to them. But financially for both them and us, it actually works out best if they bring those licenses and those with unlimited agreements can bring an unlimited amount of licenses to our cloud as well as continue to use whatever they\u2019ve got still on premise at their own state while continuing to pay support and buying additional licenses. So the math is more complete and very profitable for both us and the customer. Philip Winslow : Just shows up in different places. Understood. And just a very quick follow up for Mark on the cloud machine. Obviously, you called out that there\u2019s a deployment lag there and that it sort of cost you 6 points of reported growth. Just curious what customers are saying to you about cloud machine versus the BYOL to the public cloud. Just any comments there about sort of the success you\u2019re seeing. Thanks. Mark Hurd : Well, our strategy has been to give the customer choice. So to the point that Safra is bringing up, you have a choice to using whatever currency you\u2019d like. You can buy as a license, which means the customer buys one time as a traditional license transaction and can bring that to the cloud. And you can bring to the cloud a couple of different ways. If you\u2019re in one of these highly regulated environments like I described, you can bring it to the cloud, utilizing the cloud machine, which is a very effective way of getting most of the benefits of the cloud without having to go through some of the hoops I described a few minutes ago. Or you can bring that license all the way to the Oracle public cloud. Some customers, frankly, use it as a continuum because, back to Larry\u2019s earlier point about the autonomous database, it isn\u2019t just about the flexibility of how you pay for it, the benefits now, most of our customers now have the opportunity with the Autonomous Database to simply get out of patching. That may sound like a really trivial issue when you say it on a conference call with an analyst. It is huge to all our customers. I sit in rooms with CEOs talking but how the heck do I get out of this damn patching? Some of our customers have 12-month lag time between the release of a patch and when they can get it implemented, the release of a patch from us and when they get it implemented.  This Autonomous Database actually eliminates all of that. It eliminates all of the labor they may have on premise, actually DBAs and so forth that are actually running these databases. And we\u2019re trying to give the customer we think now exactly what they want. They can take advantage of this either on premise, they can now take advantage of the Oracle cloud in their data center with the cloud machine, or they bring it to the Oracle public cloud. And if you want to buy it as a license, you want to buy it as a cloud service, it\u2019s totally up to you. So that\u2019s been our strategy, Phil. And frankly, to Safra\u2019s point about the economic model, we\u2019re fine either way the customer wants to do it. And so that\u2019s our strategy. And I think, my opinion for what it\u2019s worth, is whether that shows up in a license and then brought to our cloud, that\u2019s great for us. Whether deployed on the cloud machine, and granted Larry\u2019s point about the latency between order booking and eventual deployment, it is what it is for a short period of time, but that\u2019s just yet another thing that differentiates us from what anybody else can do in the market today. I hope that helps. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Sarah Hindlian, Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian : There is really one thing I want to ask Safra that you mentioned, which was tax repatriation and possible implications of the Tax Code changes here in the U.S. I\u2019d love to hear more about how Oracle is thinking about it and different ways you can deploy your balance sheet. If you could expand on your earlier comments, that would be very much appreciated. Safra Catz : Well, to the extent that repatriation is part of the final bill, and to the extent that whatever is the rate for the cash that we bring back, either what we actually have or the deemed repatriation, that will make available to us under $60 billion, depending on the tax of cash that we can use for whatever would be available for us. We haven\u2019t made any decisions about how we would use it. I believe that it is mandatory repatriation. So, a tax will be due on all cash outside the United States for all of those companies, and I believe we\u2019d need to book it, or at least book an estimate for it in the quarter that the tax law changes. That will make our tax rate look sort of strange, but, of course, I\u2019ll disclose the amounts and all that. I\u2019m not sure that the final rate has been set, and, whether it will actually stay in the bill. So, we hope it does. We hope they do move to a territorial system. It will make us more competitive, and we look forward to that. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne, Evercore. Kirk Materne : Mark, I want to jump over the applications business really quickly. Just could you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment, especially around ERP and HCM and sort of what\u2019s underpinning your confidence in sort of the ARR growth numbers over the next year in that space? Thanks. Mark Hurd : Well, first of all, underpinning my\u2026 Kirk Materne : Your $2 billion outlook. Mark Hurd : Yes, well as I\u2019ve said several times, I really look through starting with like just our pipeline, so our pipeline is bigger than it\u2019s actually \u2013 or actually growth in pipeline, Kirk, is just as it sits this second towards the end of the year, is just superb. I don\u2019t want to go farther than that. I\u2019m just really pleased with the progress in the number of opportunities we\u2019re getting to participate in. And that gets to the competitive dynamics. If a customer wants SAS ERP, there really isn\u2019t a competitive dynamic. So, it\u2019s really us. So, we really lead in that category. And the reason we lead is because there\u2019s nobody else. Full stop. Now to the degree in HCM, that HCM is combined with an ERP, which is becoming more and more the fashion of what you\u2019re seeing, then we\u2019re obviously significantly advantaged. We have a competitor in SAS HCM. We don\u2019t have a competitor in SAS ERP. Now, the other thing I\u2019d say that\u2019s at issue is for us, over the last couple of years, is getting out of our traditional base. We\u2019re getting better and better at now \u2013 because historically if you went back six, seven years ago, we\u2019d typically call on the Oracle base of customers and the other traditional older on-premise ERP company SAP. Once you bought SAP, once you bought Oracle, those people didn\u2019t move calling on the other customers. That\u2019s all changing now. So now as customers get more aware of the difference between a traditional on-premise ERP and a new modern SAS ERP, we get a chance now to compete for their, these competitor customers that frankly, we hadn\u2019t had a chance to compete for, if you will, in the older generation of applications. So, I don\u2019t if that helps in the dynamics. By the way, those dynamics changed, because all of us usually on this call think about the United States of America. The farther you get from the United States of America, the better the dynamics become for us. Because of our global distribution, because of our global footprint, because of our global presence, because of our global references, because of our ability to deploy in multiple SAS data centers around the world, we\u2019re even more advantaged with the farther away you get from the United States. So I\u2019m optimistic. I\u2019m optimistic because we have great products. We got a competitive product lead in the most important application segment in the world which is ERP. We\u2019re about to go live with our applications internally and financials which now we\u2019ve already gone live with HCM. We\u2019ve gone live with other applications. Now we\u2019ll have our flagship product automating Oracle. We\u2019re just in a great position. I know that sounds like hype and I actually believe this. So this is what\u2019s going on in the marketplace and one of the reasons why in our company, if you\u2019re inside our company, in our apps group, you feel the sort of confidence and swagger that you see around our apps group today. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Kash Rangan, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : A couple of questions for Safra. One, Safra, do you think as the business continues to get scale, that operating income growth rate can continue to accelerate and outpace revenue? And secondly, just sort of a clarification, when you look at the guidance for cloud growth rate and kind of correlate that against what Mark said with respect to SaaS ARR bookings growth which looks to me about 40%, 50%. If you back that out of your cloud guidance for Q3, it looks like the IaaS/PaaS business, maybe it\u2019s a temporary thing as down to slightly flattish. So I just want to clarify that\u2019s the way we should be modeling the two different line items and how we should be interpreting your cloud guidance. Thanks. That\u2019s it for me. Safra Catz : For your first question, yes, I think that operating income is going to grow faster than revenue because we get economies of scale, we have margin improvement, and the business is growing. And when it grows, we get economies of scale that allow us to grow income, operating income faster than revenues. And I\u2019m quite sure of that. I think you should not confuse bookings with revenue, and PaaS and IaaS forecast looks good. I\u2019m not giving you \u2013 I\u2019m not breaking them down for you, but I expect them to be positive and consistent with what you would have seen. And just as a reminder, the PaaS/IaaS includes a piece that is not growing and a piece that is growing. The piece that\u2019s not growing is like 200 something, 240 \u2013 I can\u2019t remember. Mark Hurd : Just to try to help, I think the right word that Safra used is consistent. You should think of it being roughly the same in growth rate as you saw cash and the legacy piece is $0.5 billion, roughly speaking, annualized. So that would give you some help I think for the scale of the business. Actually, maybe a little more that but it\u2019s roughly right, Kash. Kash Rangan : So the comparables will get easier next year. I would think that for PaaS and IaaS you should start to resume that growth. Mark Hurd : No question about it. Safra Catz : No question because the PaaS/IaaS that we care about, the one we\u2019re focused on is growing 40 something percent. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Ken Bond for closing comments. Ken Bond : Thank you, Holly. The telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dialing information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call and we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. Happy holidays.

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revisit our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q4 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As you can see, we had another solid quarter. But before discussing Q3, let me just point out that the GAAP income statement was impacted by one-time net charge totaling $6.9 billion related to 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This is clearly a onetime event, so for use of comparison, we have excluded it from our non-GAAP calculation. Now back to the quarter. Total cloud and software revenue were $8 billion, up 7% and up 3% in constant currency. Inside of cloud and software revenue, GAAP total revenue for application, which is new licenses, license updates including support and SaaS were $2.7 billion, up 9% or 6% in constant currency and GAAP total revenues for platform and infrastructure, which is new licenses, license update, including support and PaaS and IaaS were $5.3 billion, up 8% or 3% in constant currency. Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 21% on a GAAP basis from last year in constant currency with -- on non GAAP basis with Fusion Cloud revenues up 52% in constant currency. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenues for the quarter were $416 million, up 24% from last year in constant currency. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue, excluding legacy posting services, saw growth of 49% in constant currency and 56% in U.S dollars. As legacy hosting services become smaller part of total PaaS and IaaS, the underlying growth of PaaS and next generation IaaS will be more visible. As for cloud margins, our SaaS business continues to scale in grow and the gross margin has expanded to 67%, up from 65% last Q3. We expect to see further improvement and remain committed to our goal of 80% PaaS gross margin. Now the gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 35%, down from last year. However, in looking ahead, I believe we\u2019re at the point where PaaS and IaaS gross margins will begin to improve with Q4 slightly higher than Q3. Total new license and less license updates, including support revenues were $6.4 billion, up 4% in USD with software updates and support revenue of over $5 billion for the first time ever, reflecting continued excellent renewal rate and the strength of our installed base of customers. Total non-GAAP revenues for the company were $9.8 billion, up 1% from last year in constant currency and up 5% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 4% from last year in constant currency 9% in U.S. dollars. The operating margin was 44%, which was up from 43% last year. There were a couple of the one-time in and out in the expenses impacting this but basically the operating margin has now increased year-over-year for sixth consecutive quarters. And while I can\u2019t promise this will happen every quarter, I do expect that operating margin will continue to expand. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was materially lower than guidance at 16.1%, reflecting the impact from the new tax law, as well as other one-time benefits. The GAAP tax rate was 222%, reflecting the $6.9 billion tax charge related to the new tax law. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.83, up 20% in USD and up 15% in CD. The GAAP loss per share was $0.98, driven by the one-time charges related to the new tax law. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $15.2 billion, up 13% in U.S dollars and free cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.3 billion also up 13% in U.S. dollars. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $286 million and we expect that cloud CapEx spending will continue to be driven by our ARR and should we see higher than expected ARR growth, we\u2019d expect to see higher CapEx as investments as well. We now have more than $70 billion in cash and marketable securities, net of debt our cash balance is nearly $10 billion, the short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion, up 4% in constant currency. This quarter we repurchased nearly 81 million shares for a total of nearly $4 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased $143 million shares for a total $7 billion and we also paid out dividends of nearly $3.2 billion. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. As we move to Q4 guidance, I want to remind you that we have a bit of a tough comparison as the last Q4 we beat our EPS guidance by $0.10. I will give you guidance for non-GAAP Q4 in U.S. dollars and also in constant currency. Assuming prior exchange rates, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue and $0.03 positive on earnings per share, so for Q4. Cloud revenues including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS are expected to grow 19% to 23% in USD, 17% to 21% in constant currency. Total revenues are expected to grow from 1% to 3% in USD and negative 2% to 0% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to be between $0.92 and $0.95 and EPS in constant currency expected to be between $0.89 and $0.92. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate of around 20%. The important thing for you to know is that for fiscal 2019, I expect the new tax law will translate for us to a tax rate of 19.5%. However, in any given quarter, we could see one-time tax events that will cause our actual tax rates to vary from our base rate, but I expected a normalizing for these one-time tax events our tax rate will average around 19.5%. With that, I will turn it over to Mark for his comments. Mark Hurd : Thanks, Safra. I'm just going to start with a few customer wins for the quarter and then make a couple of comments and I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. First, in ERP wins, Avis Budget Group, Barrick Gold, by the way also bought HCM at the same time, Baylor Scott & White Health, ERP and Fusion HCM; Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida Fusion ERP, Broadcom Fusion ERP; Caesars Entertainment, Fusion ERP and HCM; Dubai Ports, Fusion ERP; Eastern Line Technologies, Fusion ERP; Master Lock; MTM Group; William Morison Supermarket, all Fusion ERP; and HCM Arthur Gallagher; City of Memphis, again Dubai Ports; Grant Thornton; Henkel's McCoy, Marina Healthcare, also MTN brought HCM; National Oilwell Varco; Principle Financial Group; First Group, also William Morrison Supermarkets, and a really-really large U.S. bank who bought HCM from us which is one of the largest HCM transactions in ARRs that we have ever received. With that a couple of comments on a quarter. Safra mentioned our revenue numbers up 6% with software and cloud revenue year-to-date, up 8% and operating income up 10% and EPS up 16%, up 20% in Q2. We talked a little bit about our ecosystem. Our app ecosystems year-to-date is up 12%, we continue to grow faster than the market. Less than 15% our apps customers have started to move their core apps to the cloud. Between customers that are partially moved and those not started yet, we have an enormous opportunity. SaaS bookings ARR, ARR was roughly where I expected it to be in Q3 and with SaaS revenue now approaching $5 billion, I'll focus my comments on SaaS revenue as opposed to ARR. SaaS revenue up 24%, now over $4.6 billion run rate, ERP up 62% organically, overall ERP is now $1.5 billion annualized run rate. Fusion HCM was up 71%, that's a revenue number, doesn't include the bookings that I described a couple of minutes ago, verticals up 20%. Now we move to tech. By the way on the verticals, I want to mention the 20% growth is compared up 110% last year. On our technical system, year-to-date our technology ecosystem is up at 6% with the database ecosystem also up at the same time roughly 6%. And again we\u2019re growing faster than the market. The fact is that we are taking market share and with autonomous database just beginning to show up in our pipeline, this will only strengthen our technology ecosystem growth. As the infrastructure revenues up 28% with our NexGen PaaS infrastructure business growing 56% and we\u2019re already over $1.1 billion annualized run rate. A few highlights Oracle clouds, which includes database and service, up 34%. Public cloud infrastructure was actually up 142%, storage infrastructure up 82%, compute infrastructure up 121%, network infrastructure up 181%. Cloud revenue of 25% growth now at $6.3 billion annual run rate and 80% of our trailing 12 months software and cloud revenue that are now recurring in nature. We're executing well on a big and growing pipeline. Our pipeline is at a record level and our year-to-date performance with top line growth at 60% USD and 16% EPS growth reflect our success. Looking forward for the full year, I expect our apps ecosystem as I said early in the year will grow around 10%. The tech ecosystem will grow around 5% and our EPS will be above 10%. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Mark. Oracle was fully autonomous self-driving database is now available in the Oracle cloud. No other cloud provider has a fully automated database. One that automatically and immediately applies security of assets without requiring any scheduled downtime. Oracle's autonomous database features are absolutely unique. There are more autonomous cloud services to come. Over the next few months, we expect to deliver autonomous analytics, autonomous mobility, autonomous application development and autonomous integration services. Oracle's new suite of autonomous PaaS services delivers an unprecedented level of automation and cost savings to our customers. Our highly automated suite of autonomous PaaS services reduces cost by reducing human labor and improves reliability and security by reducing human error. No other cloud provider has anything like it. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Holly if we could prepare the audience for Q&A please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow, Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : I had a question around IaaS, PaaS, you saw an acceleration of growth which is greater. And Mark you talked in February when we talked about bring your own license as a factor that we need to consider. Can u talk a little bit about momentum you saw around IaaS, PaaS and bring your own licenses this quarter? Thank you. Mark Hurd : Raimo, it\u2019s why I continue to try to focus here on the ecosystem number. I mean I think again without autonomous database frankly being GA at this point being generally available as Larry mentioned a bit in his comments. We grew the tech ecosystem 6% and it shows up in different categories. It shows up in license and again licenses today are not really on prem, licensees are now currency that you can use in the cloud or you can use it on prem, so licenses are now able to be used both ways. And so we\u2019ve seen strong database, I\u2019d say strong database momentum in the context to being able to licenses and use in the cloud or on prem. By the way, we continue to see support grow in database at the same time. And you saw as I mentioned in my comments, growth in databases of service simultaneously 34% at all of the core next gen infrastructure categories grew in excess of 100%, storage is actually up 82% but compute up 121. We saw a good momentum. And again, the key for us so is that all tech eco system growth and I think with autonomous data base as we get a GA and build references, it\u2019s going to do nothing to get better. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash Rangan : Safra, I am looking at your SaaS guidance. Clearly, the business seems moderating into the 28%-ish type growth here. At this point, how do we get the margin leverage that you\u2019ve always talked about heading to 80%? Seems like on a year-over-year basis, you're showing an improvement but from 60%, 70% to 80% and what looks to be perhaps I am not putting words in your mouth, and it\u2019s basically your. So seems like a pretty big leap. And I just am curious to get your thoughts how the company manages to accomplish that goal? Thank you and that\u2019s it for me. Safra Catz : So in running our SaaS business, it\u2019s really now getting to a scale and we\u2019re able to use the number of new technologies that we\u2019re rolling out through the business that is giving us a lot more capacity. So before we had to invest more for the same amount of users than we do now and so we\u2019ve got quite a lot of capacity improvement. And in fact we\u2019re not going to need to make too many more infrastructure investments into the SaaS business and yet handle a much larger install base. I don\u2019t know if anybody else wants to add to that\u2026 Mark Hurd : For example, as we fully diployed database multi-tenancy in our SaaS, let\u2019s say we double our capacity without spending one penny on hardware. We can help twice as many customers, twice as many transactions, twice as many users without spending one dollar. So those are technologies we can add that allow us to dramatically improve our SaaS market. Larry Ellison : It\u2019s a straight math, so at our current SaaS business and you now play out we\u2019re spending $1.3 billion roughly speaking expense when you reverse engineer the gross margin. To Safra\u2019s point, we\u2019re just simply not having the dialog right now, dialog in the context of more expense. So if you just sell forward our bookings, you put $1 billion of revenue on the top, you\u2019re roughly at that number. Kash Rangan : And Mark, I think you just said that only 15% of apps customers moved to the cloud, the other 85% is ahead of you. Couldn\u2019t the company grow again faster than SaaS given that you have a significant option and you had a few investments in it? Thank you. Safra Catz : And to clarify, first thing you understand that that 15% have started, this is not 15% have moved all of their apps to the cloud, they just started so this is ton of room here\u2026 Larry Ellison : There's a lot wrapped into that quote that I put out there. And so let me try to unpack it a little bit. So in terms if you looked at core, meaning I have core e-business suite solutions and I replaced it with a cloud financials SaaS application. That percent of our user base has moved is below single digits. The less than 15% number we put out is the percent of our user base that has some cloud applications that they are now using. The percent of our user base that is in our pipeline now, is getting to be fairly extent, it's multiple 10% of our user base. And to your point when we convert a AI and traditional on premise application to SaaS, we typically get 3 times the revenue. The bulk of our bookings, the bulk of our revenue today is not from our user base. In addition, one of the biggest users we have has now just migrated to the cloud and that would be us, Oracle. We have migrated the entire company to SaaS, that's an important point because we've moved really the suite of ERP capabilities that we had traditionally on premise now to cloud. So to your point the ability to accelerate that growth rate and I have not given this number what we could do by taking market share and all of the above, which we truly believe we are and we\u2019ll continue to do by just moving the user base does turn us into a very, very large SaaS business and to your point very well accelerates our growth rate. Mark Hurd : I would like to add one thing to that is that we have some very high growth rate SaaS businesses like ERP and HCM, and we have some that we developed organically and we have some slower growth rate SaaS businesses that we've acquired many years ago. As the mix changes, you see all the growth is coming from Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM, NetSuite, it's also we expect after the quarter, this quarter -- great part of this quarter. As you see this shift to the higher growth rate SaaS services, I expect as our mix changes Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM and that's where it became a larger percentage of the total, again to growth mark, the math just says the growth rate should accelerate because of the mix change. I also think that's very important. Also the renewal rates, the renewal rates are much higher in the high growth SaaS services. So Fusion ERP, Fusion HCM, NetSuite have much higher renewal rates than we have in some of the older acquired SaaS products. So the combination of faster sales and higher renewal rates should dramatically increase our growth rate in our SaaS business. So you raised a simple question and you got a lot of guys in there\u2026 Kash Rangan : Analytical answer from Larry, thank you. Larry Ellison : And the reason I say to you because it's important to understand we actually don\u2019t have a SaaS business that really grows at the rate we report SaaS. We have acquired businesses that are growing low single digits that we've had for a while, Fusion growing mid-60s with the potential to grow higher. We have NetSuite that we acquired that's growing mid to high-teens, but to Larry's point, we think it's going to start we're start to seeing the numbers grow faster and then vertical businesses that are growing roughly 20. Mark Hurd : And as you see fusion becoming a more and more -- a larger and larger percentage of our total SaaS business then the change in mix you've got -- right now you would certainly have a very large fusion SaaS business growing at a high rate was then works those slower growing acquired businesses. So the reacceleration again to grow Mark it's just the matter of amount. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. John DiFucci : My question also I think has to do with the BYOL and I'm just trying to figure this out. So Mark from our field due diligence the flexibility offered customers would be BYOL as something they really appreciate. And it's certainly unique out there just no one else doing that and that's other vendors getting pressure to do, because you guys are doing it. I guess when I look at your results here and I see the cloud revenue been moderating pretty aggressively over the last couple of quarters, I buy into the whole ecosystem thing that you\u2019re talking about, it makes sense to me that BYOL will have that -- that would be a result. But I'm just to figure it out, because it looks pretty aggressive. And I'm getting pinged with emails too. And is that what it is or is it the large numbers too? And I am not sure if we\u2019re going to -- you said it accelerate a couple of times you used that word, and when I think of that whole ecosystem. Well that whole ecosystem is that what you guys think will start to happen at some point hopefully in the near future? Mark Hurd : Well that was about 20 questions. So I'm going try to do my best to unpack it. I guess we were talking -- you started talking about database and then you introduced my comments on acceleration, which was mostly in apps and mostly around one portion of the apps ecosystem, which is SaaS. Let me go to tack answer, and Larry is going to want to chime in on this as well. The concept around BYOLs we don\u2019t want our customers to pay twice. So they get the opportunity to buy our license they can bring that license with them to the cloud and they can bring for example a database license to the cloud, and I'll take advantage of that by the appropriate infrastructure compute, storage and then with that perhaps some automation. And if the customers choose to buy that way that will improve our license business in the way it's reported and it may have an effect on our cloud business and tech. And that's why I focus you on the ecosystem growth and the ability for us to grow faster. And then you have to add to it. We are just really bringing autonomous database to the market now. So that's going to go through its phases to bring the market. That and I told you this John over the past several quarters, our tech ecosystem without autonomous database, it's been taking a little bit of share. I think autonomous database is the most important thing we've announced in years. And I don\u2019t think the autonomous database -- I don't want to be sarcastic, because I don\u2019t want to be miss-print it, it will accelerate our tech ecosystem growth. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Adam Holt, MoffettNathanson. Adam Holt : We've been very focused on here, your total new license or new software revenues which includes license revenue and cloud. There's been some movement about which has been a little bit better, which has been a little bit worse in the last couple of quarters. But how should we -- if we were to boil down all the comments you\u2019ve made on last couple of questions. Think about the mix between license growth and cloud on a go forward basis. Do you think that license growth could get close to breakeven? And then just for your Safra, you started to really buyback some stock, which we love this quarter. Could you give us maybe a sense for what we should be thinking about from a share count perspective going forward? Is this the new normal on now the buyback level? Thank you. Safra Catz : Well, I don\u2019t usually tell you in advance how much I\u2019m going to buyback. So we did $4 billion in this quarter, seems like a reasonable amount to do. Haven\u2019t really -- don\u2019t really know what to tell you, because I don\u2019t usually give guidance from my buybacks, don\u2019t expect it to exceed that in the next quarter. Adam Holt : And then the question about license mix versus cloud? Larry Ellison : Well, there is no doubt that BYLO, when you're bringing your license to the cloud, encourage your customers to continue license purchases, it did give a buy more data base licenses, continue to buy data base options like multi-tenancy to buy data bases, data base options like real applications clustering and the like. So you will see -- and again our customers love the idea that once they make an investment in the license, they can use that license on premise or in the cloud, you can deploy it either place. So where historically people have thought of our license business as our traditional on premise business that is -- in fact that is simply not the case. In fact, our license business is now more and more -- our licenses are being deployed in our cloud. By the way, it\u2019s not just -- they're not just being deployed in our cloud, our licenses are being deployed in the sales force and the SAP cloud and the Microsoft cloud, in the Amazon cloud. So again, our license business is not our legacy business, our license technology business not a legacy business. These licenses are going to be used and are being used more and more in modern cloud, not just the oracle cloud but our competitors clouds as well. Mark Hurd : And I guess I would just say that, I know how badly everybody want to micro analyze every single number, and it\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to focus you back on this ecosystem. We\u2019ve grown our software business year-to-date 8%. Some of that shows up in license. Some of that shows up in cloud. Now, we have a couple of drivers we\u2019ve talked about on the call. We\u2019ve a autonomous database, that\u2019s going to show up in both license and cloud, it\u2019s a fungible currency in the context of how -- to the earlier question, but I can now buy a license and I can bring it with me the cloud, it could show up in either buckets. And again focusing on the overall ecosystem growth is important, the apps, we've talked about the user base and our ability to migrate to that user base, what effect will that have, that will show that apps support revenue goes down, SaaS revenue goes up. And so these things are going to go on simultaneously and again I'll say it one more time, I think trying to micro manage every line is probably the long way to look at the company, because we've got multiple drivers here, but they're all driving towards more overall software growth, some could come in cloud, some could come in license, but we're going to continue to gain share in both ecosystem segments. Operator : Our next questions will come from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather, go ahead with your questions. Heather Bellini : Mark, I know you don\u2019t want us to micro manage and fix data on license revenue, but you guys were seeing this segment shrink 10% to 15% over the last couple of years in '16, a big change in that performance over the last few quarters. One of the big questions that keeps coming up is what's driving the performance? And again, not trying to micro manage it, but there's a big debate of how much of it is just 12cR2 benefits and therefore maybe more one-time in nature versus maybe customers that are recommitting to Oracle ELAs, because of some of the things they see that you\u2019re doing on the innovation front. And I guess quite frankly, people are just trying to get a sense of how they think about growth in license as a result of all that over the course of the next year? Mark Hurd : Well, I think my answer maybe yes. But I do think at the core of it is what we talked about earlier, bring your own license, gives now the customers instead of having to figure out how much I am going to buy here or there, I now get the ability to commit to a technology and we now -- we get the customer now have a currency that I can bring to whichever monument I want, whatever quantities I want. And it now gives the customer ultimate flexibility and that's what customers want. So BYOL was a concept has given our customers a lot of relief, you add to that the fact that we also move to universal credits, now gives the customer the opportunity to make even a cloud decision and reapply those credits across multiple cloud services. So this is a very -- Heather, I would say, a very customer friendly environment we created now in terms of the way they acquire our products and it\u2019s having an effect on the market. Larry Ellison : Let me try to be clear about this as I could be. With BYOL, when someone brings their database to the cloud, some of that revenue goes into license and some of that revenue goes into cloud. Without BYOL, as we didn't have BYOL, and someone -- an Oracle customer went to the cloud, when 100% of revenue go to the cloud. So there's no question BYOL has lowered our cloud revenue and increased our license revenue. Heather Bellini : And technology? Larry Ellison : And technology. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : On autonomous database cloud, Larry or Mark perhaps can you talk about the impact that it would have on converting economics from on-perm, because it would seem I have to imagine you\u2019re going to get better multiples and the 3x that you've talked in the past as you generally get with regular data base and service? Mark Hurd : Well, the amazing thing about the autonomous database is the only database on the planet that requires no human labor to administer the database. There are no DBAs tuning the system, there are no DBAs applying security patches, there are no DBAs backing up the system or recovering the system, it's all the done automatically. But with the bulk of the cost of running a data base is human labor, it's not buying the software, it's not buying the cloud surface, not buying the hardware or the cloud services or anything else, it's the human labor and we basically take that to zero. So there is huge value up by getting without this human labor. By the way, it's not only cost savings so I think I said earlier in my opening remarks, we also eliminate human labor, you eliminate human error that gives you a much more secure system, nobody forgets to patch something. And your CEO ends up getting fired or on the front page of the newspaper, no one forgets to apply security patch and your data is stolen, that's all automated. So you have a much more secure system. You have a much more reliable system but you have to be willing to pay less, because human beings cost a lot of money and we've automated them out of the system. So we think this new autonomous database is again maybe the most important thing Oracle has ever done in terms of data management and we are the number one data management company on the planet right now, and have been for some time. We think this is a very big deal. We think the bulk of our customers are going to move the autonomous data base. Now when we talk about migration, when you move from an on premise database to an autonomous data base, you press one button because you don\u2019t have to set up indexes or retune it or do anything else, your data automatically moves from on premise into our autonomous database in our cloud running on high performance year that pretty much guarantees to give you -- if you\u2019re running Exadata on premise it will run at the same speed. If you\u2019re not running at Exadata on premise, it will run 10 times faster by moving to the cloud. And it runs multiples of times faster than Amazon. Now -- okay Oracle\u2019s got a faster database than Amazon it's no big surprise there. But the interesting thing Amazon charges by the minute and we charge by the minute is our prices are essentially the same or close enough. If we run 10 times faster, we are 1/10 the cost of Amazon database and that's what it is. So I mean we\u2019ve been all the public benchmarks are, you can go and look at them, we're 1/10 the cost. We automatically apply security patches, we eliminate human labor, it's a huge benefit to our customers to move to the autonomous database, it just went live a couple of weeks ago and we expect it\u2019s going to change the profile of our company forever. Larry Ellison : Brad, to your question about the multiple, the answer to your question is yes. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler from Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Safra or Mark, software support with constant currency has been growing 2%, 3% year-over-year in the recent quarters, but only at 1% this quarter constant currency. Are you seeing increased cannibalization of the on premise business by your own Oracle cloud SaaS and PaaS or there other factors that are coming in? Safra Catz : Actually, all you\u2019re really seeing is seasonality. If you\u2019re asking our cancellation rate way up, they are not. And in technology and especially with BYOL there\u2019s absolutely no reason. And in some cases for customer to cloud in the apps business, you will see cancellation. They are transacting not that large in the overall base. And so the overall cancellations for the company are actually the same. So they\u2019ve moved at all. And all you\u2019re seeing for the quarter is seasonality. I don\u2019t know Mark if you want to add anything\u2026 Mark Hurd : Everything she said is right and I\u2019d say nothing other than to say it\u2019s a little bit of a two different stories. So in data base support, data base support is growing I just want to make sure it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s growing materially, it\u2019s not growing 1%, it\u2019s growing more than 1%. Apps support the decline apps support decline is actually in our case is the bulk of our apps support is ERP that is the bulk of our application support. We want to migrate that to SaaS. So overtime, I have no issue if the ERP cancellation goes up as we migrate those customers I talked about earlier does that. And to Larry\u2019s earlier about point of about BYOL, BYOL very likely will have the impact of continuing growth in the tech, support part of our business and the applications now that I described is very much a byproduct of the migration of our support through to SaaS. Does that help? Mark Moerdler : Just quick follow up. Is it the seasonality then so that Q3 is going to be weaker effectively and other quarters are better. Is that the way should be thinking models, can you give more detail? Safra Catz : It just happens to be when we do the renewal. So I think you will see a return. And because you asked -- you compared a full year to one quarter and I think you will see that it recover I mean as Mark just said, on the tech side -- and remember also that some of it has to do with first year support. So since we\u2019re selling less apps licenses, we have less first year support associated with those licenses. And so -- and that\u2019s been for the past few years, so the amount floating is a little bit less, cancellation rates are the same and then we have some folks on the app side migrate. But that\u2019s it, still growing. Larry Ellison : Let me just, real quickly. On the applications business, if someone moves in the e-business suite to the Oracle -- to Fusion ERP, they stop paying support, support goes down and a 100% of the Fusion ERP revenue is recognized in the cloud. This is in contrast to our tech business where if someone has an Oracle license or buys an additional Oracle license and then brings that license to the cloud, our license business stays the same or goes up. And part of the autonomous database that's running in the cloud is recognized as part of a license and support business. And part of the revenue for the autonomous database is recognized as cloud revenue. So it's split. So these two businesses operate very differently. In our applications business, we're migrating people from an older generation of applications to a new generation of applications. We're actually changing from one product to another. We're changing from e-business suites to Fusion ERP, which is a different product. One runs on-premise, one runs in the cloud. Our tech business is very, very different. Oracle database on premise, you run the same Oracle database in the cloud. So we don\u2019t expect any shrinkage. As Mark said, we expect our license business, our new license business, our license and support business for tech, specifically database, to continue to grow even as people migrate those databases to the cloud. Safra Catz : Yes, net-net tech really accelerates completely unchanged. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Kirk Materne, Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Mark, when you look at the opportunities front in the ERP market, we've absolutely seen an inflection demand in CRM, I would say, HCM started over last couple of years. When you think about ERP, do you see an inflection on the horizon over the next 12 to 18 months? And can you just discuss maybe why and if we do see that, how do you see the competitive environment shaping up? Thanks. Mark Hurd : Well one in ERP, we are the leading vendor in the world, and the number two company is hard for me to find. So let me start with that. So when I look at SaaS, there is no other company that has the ability to take customers to the cloud with a true SaaS offering. So full stop. Second, we have an inflection point clearly with our user base. So our user base as we\u2019ve tried to talk about today has only begun to move. And so just to the earlier question imagine what happens to our applications revenue, when we multiply three to one, actually our revenue doubles, our support revenue doubles, support revenue gets three times that revenue in the cloud. All I did in that math was talk about our user base. The bulk of what we book today in many cases is outside our user base. Larry Ellison : Yes, someone else's user base. Mark Hurd : We are gaining share from other companies. So I don\u2019t want you to walk away from this cold thinking I got it, their SaaS revenues really limited to their user base. I just talked about that in the context of one catalyst to our SaaS revenue, which is converting our existing customers just upgrading them to the latest version of ERP, which is SaaS. I truly believe the opportunity is materially bigger than that. Most of the ERP market doesn't sit with SAP by the way, doesn't sit with the -- the majority of the market doesn't sit with Oracle or SAP, it sits with this category called others. And as others would like the opportunity to move to SaaS, we're in the best position in the world, worldwide to move those companies to SaaS. So moving our user base has a dramatic implication on our applications ecosystem. If we're successful to continue to take share at the same time, yes, it's a pretty exciting opportunity for us. And that's why you hear us talk about it so much. Ken Bond : Thanks Mark. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department for any follow-up questions from this call and we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Holly for closing. Operator : Thank you for joining us for today's Oracle Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your participation.

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. We had a terrific quarter and a tremendous number of wins in the cloud, with total revenue growth 1 point above the high end of my guidance, and earnings per share $0.05 above the high end of my guidance. Before further discussing our Q4 results, I'd like to comment on updates we've made to our financial reporting, so as to better describe our business since we introduced the BYOL license initiative to our customers. BYOL, which is bring your own license, allows customers to move their existing on-premise licenses to the Oracle Cloud so long as they continue to pay support for those licenses. BYOL also makes it cost effective for customers to buy new licenses even if those licenses are only going to be used in the cloud. So some of our customers are buying new licenses and immediately deploying them in the cloud. In fact, our largest license sale in the quarter was a cloud license. Other customers, like AT&T in the release, are moving their existing licenses -- excuse me, moving the existing licenses they own to the cloud, while continuing to pay support. Support for licenses that have been moved to the cloud is Cloud Support. As a result, our new License revenue is now a combination of new cloud licenses and new on-premise licenses. Our Support Revenue is now a combination of cloud license support revenue and on-premise license support revenue. To reflect these changes in our business, we have now labeled new software licenses as Cloud License and On-Premise License. And we've combined cloud SaaS, plus cloud PaaS and IaaS, plus software license updates and product support into Cloud Services and License Support. So to say it another way, customers are entering into large database contracts where some of those database licenses are to be deployed on-premise, while other database licenses are used in the cloud. Previously, all of those license and its related support revenue would have been counted entirely as On-Premise, which clearly, it isn't. In addition, customers that are in the process of moving their existing database licenses to the cloud previously had all of their support revenue counted as On-Premise, again, which it isn't. We have reflected these revenue reporting updates in our expense reporting as well. Our cloud, SaaS and PaaS and IaaS services are all moving into our new second generation data centers based on our bare metal infrastructure with a single unified operations team. Data center expenses there are shared across SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, giving us economies of scale and other efficiencies. We've also consolidated most support functions across our software technologies in the cloud and on-premise. Sharing our teams across the different offerings allows for improved asset utilization and has a positive effect on our gross and operating margin. Now that we have built a rapidly growing multibillion-dollar cloud business, our management team is focused on 2 principal financial measures to judge our success : First, we expect our overall revenue growth rate to accelerate because our growing cloud revenue is becoming a larger and larger percentage of our total revenue. While any one quarter's results may vary, we expect to increase our revenue growth rate with this year and beyond. Second, we expect that we will once again deliver double-digit EPS growth for the year. Okay, turning back to our results. First, I'll go over Q4 and recap fiscal year 2018 before moving on to my guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.  As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise. This quarter, currency movements resulted in a 2% tailwind on revenue, which was approximately $140 million less than when guidance was given. And currency movements had a $0.02 positive impact to non-GAAP EPS, which was $0.01 less than the $0.03 which I guided to. Regardless, we've exceeded the high end of both ranges. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 5% in constant currency, 7% in U.S. dollars. Under our prior reporting structure, in Q4, what we previously called Total Cloud revenues were $1,700,000,000. I cannot stress enough the stability and growth of our installed base of customers quarter after quarter. Our customers are maintaining and expanding their Oracle environment because they have portability to use our licensed software on-premise, in the cloud or via hybrid environment. This is largely because our products are capable of doing things others just can't do, whether that's security, performance, scalability or the autonomous features that only our database has. As our customers adopt our technologies, whether via licenses or cloud services, our overall customer base is growing, and that growth is starting to accelerate. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, and as we continue to scale and grow, I expect this will go even higher.  Total revenues for the quarter were $11.3 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.3 billion, up 4% from last year. And the operating margin was 47%, which was up from 46% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 19.2%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%. And EPS was USD 0.99, up 11%, and up 9% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 17.7% and GAAP EPS was USD 0.82, up 8%, and up 5% in constant currency. Now moving on to the full fiscal year. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue was $26.3 billion, growing 7%. Total company revenues for the year grew 3% to $39.9 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 3.12, up 11% in constant currency, and up 14% in USD. This was largely driven by the acceleration in operating income growth, which was up 9% in USD, 6% in constant currency. This is mirrored in our operating margin for the full year, which was up from 43% last year to 44% this year. As a reminder, our best ever full year operating margin was 47%, and I expect we will surpass that in the coming years as our total revenue growth accelerates and we benefit from greater scale in our business. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was a record $15.4 billion, up 9% in USD. Capital expenditures for the year were $1.7 billion. And free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.7 billion, up 13% in USD. We now have approximately $67.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $6.6 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.4 billion, up 2% in constant currency. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 106 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 238 million shares for a total of $11.5 billion. Since FY '11, when we ramped up the share purchase program, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 20%. In addition, we have paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. Now to the guidance. First of all, we will be adopting the new accounting standard, ASC 606, with a full retrospective view starting in Q1. We will also provide you with the prior year results reflecting ASC 606 so that you can compare it. Secondly, my EPS guidance for both Q1 and FY '19 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base rate, but I expect that in normalizing for these one-time events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year of 2019. Importantly, in regard to Q1 guidance, exchange rates have moved from a 3% revenue tailwind to now being a 1% headwind from the last time I gave guidance. That is a 4% negative move, which impacts revenue in Q1 by about $300 million. It also impacts EPS negatively by $0.03. So for my guidance, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 9% and 13%. I'll do the math for you, that's between $0.67 and $0.69. And non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 11% and 15%. And again, doing the math, that's $0.68 to $0.70. For the full year, we expect to have a higher revenue growth rate than FY '18 and to, once again, deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. Total CapEx for FY '19 is expected to be similar to FY '18's CapEx of $1.7 billion, but it could be a little higher, depending on bookings. With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments. Mark Hurd : Thanks, Safra. I thought for a change I'd just start by listing off cloud wins in Q4. Let's start with ERP. Let me just run through some of these brands : BAE; Baylor University; Cerberus Capital Management; Con Ed; Cox Communications; Danaher; Facebook; General Dynamics; Genuine Auto Parts; Intel; Johnson & Johnson; Kohl's Department Stores; Land O'Lakes; Marsh & McLennan; Mount Sinai Health System; Pernod Ricard; Scholastic Corporation; Siemens; Cleveland Clinic; Time, Inc.; United Parcel. These can be modules. In many cases, we're replacing in for SAP. Some cases, upgrading our user [ base. ] This was a fantastic ERP quarter, and not just in volume, but the quality of the brand. Let me turn to HCM. Before I go into detail, let me just say, every win is versus Workday, full SOP : Akamai; AT&T Baylor University. As you can tell, that was a dual ERP HCM win. You'll hear a few of those : City of Jacksonville; Con Ed; Delta Dental; First Data; Grupo Televisa; Ingersoll-Rand; Juniper; Lawrence Berkeley National Lab; ManpowerGroup; Mount Sinai Health System, again, a dual win if you will; Noble Energy; Providence St. Joseph Health; Sumitomo Heavy Industries; Sherwin-Williams; Time, Inc.; Toyota Motor; University of Wisconsin; DeBra Technologies. A lot of wins. And I'm -- I have more, I just don't have time. It was that sort of quarter for us. As it relates to platform, 2 very significant ISVs have gone live in production with us. One, Manhattan Industries. And one of the largest networking ISVs of the world have made significant commitments to production and non-production workloads that are now live on our cloud. We beat AWS head-to-head on price, performance and breadth of services for these wins. There's a little bit of mention of AT&T. I thought I'd give you an update on AT&T. AT&T, of course, is moving thousands of terabytes of data to the Oracle cloud. We have begun to migrate thousands of these databases as we speak. We expect within the fiscal year to have the AT&T data centers all connected to the Oracle cloud, migrating this massive data set. We expect this, of course, to be the first of many that we've started to sign in Q4. I mentioned a couple of the ISVs, but the importance of the progress is to be noted. Just a few numbers to close up. In the apps ecosystem, 91% now of our trailing 12-month revenue is recurring. The apps ecosystem is now bigger than 11 billion. It's up 11% year-over-year. And as I think, a year ago, I mentioned that I expected our apps ecosystem to grow roughly double digits. It did. It did a little better than that. We're growing faster than the market. And while I list all of these wins, most of these wins that I list are not coming from our user base. Our user base, while heavily now represented in our pipeline, Larry had a very important announcement last week, but it is still not the bulk of what is in our cloud, and that opportunity is yet ahead of us. Some numbers on SaaS. Overall ERP and HCM revenue was $2.2 billion for the year. Fusion apps up 62% for the year. Fusion ERP was up 60% organically, 68% for the year. Fusion HCM was up 72% for the year. I want to make sure I say this number carefully. NetSuite bookings in the quarter were up 62% in constant currency. This reflects the investment we've made in go-to-market that we started a year ago. That began to reflect itself in the performance in the back half of the year. This will lead to accelerated NetSuite revenue in 2019. Our tech ecosystem is now greater than $21 billion and up 5% for the year, with the database ecosystem up 6%, and accelerating in Q4 with an exit growth rate of 7%. BYOL is clearly resonating with customers. Q4 database new license revenue was up 9%, and autonomous database is now beginning to show up in our pipeline. And we're pleased with our license revenue for our key database options, which are necessary to run the autonomous database, were up mid-teens in the quarter. Our next-generation PaaS grew 45% for the year with now total revenue of $1.1 billion. I'll close by just saying I think we're executing well on what is a growing pipeline in both apps and autonomous database, a 5% top line growth and 14% EPS growth in FY '18. To Safra's point, looking forward into FY '19, revenue growth is expected to grow -- to go -- is expected to be higher than FY '18, and EPS will grow double digits for the year. Again, with that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Mark. We've just about finished enabling all of our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS cloud services to run alongside each other in our new second-generation bare metal data centers. This consolidation of all 3 categories of cloud services, SaaS, PaaS and IaaS into a single standard data center, allows us to share assets while giving significant -- while giving a significant economies of scale. As a result, we expect continued expansion of our cloud margin. But just as important, to have SaaS, PaaS and IaaS in the same data center makes it easier for our Fusion customers to extend those SaaS applications using our latest PaaS and IaaS technologies and capabilities. As an example, we recently demonstrated how one of our customers used our mobile service, our cloud global service, our cloud voice service and our cloud machine learning service to extend our Fusion HCM system with an Amazon Alexa voice interface for vacation requests and vacation approval. We've developed these new technologies, machine learning, voice and mobile, so we could voice-enable all of our applications. And we're putting those voice systems, a combination of chat bots, voice, all machine learning-driven, we're putting those voice interfaces as the next generation of our UI for Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM. The technologies that we use to add to voice interfaces to Fusion HCM and Fusion ERP are available as PaaS services in our cloud to our customers. So if there's something they want to add to Fusion ERP or HCM, they could do it using the same tools we use to build the applications in the first place. We think that's a big deal. We think having SaaS, PaaS and IaaS all integrated together in the same data center is a key differentiator between Oracle and our cloud competitors, most of whom are focused primarily on SaaS only or primarily on IaaS only. With that, I guess, we'll open it up for questions. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Operator, if you please prepare the audience for Q&A. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Mark, I think it's fair to say everyone's very surprised by 9% database license growth in the quarter. I want to make sure I heard that right, and that overall database ecosystem growth accelerated in Q4, and this is even without autonomous database fully available just yet. So my question, how much of this is just customers purchasing ahead and buying into the strategic road map? Or are there other factors we should consider? Mark Hurd : First of all, you got those numbers right, so I'm glad, because I -- it means I said it right. And we did see acceleration in the quarter. And I think it's all of the above. And again, it's back to the point of we've had good demand sort of across the board. And the other point I tried to make, and I went through the numbers relatively quickly, was the option number. The option number in the quarter was mid-double digits, the necessary options to enable autonomous database. And I think, Brad, that's again a key number, and back to the fact that this represents to us whether that shows up in cloud revenue or license revenue. You see it start to show up in both numbers. For example, we had a really cool win in the quarter that I just ran out of time to mention it, Ford. Ford was literally a BYOL customer or a BYOL transaction in the context of it was a combination of license deal and cloud deal that in the sense of cloud, the way we would have historically reported cloud revenue at the same time. And again, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, you're just, Brad, beginning to see the beginning of autonomous database. While we've been talking about it, we went really GA with autonomous database data warehouse in the beginning of Q4, so it's just beginning to show up in our pipeline. So to all of your points, the numbers in Q4 show numerically the progress. And certainly, what we begin to see now in our pipeline is now the technology is literally rolling out. We're in hundreds and hundreds of trials and proof of concepts, and those are of course the beginning stage of all of this. So that -- we're pretty encouraged, and certainly the fact that it showed up in Q4 numbers is encouraging as well. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Just a quick follow-up for Safra. Safra, it's great to see double-digit EPS growth back on the table for fiscal '19. Can you just remind us what your assumptions are that get you there, particularly on the buyback? Safra Catz : I don't usually give guidance on the buyback, but we view our stock as very inexpensive, and we're -- we view it as something in the range of where we've been lately. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian : My first -- my question is for Larry. Larry, what you're talking about is AT&T is clearly rolling out. But the one thing I want to understand better, I'd like to understand a little bit better customer demand and adoption trends, too. But I'd also like to hear a little bit about how more regular annual database updates versus what I would consider historically to be more large and monolithic upgrades, if that can actually change any software buying patterns of the customer and if that's something you're starting to see or thinking about? Lawrence Ellison : Well, let's see. I think, we used to have a real -- let's say, a few years ago, you could expect a major database release every 2.5 years. Something like that was the cycle. Clearly, we're -- and when a new database release came out, that often spurred a certain degree of buying. Now we're -- we -- keep in mind, we still have a major database release coming out periodically, but it's going to come out in the -- because of the cloud now, it comes out a bit more frequently, and a lot of -- the autonomous features are being added very rapidly. For example, we came out with -- I guess, we went GA, as Mark pointed out, GA and autonomous database at the beginning of Q4. We will have our simple -- autonomous transactional OLTP system, we will call it something -- or a combination of OLTP and data warehouse integrated coming out in the next month or so. And then, a couple of months after that, we're going to have the high-performance, high-reliability OLTP system coming out. So some of the -- the autonomous features are coming out at a more rapid rate than some of the more mature features in the database. Those features that are aimed primarily at the cloud are going to be delivered at a higher rate -- I don't -- I hope that answers your question, than we have historically... Sarah Hindlian : Yes, that does. Yes, that does. I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow : Just a question to the team here. On the Q1 call, you talked about the legacy IaaS business versus the new IaaS business. And then, on the Q3 call, you talked about your legacy SaaS versus the newer SaaS products. And Mark, obviously, you gave some color on the newer ones in your prepared remarks. But hoping you'd just give us a little more detail, sort of just the trends that you're seeing there, call it new versus legacy IaaS and SaaS. And how are you thinking about sort of the criss-cross points there with the newer businesses that are growing quickly, sort of get big enough and keep growing fast enough to sort of offset whatever you're seeing on the legacy front? Safra Catz : Is it for me or for Mark? Philip Winslow : Jump ball. Safra Catz : Well... Mark Hurd : I'm taller, so I'll start. But I think you hit it right, Phil. I mean, listen, just to give you an example, I gave you 2 wins. I named Manhattan and a new ISV that's, I think, I used the term big networking company. That's a brand-new app to the Oracle cloud. Brand-new. Remember, brand-new app to Oracle, let me start with that. App wasn't running on Oracle, we've moved it to Oracle as well as to the Oracle Cloud. So you have a couple of different dynamics here. Yes, there's some legacy stuff and what you would think of as the traditional reporting that we use, but we're in the top of the first inning of all this. To Larry's point, we released autonomous database in April. It's showing up in trials and POCs, not in the numbers even that you're seeing here. We're getting new ISV wins that are just net new to Oracle, in addition to bringing our existing customers to Oracle. So again, we're in the law of small numbers here relative to the entire company that have tremendous upside here. But the key thing for us has been getting our products in the market, the next generation that I mentioned that I gave you a statistic on, the 45% growth rate in our next-gen PaaS infrastructure business and -- for the year. And that's obviously the next gen of it, and that's at the very embryonic stage, Phil, of the beginning of this. So -- and these wins are now just these trials and POCs, the example of the ISVs, they've yet to really just to start to boost revenue because you've got to start with the work and then you start moving to production. In fact, [ they have ] already moved -- just begun to move a couple of their customers to the Oracle Cloud as part of this. So we're at the very early phase of this, and the lines will cross obviously relatively soon here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs & Co. Heather Bellini : I wanted to ask a little bit about BYOL and Oracle Cloud infrastructure. And Mark and Larry, I know you guys touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but can you give us a sense of where we are in the migration to BYOL? And I guess, in particular, can you give us a sense of the momentum within your enterprise accounts using these technology rights in the cloud? And how do you see the slope of this adoption curve as you look ahead? Lawrence Ellison : Well, I think, again, maybe the most interesting fact in the quarter was our very largest deal in terms of the new license purchase was we know the intent of this particular customer, and the intent was to deploy 100% of it in the cloud immediately. So we're seeing -- and I guess we've mentioned AT&T 35x now on the call as an example. But they're an example of a very -- one of our largest customers that really has an intent to move the majority of their Oracle data into the cloud. That's just a gigantic swing, but AT&T's unusual because they're such a large -- had so many large Oracle databases. But many of our other customers, now that we have BYOL, can move their Oracle database license off to on -- from on-premise into our cloud, and they just pay basically for the incremental infrastructure cost, and they continue paying support on what becomes a cloud license. That's a very attractive value proposition for our customers. And we see -- large numbers of our largest customers are very interested in beginning that migration process. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Can I double click on licenses again? The -- you have tough comps because Q4 last year was strong on licenses. So -- and I know last quarter, you kind of talked about some delays on the apps, on the vertical apps side. So can you talk a little bit about like how we got to the number that we have there now between bring your own licenses, but also how to play dumb on the upside? Mark Hurd : Well, without sounding trite, we just sold more. And I think, at the end, it's a combination of what we said. I mean, you're exactly right. Q4 last year was a very good, strong quarter for us. So it was, if you will, a tough comp. But to Safra's opening comments, the quarter was strong for us really across every line. I mean, the only thing that really hurt us in the quarter, to be honest with you, if you look at the income statement, was currency. We went in expecting to get 3 points, we got 2. We wound up being on top of that. And so it was just a solid quarter, and I really don't have any, Raimo, discrete stories to tell you to give you more flavor. I -- obviously, the database ecosystem was strong, and clearly, the options within -- we accelerated database growth in the quarter. Database options within the context of it, particularly those that enable autonomous data warehouse were strong in the quarter. Our apps license did decline, right, in the quarter. We expected that. But frankly, it was actually relatively stable. So one, if you will, because the user base is still the scale that it is, our apps license was declining, but better than I expected within the context of that decline, if that makes sense. And so it just -- obviously, the quality of the brands on the bookings side, which don't show up in actually the income statement, was just, I don't want to say it was unexpected. It was just pleasant to see it all come through. And I just want to double-click on the NetSuite booking. The NetSuite booking, while it is what we hoped, it's so great to see because it's been such a fabulous acquisition for us. The team has done a great job. We've invested. And it showed up numerically in the bookings and that will show up in the revenue as we go forward to '19. So as I go through the quarter, and we haven't mentioned our expense structure, we just -- we've got a lot of leverage there as well, and so just as I look through the line just from an operating perspective, it was a very solid quarter. Maybe more than you wanted in your question, Raimo. Safra Catz : Well, also, Raimo, let me just add, we launched BYOL at the very end of Q2. And this really opened up a lot of EULAs and PULAs for our customers who are very interested in being able to deploy in the cloud and on-premise. It's of particular value to them. And so there are literally billions of dollars involved in these agreements. And many, many customers. It is very widespread and it really showed up in Q4. And it shows up in all the quarters, but of course, after BYOL, it really showed up in Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Safra Catz : Kirk? Ken Bond : Kirk, we can't hear you. Kirk, going once, twice. Operator, next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits : I think it's probably a question for either Mark or for Larry. Can you talk a little bit about how customer demand for database in the cloud is evolving, both for new workloads and for existing workloads, and how the balance is working out by whether or not they're choosing BYOL or Database as a Service? Lawrence Ellison : Well, they're overwhelmingly -- at least against early days, because BYOL has only been around a couple of quarters, it's overwhelmingly BYOL because -- for new workloads and for shifting existing workloads. I mean, Oracle has -- a majority of the world's databases are Oracle databases. We're larger than IBM and Microsoft combined, who are second and third. And we have a lot more to -- and we have much bigger databases than they have and all of that. So there's just a huge inventory of information inside of these databases that needs -- and we have huge customers who would like -- that own licenses for all of this stuff. And they want to move -- not move all of it at once. I mean, AT&T has actually made a commitment to move all of it in a relatively short term. Other customers are moving, but not as rapidly. And they are buying additional options for their existing licenses, so they can move into the cloud and take advantage of autonomous services. So let me explain the situation. So you want to move 10% of your databases from on-premise into the cloud and you want to use the autonomous database. Well, the autonomous database requires that you have the multi-tenant option and the real application cluster option. So you might have database -- you might have some database licenses but might not have licensed those options. So you go ahead and enter into, what, a EULA or PULA, PULA one of these large license agreements. You add these additional options and maybe additional database licenses, and then when you have those additional options, you then -- that makes it possible for you to take advantage of the autonomous database services. Though if you don't want to use the autonomous services, you can still move your database into our cloud, you just don't get the autonomous features. But most people are very excited about the autonomous features because it at once lowers labor costs and secondly, dramatically improves security and reliability because there's no pilot error, there's no opportunity for mischief by taking out the labor. So not only do you save a lot of money by eliminating the labor, again, you have a much more secure and much more reliable system. Again, no pilot error, no mischief. So they're entering these EULAs. They're buying additional options and then they're moving their licenses over. We've been at this for a very, very long time. New workloads, all the new workloads of that -- for any given year is small compared to the 25, 30 years inventory of data that we've accumulated since we've been in this business. So again, overwhelmingly existing databases, not new workloads. Overwhelmingly BYOL as opposed to database services. Now we're getting some new exciting new workloads, don't get me wrong. The new workloads are very important to us. There are lots of cool startups, and we're going after those aggressively, and we're getting a lot of those. I know Mark mentioned earlier that a lot of our customers are not -- a lot of our new customers in the cloud are not existing Oracle customers. So obviously, those are new workloads, and we're getting a lot of those. But you said, where is the majority of it? The majority of it is inside of our installed base. They're using their existing licenses. They're buying additional options. They're moving into the autonomous database in the Oracle Cloud. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies and Company. John DiFucci : And my question, I think, is probably best fit for Safra. So Safra, we understand how the separation of cloud and on-premise sales sort of gets blurred with the flexibility you allow your customers with BYOL. So I think, from a high level, we all understand why you changed the way you report. But how do you get investors comfortable that this also is not obfuscating any cloud weakness? Especially like when I look -- and I know we don't have a long-term deferred revenue, but the deferred revenue looks a little bit -- it was below what we were looking for. I'm just trying to anticipate questions I'm going to be hit with tomorrow. And frankly, looking at your stock, I mean when you put the headline numbers, the stock popped. And I know you may not be looking at it minute by minute, but then when the details came out, it actually dropped. So I think that might be something, one of the reasons anyway. Safra Catz : All right. So let's cover everything. So first of all, there is no hiding. I told you the cloud number, $1.7 billion. You can do the math. You see we are right where we said we'd be, no surprises. Margins up sequentially, shows business is doing well. Cloud billings, strong. Nice and strong. You can hear that. You can hear it from what we're talking about as far as net deferrals. Gross referrals are actually up 5%. So this is just a collection thing with timing, and you'll see that quarter to quarter, especially Q1 from Q4. So this is not -- nothing surprised here. We don't have any bad news. In fact, what we're telling you is, in fact, that the way to understand our business better, especially with so many customers taking licenses and support that -- licenses that are supported, that we were counting and calling on-premise. When in fact, they are not deploying them on-premise, it would be -- it's simply not so. And so we want to explain to you and make sure you understand and have enough understanding of the business to see that our customers are both buying licenses and using licenses they have, which are currently being recorded as on-premise and support. They're using those, in fact, in the cloud. And that's something that's, of course, what they were designed for, frankly, and what we're very excited about. So I think between all the information I've given you, it's quite clear that we had a superb quarter and we're expecting the same next quarter. John DiFucci : That's helpful, Safra. But if you could just remind us when you refer to gross deferrals versus net deferrals, I know that you, Oracle, is probably more conservative than, I think, any company we cover in your reporting of deferred revenue. But if you could hit that quickly, that would be great. Safra Catz : Yes. I mean, from the gross deferrals, what we do is we subtract the uncollected, which is obviously a very big number at the end of Q4. Think about it. So that's all that's going on there. Mark Hurd : John, just Mark. I'd add, there is just no story in the gross short-term deferral story. Safra Catz : Exactly. Mark Hurd : I mean, this is a nothing burger. And I'm telling you that the gross deferrals were right on where we thought. This is, just to -- there's just nothing here. John DiFucci : Okay. That's really helpful. Ken Bond : Thank you, John. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call and we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for closing. Operator : Thank you for joining today's Oracle Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your participation.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to Oracle's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Now I'd like to turn today's call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Ken Bond : Thank you, Victoria. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief of Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.  As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you from placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.  Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll first go over Q1 before moving on to my guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.  Once again, we had another solid quarter. Constant currency revenue growth was slightly above the midpoint of my guidance, and earnings per share was $0.03 above the midpoint of my guidance. As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates because that's how we also look at the business. Total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $6.6 billion, up 4% in constant currency. This accounted for 72% of total company revenue, and the bulk of it is recurring revenues. In terms of ecosystems, GAAP applications total revenues were $2.8 billion, up 7% and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenues were $4.7 billion, up 2%.  Drilling in a little. Total cloud revenues grew in all regions, and in terms of product categories, ERP grew in the 30-plus percent; verticals grew in the 40-plus percent; and public cloud PaaS and IaaS grew in the 20-plus percent. Mark will have much more detail when he speaks.  Total revenues for the quarter were $9.2 billion, up 2% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 3% from last year, and the operating margin was 41%, same as last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.1%, slightly below our base rate of 20%. And our non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 in U.S. dollars and up 19% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 10.8%, and GAAP EPS was $0.57 in U.S. dollars and up 16% in constant currency.  Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was a record $15.5 billion. Over the same 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion [Audio Gap] of which approximately 64% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. We remain committed to creating value for our shareholders through internal investments and targeted acquisitions as well as with stock repurchases and dividends. This quarter, we repurchased 212 million shares for a total of $10 billion.  Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 440 million shares and reduced the absolute shares outstanding by over 8.5% while growing free cash flow 10%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $12 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.  Now before I go to guidance, a quick comment on ASC 606, which we adopted this quarter. The estimated $86 million effect to Q1 of last year, FY '18 revenues, which we had posted on our website last quarter, ended up being $83 million instead of the $86 million so basically about right.  Turning to currency. Exchange rates have moved from a 1% headwind to now being a 2% headwind to revenue and a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind to earnings per share, depending on rounding. Now I'm not sure what it will be by the end of this quarter, so with that, the guidance.  Total revenues are expected to grow from 0 to 2% in constant currency because we have a tough comparison with last year's revenue, especially license. I expect second half revenue growth will be higher. Also, we remain committed to delivering a higher revenue growth rate for all of fiscal year 2019 when compared to that of last fiscal year.  Assuming current exchange rates, non-GAAP EPS for Q2 in USD is expected to grow between 11% to 15% and be between $0.77 and $0.79. And non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 12% to 16% and be between $0.78 and $0.80. Once again, we expect to deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for fiscal year 2019. My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base rate, but I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2019.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Lawrence Ellison : Okay. Thanks, Safra. All right. Oracle has 2 strategic products that will determine our future. Our cloud ERP product is the strategic key to our success in the SaaS applications layer of the cloud. And our autonomous cloud database is the strategic key to our success in the IaaS or infrastructure layer of the cloud.  Oracle is already #1 in ERP cloud market share with over 20,000 Fusion and NetSuite customers. Customers are buying Fusion ERP to replace their existing SAP on-premise ERP systems, and customers are buying Fusion ERP to replace their existing Workday cloud ERP systems. ERP is the largest segment in the application business. Continuing our rapid growth in the cloud ERP market puts Oracle well on its way to becoming the world's largest SaaS applications company. That's our strategy and current market position in the SaaS layer of the cloud.  In the IaaS or infrastructure layer of the cloud, we have the world's most popular and technically most advanced database, the Oracle Autonomous Database. The Oracle Database is so much better than other databases. Even our biggest competitors use it to run their businesses. Salesforce.com uses Oracle to run their sales automation cloud. SAP uses the Oracle Database to run their cloud services and nearly all their on-premise customers. Even Amazon uses the Oracle Database to run most of their business. Now that the Oracle Autonomous Database is running in our second-generation bare metal cloud infrastructure, customers can both lower their labor costs and cut their Amazon bill in half by running the Oracle Database on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. The Oracle Autonomous Database automatically patches itself while running to prevent data theft. No other database can do that. We think these are compelling advantages, with the Amazon infrastructure business. We think these compelling advantages will allow us to compete very effectively against Amazon in the infrastructure business. Today, we may be behind Amazon in infrastructure market share, but we are way ahead of Amazon in cloud infrastructure technology. We think that will allow us to gain market share in infrastructure in the cloud very, very rapidly.  I'll turn it -- with that, I'll turn it over to Mark Hurd. Mark Hurd : Thanks, Larry. I'll give you a few numbers and then a few wins in the quarter. First, our apps ecosystem. 91% of our trailing 12-months revenue is now recurring in apps ecosystem with GAAP apps ecosystem now greater than $11 billion in trailing 12-months revenue, up 7% in the quarter. We're growing faster than market with, as Larry mentioned, an enormous opportunity ahead of us. Nearly 2/3 of applications support revenue for Oracle is ERP or HCM, with most on-premise customers at a very early stage of moving those back-office apps to the cloud. I do expect our apps ecosystem to grow roughly double digits for this year. In SaaS, Safra mentioned a few numbers. Let me give you a few more. Overall ERP and HCM now annualized revenue is greater than $2.5 billion. Fusion ERP was up 40% in revenue organically. NetSuite ERP had a spectacular quarter. Revenue is -- I think we've mentioned through previous calls the momentum we've been seeing in NetSuite. We were up 26% in revenue, and bookings were almost up 40%, 39% in the quarter. That follows on a bookings growth that was greater than, call it, roughly 70% for NetSuite in Q4.  Our verticals were up 41%, and annualized revenue is now $800 million. Our tech ecosystem in GAAP is now greater than $21 billion on a trailing 12 months basis and Q1 was up 2%. Bring your own license continues to perform well as both Q1 database new license and support revenue were up mid-single digits.  Now I'm going to shift to talking about a few customer wins in the quarter. I'm going to try to keep it to a few. But I want to give you a flavor for some of the wins that we've -- on top of what we did in Q4, what we did in Q1. We'll talk first about ERP and what we did in that category. First, Academy Sports, a nice win for us in North America; Airbnb, they bought ERP, and Larry mentioned, this is actually a replacement of Workday Financials at Airbnb. TOMS, they're a retailer, very nice win for us. They also bought not just ERP but bought HCM as well as a package back-office deal in the quarter. Legg Mason, many of you may know, is an investment adviser. Legg Mason bought ERP in the quarter. That also was a replacement of Workday Financials.  I'll talk a little bit about a company called Federal Express. FedEx is, in the FedEx side of the house, a traditional Oracle user. They bought a company called TNT in Europe that was an SAP user, and they are now going to standardize all of their ERP on Oracle Fusion ERP. In addition to that, they bought payroll from us in the quarter. They happen to be a Workday HCM customer but bought payroll from Oracle. This is one of the more significant transactions we've had of course of a -- over a course of a number of significant transactions but a very strategic and significant one with the replacement of SAP as a combination of a migration of an existing Oracle customer.  A few other customers : city of Sunnyvale; Equity Bank in Europe; the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation bought ERP. And I'm still on ERP, just to be clear. Highmark Health; Noble Corporation, obviously a big oil and gas driller, $4 billion, $5 billion company, nice win for us in the quarter; Santander, consumer part of their business is going to Oracle ERP; Saudi Telecom, another combination ERP, HCM customer in the quarter; the state of Nebraska; TIAA, another investment firm, again, another ERP win in the quarter. Talk a little bit about HCM. VITAS Hospice Healthcare bought also a bit of ERP in the quarter, a relatively large HCM transaction for us in the quarter; Canon, that many of you will also know; Allnex, manufacturing company in Europe; Fortive, a significant customer, HCM win; the government of Saskatchewan. Marriott, one of the biggest HCM transactions that we've ever taken down, we took down in the quarter as well.  I thought I'd mention, at the same time, another back-office category that's becoming more significant for us, which is Supply Chain Management. Our SCM product has been out now a while. The number of customers now, again, significant. Prospect Medical healthcare company; Rotary International; Academy Sports again, as you can see, a portfolio deal for us in ERP in the quarter; Beckman Coulter, a $6 billion company going to Oracle Supply Chain Management in the cloud; city of Sunnyvale, which I mentioned earlier; Noble Energy, which you saw me mention earlier; Zebra Technologies, which I mentioned earlier. So again, significant amount, as you can tell in the back office. Once you win ERP Financials, the opportunity to then get HCM and supply chain management is significant.  I thought I'd close by just mentioning a few infrastructure wins in the quarter, and these are both infrastructure and PaaS wins : AIG, Emerson Electric, Hermes Parcelnet, Nuance Communications, Network Rail, Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company, Swiss Re, Toronto Dominion, Standard Industries. And I thought I'd also mentioned a couple of ISVs. I traditionally don't talk about ISVs as much, but in the quarter, pretty significant ISVs : FICO, Seiko and HighJump. HighJump's the leading provider of supply chain software management and warehouse advantage, in some of the -- they'll be using our platform and our cloud to deliver their applications into the market. Seiko is an e-commerce payment platform. FICO is a leading analytics software company in the sort of personalization space. All will be using the Oracle PaaS platform as the base by which they bring their software to market.  With that, I'll close by just saying, listen, our pipeline, as you can tell by these -- I hope you can tell by these wins, our SaaS pipeline is at a record level and to Larry's point, led by both ERP. And that's not just Fusion now but the NetSuite improvement is material and significant. Our pipeline in PaaS is also at the highest level it's been. And it was, overall, a solid quarter for us. Looking forward to Safra's point earlier, we do expect revenue growth in the second half to be higher than last year and EPS will grow double digits for the year. With that, I'll give it back to Ken, and then we'll take your questions. Ken Bond : Thanks, Mark. Victoria, if you would please instruct audience on the questions, we'll go ahead and get started with the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. S. Kirk Materne : I just have a question for Mark regarding the applications business. Obviously, you spent a lot of time outlining some of the wins this quarter. Can you just unpack maybe a little bit more of your confidence in terms of the business heading into the rest of the year? I'm just kind of curious how much of that comes from maybe some of your existing customers finally moving onto the cloud in terms of the ERP and maybe HCM areas and just your confidence that the improvement in NetSuite you saw this quarter is sustainable as we go forward from here. Mark Hurd : Thanks, Kirk. I just don't know what words I can use to get -- to show more confidence in the apps business than what I've done. I think the NetSuite performance is sort of, Kirk, the way I'd describe it, it's sort of the best of NetSuite and the best of Oracle combined. We've had significant -- I think the management team in NetSuite has done a great job. Our attrition is down. We've also been able to supplement the NetSuite sales organization with our traditional recruiting, our traditional college hires. And frankly, they've done a fantastic job incubating them, absorbing them and getting them productive. They probably wouldn't have done this as a public company because of short-term quarterly earnings per share requirements. We invested in them. I think I've mentioned that before, both in R&D and in sales. And to be very blunt with you, it's paid off. In Q4, bookings numbers were spectacular. That translated to Q1 revenue growth. Their Q1 bookings were a little bit ahead of the plan that I had for them. And so again, when you have this sort of bookings growth back to back, we can pretty much predict, not perfectly but pretty close to what the annual revenue is going to be, and I expect that, as I said I think in the Q4 call, they will accelerate their revenue growth from last year to this year, and it's going to be relatively material, call it, 7, 8, 9, 10 points of growth rate. I'm talking about now growth comparisons year-over-year. In the traditional Oracle business, in the Fusion business, I don't know what more I can do than read you this list of customers. I mean, this is just a broad set of customers across regions. And now that we're bringing on both supply chain, as I've tried to mention and outline a few supply chain wins, supplemented by now the maturation in our manufacturing -- the great news about this business is most of the people we compete with aren't in a great position to bring their customers to the cloud. If you will -- I'm saying now, Kirk, the traditional ERP on-premise vendors. So our HCM business, I talked about. So my confidence level on the apps ecosystem is pretty high. 91% of our revenue, as I mentioned, is recurring. So our ability to predict our pipeline, our conversion rates are quite high. The morale of our team -- listen, let me lay -- end it this way. Our team here at Oracle believes their destiny is to win every deal. That's how they believe -- they believe that we're in a position, from a technology perspective, to be in a position to win virtually every deal, and that's the attitude we go into with this. It's a long answer to tell you, confidence on my side is really high. It shows up in our pipeline and our results. Operator : Our next question comes from Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian : Mark, Kirk asked about the apps ecosystem, and you're clearly bullish on that. But can you talk to us a little bit about some of the bookings trends you're seeing in the overall tech ecosystem? And then as a follow-up, Mark, I'd really appreciate it if you could let me know what's going on with Thomas Kurian and provide us with some sort of an update. That would be greatly appreciated. Mark Hurd : I got the second question. I think the first question was bookings trends? Sarah Hindlian : It's really around cloud bookings. Mark Hurd : Okay. All right. I got it. First, I'd say -- let me try to give you as much clarity as I can. In our next-gen PaaS infrastructure business, we're talking about mid-20s sort of growth rate in bookings. Early days, to sort of Larry's point, but very encouraging in terms of these sort of short-term results we have. When you start seeing, as early indicators, ISVs move, and that's one of the reasons I outlined the ISVs, this is really good news because ISVs are some of the most discriminating -- it's sort of like our GBUs. They're probably the biggest ISV I know of. And their excitement to move to, what Larry's describing as our Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, is how fast can we get that done. And now when you see other ISVs lining up, these are very strong indicators to us of our future as it relates to OCI. And nobody can do what we can do with the Oracle Database on OCI that Larry already mentioned -- already mentioned that. I think I've talked about the SaaS bookings growth. Our bookings overall in cloud for the quarter accelerated on a rate basis. The growth rate accelerated. So that was, obviously, a good indication for us of overall bookings growth. Again, I'm trying to focus you more on the revenue long run, is I think the best indicator of where we are. Bookings to us was a good description before we had revenue. And so what I'm trying to do now is keep you focused on really what the prize is because if the bookings don't translate to revenue, they don't mean anything to us. So we're trying to get very focused on revenue. That has a couple of other aspects to us, which is also our renewal rates, making sure -- our renewal rates, we believe, are continuing to improve if you start looking at our renewal rates as they go forward. So the combination of bookings and renewals going up gives us a better revenue outlook. On Thomas Kurian, which I think was your question, Thomas is a good guy, works awful hard. He's taking a break, and we expect him back. Sarah Hindlian : That's very helpful. Is there a time line on when he'll be back? Or is it just some kind of over the next few months, something along those lines? Mark Hurd : Well, I'll stick to what I said. He's taking a break. We expect him to... Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : I've got one for Larry and a quick follow-up for Safra. Larry, with the introduction of autonomous database, you've committed to a more accelerated innovation cycle. And you now have the next major database version 19c just around the corner? How do you envision the newer cadence impacting customer adoption patterns and ultimately, the purchasing cycle? Lawrence Ellison : Well, I think people are moving to the cloud infrastructure. Again, it's very early days. So there are 2 things that are going on. We're delivering our technology in the cloud prior to making it available on-premise, it just allows us to -- it's just easier to get our cloud product out and make it available to a large number of customers for their -- for development of new applications, for the lift and shift of existing applications. So a lot of our customers are now experimenting with a data warehouse here. And there's now an OLTP system that's available for -- with the autonomous database, and they're in the process now of trying it in the cloud. And we've gotten a lot of people that were very, very surprised. We had very positive feedback. I think the strangest one for me was someone who was running exadata on-premise, which is our -- which is, theoretically, the fastest system on which you could run the Oracle Database. They moved it to the Oracle Autonomous Database Cloud, which by the way, also runs on exadata in the cloud, and they got a 5x performance increase. And it's simply that the machine learning tuning for the autonomous database is just better than human beings, and they were shocked. And so now they're moving additional workloads to the Oracle Cloud. I think the fact that we can upgrade these things faster will actually increase the adoption rate. Albeit now, we got to confess, these are pretty early days. Our -- we have tens of thousands of database customers. A lot -- an awful lot of them are now moving their first workload and experimenting with their first workloads in the cloud. Once they get through that process, I think we'll have a very, very rapid migration of workloads from on-premise into the Oracle Cloud. Mark Hurd : Just to add numbers to Larry's point, I mean, if you looked at the quarter, I said we had mid-single digits growth in database, license and database support. The real driver of that was the options that come along with autonomous database. So multi-tenant Active Data Guard and RAC were really the leading drivers of that growth. Lawrence Ellison : Yes. I'd like to just follow up on what Mark said. People are bringing their own database license to the cloud. So what we're seeing is they want to use autonomous database in the cloud. Autonomous database requires the multi-tenancy option, and it requires real application clustering option. And they're trying it. They try it. They're getting great performance. They're getting terrific availability. They go back and then do a license deal where they acquire the pieces that are missing, of multi-tenancy and Real Application Clusters, and then they lift their entire license from on-premise and move it to the cloud. And we think that's going to be the vast majority of our cloud -- our database cloud customers are going to be taking their existing on-premise license, augmenting it with certain new features required for autonomous database and then buying the infrastructure piece in the cloud while bringing their own license. Brad Zelnick : Just quickly for Safra. We continue to see you express a strong opinion on the value of your stock, buying back $10 billion worth of shares this quarter and the additional authorization as well. How should we think about the rate and pace of buybacks versus other uses of cash going forward? Safra Catz : We think our stock is an unbelievable buy, so we are buying it back. And I'm not going to tell you exactly how much, but you can see I've got $20 billion in authorization, which I'll use up when I use it. But at these prices with our growing cash flows, with our earnings growing like they are, it seems like an amazing deal to buy our stocks, so we're putting our money where our mouth is, frankly. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies & Company. John DiFucci : My question's for Safra. Safra, cash flow grew last year for the first time in several years. So I guess, 2 questions on cash flow. One, this quarter, operating cash flow was up modestly and free cash flow was flat. Was there anything affecting cash flow this quarter relative to a year ago? And then two -- I'll let -- yes, answer that first. Safra Catz : Yes, so let's do this one at a time. So by the way, operating cash flow was a record, okay, both latest 12 months and in the quarter. A couple of things that move around that I don't know, you wouldn't necessarily have visibility into, which is how much of a tax deduction we get when our employees exercise their options. And compared to last year, there was a $300 million-plus difference, so less of that. In addition, with lower tax rates, you -- the value of that is lower. So I suspect that you're going to see operating cash flows and cash flows in general continue to increase because our business is growing now. And at any one time, you may see some seasonality within the working capital line but -- when we do, for example, a tax payment or something like that. But other than that, you should see an overall line going in an upward direction. John DiFucci : That's my second question. So you answered it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : I had a question, Safra, for you given Mark had great comments to say about the cloud business. But I'm wondering, is it safe to assume that the software support revenue is continuing to grow? And then my follow-up question is also if you could share any color on trends that you've seen in short-term deferred revenue in the quarter. Safra Catz : Okay. So yes, you should assume that support is growing. Our base continues to grow. And as far as short-term deferred revenue was, let's see, about $10.35 billion, and the reality is that gross deferred was up about 4%. We netted down quite a bit in the quarter for uncollected invoices. So invoices that had been sent out mostly for Q4 bookings and things like that, which are as yet uncollected, we net down. Other folks don't net down. And so that's our short-term deferred revenue, going great. Mark Hurd : One thing on support, Heather, though, just to -- I know you know this but just to be clear, there's multiple things going on inside support. Database support is growing. So it's growing rather nicely, and our renewal rates are inclining slightly. So as you know they're very high. But this quarter, we actually had a slight incline as we did in apps. But apps support revenue is declining and will continue to decline if we do our job because our job is to move them to the cloud, to move them to SaaS. And so when you ask that question, I don't want to give the wrong impression. We're -- if somebody who was looking for every line of support to grow, we're actually working against that. Heather Bellini : No, no, I just meant the net of it, like the database support you said is growing rather nicely. Apps is declining but the net of it is that total... Mark Hurd : That statement's true. I just want to make sure you know that we're seeing an incline, meaning that if you looked actually at our renewal rates, and I'd like you to know this, that our -- as a percent of what we get canceled, more of that cancellation than ever is moving to our cloud. So actually our net cancellation rate is actually declining in apps as well, but the driver of that is the movement to our cloud. So great you know that. I just wanted to make sure we didn't leave you with the wrong... Heather Bellini : But then just to be clear, Mark, did you say that database support attach rate is increasing? Safra Catz : Attach rate's 100%. It's just about renewals in database. Database installed base continues to grow. Mark Hurd : [ Revenue growth ]. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Got a question for you. Cloud services and license support was slightly less than what The Street had expected. Can you drill in, help us better understand, if you had weakness, where that weakness was? Was it maintenance? Was it PaaS? Was it IaaS? Was it SaaS? How should we think about that? I'd appreciate. Safra Catz : Well, I think most of -- any kind of what miss from the numbers you have was that, in fact, there was really just some currency difference between when I gave my guidance and when -- and what it ended up being. So it was basically double the negative that I was expecting in the quarter. Mark Hurd : I would say -- so to be very blunt with you, I would say relative to Safra's point, when she gave the guidance, when we sat in the room, relative to that number on that line that you're talking about, Oracle's performance in Q1 beat that number. Now the implication of currency during the quarter moved on us from the time we mentioned it to the time we reported. So I don't -- again, back to -- I don't know what's in everybody's model, but relative to our view, we did better in that line than we did based on our forecast at the beginning of the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow : Mark, you highlighted mid-single-digit growth in database license and support. Just a competitive question for both you and Larry here. What are you seeing just in the competitive environment, in database in particular, because we obviously get questions about NoSQL players and what ACID compliance means there with some of them achieving that. And then you have cloud vendors as well such as Amazon with them announcing bringing RDS on-premise. So just competitive environment there, that would be great. Lawrence Ellison : Again, we think we have a very, very large lead in technology. Now there's other -- there might be a reason why you decide to use a database that's not as good. If you're committed to the Amazon Cloud and you're getting a lot of stuff at the Amazon Cloud and Amazon sells Redshift or -- Amazon sells a number of different databases, right? Aurora is actually the MySQL database that we're responsible for. So people don't -- people say, okay, I'm going to use whatever Amazon has on the cloud and there are -- a number of people do that. And that happened to us in the previous generation when a lot of people chose to use Microsoft database because at the time -- it was the easily available with Windows. So we do see that. We weren't -- we're not the only database around. However, in terms of technology, if you want the highest performance, if you want the highest reliability, if you want the highest security and if you want the lowest cost, whether that performance translates into cost, the reason we're much -- the Oracle Database is much cheaper than the Amazon database is because Amazon charges per minute. We charge per minute. If we can do more in 1 minute -- twice as much in 1 minute than they can, we're half the price. So we think while people will go to the Amazon Cloud and buy whatever is there as part of the Amazon infrastructure, anyone who's actually shopping for the best database in terms of reliability, in terms of ease of use, in terms of lowest cost, they're all going to pick Oracle. Mark Hurd : Yes. Phil, numerically, just to end it. If you're growing mid-single digits, you have half the market and the market's growing 3, I don't know, we must have gained 1 point of share. So it's just all the points we talk about, I mean, we just -- all these different names you mentioned, and Larry talked about the technical part, numerically, it's just hard to dispute the evidence that, over the past year, 2 years rolling in quarters, we've just gained share. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits : Michael Turits. Mark, question for you on the vertical markets. How are they doing? And how are we doing in terms of moving those vertical applications to cloud? And how do you expect that to impact the cloud growth rate? Mark Hurd : Well, I think the vertical businesses are continuing to make -- I made a comment in my script about their growth in SaaS being in excess of 40% for the quarter, so that's a good number. They've also now to the point where their SaaS business is bigger than their license business. So in terms of the pivot from an applications perspective, they've done, I think, a good job. Their license business, within that license business, there's another opportunity for us to do more of hosting, if you will, some of that business on our OCI cloud. Again, I mentioned earlier, they're about the biggest ISV in the world from an applications perspective, and they are perhaps the absolute best ISV test case you could ever have for the applications running in OCI. And they are beginning that move to OCI or, if you will, our next-generation cloud infrastructure. And it's going quite well. So if there's a combination of the SaaS growth, which is now 40%, as I described, and then the movement of some of those applications to our OCI, if you will, a -- sort of a hosting part of the business, both going well. So our verticals are growing. Their license business, by the way, still allows us to grow support for our vertical businesses, so overall, quite healthy. I hope that helps.

Ken Bond : Thank you, Victoria. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect those forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and any other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll first go over Q2 before moving on to guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Mark and then Larry, for their comments. Let me start by summarizing that Q2 was another solid quarter. Constant currency revenue growth was slightly above the high end of my guidance and constant currency earnings per share was $0.02 above the high end of my guidance. As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rate unless I state otherwise. Total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $6.6 billion, up 5% in constant currency. This accounted for nearly 70% of the total company revenues and most of it is recurring revenues. GAAP applications' total revenues were $2.8 billion, up 7%; and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenues were $5 billion, up 1%. Mark will go over more detailed revenue and bookings numbers in a moment. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 86%, essentially the same as last year with continuing improvement in SaaS gross margins, stability in software support gross margin and continued investment in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. As we continue to scale and grow our cloud business, I expect our gross margins will ultimately go higher. Total revenues for the quarter were $9.6 billion, up 2% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.1 billion, unchanged from last year, and the operating margin was 43%, the same as last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.6%, slightly below our base rate of 20% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.80 in U.S. dollars and up 19% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was $15.9 billion -- 15.9%, and GAAP EPS was $0.61 in U.S. dollars, up 22% in constant currency. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $15.2 billion. Q2 operating cash flow was, in fact, negatively impacted by our first installment payment over $600 million on the onetime transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $13.8 billion, up 10% in U.S. dollars. We now have more than $49 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.2 billion and that's up 6% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligations or what we'll refer to as contract backlog will be in the 10-Q and is now $30.1 billion, of which approximately 62% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. We remain committed to returning value to shareholders through acquisitions, internal investments and a return of capital with stock repurchases and dividends. This quarter, we repurchased 203 million shares for a total of $10 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 602 million shares and reduced the absolute shares outstanding by over 12%. The Board of Directors, again, declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share. Turning to currency. I expect the strengthening U.S. dollar will increase the currency headwind to 4% for Q3 and a $0.03 headwind to earnings per share. So for Q3, my guidance is, total revenues are expected to grow 2% to 4% in constant currency. I continue to expect the revenue growth will be higher, and we remain committed to delivering a higher constant currency growth rate for all of fiscal 2019 when compared to last fiscal year. You may remember that last year's Q3 EPS included some onetime events, which I called out at the time, which helped by about $0.03 last year. In addition, my EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 20%, which is nearly 4 points higher than last year because last year's tax rate was a catch-up quarter for the new tax law. Certainly, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for Q3 to vary from the base rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2019. Okay. With all that, for this quarter, non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 7% to 9% and be between $0.86 and $0.88; and non-GAAP EPS for Q3 in USD, in U.S. dollars, is expected to grow between 3% to 5% and be between $0.83 and $0.85. And while my double-digit constant currency EPS growth guidance for fiscal year '19 has not been a specific number, I can tell you that internally I have, in fact, raised my fiscal year '19 constant currency EPS growth rate estimates. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments. Mark Hurd : Thank you, Safra. Solid quarter for us from top to bottom. Total revenue was up 2% in constant currency with cloud services and license support up 5%, and of course, EPS up 19%. It's the seventh consecutive quarters we've had reported double-digit EPS growth. Apps had a spectacular quarter. We had great momentum, growing 7% for the overall ecosystem, over $11 billion in trailing 12 months and 91% of that is now recurring revenue. We continue to grow revenue faster than the market, and we have an enormous opportunity ahead of us, particularly in ERP as well as HCM. To Safra's point about the numbers, let me give you some numbers about our SaaS business. Overall ERP and HCM now have annualized SaaS revenue of $2.6 billion, up mid-20s percent. Fusion apps revenue growth was 34%. Fusion ERP revenue growth was 44%, all organically. NetSuite ERP revenue grew 25%. Vertical revenue and applications grew 35%; annualized revenue now of $800 million. In terms of SaaS bookings, I want to try and give you some context. Now, of course, as I talk about bookings this did not show up in any way, shape or form in our revenue. ERP and HCM's booking growth rate has accelerated the last 4 quarters and now is in the high 30s. In addition, we saw our largest movement of the installed base customers to ERP cloud with almost roughly 200 customers moving in the quarter. All of that, of course, shows up in bookings and not revenue. In addition, SaaS net bookings -- let me try to say this carefully, SaaS net bookings, which factor in our nonrenewals, were the highest ever in the company's history for a non-Q4, and up in the high 30s percent. Our tech ecosystem GAAP -- tech ecosystem was $21 billion on a trailing 12-month basis and Q2 was a 1% growth with database new license support revenues up low single digits. Larry's going to talk quite a bit more about Autonomous Database. We are seeing more than 1,000 trial activations per month currently between data warehouse in transactional basis and this number continues to ramp. Now we also had our Cloud at Customer solution, which has been one of our exciting offerings, revenue up triple digits, booking up in the low 40 percentage. Now I'm going to mention a few customer names that I thought I'd explain some of the wins in the quarter that are behind some of the apps numbers I described. In general, I'm going to talk about some back office wins and a few full suite wins. One win was at MGM. This is MGM Resorts, the hospitality company. ERP, or really our full suite including supply chain, that actually replaced a product called Infinium, which is part of a blizzard of brands inside N4. We had a very large win at a large distribution company whose name I can't mention, but it was a complete suite win. ERP, HCM -- by the way, this is a theme I'm going to tell you about, how when we win ERP, it is now increasingly that we connect HCM to that win. People want the same UI, user interface, the same workflow, et cetera, and so ERP has a tremendous effect on pulling HCM through. Another exciting win we had was at Johnson Controls. Johnson Controls was, again, a suite win where we sold them service cloud -- both our service cloud and our field service solution, and really to one of their divisions, also, ERP in their Tyco division, very exciting win for us. Hormel, food processor, great win for us. ERP -- our full suite of ERP, inclusive of HCM, very exciting. A company called Securitas. You probably may see them performing security in many major facilities around the country, but again, a full suite win there. Helzberg Diamonds. Again, a full suite win there as well. Indiana University Health Center. This is, again, another -- this actually was a Lawson, if you've heard of the Lawson product, we replaced there with ERP, EPM, really our full suite in addition to -- into HCM. So I won't go through all the color with all these, but let me just read off some more names for you, just so you get some context for it. Littlewoods, a retailer; Samsonite; VeriFone; Department of the Environment in Australia, Land and Water, really significant win for us there; the European operation of Toyota, very significant win for us in ERP; Marvell Semiconductor. I'm going to run out of minutes here. Dana Corporation, very nice win for us; DHL in Italy; Gilead Sciences; Ithaca College. And I'm going to stop. I know because it just keeps going, but this was a, as I've told you, the biggest net bookings we've had in our history non-Q4 and the stuff I -- that's by the way, a booking statement and they're supported by these quality wins. So last thing I wanted to do was, before I close, is just talk to you about a survey that came out from IDC. And I've talked to IDC about it and I have to read this literally. So I have to read it to you in its entirety to make sure that I get the message that they want across. So I'm going to do it and let me start with open quotes, this is from IDC, \"In the SaaS view survey, IDC released in October of 2018, where it surveyed 276 HCM SaaS customers on their experience with SaaS HCM vendors, including Oracle, Workday and SAP SuccessFactors. Oracle SaaS HCM is the highest rated among the 3 vendors in most scoring categories, including vendor satisfaction, likelihood to recommend vendor to a colleague, data security, trusted brand, lower TCO, value for the price paid, ease of use, superior features functionality, ease of implementation, customer support service, product innovation and geographical reach.\" The reason I wanted to read that to you is instead of that coming from me and my opinion, this comes from an independent analyst community and I wanted to make sure I share that with you. Let me just close to say, it was a solid quarter again with 19% EPS growth and 10% free cash flow growth. The strength of our bookings growth along with climbing renewal rates, gives me confidence that our cloud apps business is only, only going to strengthen from here. If I'm not being clear, this is perhaps the best apps quarter we've had just in terms of bookings -- breadth of bookings across the portfolio and the visibility that gives us into the revenue backlog. Looking forward, we still expect full year revenue growth will be higher than last year and EPS will grow double digits for the year. And with that, I'm going to turn it over for Larry for his comments. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Mark. Oracle has 2 strategic products that will determine the future of our company : Cloud ERP and the Autonomous Database. Virtually every technology analyst organization agrees, Gartner, Forrester, IDC and the rest. Please read the published reports that Oracle has developed the world's most advanced ERP technology. Featuring an easy-to-use voice interface and machine learning based artificial intelligence to automate many formerly manual ERP processes. But more than being simply the technology leader in ERP applications, the analysts also confirm that Oracle has translated that technology leadership into market leadership in cloud ERP with nearly 6,000 Fusion ERP customers plus more than 16,000 NetSuite customers and we are adding about 1,000 new cloud ERP customers every quarter. Technology analysts also agree that Oracle's new Autonomous Database gives Oracle the largest technology lead we have ever enjoyed over our database competitors since we entered the database market almost 4 decades ago. As we pair our new Autonomous Database with our new Generation 2 Cloud infrastructure, we expect not only to hold onto our 50% database market share, we expect to increase it. That means millions of Oracle databases will move to the Oracle Cloud. Those are the 2 strategic initiatives that we are focused on. One, continue to expand our market leadership in cloud ERP, which should make us the world's largest cloud application company. And two, maintain our database technology leadership and migrate our 50% database market share through the Oracle Cloud. We're optimistic about our ability to deliver on these 2 strategic initiatives and our ability to be the leader in these 2 key market segments. With that, I'll turn it back over to Safra. Safra Catz : Okay. So I think we're ready for questions. Ken Bond : We're now ready for Q&A, Victoria. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : SaaS ERP is the largest growth driver within SaaS and we believe within your total apps business, but there are so many moving parts that it's not obvious in the reported results. Can you give us a sense of when you expect that SaaS ERP will be large enough and growing fast enough to start to visibly improve year-over-year revenue growth first in SaaS and then in overall apps? And then as a quick follow-up, can you give us any color on the timing of conversions from book to revenue, has it improved or not? Mark Hurd : The answer to both questions is no. No, no, so -- first, I'm kidding. I'm kidding, Mark. So it's holiday season. I thought it's time for some festive commentary. First, I think -- first of all, it is happening. So when you look at first and breaking these into pieces, the NetSuite performance has been spectacular, it's just one piece of it. When we bought the NetSuite, NetSuite was growing 15-ish sort of percent. And I sort of said this as color on our call, their bookings starting -- if you went into Q3 of last year, Q4 was spectacular, Q1 was strong again. They had another very strong bookings quarter again in Q2 and their revenue growth is now gone up to 25-ish percent in the quarter. So that is, obviously, significant for us in terms of their scale and now their growth rate. I really have -- I don't want to say higher expectations, but I continue to have high expectations that they'll continue that momentum that we've seen, meaning increased growth rates. The Fusion growth rate in ERP is even higher than NetSuite's. And I hope by the quality of the wins I described to you, you'd get a flavor for the popularity of that solution now in the marketplace. So when you combine the 2 together, our target is that we could see hundreds, if not -- and I just want to be careful, wavy line here, Mark, we can get into close to $1 billion worth of growth next year out of those 2 solutions. I'm not giving you that's the number. I'm telling you it's that sort of opportunity for us in scale. But to add to it, the thing that I tried to make sure was clear on the wins we're describing is, the pull when we sell ERP, the ability for us to pull other solutions with it is doing nothing but growing particularly as [ a right stage. ] Does that answer your question? Mark Moerdler : Helps to point me in the right direction. Ken Bond : Okay. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Larry, I think we all appreciate how sticky Oracle database is given it stores some of the most valuable information in the world, but the competitive noise in the market just keeps getting louder and louder. What's your latest thinking on the competitive dynamics for database? Lawrence Ellison : Okay. Well, there is the wonderful Gartner report that ranks the technology -- the Oracle database technology, Oracle is ranked with a huge #1 lead by Gartner. A distant second is Microsoft. A distant third is IBM, and a ridiculously distant fourth is Amazon, who's making all the noise. We think we -- we have a huge technology leadership in database over Amazon. What Amazon did is they got their databases, and by the way, Amazon Aurora is just my SQL, open source. And Amazon Redshift is also just a borrowed open source system. These are very old systems that Amazon took open source databases and gave them an Amazon name and put them on the Amazon Cloud. Now the beauty of what Amazon did is they put them in Amazon Cloud and they made them available on the cloud. They did that long before we made the Oracle database available on the cloud. But in terms of technology, there is no way that someone can move -- a normal person would move from an Oracle database to an Amazon database. It's just incredibly expensive and complicated. And you got to be willing to give up tons of reliability, tons of security, tons of performance to go ahead and do it. But we have a huge technology advantage. Again, don't believe me, read the Gartner report. We've never had -- the Oracle Autonomous Database has the biggest technology lead we've ever had in the database world from a technology standpoint. The problem is, we have to deliver that Autonomous Database on first-class cloud infrastructure to be successful in the cloud business. We need more than just a great database. We have the best database, but we also need first-class infrastructure to run that database on. And we now finally, have that with our Generation 2 Cloud. And I think you'll see the combination of the Oracle Autonomous Database and the Generation 2 Cloud. You'll see rapid migration of Oracle from on-premise to the Oracle Public Cloud and to the Oracle Cloud at Customer. So we think we're -- as I said in my opening remarks, we think we're not only going to hold onto our 50% share, we're going to expand it. Nobody, save maybe -- Jeff Bezos gave the command, \"I want to get off the Oracle database,\" and they've been working on this for a few years to try to get off the Oracle database and get onto the Amazon databases. It's taken Amazon, who's dedicated to doing this several years and they're not there yet. Why? Nobody else is going to go through that forced march to go on to the Amazon database, if amazon can't even get there without this kind of effort. We're confident we hold on to our... Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. John DiFucci : Listen, my question is sort of a follow-up to Brad's. And Larry, and I think it's more for Mark and maybe Larry, too. We understand your focus on moving your 50% relational database market share to the Oracle Cloud, but that's going to take time for your customers to get there. And until then, they're likely considered by for on-premise deployments. This quarter, platform and infrastructure grew 1% constant currency. Realize there's headwinds in there from, like, the middleware business and probably some other things, but more interested in the database, as you say Larry, that's one of the strategic products that has to be successful here. Can you give us some more color on the database in this quarter especially for the options? And the 2 that standout for me are multi-tenancy and then memory, but I know there's others that are associated with the Autonomous Database. I mean, these are 2, but others that are really specifically there. And I guess, when will we see those tailwinds from whatever middleware and whatever else is causing them to subside in that part of the business? Mark Hurd : Larry will start and then I can follow-up with some numbers for you, John. Lawrence Ellison : Okay. The autonomous -- the database options grew about 4% in the quarter. And we've never had a quarter that I know of where the database business has not grown -- the database license business has not grown. The issue has been, when will we get our cloud infrastructure solid enough to host our database and the answer is, we did that several months ago -- less than a year ago. Less than a year ago, we got the infrastructure in shape, OCI, the Generation 2 of our infrastructure is now there. We're now running thousands of Oracle Autonomous Database trials that our customers look at this. And customers can migrate from on-premise to the Autonomous Database very, very quickly. It is not a technology upgrade. It's just an update, just move your data, drop a few indexes and you're there. You can do it very quickly. So we expect that the uptake next fiscal year, we're going to get enough business for the Oracle database in the Oracle Public Cloud to move the needle, kind of the answer to the question. When does ERP actually move the needle? When does the ERP get around the $1 billion growth rate? And Mark said, we've got a shot at doing that next year. We have a shot at doing the same thing, moving the needle the same distance with Autonomous Database next year. Mark Hurd : By the way, John, just a couple of points to add to Larry's point. We haven't had a quarter where database license and our support business didn't ever grow. So -- and the options, just to follow up, a little bit of color, the autonomous options actually grew the fastest of the group of options. So again, while the trials are what I said, when you have thousands of trials and they're growing monthly, which is, again, to Larry's point, about next year's impact on revenue, the options are a pretty good precursor to that, that you're seeing those options like Active Data Guard, multi-tenant, et cetera, that are really driving the options growth that Larry described. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow : Just wanted to follow up on, Larry, your last comment there about the Autonomous Database. I mean, obviously, the transactional database just came out in August and the data warehousing one earlier this year, but what has the feedback has been from customers? Sort of why is the interest level growing? Is it cost? Is it the availability, et cetera? Maybe just some more color on sort of what you're hearing from clients now that the 2 options have been live out there. And then just to your point there about sort of the adoption life cycle, wondering if you can step us through that, like, what are the key milestones you think sort of customers need to see to then start hitting sort of the inflection point on adoption? Lawrence Ellison : Okay. I'll say that the thing I thought would drive the autonomous usage was reduction of labor cost, more -- you eliminate human labor, you lower cost. You eliminate human labor, you lower errors. What has really been driving it is productivity. They've been able to get -- we've had customers that literally got their databases up and running in 15 minutes. And that -- existing customers, existing DBAs put another system in 15 minutes, whereas a normal time to put something like that up was 15 days. So the fact that the existing teams of DBAs, our primary customers can make themself as dramatically more productive, get 10x more done in the same time period than they could prior to the Autonomous Database has been the thing that has been most shocking to our customers. And it's the thing that's driving -- that we think is actually going to drive the migration more so than, if you will, closing data centers and reducing labor cost. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie. Sarah Hindlian : This is a question for Safra and Mark. It's obviously a very turbulent market out there. So I'd kind of appreciate it if you could both tell us a little bit about what you're hearing from customers when you meet with them. What are they telling you about how they see the world in light of all the volatility that's going on? Safra Catz : Well, many of our customers, especially those moving to SaaS and moving to the cloud are looking for ways to increase productivity, to spend a lot less money running their back offices and to get real business insight from the technology, and there is an immense amount of excitement around it, frankly. In fact, a number of our customers that may use one of our cloud products are now moving to our other cloud products without even doing a full RFP and competitive analysis because they've been so satisfied with our products. In fact, just today I got a call from a very well-known company and they've already picked our ERP and were so happy they're just going to roll out HCM and supply chain management now next. So there is a lot of enthusiasm around our products as a general matter, regardless of the economy, our products save them money. So it gives them more money to invest in other things and that's what, obviously, I focus on with them. Mark Hurd : I'd say, listen, Sarah, most of our customers want to focus on their business, focus on growing their business. They want to focus on their customers and what they do to make money. I think IT and I know you all know this, but most of what's going on in business IT today is most of the big budgets are spent on maintenance, keeping the existing applications, the existing infrastructure just running, very little innovation. The chance here with the products we have is now to change basically their paradigm, to shift their IT budgets to our R&D budgets and this is very attractive to our customers. The transfer of the work from them to us and while they do it to use the line Larry always uses, which is they have to be willing to spend less as they do that and then they get all this innovations sort of at the same time. So the fact -- and this has now become something that we don't have to evangelize to Safra's point. It's sort of becoming more mainstream in every dialogue. I mean, this last week I was in the Midwest, saw tens of customers. And I would tell you, it's one of the first trips where I didn't spend evangelizing much. I spent more time really talking about what we could do, meaning the maturation of the market now is, as a normal course of business, how can we help save money, get more innovation at the same time. And by the way, I'll just add to Larry's point, while he talked about great advantages, customers do want to get out of data centers, they do want to get out of servers, they do want to get out of infrastructure, they typically don't help our customers advance their business. So when you can do all this for them and you can help them save money and drive innovation, this is a big deal out in the market and this is what our customers are talking about. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Can I -- given that the comps are getting easier on the apps ecosystem for the second half, so there is almost kind of the room for accelerating further. Can you double click again on that ERP NetSuite strength? I mean, you have 16,000 customers, but in theory, a big market and you are reaccelerating it. Can you double click on what's working there and how big that could get over time? Mark Hurd : Well, sort of everything. So just to be clear on NetSuite, there's 3 -- and I've been through this before, but at the risk of going over it again, there are 3 core tenets as we bought NetSuite that we really focused on. One was, we believe they were underserved in terms of the amount of sales resource they had in the marketplace. We've increased that dramatically, both domestically and make sure I'm clear to you. Remember, a lot of the growth we've had in NetSuite isn't just international, it's domestic. They've had a tremendous run in The United States of America, just simply getting them more customers. And we've also expanded their resource internationally and we've grown internationally. So just more sales resource has been part of it. Second, we've increased their R&D to get to more countries. So we've released 19.1, we're now in -- I'm sorry, 18.1 and 18.2. We're now covering more and more countries than we were before. So we have more sales people with more product available in more locations. Third, we're very focused on industries. So when we say industries, we don't mean something like just retail. We actually go into micro segments into the marketplace like campus bookstores and say, we're going to really get features for that discreet micro segments. So those 3 fundamentals of more sales resource, more countries, more micro segments, those are the 3 key fundamentals that we've driven. By the way, we follow a lot of that same formula with Fusion, which is really sort of the same formula that we drive there. NetSuite has just done a great job, that team has done a great job. And if I haven't been effusive enough about it, I'm thrilled with their performance and what they've done and their future. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits : If Autonomous Database does as well as you expect, what's the impact of that on Infrastructure as a Service? Is there a feedback there? Lawrence Ellison : Well -- okay. Yes, Autonomous Database and -- Exadata services and Autonomous Database we think will be between 1/3 and 1/2 of Infrastructure. So obviously, it's going to drive infrastructure. It is the driving force in infrastructure. We think moving the -- in fact, if we did nothing but run Oracle applications in the Oracle Public Cloud and Oracle ISV applications, so all we did was move Turner over and all these other guys over and all of these existing Oracle applications, we'd be more than 10x bigger than Amazon. If that's all we did. But we -- of course, we're ambitious to do more than that. We have the big SaaS business as well, but the Oracle database will drive the infrastructure business. It will be between around 50% of that business and maybe more. Safra Catz : Okay. I think that's it for us. Let me just say one other thing to the extent that Autonomous Database does very well. Also, you can imagine that our margins on PaaS, IaaS they just go through the roof. So the more of our infrastructure that is -- is that not only are the revenues up, but the margins really skyrocket. Ken Bond : Okay. Thanks, Safra. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up question on this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thanks for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Victoria for closing. Operator : Thank you for joining today's Oracle's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your participation.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome to Oracle's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.  Now I'd like to turn today's call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President. Ken Bond : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendment for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll first go over Q3 results before moving on to guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Mark and Larry. As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise.  Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue for the quarter was $6.7 billion, up 4% in constant currency, and now accounts for nearly 70% of total company revenue, largely recurring revenue. As in past quarters, we are seeing robust double-digit growth rates for total cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong growth in Asia Pacific. In terms of product categories, ERP grew in the mid-30s and the verticals grew in the high 30s. Our software business, which is the totaling of Cloud Services and License Support revenue with Cloud License and On-Premise License revenue, is 82% of total revenue and it grew 3% in constant currency.  Our software business has remained extremely stable and resilient as we have made the transition to faster-growing SaaS business that entailed trading nonrecurring upfront license revenue for recurrent long-term subscription revenue.  Through adoption of autonomous database and OCI, we're now shifting the focus for our infrastructure business to the cloud. As a percentage of our total software business, cloud is now more than double what it was just 3 years ago and provides us with the ability to accelerate overall software revenue growth as this mix shift continues. GAAP applications total revenue were $2.8 billion, up 7%, and GAAP infrastructure total revenue were $5.1 billion, up 2%. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, essentially the same as last year with continuing improvement in SaaS gross margins, stability in software support gross margins and continued investment in Oracle cloud infrastructure. Once our cloud business is at scale, I expect our gross margins will go significantly higher.  Total revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 5% from last year, and the operating margin was 44%, up from 43% last year. This quarter last year was greatly impacted by the change in the U.S. tax book, so comparing the GAAP numbers is not very meaningful after pretax income. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20%, up from 16% catch-up rate last year, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.87 in USD, and up 12% in constant currency. This quarter, the GAAP tax rate was 11% and GAAP EPS was $0.76.  Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters is $14.8 billion. Over the last 4 quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $13.2 billion, down 1% due to timing differences of tax payments and working capital items.  We have more than $40 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion, up 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligations, or what I'll refer to as contract backlog, will be in the Q, and is now $31.5 billion, of which approximately 62% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.  Since we remain committed to returning value to shareholders through acquisitions, internal investments and a return of capital with stock repurchases and dividends, this quarter, we repurchased 206 million shares for a total of $10 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 728 million shares and reduced the absolute shares outstanding by nearly 16%. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 26% from $0.19 to $0.24 per share.  Turning to currency. I expect the strengthening U.S. dollar will continue with a currency headwind of 3% for Q4 revenue and a $0.03 headwind to earnings per share. Okay, so with that, let me turn to the guidance. So for Q4, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency and 0 to negative 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 15% to 19%, and be between $1.08 and $1.12 in constant currency, so we will deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for fiscal year 2019.  Taking into account the $0.03 currency headwind, non-GAAP EPS for Q4 in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 16%, and be between $1.05 and $1.09 in USD. My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20%.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for his comments. Mark Hurd : Thanks, Safra. Thanks. Solid quarter for us, from top to bottom. Total revenue was up 3% in constant currency with Cloud Services and License Support, up 4% and EPS 12% -- plus 12% in constant currency.  In our apps ecosystem, we continued our momentum, growing at 7% and that was an acceleration for us, and over $11 billion in trailing 12-months revenue and 92% of that is now recurring. We continue to grow revenue faster than market, and we have an enormous opportunity ahead of us in ERP and HCM. In terms of SaaS revenue and bookings, Fusion apps were up 35%. By the way, our overall ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now $2.8 billion, and that's up in the mid-20s. Again, Fusion apps, 35% up, Fusion ERP where revenue was up 47% organically. NetSuite revenue was up 28%. Bookings were up actually even higher in the mid-30s. Our vertical revenue was up 38%, and our annualized revenue in the verticals is now over $800 million.  I'm going to read you a quick quote from IDC, and I have to read it precisely or I'll get cards and letters. So let me just make sure I do this exactly as it's written.  \"Per IDC's latest annual market share results, Oracle is the #1 enterprise applications vendor in North America based on market share and revenue, surpassing Salesforce.com and SAP.\" We've seen this momentum building, so this is not any surprise to us, so I think it's always better when you can see it in real numbers from somebody other than us.  Let me switch briefly to infrastructure. Our GAAP tech ecosystem is $21 billion on a trailing 12-months basis and Q3 was up 2%. In Autonomous Database, our momentum continues to build. We now have 4,000 new trials that were added in Q3 alone, nearly 1,000 paying customers. We're adding many new customers and we're seeing great pull-through and with 20% of our autonomous data warehouse trials also using analytics. We now have over 35 referenceable customers and we expect to be greater than 100 soon. Cloud customer revenue was up triple digits for the fourth consecutive quarter. So overall, a solid quarter, as we hit our revenue targets and saw a 12% EPS growth. The strength of our bookings growth along with climbing renewal rates gives me the confidence that our cloud apps business is only going to strengthen from here and going forward, given the visibility we have into the revenue backlog, which Safra touched on a bit earlier.  Looking forward, I do expect FY '20 revenue growth will be higher than FY '19. And EPS this year will be certainly -- grow double digits, as Safra mentioned. I'm going to give you a few customer wins as well, try to give you a flavor for what happened in the quarter for us. Now most of these didn't affect our revenue, most of these, obviously are, all really bookings that occurred in the quarter, but I thought I'd give you some context about some people in our user base as well as outside our user base. So for example, Tromp Group in the Netherlands E-Business Suite migration; MasterBrand Cabinets in the U.S. in E-Business Suite migration; thyssenkrupp in Germany in E-Business Suite migration; Willis Towers Watson E-Business Suite migration. I gave you those, just a few of those examples. Those are core, sort of, E-Business Suite, Black & Veatch was another one, engineering company, core, sort of, E-Business Suite customers as we see this acceleration of our user base move into the cloud. Got a couple PeopleSoft ERP migrations, Amica Mutual in the quarter, Depaul University. And then a slew of wins again. And I referenced that a lot of the ERP user base that's out there today is outside of our user base or even our traditional on-premise competitor from, if you will, the old days.  ON semiconductor, nice win in the quarter. Packaging Corporation of America, again, outside of our user base for the quarter.  Eaton, another manufacturer. Atradius Cr\u00e9dito in the Netherlands. I could go on, which, in the sake of time, I won't, although I'll mention Ashford Hospitality. These are, again, outside our user base that are brand-new customers to Oracle in the area of ERP. In HCM, Abu Dhabi Airports; ADT; Alorica; Banco Davivienda; BLOM BANK; Great Canadian Gaming. We had a really nice win in a company called DeNova Healthcare. This again was not inside our user base. These were attritional Lawson customer, where we actually get multipillar ERP back-office and HCM connected together.  So anyway, I'll stop there in the sake of time, but just a really, again, very impressive set of customers and a good mix of net new logos as well as movement from our user base. We had a pretty good quarter and it was some really quality names on the platform side. Fair Isaac, Generali shared services in Italy; JOANN Stores; Trans -- Trenitalia; Unicorp, I mean, some really nice beginnings of what you're seeing as we move toward gen 2 cloud and Autonomous Database. I did want to make a couple of quick comments on our growing relationship with The Gap. So it's a global retailer as, I think, most of you know, with revenue of greater than $16 billion, and we've been working with The Gap in their transformation to what's really a multi-cloud environment but using many, many Oracle Technologies, and they include really everything we got : SaaS, PaaS, delivering innovation, reliability and scalability at every turn. And as part of even the things they're using in the private cloud, those are all really enabled by Exadata, and we're really thrilled to be Gap's strategic partner in their efforts to spin up their new retail brands and stores faster. And so that's the few quick wins for the quarter. So overall, good solid quarter for us on the income statement side, but also in the quality of these bookings that we're describing or that I've been describing. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Mark. Oracle's future rests on 2 strategic businesses : cloud applications and Cloud Infrastructure. The growth in our cloud applications business has been driven by our Fusion Suite and NetSuite.  Both the Fusion Suite of applications and NetSuite are growing very, very rapidly, and Mark gave you the numbers. As the names imply, both Fusion and NetSuite are integrated suites of applications, including sales, service, human resources, financials, supply chain and manufacturing applications. No other cloud services provider has such a comprehensive suite of applications covering both the front office and the back office.  Most customers want their cloud services provider to make their applications work together. Customers do not like to be responsible for the complex process of integrating lots of different applications, running on lots of different vendors' clouds. We think our integrated suite approach to the cloud applications business is a primary reason for the very rapid growth in our cloud applications market share.  The introduction of our Gen 2, highly secure infrastructure, featuring the Oracle Autonomous Database has been very well received. During Q3, we had nearly 1,000 paying Autonomous Database customers and over 4,000 active trials. Our infrastructure technology is highly differentiated from AWS. Each one of our cloud computers has a separate security processor and memory to insulate customers from intruding upon each other. And it also makes our cloud control code inaccessible by customers. No other cloud services provider offers this kind of protection across their entire public cloud. The Oracle Autonomous Database is the only database that can respond to a security threat by automatically patching itself while it's still running your application. No downtime is required. No other database has this capability.  Oracle Technology leadership in cloud infrastructure and database plus our market leadership in cloud applications makes us very optimistic about our future.  I'll turn it back to you, operator. Ken Bond : Operator, if we could move to the Q&A portion of the call, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Mark, I wanted to ask a question of you. Last month, when we were together at our tech conference, you reiterated that fiscal second half '19 sales growth would accelerate on a constant-currency basis versus the first half. And I'm not trying to be nitpicky but I think it doesn't look like it's accelerating much. So I was just wondering if anything changed. And I also wanted to ask about fiscal '20, which you've just mentioned that fiscal '20 constant-currency revenue growth would be higher than fiscal '19. I guess what I'm wondering is should we be thinking that, that constant currency growth acceleration that you're referring to for fiscal '20 is similar to the type of acceleration on the second half of fiscal '19? Or could it be more meaningful? Mark Hurd : Yes, so let's go back to it. I think '19 will grow faster than '18. Second half is, whatever adjective is around it, grow faster than first half. FY '20, faster than '19. When you get in underneath at what are the drivers, at a big level, first, our growing businesses are becoming a bigger part of our total than our other businesses. So as an example, just one example, cloud ERP gets bigger, hardware gets smaller, obviously, those have offsetting effects. In addition, we have the things that attach with that, for example, our consulting services business now in on-premise has been declining, but our cloud consulting is inclining as does our overall bookings. So as a result, these just offset each other. Within it, clearly, I've given you the numbers on certain parts of our apps as the example of ERP and HCM, which are just growing substantively. Larry's comments about Autonomous Database are 2 huge drivers of growth as we go forward. So I think all of those statements, '19 versus '18, second half, first half, '19 to '20 are all where you're going to see acceleration of top line growth in CD. Operator : Your next question comes from John DiFucci with Jefferies and company. John DiFucci : So your aggregate results have been, I guess, relatively steady might be the right way to characterize it. And during this period, I think investors really appreciate the share buybacks and the dividend, nice dividend increase this quarter. I guess, I want to sort of follow on with that line of thinking, Mark, and this uptick in fiscal '20. And you talked a lot about your cloud apps and we get a lot of information on that, but can you talk a little bit about what extent the database options might be a driver to some of that revenue acceleration? And how big is the middleware business at this point? Mark Hurd : I'll start. I'll let Larry comment also a bit on the off-trends. I think, first, just when we get into on the database side, I mean, the big move here is to autonomous. I think we tried to give you some numbers of the level of interest. The level of -- the increase in interest coming from even Q -- end of Q1, early Q2 into Q3 was just -- John, it was just substantive. It won't show up in our revenue numbers yet, but I'm talking about in terms of trials and people testing, and now, frankly, people buying. And what we've even seen is what's really nice, somebody buying something for as small as 15, 20, 25K as their first move into Autonomous Database, and actually, even within the quarter making a second purchase that turns into 200K, 250K. These are really encouraging early signs for us. And then to the point that you bring up, we just don't get the database, we get analytics, we get other services that come with it. So as we continue to convert trials into real usage, real usage into expansion, this becomes a core key driver as we move forward. I'll let Larry follow on with other parts of the options. Lawrence Ellison : As people use Autonomous Database in the public cloud, they typically got and buy the multitenant option and the Real Application Cluster option, which are required options for Autonomous Database. So there's no question that the introduction of Autonomous Database and the consumption of Autonomous Database as that accelerates, will increase the license purchases of those 2 options. John DiFucci : And just the second part of my question, you used to talk about middleware and how it was -- on-premise middleware stuff wasn't growing all that -- or is declining. I'm just curious, can you tell us even just roughly how big that is at this point? Because Mark, you sort of alluded to some of these other businesses that weren't growing or getting smaller and smaller. Mark Hurd : We never break that out, John. So to my knowledge, unless -- I'm not going to break -- I'm not going to start breaking it today. But clearly, middleware is moving, if you will, from, like everything else, from on-premise into the cloud. We've got a full suite of services in the cloud, but we're not going to break it out into a discrete business today. Lawrence Ellison : Yes, I can tell you a couple of parts in middleware are doing quite well. I mean, I think it's a mixed story. I think analytics are doing very well in the cloud, as Mark mentioned, 20% of Autonomous Database goes up with analytics and, John, we had a very good quarter. Mark Hurd : By the way, I guess, one last point while -- since we did do a little bit of that. Security is faster growing businesses as we can have within the context of the middleware business as well. So again, the problem with middleware, it's not a thing. It's multiple products within it. Some, like many things we've talked about, many things growing fast and things declining simultaneously. Operator : Your next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow : I just want to build on John's question there about the reacceleration ahead of us in database. When I think about what really differentiates Oracle and cloud, it's the Gen 2 OCI that we continue to get kind of increasingly positive data points on but then also adding autonomous platform on top of it. And so my question is with the TOMS data warehouse being out for a year and the transactional processing being out since August, how should we think about those 2 kind of combined to the reacceleration on top of ACI? And you mentioned the 1,000 customers and 4,000 trials, what is actually the driver of people shifting over? Is it speed? Is it cost? Is it performance? Just some more color on that would be great, so timing and then why. Mark Hurd : I'll let Larry start. Lawrence Ellison : Okay. All right, so the driver is many different things. Some of our customers were stunned that they can get a database up and running in 5 minutes. So we've been collecting references and studying the 1,000 customers and the 4,000 trials, and what they find encouraging about the Autonomous Database. Certainly, we'll call it productivity improvements. The fact that they can go from not having a database, not having a hardware, literally log on to our cloud, create an instance, get -- move their data and be up and running and doing useful things in 5 minutes is proving to be a shock to a lot of our customers. So getting things up and running quickly. Productivity has been a very big issue. We've got 1 customer who's done a series of tests. They were an AWS user, and I know we have these ads that promise cut your AWS bill in half. They found that we were running 11.5x faster than they were running in AWS, and they cut their bill by 80%. So a lot -- so that's -- and these are university researchers, so they're very, very cost sensitive and they felt it was worthwhile making the move just because we were much less expensive. Autonomous Database was way less expensive than Redshift or Aurora at Amazon. Some people, they had an existing data warehouse and it was just the compatibility, being able to take an existing data warehouse, not spooling up a new one in 5 minutes, but taking an existing data warehouse, lifting it and shifting it over. So we're seeing all 3 of those use cases. Productivity -- motivators, I should say. Productivity, compatibility and cost, all driving the usage of Autonomous Database. Mark Hurd : So I'd say that we've never had a release in the database area where we could actually talk to a CEO about what was in the release and the CEO would go, I completely get it. I mean it's not like we're talking about partitioning or something like that. When you talk about the fact that this database patches itself, our customers at the CEO level now understand what a patch is. They understand why it's so important, why it's so strategic. They, in many cases, have to discuss it with their audit committees. And the fact that now patching goes from a problem to where they pass that to us and it gets done instantaneously, we have many customers who said, if this thing did nothing but that, I would migrate to Autonomous Database. If the fact that -- you add to the fact to Larry's point that this database tunes itself, creates all its own index, is it actually it's labor less and can you reapply talent to another area. If it did nothing but that, it would be valuable. If it did nothing but give you better security and give you price and performance, and so this is a release that the reason you're seeing the trials and the level why you hear our enthusiasm the way it is, is the customer response is just extremely high because it just makes business sense. This isn't something sold 5 levels down or 4 levels down in the order. This can be sold at the top of the company, if you will, at the CEO level. So it's why it's such an exciting release test because at this point it has so many business benefits to our customers as opposed to maybe the fact that you would think of traditionally many of our benefits being, if you will, technical. It's different explaining to a CEO what multitenant is and what in-memory is than frankly the benefits I've just described. Philip Winslow : Well, knowing how much we spend on patching, I've got a lead for your CRMs with them. Mark Hurd : I'll stop -- I won't get too specific into your situation, but you're a good use case with a very large bank with a tremendous amount of Oracle that, frankly, in many ways, done a fantastic job, but still has a window that has to be closed. And this -- in terms of patch deployment, then this is one vehicle to -- certainly, a vehicle and the only vehicle I'm aware of to get that done. Philip Winslow : Well, Safra can give me some quote entertainment for that reference, that'd be great. Operator : Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : I wanted to go back to the apps ecosystem. Mark, can you talk to us on NetSuite because that's accelerated again this quarter? And I was just wondering, like, look, when we talked about a few quarters ago, it was like we tried to bring it over 20, but now we're in the high 20s. Was there anything special going on? Or is that kind of -- is there anything in terms of new run rate that we need to be aware of? Mark Hurd : Well, I mean, as I've said on multiple calls in a row, they've been doing very well. I mean, this started tremendous acceleration we had last Q4 when their bookings growth was over 70%. And you're just beginning to see that turn into now revenue. So I believe the new rate is sustainable. And I actually think we can do better. And our strategy has been very simple, and -- but I know I've said it before, but it's been, frankly, no more complicated than adding salespeople internationally and domestically. We've done both to, if you will, localize the product for more countries. We've done many new countries that we've now released. In addition to that, we've been building out more verticals, what we call SuiteSuccess, where we actually bundled in the implementation with what we sell. And that's very, very popular with our customers. And so I think the team has also done a marvelous job executionally. And it's -- I know I say my comments pretty quick, but as much as the revenue grew in the quarter, our bookings actually grew faster than the revenue. And so we're very excited about NetSuite. We have been excited about NetSuite, and I think they will continue to perform. And I actually think we can do better than even what I've just described today. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits : So you've been seeing accelerating growth in cloud, ERP and HCM and other areas of cloud. Is that growing -- accelerating enough and becoming a big enough piece of the business that we can now start to see an acceleration in the cloud business overall, which has had some other headwinds? Mark Hurd : I mean, I guess I'll start. As I said in my comments, ERP and HCM are becoming a bigger and bigger part of our business. I mean, today, our annual SaaS revenues, ERP and HCM is approaching $3 billion. It's growing sort of mid-20s. And I think it's going to get nothing but better than better. Again, I don't want to get too positive. Only in the context that we're beginning to see acceleration in some key parts. So we're very focused on our competitors by brand and by industry. We deploy our sales force against those brands and against those industries as well as into our own user base. And the reason I read the references the way I read them was so you'd get a flavor that both our own user base is beginning to move in bigger numbers as well as the fact that we get competitive. Remember, most of that user base is not sitting with us or our traditional on-premise competitor. So yes, I mean, clearly it's a point to what I made earlier, and I'll stop after this to say that our growing businesses are becoming bigger and bigger, and you start putting the growth rates I'm describing on numbers like $3 billion, and you can do your own math. And so we're very confident, and feel very good about our position in those businesses. Michael Turits : Thanks, Mark. And if I get a follow-up quick one for Safra. Safra, you've managed to keep CapEx low even with the OCI investment. Any reason to expect a change in that trajectory, where we'd be spending more capital? Safra Catz : No. I expect it to be very similar this next quarter to this past quarter. And for the year, it's basically the same. Just a little bit less than last year. So that's kind of what we're looking at. Of course, if there's a huge opportunity, we may push the gaps a little more. But you have to understand that our SaaS operation is really, really coming and we're getting enormous economies of scale there. That's why the margins keep improving, and so we're able to sort of do it all within the same investment envelope so far. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : I'm going to do something I haven't done in a while, I'm going to take a bit of a liberty and ask 2 questions. The first is for Safra. You talked a bit on the call about cash flow, which has grown double digits, but was down roughly 1%, and you gave some color on the call, but can you talk a little bit more about the underlying factors here? Was timing or your definition of when you recognize cash flow having an impact? Are there other things that are impacting that cash? And then I have a follow-up for Mark. Safra Catz : I mean, there are 2 things going on. If you look just at the quarter, it's nothing but cash collections, timing of cash collections. Nothing more really than that to focus in on. If you look at year-to-date, which you may look at in one of the other schedules, it's that and some tax payments. And that's really the 2 things going on. So nothing special going on. It happens every once in a while. If you look back previous years, you will see that, and it's a very Q3 thing, frankly because, by then, we're collecting up a lot of previous quarters' bookings -- billings, excuse me, so that's really it. Nothing special. Mark Moerdler : Okay, perfect. And then as a follow-up to Mark, given some color on the Autonomous Database, like, can you specifically discuss the types of workloads that are driving adoption of autonomous, and especially new clients, for -- autonomous revenue clients to the Oracle Database? Safra Catz : Larry? Lawrence Ellison : I think the question police ought to get you for announcing you're going to ask 2 questions as opposed to just doing it. Mark Moerdler : Sorry, Mark. I decided to be polite about it. Mark Hurd : Yes. No, that was very thoughtful. I don't know, maybe, Larry, you want to start in on that one? Lawrence Ellison : Sure, I mean, there are a lot -- database does a lot of different things. The researchers that I mentioned earlier that are moving from AWS for big cost savings, they're doing a combination of machine learning and computer vision to look at tissue samples and detect anomalous cells. Cancer based kit are using computers to diagnose cancer and that's a combination of machine learning and the Autonomous Database. And that's an all-new application. So there are several people that are coming in with all-new applications in the cloud. Especially the ones moving from AWS. Then there are traditional on-premise customers, who are simply taking one of their millions of Oracle databases, there are millions of these things out there and just lifting one of those databases either transaction processing and the associated application, either transaction processing application or a data warehousing application, just lifting it intact, moving the data over and moving the application over to compute, moving the data over to Autonomous Database, and running the same exact thing in the cloud. They're experiencing, sometimes shocking performance improvements also. I know we had 1 customer that moved from on-premise into the cloud and the cloud system ran many times faster than their on-premise system. Then there are customers that are moving new -- existing big Oracle customers that are moving new developments. The new applications that they're developing from developing them on-premise, they move test and development into the cloud. And they are the ones that, again, the general reaction there is they're much, much more productive getting running. It's much cheaper to do test and development, much more responsive, much more productive to move test and development from their on-premise infrastructure to the cloud infrastructure. So online transaction and processing, lifting and shifting applications, data warehousing lifting and shifting, test and development, moving from AWS, there are lots of different use cases. Mark Hurd : Just a couple of quick follow-ons, one, I'm doing this off the top of my head, Mark, but I'm roughly right. 20% of our customers in autonomous data warehouse or in TOMS Database right now are net new to Oracle, we did not have them before, net new. And 80% are in our user base, roughly 70%, 75%, there's net no competition at all and the transaction is simply, as Larry described, a migration. 75% are actually into the LOB as opposed to IT, which I look at is very good news as well. So we've got a lot of underpinning improving dynamics -- in my opinion, they're improving dynamics, in terms of net new customers in addition to moving of our database and certainly, analytical data warehousing is probably the biggest individual driver of anything we've got. Operator : And your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : My question is for Mark. Mark, as we think about the traction you're seeing in cloud ERP and where the demand is coming from, there's the massive on-premise install base opportunity, but I think some might not appreciate that more than half the market is the long tail of niche legacy vendors that most people haven't even heard of. Can you just give us a sense for your success in displacing that long tail? How much you think you're participating there versus the more usual suspects? Mark Hurd : By the way, I think that's exactly right, what you said. So I think it's common thought that the ERP market on-premise is dominated by 2 vendors : Oracle and the company from Germany. And those 2 vendors together have less than 50% of the market. We have more Fortune 500 customers, for example. They have many big customers, but the blizzard of implementations -- or there's a blizzard of companies that have the more than 50% market share, 54%, 55%, most of them have moved into private equity. They're not even public companies. They're on their second or third turn through private equity. They've got no migration plan to the cloud. They've got 2G -- I could go on and on with all of these. And that's why as I mentioned earlier, we actually line up our development resources and our sales resources, very focused on these competitors. They would have names like, I mentioned a couple, like McCormack & Dodge, if you've heard of them. IBM, believe it or not, actually has got an old ERP system. There's a company called Deltek, I mean, there's a company called Lawson, a company called [ ETHICA ], there's tens and tens of these to your point, and these are old, old pieces of code. These need to move. They need to move to a more modern platform and they are, perhaps, as attractive as any other market. And in fairness, our user base actually knows our cloud road map. They actually have confidence in our R&D. They know we're going to be there to migrate them when they want to be there. They actually have less of a sense of urgency, in many cases, to move than the companies you're describing, Brad, because they're in much more desperate situations without a road map, without knowing how they're going to get from here to there, knowing their competitors are beginning to move. So we have as much success today, and if you ask one of our salespeople, would you rather have one of these competitive territories where you're going after one of these niche vendors, or would you rather have an E-Business Suite territory, many of our salespeople say, \"Give me that competitive territory,\" because there's an absolute need to move as quick as you can. So yes, it's an incredibly attractive market and it's why you hear us keep talking about it so much because the additional fact is when we sell ERP, we continue to see an attach rate to HCM, and, frankly, an attach rate to even some of our other apps in the CX and front office area as well, so it's why we're so focused on that opportunity. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Ken Bond. Ken Bond : Okay, great. Thank you. A telephone replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for closing. Operator : Thank you for joining today's Oracle's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your participation.

Sir, I hand the floor to you. Ken Bond : Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.  On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.  As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. And we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.  And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.  Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had a terrific quarter with total revenue growth 1 point above the high end of my guidance and earnings per share $0.07 above the high end of my U.S. dollar guidance. I'll first go over Q4 and recap fiscal year 2019 before moving on to my guidance. I'll then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. As in prior quarters, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. Now the effects of currency movements in Q4 were largely as expected, maybe a smidge more incremental headwind than expected, but that was not a full percentage more. Anyway, total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, while Cloud License and On-Premise License revenues were $2.5 billion, up 15%. In particular, technology license growth was up 19%, making it abundantly clear that customers are investing in the Oracle platform. The key database options necessary to run the Oracle Autonomous Database service grew 21%. I cannot stress enough the stability and growth of our base of customers quarter-after-quarter. Our customers are maintaining and expanding their Oracle environment. And in our BYOL, Bring Your Own License model, they have the portability to use their licenses on-premise, in the cloud or via hybrid environment. This popularity is largely because our products are capable of doing things others just can't do, whether it's security, performance or scalability, and in our cloud, autonomous capabilities. As our customers adopt our technologies, whether via licenses or cloud services, our overall customer base is growing and that growth is starting to accelerate. In addition, the recent interconnect agreement with Microsoft will only help accelerate the transition from on-premise database to the Autonomous Database service. Now to the numbers. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%. And as we continue to scale and grow, I expect this will go even higher. Total revenues for the quarter were $11.1 billion, up 4% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.3 billion, up 7% from last year. And the operating margin was 47%, which was up from 46% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 16.4%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. And EPS was $1.16 in U.S. dollars and up 27% in constant currency and 23% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 3.3%, also a result of some discrete items. And GAAP EPS was $1.07 in U.S. dollars and up 41% in constant currency, 36% in U.S. dollars. Now moving on to recap the full fiscal year. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenue was $26.7 billion, growing 4%. Total company revenues for the year was $39.5 billion, growing 3% compared to 2% total revenue growth in FY '18. Non-GAAP EPS was USD 3.52, up 19% in constant currency, up 16% in U.S. dollars, driven by operating income growth, share repurchases and lower tax rate. This is mirrored in our operating margin percentage for the full year, which was up slightly to 44% this year. As a reminder, our best ever full year operating margin was 47%, and I expect we will surpass that in the coming years as our total revenue growth accelerates and we benefit from greater scale in our business. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14.6 billion, lower than last year, only because, as you will see at the bottom of our cash flow statement in the 10-K, FY '19 cash tax payments were $1.3 billion higher this year, including the $610 million installment towards the transition tax in Q2 and nearly $540 million in higher tax payments in Q4. Capital expenditures for the year were $1.7 billion. And free cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $12.9 billion. We now have approximately $38 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.4 billion, up 3% in constant currency. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 112 million shares for a total of $6 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 734 million shares for a total of $36 billion. Over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by almost 25% with nearly 60% of the total reduction this past year in FY '19. In addition, we've paid out dividends of $2.9 billion over the last 12 months and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. Now to the guidance. My guidance today is a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming the current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have about a 1% negative effect on total revenues and about $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q1, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow between 0% and 2% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 14% to 16% and be between $0.81 and $0.83 in constant currency. And assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 14% and be between $0.80 and $0.82 in USD. Now this past year, we grew 3%. And for fiscal year 2020, I expect total revenue will grow faster than last year constant currency, of course, and that we will once again report double-digit EPS growth. Total CapEx for fiscal year '20 is expected to be about $2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings. My EPS guidance for Q1 and fiscal year '20 assumes our base rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base, both higher or lower. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments. Mark Hurd : Thanks, Safra. Really we just had a solid quarter from top to bottom. Total revenue was up 4% in constant currency with Cloud License and Support up 3% and EPS up 27% in constant currency. In apps, we had a great momentum. We grew 6% for the year. We're now at $11.5 billion in trailing 12 months' revenue, 92% of that recurs. We continue to grow revenue faster than market. And we have just an enormous opportunity in front of us in ERP and HCM, and I'll talk to that in a second. In SaaS revenue and bookings, let me just give you a few stats to give you some context of what happened. Overall ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now $2.9 billion or call it $3 billion, and it was up in the high 20s. Fusion apps revenue was plus 36% in Q4 and up 32% for the full year. Fusion HCM was up 25% in Q4, solid growth with nice wins that I'll discuss again in a second. Fusion ERP revenue was up 44% and also up 44% for the full year. NetSuite ERP was up 28% in Q4 as the strong momentum continues. They had strong bookings in the quarter. And I remind you that last Q4, they had 72% growth in bookings. In addition, there was a plus 30% growth in bookings this Q4. And that's what drove this revenue growth. And when we acquired NetSuite, we had roughly 15% growth rates, and those have darn near doubled now since the acquisition. In our verticals, revenue was up 19% and 32% for the year. In our Data as a Service, just to give you some further context within our SaaS business, our challenges related to the broader privacy issues continued and revenue was down 15%. Now I'm going to give you an IDC quote that I have to read as-is, so I can't improvise. But let me give you the quotes, the words and then the close quotes. \"Per IDC's latest annual market share results, Oracle gained the most market share globally out of all enterprise applications SaaS vendors 3 years running, in calendar year '16, '17 and '18.\" And I can't improvise on that quote, although I'd like to. So anyway, we just have strong momentum in the app space. I'll talk to you about some of the wins in a second. In our infrastructure ecosystem, the GapTech ecosystem was $21.1 billion on a trailing 12 months' basis and Q4 was up 7% with database up mid-single digits, driven by mid-teens database license growth. And let me repeat that, mid-teens database license growth. Autonomous Database, and I'm telling you, while the numbers helped us in Q4, they were still small. But the -- if you extrapolate them, they are relatively -- not relatively, they are very significant. More than 5,000 new trials were added in Q4 alone. We've got a great pull-through business with 40% of our Q4 wins, so 40% of the time we win on Autonomous Database, we pull through analytics. We're adding many new customers. So of all the customers we're adding with Autonomous Database, and you might think we're replacing just our base, which by the way we'd be glad to do, about 20% of our customers are just brand new to Oracle. They were not an Oracle Database customer when they bought the Autonomous Database. And new workloads are 40%, meaning that I'm an Oracle Database customer, but I'm putting a different workload on the Autonomous Database than I had on the Oracle Database. So we have both new and existing customers doing both. Now to Safra's point, and she hit it briefly, I want to hit it just a little harder. In the key database options that you need to run autonomous, so these being rack and multi-tenant and Active Data Guard if you want the SLA, our license growth was up 21%. So what do you think the market is growing, 2, 3, 3.4, whatever number you think from your favorite analyst, this was a huge share gain customer for us -- or share gain quarter for us in database. It was a solid quarter. We exceeded our revenue target and saw 27% EPS growth. Our bookings growth climbed with our renewal rates, meaning our continuing renewal rates of existing customers gives us confidence that our cloud apps business will also just continue to strengthen from here. Now I thought I'd give you just a couple of key wins we had during the quarter. And I'm going to try and give you a little more color of the typical size of the companies we're selling to. I might even try and give you a little bit about who we replaced in the deal and give you some rhythm, so you get a feel for all of this. Some of our key wins, and I'll focus on some back office wins, Argo Insurance (sic) [ Group ], about a $2 billion company; Coronado Curragh, a mining company in Australia, $2.3 billion company. Diebold Nixdorf, that's an interesting one, because I used to compete with them when I was at NCR. Diebold bought Nixdorf. And Diebold was an EBS customer. Nixdorf was an SAP customer. They combined the 2, and they will be going to Oracle Cloud ERP. The whole Diebold Nixdorf will run on Oracle Cloud ERP. NG, out of Brazil, about $1.3 billion, they bought ERP supply chain and procurement, fantastic win for us. And they were running on TOTVS, a Brazilian ERP company. And so they are net new to Oracle. Exterion, which is a $1 billion company, bought our whole -- really our whole ERP suite, ERP planning, supply chain, procurement. They did it against a background of basically having a little bit of everything. They had a little bit of EBS, a little bit of SAP and a little bit of Microsoft and replaced it all with the Oracle Cloud. Now this company you may never have heard of, Helmerich & Payne, the reason I've heard of them is their stock symbol on The New York Stock Exchange was HP. And for years, I wanted their stock symbol. And they are about a $1.6 billion company. And while I never got the stock symbol from them, we have replaced Epicor with Oracle Cloud ERP at Helmerich & Payne.  So anyway, that would just give you some idea on that. Ferguson, which is one of the largest plumbing wholesale and distribution companies, they're a $21 billion company. They bought ERP, EPM, supply chain, procurement, just a tremendous, tremendous win for us and very looking to partner with them. Santander in the U.S., another tremendous win for us. Wright Medical, which was very competitive. Emerson Electric, Rutgers University, which has deployed not only all of our financials and ERP, but are deploying our new student scheduling system, which deals with all of commissions and -- not commissions, but grants and discounting, very difficult stuff to deal with in higher ed. So a very key win for us in the quarter. A great HCM win at Waste Management. Waste Management is a $13 billion company in Houston. This is HCM, payroll, talent, some amount of ERP. Tiffany, I'm sure all of you bought something from Tiffany for some important occasion, Tiffany will be running on our HCM location. Okay. I'm getting a sign to stop here, but it was a very good quarter in terms of just quality logos. And I think what I was -- let me just try to do one -- maybe a couple of other things for you just to give you some flavor. So we get asked this in Q&A a lot. I'm just reading down the list. And of what I'm looking at is about 150 on my page, I'd say 120 bought more than one module from us. And if I read the competitors or the incumbents that got replaced, they start SAP, EBS, EBS, TOTVS, Microsoft, Epicor, Epicor, Infor, Lawson, Infinium, Microsoft, EBS, I mean, I could go on and on. But that will give you a flavor that we're getting as many, and I didn't do this accounting exactly, but as many of our logos from outside of the traditional Oracle user base as we are from the Oracle user base. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Mark. As Mark said, in Q4, we saw a surge in database license sales. We also saw very rapid growth in sales of those database options required to run our Autonomous Database. We continue to gain overall database market share as we migrate our database users to the cloud. In the quarter, we added over 5,000 new Autonomous Database trials in our Gen 2 public cloud. Our new Gen 2 Cloud infrastructure offers customers a compelling array of advanced technology features, including our self-driving database that automatically encrypts all your data, backs itself up, tunes itself, upgrades itself and automatically patches itself when a security threat is detected. It does all of this autonomously, while running without the need for any human intervention and without the need for any downtime. No other cloud infrastructure provides anything close to these autonomous features. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Holly, if we can start with the Q&A portion of the call please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Michael Turits, Raymond James. Michael Turits : Strong quarter in a lot of ways, and database obviously stood out. But I'd like to ask about the recent Azure partnership. In general, your strategy has been to make sure that on-premise Oracle workloads move to Oracle Cloud. Does this Azure partnership represent an opening to Oracle workloads running on other clouds? Or is it more directed at just getting Azure services integrated with Oracle Cloud workloads? Lawrence Ellison : It really is -- most customers have Microsoft technology and Oracle technology. So they might have a Microsoft analytics suite and their data in an Oracle database. And we want to make it as easy as possible for you to run those Microsoft analytics in Azure, accessing the Oracle Database in the Oracle Public Cloud. And we built these high-speed interfaces and make -- we made -- we glued the technologies together, but we also have unified the customer experience. So the customers -- it feels to the customer, like they're working in one cloud, but they have 2 suites of products and technologies they have access to and they can interconnect those things. But no, the Oracle Database is still running in the Oracle Cloud and the Microsoft analytic technology is running in the Microsoft cloud. They are just talking to each other at high speed and highly reliable. Ken Bond : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler, Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : Congrats on the strong quarter. I'd like to focus my question on the database business and especially Autonomous Database. Mark, Safra, thanks for the data you gave on autonomous on the call, but can you give us some more color on how we should think about the database biz revenue going forward? Is autonomous adoption hitting the stride, so we can visibly see it in license revenue on a quarter-by-quarter basis? And what's this impact going forward on cloud [indiscernible] ? Lawrence Ellison : Okay. Let me give you what I think is maybe the most interesting thing we can say about this. We have 2 ways of forecasting our Autonomous Database business. One is the traditional way, where the field comes out with quarterly forecasts, we put together annual plans. And that's in fact what we relied upon for years in terms of giving you guidance. But now that we're in the cloud business, we have some interesting additional data, not around field sales, if you will, bookings for selling our cloud services and our technology, but rather we have real data about consumption inside of our cloud. And we started collecting the consumption data, because to add capacity to the cloud -- Safra said, depending on bookings, we might have to spend more money. Let me be a little bit more precise. It's not even bookings that drive it. Bookings that lead to increased consumption triggers our just-in-time provisioning of our hardware into our public clouds. And right now, we're getting signals from our usage in our Gen 2 Cloud that is signaling much faster Autonomous Database growth than we're seeing from our sales forecast. It's just kind of interesting, but encouraging. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : It's great seeing the business accelerating like this. My question is for Larry. Larry, it's so nice to see the early success in Autonomous Database and demand for database options. But as we think about the long-term prospects of the database business, in years past, a lot of your success was tied to the ISV ecosystem, and it would seem the future is increasingly about embracing software developers. First, would you agree with that statement? And how do you see Oracle attracting developers to your database and OCI more broadly? Lawrence Ellison : Well, I think you're saying the same thing. Why is it attractive to -- why is it good to attract developers, because developers write applications and the most important applications are ISV applications, which are used across the board. So I don't think anything has changed at all. Developers were always, if you will, the foundation of our business. We have over 1 million developers in our ecosystem already. And most ISVs, most of the current ISVs in the cloud use the Oracle Database. I mean, everything the Salesforce.com runs pretty much is running on the Oracle Database. Everything that SAP acquired to run in the cloud runs on the Oracle Database. Now I know SAP said they're going to move to HANA, but they said that 6 years ago, haven't quite gotten there yet. Anyway, the -- we go after developers -- and in fact, yesterday, we were putting the finishing touches of a program we're going to be announcing to developers at Oracle OpenWorld, which is basically free services to developers, forever, if you will. So developers and college entrepreneurs can -- this is free service. We'll be able to provide this free service that will let developers to start on the Oracle Cloud, build their applications and graduate from being maybe a solo entrepreneur some place in a dorm in MIT to eventually being an entrepreneur starting a company and then becoming an ISV. That's the cycle we want to sign up people early, and we have all sorts of cloud programs we're putting in place to be able to do that. Ken Bond : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of John DiFucci, Jefferies. John DiFucci : I'm going to follow up with another database. I know apps was good too, but I can't help myself, have been waiting for this. Maybe... Lawrence Ellison : Us too. We've been working for this for a long time, and it's great to see it's just begin to show up in the numbers. John DiFucci : It is. And the timing is kind of odd, Larry, because many infrastructure companies this quarter have struggled lately. And as you probably know, the logical conclusion from the investment community was that we'd see some relative weakness out of Oracle. But your constant currency infrastructure growth was better than it's been in -- I mean since you've been doing this, like over the last -- I went back looking back to fiscal '16. And in this quarter, the constant currency growth was better than it's been since -- over that time period. I guess, Larry, you mentioned the options, and that's something we've been sort of waiting for and looking for. I guess, can you give a little more detail on that? And then maybe even more generally, maybe Mark, if you can give us some detail on comments on the general broad-based infrastructure IT demand out there? We're not -- we don't just cover Oracle, right? We're just trying to figure out what's going on out there. Lawrence Ellison : Okay. So let me -- there are 2 options that I think Mark mentioned them that are absolutely required to use Autonomous Database. One is the multi-tenancy option. This is the one where you can take an existing application, it could be an ISV, you could take an existing application that was never built to be multi-tenant, you move it to the Oracle Database, you don't change a thing and you suddenly have a multi-tenant database. So that's one thing that's required for Autonomous Database. The other thing is this real application clustering. Real application clustering refers to the fact that we use multiple computers to run every database instances. So in case one of those computers should fail, there's -- our systems are fault tolerant, they keep running. So the Autonomous Database never breaks. Let me say that again, never breaks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, stand by. And our next question is going to come from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs. Ken Bond : Heather, can you hold on for a moment. Heather, can you hear me okay? I apologize everybody. Larry, what'd you like to do? Would you like to continue on or... Lawrence Ellison : Yes. I would like to answer the question. Safra Catz : John, did you get any of Larry's answers? Ken Bond : John we'll get you back on the line and we'll kind of figure out -- apologies for these logistics. Lawrence Ellison : We were talking about the options. So let me -- I'm sorry. And I'll cycle back and repeat my answer. So the answer, there are 2 options required for Autonomous Database. One is the multi-tenancy option, and that allows, let's say, an existing ISV to take an application that was never meant for the cloud, move it to our Autonomous Database with the multi-tenancy option, and suddenly, without changing their application, their application becomes a multi-tenant cloud application. That's one key feature and we've seen sales of that skyrocket. The other key feature of Autonomous Database that's required to use Autonomous Database is this feature called rack. Rack is the ability to use multiple computers to run a single application or a single database instance. So in case one of those computers should fail, we tolerate that failure and the application keeps running, because we have multiple computers. You might have one. You might have 2, 3, 4. But you lose 1 or 2, you still have 2, 3, 4 left, whatever you -- however you configure the system. We will only configure Autonomous Database with multiple computers. Autonomous Database never fails. You must have the rack option to ensure that. Rack options are growing more rapidly than you would expect, being driven again by consumption of the Autonomous Database. So we're seeing very, very rapid adoption. In fact, it's -- and another thing -- to add a little color to this, initial transaction, a lot of our existing customers might come on with a very small project, let's say, a $30,000 ARR project. And within 60, 90, 120 days, that becomes $120,000 project. And after another few months, it becomes $0.5 million project. So we're really optimistic about this business. And the optimism -- and I'm just back to what I said earlier, the optimism was not in Safra's guidance, which is based on sales forecast. The thing that I find fascinating are the consumption data curves, which shows our consumption rate growing much faster than the fields currently anticipating. To me, that's just wonderfully encouraging, and hopefully, this is the beginning of the trend. We'll find out soon. Ken Bond : Okay, Holly, if we could now move ... Lawrence Ellison : I think Mark had a follow on. Didn't you have a question for Mark as well? John DiFucci : I did. Just a general demand. Can you hear me? Mark Hurd : Yes. We can hear you, John. John DiFucci : Okay. Yes. It was just -- we're seeing a lot of funky stuff out there for infrastructure software. And I'm just wondering -- I mean you guys just have a broad customer base. Just like wondering what you're seeing in general? Are you seeing any -- I mean your business was strong, but there's a lot of companies that have struggled recently. Are you seeing anything, any changes out there for infrastructure demand in general beyond Oracle even? Mark Hurd : Yes. I mean we have new hot products. I mean that's the difference. I think that again, I won't speak to everybody, but when you go out with the Autonomous Database, Larry talked about a lot of different factors, but from a business perspective, we very rarely had a product that we can go talk to somebody at a senior level and say how would you like to get more secure, save money and get better performance all at the same time. Lawrence Ellison : How would you like to  outsource the security detection and patchings responsibilities to somebody who does this for a living, so you never have to read the name of your company above the fold on the front page talking about how much data you just lost. All right. So we expect -- yes, I'm going to let Mark talk. I'm sorry. Mark Hurd : Well, this is a really simple message. This is different from saying, we've got a new partitioning. It's just a very different approach for us. And so we've got new products. You know about the strengths, John, you mentioned in cloud apps. And we benefit from a set of competitors that are in different stages of maturation, most of which are weak. And we've got great products and what we are just now bringing out in Autonomous Database. And so I think that's a bit different just in terms of the various product cycle that we're in versus what other people might be in. Lawrence Ellison : Yes. Let me then close with -- I couldn't agree more with Mark. Our really good hot new products like Autonomous Database, Fusion, cloud application suite, NetSuite are selling really well. In fact, they are accelerating. They're doing extremely well. Quite frankly, we have some other product lines that we're quite naturally downsizing like some of the acquired Sun hardware, there are some older on-premise software products that aren't really doing well. Mark mentioned data cloud because of all the privacy issues. So yes, there are some of our businesses that are not, if you will, hot. But the good news is the hot businesses are now bigger than the not-so-hot businesses and that's determining our future. Mark Hurd : By the way, what Larry said is right, I think it's worth noting. Our SPARC business declined 24%, 25% this quarter. Our NetSuite business grew, as we described, in the high 20s. And they don't cancel out. NetSuite is now bigger. But when we look at the aggregate growth rate of the company, it's made up of negative 25s and plus 27s, like what I just described. And so it does create the phenomenon that Larry described. Lawrence Ellison : Again, it looked like -- and I swear this will be the last part of the answer to your question. The -- it does look like the top line is moving up modestly. But underneath that, there is really a lot of activity. You have these very -- these modern businesses like Autonomous Database, Fusion, NetSuite growing very rapidly, taking share, clear #1s in the overall marketplace. [indiscernible] is dominant #1 in cloud ERP. And you have these other businesses that are melting away and we just don't care. We're focused on our star products, and our star products are now driving our top line higher. Operator : And our next question will come from Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Okay. So I guess, I should spend a little bit of time on the app segment, given everyone has been focusing on the infrastructure segment so far. It obviously looks like that was another strong quarter there. I was wondering, Mark, if you could share with us in terms of how the SaaS business is performing, if you could look out next year -- I mean, you had tougher comps in the fiscal year that just ended, right, as the anniversary of NetSuite went on. When you think about the type of acceleration we can see, can you walk us through kind of the puts and takes in terms of the types of acceleration we might be able to see in that business? And also I wanted to ask you, I mean, SAP is going through where they are trying to get customers to replatform. How much of an opportunity is that for you to go and potentially win back some of those customers or to win some of those customers for the first time? So wondering kind of the competitive environment, I guess, between Workday and SAP and how you're seeing that play out given some of the announcements from SAP? Mark Hurd : Okay. Well, that question would take me like an hour to get. Heather Bellini : How about the abridged version? Mark Hurd : The abridged version. I think, to your point, SAP is forcing all their customers to a new platform by beginning of 2025. That forces all their customers to move and all the changes, not just the changes they've just made, but all the changes they made to the code have to be remade to the code. And what that means is they have to roll up a big new bill to move to this thing Larry called earlier, HANA. And it's a big damn bill. And so the poor CIO or CFO, whoever this guy is, has to show up to the Board and says to the Board of Directors, we've got a $500 million bill to move to HANA. And you all on the phone are smart. My guess is the Board members says something clever like what's HANA. And the guy goes, well, it's a platform. And the guy goes, well, what's a platform? And he goes, well, it's a new thing we run our ERP on. The guy goes, oh, okay. And it costs $500 million? And the guy goes, oh, yes. And he goes what do we get for it? And he goes, well, we get some new plumbing and we get some new this. I just think that meeting goes very badly. And somewhere in the meeting, the customer goes who else have you talked to? Do we have an alternative? Could we not do it? Could we go with somebody else? So yes, I mean, I think it's an incredibly interesting strategy on their part to put all their customers at play. Do we get calls from customers that we haven't been called or talked to in 20 years? The answer is yes. And is it because -- and remember, Heather, you know this that when we sold to customers 15 years ago, they never really talked to SAP after that and vice versa, because you're expected to stay with these ERP systems forever. So yes, some percent of their base will move as a result of just this, because it's a lot of money for not getting much, real simple. And the rest of the... Heather Bellini : Anything on Workday? Mark Hurd : I thing Workday does -- again, my sense of Workday is they do a decent job in upmarket HCM where they can divorce the HCM buyer from the ERP buyer. When the ERP buyer and the HCM buyer are aligned and combined, they're really in a position with no chance, because they don't have much of a financials product. And I know they hyped it and they talk about it and all that, but at the end of the day, they're just not competitive. So for us, the market really is for us to keep moving ahead. It's a lot --  I don't know what our market share must be in cloud financials now, but it must be plus 90%, 92%, 93%, 94%. So yes, do I think we can accelerate? I think the greatest story you can see here is the NetSuite story that we doubled the rate. And if I didn't say enough things about NetSuite, because I'm sure the NetSuite team is listening. Let me say, NetSuite, NetSuite, NetSuite. They have just done a fabulous job and they are doing a fabulous job not just growing internationally, but growing domestically. A lot of this performance in NetSuite is just pure U.S. domestic performance, more salespeople, more industries, micro industries that we build for, better execution. And so between NetSuite and Fusion, we've just had a really good run. I won't tell you everything is perfect, which is really good news. With these numbers, we can do better. We can do better. And I think we're just getting our stride. So I feel very good about it, Heather. Safra Catz : And as Fusion becomes a higher percentage, Fusion ERP is growing so quickly and it becomes a bigger percentage, it just kind of overwhelms everything else. Lawrence Ellison : Yes that's the mix change. I mean that's what you're seeing really in this quarter is the beginning of the fact that our hot rapidly growing products are now bigger than some of those products, again, like Sun SPARC that are in decline. And we kind of cross -- those 2 curves have crossed one another. Fusion is an international product in a lot of countries. And now we've moved NetSuite to a lot of countries. And quite frankly, we haven't really started to get the benefit of that just yet. So that's going to kick in this fiscal year and that will have a big impact. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Phil Winslow, Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow : Congrats on a great finish to the year. A lot of time has been spent on platform and applications. I wanted to focus on infrastructure and hope you can give us an update on just what you're seeing on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure too. What's the feedback from customers? How do we think about sort of where we are in the adoption life cycle? And then one question I get from investors is how should we think about OCI 2 relative to the announcement with Microsoft, if there is any sort of impact there? Lawrence Ellison : Well, OCI 2, we have 2 infrastructure products. We had what we now call OCI Classic, which really is frozen and we're moving all of our customers -- almost moved all of our customers to our Gen 2 Cloud. Our Gen 2 Cloud is dramatically better, I think, not only than our Gen 1 Cloud, but other people's, the existing clouds. We have -- without going through a lot on this, we have an architecture where we have 2 separate computers in each computer that you rent, if you will. And we have the Intel computer that you rent and then we have another processor with separate memory that has all of our cloud control code. So that's very different than Amazon or Google or Azure as an architecture. That's true with every single computer in our Gen 2 Cloud is really 2 computers, the one that the customer uses and another one that we use to manage the cloud and encrypt the data and encapsulate the messaging and virtualize the messaging and do all of that. The -- it's impossible for a cloud customer to get at our code and hack it. And it's also impossible for our programmers to look at our customers' data. So we did this. We redid our architecture, because we decided that existing architectures, infrastructure architectures had just too many vulnerabilities. And so we bit the bullet, said, okay, we're going to freeze OCI Classic, we're going to invest in Gen 2 that gives us this much more secure, much more reliable platform. And in fact, it'll be much faster. It's also much faster. We have much faster networking, I'm not going into all of that. But this is a huge differentiator between us and everybody else. And customers are beginning to see that. They are beginning to understand the architectural differences. A lot of the world security agencies are now coming to us and saying, hey, this looks really good, we're going to go with this, not Amazon or somebody else because of these architectural distinctions. Also, a bunch of people are running high-performance workloads on our cloud. We have a much fancier network. We have RDMA capability built into our network that the other guys don't have. That's because we redid that. We didn't have it in Gen 1, we have it in Gen 2. It allows us to run large machine learning workloads, rendering, simulations, all sorts of high-performance computing way better than our competitors. So there are a bunch of applications we just do better and people are beginning to notice and they are beginning to move and buy. Operator : And our final question for today comes from Raimo Lenschow, Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : I wanted to go back to NetSuite strength, Mark, and you talked already a lot about it in terms of geographic and going deep into industry. But I just wanted to see like how sustainable is that? So where are we in that innings in terms of going against certain countries or going against certain industries? Like is that kind of where the initial investment is coming through now and then we are done? Or are we on the beginning of a journey here? Mark Hurd : First, Raimo, I think one thing that I'll add to Larry's Gen 2 point is customers love Gen 2. And it's got a great thing, it works really well. It's reliable. It scales. We're hiring people in our engineering group, continuing to expand. And so just to add to Phil's point, I mean, it is very well received by our sales force, our field and it's been fantastic. On NetSuite, yes, we're just at the beginning. To Larry's point, we really haven't seen the acceleration internationally that we've seen domestically. So we are adding salespeople internationally. We've done that. We've got some more to do. So there is growth there. We are adding more countries. There is more to do there. And we are adding what we call sweet success, which is where we take an industry -- not even an industry, a micro industry. So instead of taking retail, we would take retail bookstores and campus bookstores and universities, and we would refine the solution for campus bookstores and then put a consulting offer around it that we would deliver, so it's a complete one-stop shop for the customer. And we're continuing to build those out. So we've increased R&D yet again to do more of those, increased our sales force yet again to get after more customers. And our expectation is that we continue to drive significant growth in NetSuite. Ken Bond : Okay. Thank you, Mark. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department for any follow-up questions from the call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Holly for closing. Operator : Thank you, and thank you for joining today's Oracle Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Ken Bond : Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on short notice. Welcome to Oracle's first quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations' website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and thank you, all, for joining us on such very short notice. Of course September 11th is an important day for our country and for us at Oracle. Many of you know that we lost 11 of our employees and many friends that day and we honor all the victims today and every day. May their memories be a blessing to all of us. We originally planned to hold this call tomorrow. However, as Mark will be taking a leave of absence for health-related reasons, we felt it made sense to share all of our news at once. Mark was extremely engaged with the business through the end of the quarter, but now he needs to focus on his health and taking care of himself. As the three of us have always worked as a team on managing Oracle, Larry and I will cover Mark's responsibilities during his absence with support from the rest of our strong management team. Now, switching to the first quarter, I will review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. And though the effects of the currency movements in Q1 were modestly more than expected with a 1.3% headwind to total revenues and $0.01 headwind to earnings per share, both results were in line with my guidance range. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 4% and accounting for nearly three quarters of total company revenues and most of all of this revenue is recurring. Cloud and On-Premise License revenues were $812 million, down 6% coming off 15% license growth last quarter. And as a reminder, because Q1 is normally our smallest quarter, we tend to see more volatility in new software license growth rates in Q1. In terms of ecosystems, GAAP applications ecosystem revenues were $2.8 billion, up 3% with Fusion apps up nearly 40% including Fusion ERP, up mid-40s and Fusion HCM up low 30s. NetSuite ERP was up in the mid-20s. Vertical SaaS was up high single-digits while Data Cloud was down in the low teens. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is now recurring. GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $4.8 billion, up 3% with total database revenue up similarly highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up triple digits, but also small base for now. On a trailing 12-month basis, more than three quarters of our infrastructure ecosystem is now recurring. In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong results in Latin America and Asia Pacific. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%. And as we continue to scale and grow, I expect our cloud gross margins will go higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth. Total revenues for the quarter were $9.2 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 4% from last year; and the operating margin was 42%, up from 41% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 9.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% and EPS was US$0.81 and up 16% in constant dollar and 14% in US$. The GAAP tax rate was 13.9% and GAAP EPS was US$0.63 and up 13% in constant currency and 11% in US$. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last four quarters, capital expenditures were $1.7 billion and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $36 billion in cash and marketable securities and the short-term deferred revenue balance is $10.9 billion. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 89 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 611 million shares for a total of $31 billion. And over the last five years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $15 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currencies. Assuming, current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative on EPS. Of course, that could change. So, for Q2, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from 0% to 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.88 and $0.90 in constant currency. And assuming the $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in U.S. dollars is expected to grow between 9% and 11% and be between US$0.87 and US$0.89. For fiscal 2020 and the third consecutive fiscal quarter, I expect that we will report double-digit EPS growth in constant currency. Total CapEx for fiscal year 2020 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move a little depending on our bookings, and how much we need to invest to accommodate them. My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal 2020 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020. I'm turning the call over to Larry for his comments, who will spend a little time highlighting some of the key wins we had during the quarter with emphasis on back-office applications, and then talk about autonomous database. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. As you're already aware, our back-office applications business has been reporting excellent growth for a number of quarters now. And we have a massive opportunity ahead of us in both ERP and HCM. Not only do we have an enormous installed base of existing ERP and HCM customers, who can operate to the cloud, but more than half of the current ERP and HCM market is served by companies, who have no SaaS upgrade path. These companies products are vulnerable to being replaced, and we're in the process of replacing them. Our investments in Fusion has not only enabled our strong back-office results over the last few years, but they've positioned us to become not just the biggest back-office player in the cloud, which we already are but the biggest back-office player period. Cloud on-premises all of it. So with that, here are some key Fusion ERP wins from Q1. DP World, Shaw Communications, Bangkok Bank of Thailand, who's upgrading their e-business suite with our Fusion Financials Cloud Service and our Fusion Financial Enterprise Performance Management, Envision Healthcare where we beat Workday and we're replacing Envision Healthcare's legacy system, which is an Infor Lawson system. Express Scripts who's in the process of migrating from Hyperion on-premise to the Fusion EPM in the cloud this is their first cloud application. Lyft who's operating a portion of their ERP system that was \u2013 started out as NetSuite but is now Fusion as they plan for growth going forward. Media newsroom another competitive win against Workday. National Oilwell Varco in a nice expansion both their EPM and supply chain management that we closed last year. So they're just \u2013 they're adding more products, they're adding \u2013 adding more of our overall Fusion suite. NGL Energy Partners has also bought our Fusion ERP suite and supply chain management. Penn National Gaming is an online gaming company and that was a competitive win against the unnamed German company located at a town called Waldorf. Standard Group Limited a large garment manufacturer where we beat that same Waldorf German Company. Southern Company is a utility that was running E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft E-Business Suite Financials and PeopleSoft HCM and they're moving to the Fusion Cloud suite overall Financials HCM everything. Continuing, we've got some great \u2013 some great additional just HCM wins. BAE Systems chose Fusion HCM to upgrade their HR technology and standardize on the cloud. Dubai Holdings where we're expanding our relationship by adding both Fusion HCM and Taleo for recruiting. Envision Healthcare is adding infusion HCM to the already-purchased Fusion ERP suite. A very large transportation entity in the U.K. an airport who is a long-term E-Business Suite customer is moving from on-premise to the Fusion suite in the cloud. Here's a company everyone's always heard of and probably has visited many times McDonald's. McDonald's chose our HCM. They chose our payroll. And they -- this was a battle between us and Workday. We won. And we're displacing their on-premise legacy system. Nestle; Southwest Gas where we're displacing SAP and we beat Workday, as Southwest Gas decided to move from SAP on-premise to the cloud and they picked us. The University of Texas and we're actually engaged with them on not only providing cloud technology, but also consulting support to migrate them from PeopleSoft on-premise to the Fusion HCM in the cloud. And it's just not a bunch of customer wins that marks our success. Industry analysts including IDC are taking notice as they survey their customers. In the 2019 SaaS/PaaS survey that IDC released in May of 2019, it surveyed over 1,500 of their SaaS customers on their experience with all SaaS vendors including Oracle, SAP, Salesforce, Workday, Microsoft all of them. Oracle SaaS had the highest rating among all SaaS vendor survey period. So you can see we're at the beginning of a back-office upgrade cycle that will benefit our applications ecosystem for years to come. We're already overwhelmingly the largest ERP system in the cloud. And again, it won't be long before we're just the largest ERP supplier period. The second area I'd like to talk about is the Autonomous Database, because we think this is a game changer. All right game changer interesting term. It sounds like a clich\u00e9 a little bit of marketing hype. Let me explain how important this is. Autonomous technology is the key element that differentiates a second-generation cloud from a first-generation cloud. Now in the first-generation cloud, your real benefit was you were going to rent computers and you only pay for what you use. And the benefit of a second generation -- and not so great benefit, obviously the first-generation cloud pay for what you use when you use it. Second-generation cloud, not only do we deliver the benefits of pay per use, we also take the human labor out of running the cloud. That's an even bigger economic savings. Sharing computers and renting computers is not as costly as paying for the labor to run those computers. So from an economic advantage, a second-generation autonomous cloud is much less expensive to run than a first-generation cloud. But that's not what's really important. What's really important is the second-generation autonomous cloud prevents data theft, which you can never do in a first-generation manual cloud. Let me point out how reasonable Amazon was when they refused to accept responsibility for the configuration errors made by the people at Capital One. They have a policy so you have control of your data. You have control of your system. You are responsible for running your system. And if you make mistakes, it's on you, it's not on us. That is not an unreasonable position. When you have a totally manual system and your users are responsible for configuring the system, when your users are responsible for backing the system up, when your users are responsible for encrypting the data, when your users are responsible for patching the systems, user errors can lead to catastrophic results. In a manual system, there's no way to prevent that. In an autonomous system, the Capital One data breach could never have happened, because the Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't let a human being configure the system, it configures itself automatically. The Oracle Autonomous Database system doesn't ask human beings to patch it to close security holes. The system automatically patches itself while running. The Oracle Database doesn't ask if you want to back it up or if you want to encrypt your data, it does all of this automatically while it's running. The only way you can prevent data theft is to eliminate human error. The only way you can do that was with an Autonomous Database and we have one and our competitors don't. This is a very big deal. What's the greatest thing about autonomous driving? I was looking forward to autonomous driving. Then they've seen the threat to Uber and all this other stuff. But okay, that's all interesting. The greatest thing about autonomous driving, it's going to reduce human pilot error and cut down on accidents by 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%. It's going to save lives. It's going to stop, come close to eliminating pilot error. The Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle self-driving database prevents users from making catastrophic mistakes resulting in data loss. And there is no way to do it in a manual cloud, end of story. That's what I mean by game changer. You want to prevent data theft, you better be prepared to pay less, because we take the labor out, huge cost savings and there are no human beings involved and they can't make those common mistakes. All right. So we're still early on in the Autonomous Database in terms of -- it's only been around -- we announced it in Open World 2017 two years ago and really showed up in 2018 and now we're beginning to get some traction with this exciting new technology. It's proving to be the most exciting and successful new product offering in the history of our company. So here -- I got it. I'm sorry, am I missing? I'm curious \u2013 sorry, I got it. All right. So here's some recent data. In Q1, we added more than 3,700 new Autonomous Database trials. We now have over 2,000 customers, paying customers for the autonomous database. We're seeing incredible pull-through with the autonomous database. And you come to Oracle -- the Oracle Cloud to use the Autonomous Database and then you use a variety of other services. About 45% of the people who are using Autonomous Database are also using our Oracle Analytics Cloud. By the way they're also using Microsoft analytics, they're using Cognos, they're using a variety of other tools. But primarily, they're using Oracle Analytics. We've added many customers to Autonomous Database that weren't Oracle customers at all. 13% of the people using Autonomous Database had never bought a database from Oracle Corporation. 43% of the workloads that are going on to Autonomous Database are net new. They're not moving them from on-premise to the Autonomous Database, but half of them move from on-premise to Autonomous Database. Almost the other half 43% are just net new applications. We've had some fabulous wins in the quarter. Obviously, I'm not going to mention all it. We have over 500 wins, Autonomous Database wins in the quarter. I'm not going to mention all 500. But 7-Eleven is moving all their point-of-sale data to the Autonomous Data warehouse Cargojet Canada, Johnson Controls, LATAM Airlines is moving their on-premise data centers to OCI to get the advantage and security of the Autonomous Database. Siemens Energy, Stanley Black & Decker getting much faster data reporting on their analytics. Oh yeah, and one more company moving to the Autonomous Database is Uber. And with that, let's turn it back to the operator. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Holly before we go to the Q&A, just a couple of clarifications, because I had a couple of e-mails on this. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.8%. And then for fiscal year 2020, we expect for the full year, this will be our third consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. With that, Holly, why don't we turn up to Q&A? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John DiFucci Jefferies. John DiFucci : Thank you. I'm sure I speak for everyone just to briefly say that our thoughts and prayers are with Mark and his family at this time. But also knowing Mark for years, I'm sure he'd like us to sort of get back to business, so I'll move right to question here. So, there was -- Cloud Services and License Support was strong this quarter, but License was not as strong as we modeled it anyway. And I realize it's a seasonally slow first quarter and you said it follows the strongest and yes really strong fourth quarter as strong as we've seen in quite some time. But is there anything else you can share on that line, any further color? For instance, BYOL has got a lot of traction right? And could that cause your financials just to start to trend more seasonally sort of like it used to? I mean it started to get a little more even it's still seasonal, but a little more even. Should we be starting to think of seasonality how Oracle used to be even more seasonal, or we're also hearing you guys you hear it too you hear from some other companies that talk about macro pressure. Are you seeing any of that at all? I'm just curious any color would be helpful. Safra Catz : Sure. That's easy John. It was actually something very, very simple. First of all, outside of North America, our license was up, up quite a bit in fact internationally. What we had done in North America is we did do a split in the salesforce. We've been telegraphing that we were doing that before we split the North America tech salesforce between selling cloud -- a group selling cloud; and a group selling new licenses. So, the group selling new license was a new group and so I expect that they will more than recover during the year. But that is the only -- that's the only weakness we had and it was simply just a slow start as we reorged the North America tech sales force since we split it. So, there's no macro issue. There's no actual regular issue. And of course the thing is that in Q1, small numbers make a big difference and so they just kind of outsized. But no we don't see anything and that's really all it was. John DiFucci : Okay. That's really -- that's helpful Safra and that makes sense and sort of we're hearing things about that and just a quick follow-up maybe for Larry. Larry last quarter you had really strong results in the database options and most especially the ones related to the Autonomous Database. I'm just curious in this quarter, again, a seasonally softer first quarter, but can you talk about the options themselves? And I'm thinking more about things like -- my favorite is multi-tenancy, but there's others that are important too. Larry Ellison : I think multi-tenancy in memory all of the database options that are used with the Autonomous Database I think are selling very, very well. Again the reorg in North America had a great impact on that because those are license sales and then they bring those licenses to the cloud. So, people buy multi-tenant. They buy rack. They buy in memory. They then pick up those options and their existing licenses up and they move them to the cloud. So, some of those sales were delayed because of the reorg, but we think the demand is enormous. And we think the leading indicator is just the number of trials we've signed up in Q1. So, our cloud salesforce in terms of the cloud activity, we had incredible cloud activity. And we expect -- again we signed more than 500 deals Autonomous Database deals in Q1. 3700 new trials the 500 signed paying customers more of them and we expect to double that in Q2. So, we expect to go from well over 1,000 paying customers and that pipeline to just start building. That is the best early indicator. And that will drive not only cloud revenue, but also license revenue because of the options. Ken Bond : Next question, please. John DiFucci : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much. I'll start just by echoing John's sentiment and wish Mark a very speedy recovery. But getting on with business, I wanted to dig in a little bit to the great momentum that you're seeing in cloud ERP? And you gave a lot of color Larry in your comments, but perhaps if you can help us understand what the demand patterns look like amongst existing customers migrating versus new logo business that you're able to attract. And as well, that market has always been a fragmented market. And is there any evidence that you might be benefiting from consolidation finally in ERP which has so many players that's in the long tail? Thank you. Larry Ellison : Well, I think -- let me talk about some of the easiest consolidations. We're picking on Lawson. We actually have sales territories which are Lawson Healthcare sales territories. So, we go out there -- the Lawson Healthcare customers and we've rolled up a bunch of those. I'd say about one-third of their customers of Lawson Healthcare customers are in our pipeline, either already converted or in our pipeline. So, we expect to win all of those. We've just added some new sales territories which are Lawson retail territories, which is a combination of our Fusion Financials and our retail merchandising products. And we think that's also a very vulnerable company that Infor really -- well they tried. A lot of people have tried to build cloud systems. It's not easy. I can attest to that. I have lots of scars. But I mean Fusion took 10 years to get going. I mean, it's a big deal. And NetSuite that overnight success took 20 -- been in business over 20 years. Salesforce has been in business over 20 years. It takes a while to build these very complicated systems. And Lawson doesn't really have anything. So we're taking a bunch of their customers. But the one that's extraordinary is that SAP really does not have a true cloud system. SAP is doing some hosting. They don't have a true cloud system. And now we're seeing kind of some of their larger -- not the very largest companies, but some of their medium large companies, go ahead and pick us and we're converting them. But we are in conversations with their very largest -- SAP's very, very largest customers. We're in the middle of converting one of their very, very largest customers. And we think that of course is the huge opportunity. We think we -- right now Oracle and SAP has about half the European market. I'm sorry; it's a very long answer. We have about half -- the two of us have about half of the European market. And the other half of the European market as you say highly fragmented. We started out by targeting the highly fragmented guys who are really weak and vulnerable, but we think the opportunity exists to roll it all up. If you look at our market -- I mean I'm almost afraid to mention what our market share in ERP and the cloud is. What is it, 95%? Safra Catz : A lot. Larry Ellison : I mean, I don't know. I mean just, I'm guessing, but I don't know because I don't know of any other cloud ERP system other than NetSuite and Fusion, so maybe 95% is low. I mean, it sound a little crazy. But SAP really did not rewrite their code. They really don't have a cloud system. And we have an opportunity to go after them and just put that aside and then that whole other half of the ERP marketplace which is companies that a lot of people have never heard of. And yes, I think we can consolidate virtually all of that. I mean, I don't know how to describe it. It's a crazy opportunity. You don't see this happen very often. Ken Bond : Next question, please. Brad Zelnick : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow, Wells Fargo. Phil Winslow : Hey, thanks for taking my question and I just wanted to echo Mark just wishing you the speediest recovery and all the best. And to the team, congrats on a solid start to the year. I just wanted to follow up on John's question on the database. One of the questions I get from investors is sort of the trajectory of database because obviously we're getting some metrics from you guys, that's showing an inflection in terms of customers, also just trials out there. How do you think about just I guess the shape of the curve of database growth going forward with all these different levers? Larry Ellison : Okay. Well, because the growth rate is so extraordinary, we don't -- we're not forecasting it. I mean, when Safra gives you a forecast, she's not forecasting some -- this incredibly steep growth curve in Autonomous Database. So, we're giving you, I would say a conservative point of view especially in terms of Autonomous Database. And \u2013 but again, this is the case where we have a technology that nobody else has, A, we are the dominant database supplier on the planet right now. We're bigger than IBM and Microsoft combined. In the previous battles, in the previous war on-premise, we were bigger than Microsoft and IBM combined our two biggest competitors. The cloud based \u2013 there are a bunch of open source cloud databases and there is a lot of more specialized, I mean there are probably a dozen of them, or more for that matter. But none of them are autonomous. None of them are secure. None of them task themselves, while running. None of them give you 99.995% availability. I mean, they're \u2013 we're 100 times more reliable. I mean seriously a 100x more reliable than these guys. We have the only system that we can pretty much ensure that your data can't be stolen, because you're \u2013 because you can't make pilot errors. You can't commit \u2013 you can't make mistakes, because all that's \u2013 all of those decisions are automated. So, it's another \u2013 I mean, so we're sitting in two markets that we have an opportunity of completely dominating and owning. One is ERP, where we've been in it for a while and you actually can see the data \u2013 you can actually see the curve and the curve \u2013 and the curves \u2013 the curve we have enough years of data that you can see the slope of the curve and you can do these market share studies. There are always analyst reports and all that. And we've made great progress in that and you can see it. In the Autonomous Database, all you can do is listen to me talk about this extraordinary technology. And we're so early on in the curve we've got such little data in the curve. I understand \u2013 and even we're playing let's wait and see what this turns out to be. But we have this gigantic installed base that's I think going to go with Autonomous Database. But it's not just that it's not safe to go to any other database. That's a pretty good differentiator. And it's our second extraordinary opportunity. ERP back-office in the cloud, Autonomous Database in the cloud, we're successful in those two markets, should be enough to make a living. Phil Winslow : Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you so much. And again, I'm going to echo everyone's thoughts for Mark and thoughts with him and his family. Just wanted to ask two quick questions. One, if I could, Safra I know John DiFucci asked some questions about the environment. You talked about the North American sales reorg. I was wondering, just you've seen a lot of results since August, early August come in where maybe results haven't been as good as people wide. I'm just wondering if you're seeing \u2013 if you saw any elongation in the sales cycles, if there's anything you can share with us there just globally from what you've been seeing. And then secondly, just a question related to OCI and \u2013 I know obviously Open World's next week. There'll be a lot of partners to talk to. But a lot of the partners we've been speaking to of late have talked about a real pickup in momentum there. And just wondering, if you can share with us what you're seeing? Thank you. Safra Catz : Sure. Actually, we feel like we've got a lot of momentum here at Oracle. The issue regarding markets either abroad, or in the United States we're not seeing it. The \u2013 we're on very, very positive momentum from a product cycle point of view. Our Fusion products are basically killing it. That's doing amazingly. Autonomous Database and the whole OCI is so compelling. And we are on the field, and we are expanding globally that we have just so much good news happening around the world that we're not seeing the weaknesses. And so to the extent that there are, we just have a lot of company, product, momentum, ourselves, I know that I will not be able to hold Larry back from answering your second question. So I'm just unleashing him in advance of Open World. Go ahead Larry. Larry Ellison : Okay. So next week at Open World, we're going to be talking about \u2013 we started with Autonomous Database in 2018. We continued to make improvements there and speeding it up. And \u2013 but we're not at Autonomous Database. At Open World, we'll be announcing a whole bunch of new autonomous services. No one is doing this. But we're not talking about Autonomous Database. So you're going to see a bunch of arguments where we take that same machine learning technology to develop other autonomous services. And we're on our way. I mean, it's our goal to deliver the world's first and only completely autonomous cloud, the most important thing in keeping your data sites. But we'd like -- I mean, you really should have an autonomous operating system. You should have a bunch of autonomous services in that to operate that cloud, so human beings aren't given the opportunity to make mistakes and people can concentrate on building applications rather than managing the plumbing of the cloud, which is complicated and error prone and expensive. So we want to take -- get rid of the expense, get rid of the errors. Starting with Autonomous Database, you'll see a bunch more announcements of new autonomous services in OCI. And OCI is definitely on a roll. If people come to look at Autonomous Database, they look around in the Oracle Cloud and they see our analytics, our compute I can talk about all these other things, but we have -- we really have a second-generation cloud that's highly differentiated from our friends in Amazon or Google. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Ken Bond : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler, Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much for taking question. Again, I echo everyone else. Please tell Mark that our thoughts are with him and his family. Larry, Safra given autonomous adoption commentary how good it's going, can you give us some more color based off this quarter on how the revenue lift is occurring as customers moving to the Autonomous Database based on what you're seeing in sales that is going now, how that's trending? And any sense to how to think about how large Autonomous Database revenue is, any color would be appreciated? Larry Ellison : Well, our approach, I mean, sometimes they're critical of Amazon. Sometimes I'm just -- I try to learn from what they do. I mean they were the innovator in cloud and I give them credit for that. And I think the strategy of land and expand, which is what Amazon has used in marketing their products, so you get in for one project and you're successful on that project, then you go to the next project, it's been very different than the way Oracle has been selling in the past. We have adopted with Autonomous Database. We've adopted that land start small, get in there on a project just demonstrates how great this technology is and then get another project and another project after that. So we've adopted this land-and-expand approach. And we have many examples where people have been successful in their first projects and have moved on to two more moved on to -- then moved on to 10 more after that, so we see -- again, the opportunity is gigantic. The fact that we have four -- that we added 4,000 -- almost 4,000 trials, short of 4,000 trials in Q1 is an example of how we're really getting traction now and the word is getting out about how good the Autonomous Database is, how big is it as an overall market. Safra Catz : It's brilliant. The reality is that most of our customers have been waiting for us. They've not brought those critical large and security-conscious workloads. They've not brought them to the cloud so far. They didn't bring them to the other vendors. The other vendors are all actually having trouble in the enterprise with these important workloads. They have been waiting for us. And so as they've started to bring smaller workloads in, they can start quite small. And then their next buy is 10 times the size and the opportunities often 1,000 times the size. And that's what we're starting to see. How long will it take? I don't know. We're not -- we're trying to just go with it. You have to understand that many of these can also go just pay as you go, they're never forecasted. A customer just tries it and before you know it it's expanding. The opportunity is literally enormous, because many of these workloads, they can't go to the cloud any other way. Those that have tried have been either unsuccessful or it's been both expensive and risk their security situation. So this is a very, very powerful moment for us. We're not going to overplay it here. We're just going to ride along with it. You're going to hear at Open World from some of these customers. And it's very much like originally, when we start to talk to you about our Engineered Systems, where a customer would try a little bit, they'll try one a quarter. And before you know it, they had dozens and they grew. Now this is the next level for those critical workloads that only can work in our cloud. Mark Moerdler : Thank you. Appreciate it. Ken Bond : Next question, please. Operator : And our last question for today is going to come from the line of Raimo Lenschow, Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, let me echo as well all our prayers are with Mark and his family. Just going back, I have two quick questions, one number question, which was on deferred Safra, in theory that should grow, can you just maybe talk a little bit about why that declined this quarter? But then the bigger question was more for me around ERP. Larry you talked about like you saw some medium-sized SAP customers starting to look. And is it -- kind of in terms of going bigger, is it kind of a question of functionality and capability or more around referenceability? Because if I look at your -- you just deleveraged full quarter's numbers. You closed the quarter in 11, 12 days and were able to deliver that, which is kind of a record I've seen. And you guys are using Oracle Fusion. So it's really power -- it seems like a very powerful solution. So I'm just wondering what's holding it back at this point. Thank you. Safra Catz : Well, first, I'd like to thank you for noticing the amazing close we did on Fusion Financials and we actually -- I got to tell you the team, I think is pretty happy with this result and realize that all of our customers should be easily doing the same thing. So, first, yes, this was a very quick close, but we've got the technology and the people to do it. Let me just answer your deferred revenue comment. So I just want you to understand gross deferred revenue is actually up 3%, okay? But we net it to a bunch of things that ultimately are simply timing changes related to collections. And so that's really the only thing. There's nothing unusual next quarter you may see something different. It's literally a matter of when we pay some things and that kind of shows up in the operating cash flow. But in deferred revenue, it's simply timing of collections. There's a little bit impacted by currency, but the gross deferred revenue number is actually up 3%. It's just netted down and it's just a matter of the timing of our collections, so nothing to see here. Larry Ellison : Okay. The question about SAP, what are our big SAP customers waiting for before they make a decision to move to Oracle. It's been very interesting. We've -- I've spent a lot of time in Germany and talking to some customers and they want to move. I mean, I talked to several very large customers saying, we'd like to move to the cloud. We'd like to move to Fusion. Because I mean some of the -- I mean, moving to another SAP system -- and I mean some of these guys are facing bills of $1 billion to migrate -- for this SAP upgrade all of the consultants. So I mean, it's a big pill to swallow to do the upgrade HANA, what they call S/4HANA in the cloud except, it's not really a cloud. Safra Catz : And for no benefit. Larry Ellison : And for virtually, it's the same code you had before. It really is pretty much the same code you had before. So the customers really want to do it. What they're waiting for is one really large customer who's already done it. They are worried. They don't want to be first. No one wants -- none of these big -- these customers are conservative. They don't want to be first. We are in the middle of one of their largest customers converting them to Fusion. And as soon as we can talk about that publicly and use that as a reference, which will be probably will take another six months before we can do that, maybe less. But that's close, it's pretty close before they're live and several of their divisions are on Fusion. Almost every business leader I talk to in Germany wants to make the migration they just have to be assured that it will work. Now we're going to get -- we've won some deals in the high and at mid-market against SAP incumbents, and they're in the process of converting. And if we can get them converted much faster and get them live much faster then we can this one jumped in this one of the largest enterprises on earth that we're converting. But as we get a few of these references, we think people -- customers want to use modern technology, they want to move to the cloud. And we can -- they can do that with Fusion and they cannot do it with SAP. So we think it's a huge opportunity for us, but we have to have a core of references before these big guys are going to move. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. Thank you. That's very clear. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. A telephonic replay of this conference call would be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today on short notice. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Holly for closing. Operator : Thank you for joining us for today's Oracle first quarter 2020 conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. But before I start, I\u2019d like to acknowledge and thank you all for the many, many sincere condolences we received upon Mark\u2019s passing. Thank you. They mean a lot to us. As you can see, we had another solid quarter. This quarter, we finished with total revenue growth within my guidance range and EPS at the high-end. Cloud Services and License Support continue to see material growth, and given that it represents more than 70% of our total revenue, it more than offsets declines in some smaller non-strategic businesses. We continue to be encouraged that our overall revenue growth will further accelerate, as we reach the final stages of this ongoing shift in business mix. Of late, I\u2019ve been spending much more time with customers. The overriding theme I hear is the compelling nature of our technology and how it is critical to the success of their businesses : feature-rich, simple, secure, performant and priced right. They see Oracle as being strategic to their ongoing operations, and they tell me repeatedly that Oracle is the right partner to run their mission-critical assets, both in the cloud and on-premise. Their comments reinforce our conviction that our product strategy is right. At Oracle, we\u2019ve upgraded our internal systems to the cloud, and we are sharing our experience with customers by describing the stunning benefits and efficiencies that can be realized from the move and know we have thousands of customers and references, our own experience, adopting Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure allows us to serve as a unique and knowledgeable adviser to customers who want to know how to go about their own digital transformation. To give you some context, let me share just a few of the many benefits we are seeing in our business. With Fusion ERP Cloud, we are now able to close our books and report earnings in 12 days or less. Many companies don\u2019t report their results for weeks. And not only can we get our results out faster, but we\u2019ve saved money, too. By using the AI and processes in Fusion ERP Cloud, we have been able to eliminate more than 30% of our manual accounting activities. And enabled by Fusion HCM Cloud, we have seen employee satisfaction levels soar with all-time high rates for things like hiring and onboarding new employees. We\u2019ve also made it easier for our managers and employees, as Fusion HCM reduces the time needed to complete the talent review process by more than 70%. And separately, we\u2019re saving more than 20,000 hours of manager time each year with our accelerated job offer process. In sales, we\u2019re using our front-office cloud platform, augmented with machine learning and our own Data Cloud to help our salespeople sell more and sell more quickly. With Marketing Cloud, campaign planning now takes days rather than weeks. And with built-in machine learning, we\u2019ve seen a doubling in lead conversion. We automatically capture millions of activities in Sales Cloud each year. And with CPQ Cloud, ordering is much faster and easier, with over 70% of our transactions fully automated. We needed that to handle the increased volumes of transactions as a result of our customers move to the cloud. In addition, we\u2019ve adopted the Gen2 Infrastructure, including Autonomous Database for our custom apps. Our internal IT costs to run these systems are down by millions, while at the same time, we are adopting more than 100 new features each quarter. Here at Oracle, we are going to continue using our own cloud technology as an intelligent automation engine and continue to simplify our business model and processes. In turn, I expect that our revenue growth rates will increase and see even more expense efficiencies. And as a result, I expect that you will see us expand our margins and grow EPS double digits for the foreseeable future. Now on to the numbers. I\u2019ll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. Currency Q \u2013 for Q2 was largely in line with my guidance at nearly 1%, and the fact that the growth rates look the same in a few categories is simply because of rounding. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3%, accounting for over 70% of total company revenues and most of this is recurring revenue. Cloud and on-premise license revenues were $1.1 billion, down 7%, as more of our GBU customers order cloud instead of license. In terms of ecosystem, GAAP application ecosystem revenues were $2.9 billion, up 4%, with Fusion apps up in the low-30%s, including Fusion ERP up 38% and Fusion HCM up 23%. NetSuite ERP was up 28%. Vertical SaaS was up low double digits, while Data Cloud stabilized. On a trailing 12 months basis, more than 90% of our application ecosystem revenue is recurring. GAAP infrastructure ecosystem revenues were $5 billion, up 1%, with total database revenue up 1%, highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues, both up over 200%. But off a small base for now, on a trailing 12-month basis, more than three quarters of our infrastructure ecosystem revenue is recurring. Just a few days ago, we were able to get our first Gen2 Exadata Cloud@Customer fully deployed and connected. It was done in just four days. Previously, with our Gen1 architecture, this typically took significantly longer. As a result, we are very optimistic about the impact our Gen2 Cloud@Customer will have on our business. No other cloud provider has the right technology to actually do this. In terms of geographies, we saw double-digit revenue growth in SaaS revenue in all regions except EMEA, with especially strong results in Latin America and Japan. Gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 85%, down slightly from last quarter due to accelerated investments in our Gen2 Cloud to address higher demand worldwide. As we get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will grow higher, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth. By the way, our strategic hardware products delivered on-premise, which includes Exadata, grew double digits for the quarter, once again showing that our installed base of customers focused on our world-leading database platform continues to grow. Total revenue for the quarter were $9.6 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4 billion, essentially unchanged from last year and operating margin was 42%, down from 43% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% and EPS was $0.90 in USD, up 13% in constant currency and 12% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 17.7% and GAAP EPS was $0.69 in USD, up 15% in constant currency, 14% in USD. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.8 billion. Over the last four quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $12.2 billion. We now have approximately $27 billion in cash and marketable securities and short-term net deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Also, the prior year deferred balance was affected by our transition to ASC 606. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3%, if not for the ASC 606 transition changes. We remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 91 million shares for a total of $5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve repurchased nearly 500 million shares for a total of $26 billion. And over the last five years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 25%. The Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency, assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should have a 1% negative effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS. So for Q3, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency and assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in USD. Now I realize that my USD and constant currency revenue guidance sound like they\u2019re the same number, but it\u2019s just rounding similar to our revenue growth this quarter. I do expect a currency impact of 1% \u2013 of nearly 1%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 10% to 12% and be between $0.96 and $0.98 in constant currency. And assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 9% and 11% and between \u2013 and be between $0.95 and $0.97 in USD. Total CapEx for fiscal year 2020 is expected to be around $2.2 billion, but it could move higher based on demand for data center growth. My EPS guidance for Q2 and fiscal year 2020 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for those one-time tax benefits \u2013 the tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% in fiscal year 2020. And finally, for fiscal year 2020, I continue to expect that in constant currency, total revenue will grow faster than last year and that we will report double-digit EPS growth for the year. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Safra. As I\u2019ve said before, there are two key product areas that will determine Oracle\u2019s future in the cloud, Cloud ERP Applications and the Autonomous Database. Being the clear number one in both of these two giant applications and infrastructure market segments, we\u2019ll enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments. This is already happening in applications. We have a huge lead in Cloud ERP, with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 20,000 NetSuite ERP customers. Our closest Cloud ERP competitors, Workday, and they claim to have a few 100 ERP customers. Workday\u2019s lack of success in Cloud ERP is creating opportunities for Oracle in Cloud HCM. More and more, we\u2019re seeing HCM as being purchased as a part of an ERP cloud application suite. As a result, today, we have more HCM customers than Workday. And we\u2019re beginning to see that same integrated suite strategy beginning to drive our sales of CX customer experience applications in sales and service and in marketing. SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. As a result, SAP\u2019s installed base is very vulnerable. We\u2019ve already replaced and successfully migrated many midsized SAP customers from SAP to Fusion ERP. Importantly, a few months from now, in Q1 calendar year 2020, one of SAP\u2019s biggest customers will go live on Fusion ERP. Many of SAP\u2019s largest customers are already working with us to develop plans to migrate the Fusion ERP. SAP\u2019s customer base is up for grabs. They didn\u2019t rewrite their applications for the cloud. That has created an enormous opportunity for Oracle. We\u2019re already declared number one in the Cloud ERP market as measured in market share and our Cloud ERP business is already growing at a rate of over 30%. By offering a safe and compelling alternatives to SAP\u2019s old technology, we can increase our applications growth rate far beyond that 30%. We\u2019re very, very comfortable that we will be the overwhelming winner in this generation Cloud ERP business. Now, let\u2019s look at some application wins in the quarter. Advance Publications, a media company, bought ERP, Albertsons got ERP, EPM and supply chain. C.H. Robinson, Worldwide, a transportation company, bought ERP and EPM. DHL Supply Chain, big German company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Edwards Lifesciences, a medical equipment company, bought ERP. By the way, I\u2019m not mentioning any HCM \u2013 associated HCM deals, because I have a separate list for HCM. So a lot of these guys, maybe next quarter, I will put the HCM deals right next to the ERP deal. So you can see, because you\u2019ll \u2013 I\u2019ll be repeating a lot of these names when I get to my HCM list, and that\u2019s the point I made earlier that people are now looking at HCM as just another module that we need in the back-office, very important. Edwards Lifesciences bought ERP. Ferguson, a manufacturing firm, bought ERP and supply chain. Global Companies, big energy firm, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NCR, financial services, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. NETSCOUT, telecommunications company, bought supply chain. Mutual Life Assurance bought ERP and supply chain. Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, big energy company, bought ERP. Technip, another energy company, bought ERP. By the way, SAP is supposed to be very strong in energy. Texas Children\u2019s Healthcare, the hospital bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Unilever bought ERP and supply chain. Baker Hughes, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Carlson Wagonlit Travel services, ERP, EPM and supply chain. Kuwait Petroleum, energy company, bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Liberty Global, communications company, ERP, EPM and supply chain. Manpower, the global services company bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Sherwin-Williams, that\u2019s what they bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. The suite, a lot of people are buying multiple modules, it\u2019s not just ERP, it\u2019s ERP. It\u2019s EPM, Enterprise Performance Management. It\u2019s supply chain. It\u2019s manufacturing. Bank of New York Mellon bought ERP, EPM and supply chain. Airport Terminal Services \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, now I\u2019m on my HCM Group. I\u2019m in the HCM Group, they\u2019re all grouped together. Airport Terminal Services bought HCM. Apparel Bosco Retail, HCM. Banque Saudi Fransi bought HCM. CenterPoint Energy, other energy company, bought HCM. Cummins, manufacturing company, HCM. Graybar Electric bought HCM. Hologic, HCM. HUS at the hospital, both of the hospitals in Finland, run by the federal government in Finland bought HCM. Mountaire Farms, HCM. North Atlantic Refining, again, this is my HCM list, big energy company, an SAP stronghold in the energy sector bought HCM from us. Southern Star Central Gas Pipeline, big gas company, Energy, HCM. Technip, energy company, HCM. Tenet Healthcare bought HCM. Texas Children\u2019s Hospital bought HCM and [indiscernible] brought HCM. Birmingham City Council bought HCM. Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, a big energy bought HCM. MEDNAX Health Care, HCM. Phoenix Life Holdings, HCM. In customer experience, Equinix bought service. Ferguson Enterprises bought service. Ferrari bought sales and marketing. IKYA bought service. Nordstrom bought service. PayPal bought marketing. Rabobank bought service and Santander Bank bought service. Okay, let me move on to the other segment, which is Autonomous Database and Gen2 Infrastructure. In the database market, we are the overwhelming number one, with a combination of a dominant share on-premise and very strong market share in the cloud, though, I have yet to see any good data on database market share in the cloud. Our database business is growing very, very rapidly, because we have an enormous technology advantage in the cloud over all of our competitors with Autonomous Database. Autonomous Database is the world\u2019s only Autonomous Database. What does that mean? That means, when you configure the system, you don\u2019t do anything. The system configures itself. Robots configure the system. The recent Capital One lost all that data at AWS is, because one of the Capital One people made a configuration here. You can\u2019t make configuration errors with the Autonomous Database, because human beings don\u2019t configure the system. A lot of these above the fold headlines of people losing their data are caused by human errors. People forget the patch systems. Remember that one. They patched some, but not all of the systems. And Equifax, Equifax it was a patchy stocks [ph] database, didn\u2019t get patched. They didn\u2019t find them all. Guess what? Autonomous Database automatically patches itself when a security flaw is detected And by the way, they detected that security flow at Equifax. They knew about it. They just didn\u2019t get around to patching. Patching is hard. They have to find all the databases. You had to schedule downtime. You don\u2019t schedule downtime with the Autonomous Database. You can\u2019t see Autonomous Database, while the database is still running. But you don\u2019t capture database. The robots, our robots attach the database. That\u2019s why it\u2019s Autonomous. There\u2019s no human labor. So there\u2019s no human error. So if you are willing to pay less and not have that human labor, you get rid of all those mistakes. This is a gigantic technology advantage, by the way, and we\u2019re ten times faster than anything Amazon apps. That means, we\u2019re much cheaper than anything Amazon has. Much safer, much easier to use, build applications faster. So we already have thousands of Autonomous Database customers running in our Public Cloud. We added 2,000 more this quarter. And our Autonomous business, as Safra said, is growing in excess of 200%, Autonomous Database business off a small base. Admittedly, it\u2019s a relatively new product, but it\u2019s on its way to being the most successful new product introduction in our company\u2019s history. Now this triple-digit growth rate, I expect will spike up dramatically because of another thing Safra just mentioned. Our introduction of our Autonomous Database Cloud@Customer, Gen2 Cloud@Customer. Now, when people can start putting Autonomous Database, they\u2019re already \u2013 I mean, all our Autonomous Database customers, let me be clear, are in our Public Cloud. A lot of our customers, especially those in regulated markets, big banks, people \u2013 government agencies, defense ministries, people have that. They need the Autonomous Database capabilities behind their firewall in their data center. And next \u2013 and over the next few months, we\u2019re rolling out this Autonomous Database Gen2 Cloud@Customer. Now all of our cloud competitors are trying to create these outposts of their cloud on the floor \u2013 on the floors of their customers. We actually have it working. And in fact, we\u2019re in our second-generation of this. We did it early. We did a reasonable first-generation job, but the second time is a charm. And this new Gen2 stuff was \u2013 can be installed in a day. No, the first one we installed in four days. We expect to do that even faster. There\u2019ll be more time spent unpacking the hardware and plugging it in than readying the software, because it just syncs up with our Public Cloud and you\u2019re up and running. This is going to be a huge opportunity for us to dramatically increase the adoption rate on Autonomous Database, very excited about that. The \u2013 okay. The \u2013 when that happens, we think by any measure, we will be not only have the overwhelming market share lead on-prem, but the overwhelming market share lead in the cloud. We expect to hold onto our database franchise in a big way. So it\u2019s interesting that both of our Autonomous Database and our cloud applications are running in our new Gen2 highly secured infrastructure. And by the end of 2020, by the end of next calendar year, this time next year, I\u2019ll be able to say that we have more Gen2 data centers in more countries than Amazon Web Services has data centers period. We\u2019re adding lots and lots of data centers in lots and lots of countries. And, again, we\u2019ll have more data centers in more countries than Amazon by the end \u2013 a year from now, that\u2019s very, very exciting. Now, let\u2019s look at some of our Autonomous Database in Gen2 Infrastructure wins this quarter. Okay. [indiscernible] international big manufacturing firm. Albertson\u2019s, this another \u2013 this is more synergy that I\u2019ve got to mention where people buy our applications. They buy our ERP applications. They also build data warehouses associated with those applications. They do a lot of work. So a lot of our application customers are beginning to be infrastructure \u2013 Autonomous Database customers and infrastructure customers. So, yes, when you buy ERP, you might also by HCM. When you buy ERP, you\u2019re also going to buy the Fusion Data Warehouse, which is an Autonomous Database product and Infrastructure product. You\u2019re going to buy analytics in our Gen2 data center. You\u2019re going to be an infrastructure customer, as well as an application customer and we see a lot of overlap. We often see see people buying suites of applications, ERP, plus HCM, plus sales and things like that. But also applications plus infrastructure. Aon Financial Services. Biogen bought Autonomous Data Warehouse. Cisco Systems, again, Gen2 Infrastructure and Autonomous Data Warehouse. Clearstream services, same thing, Gen2 Infrastructure Autonomous Data Warehouse. Embraer Aviation, the Brazilian airplane \u2013 the aircraft manufacturer, Autonomous Database and Gen2 Infrastructure. Equity Bank of Kenya, Autonomous Database, Gen2 Infrastructure. Fastenal Company, a big distribution company in the United States, Gen2 Infrastructure. Healthcare Services Corp., Gen2 Infrastructure and Autonomous Database. Interact, Gen2 Infrastructure. King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Transaction Processing. The Core University, Autonomous Database, Gen2 Infrastructure. Manchester, Autonomous Database and Gen2 Infrastructure. MGM Entertainment, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Transaction Processing. Provident Healthcare Services, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Transaction Processing. Schenker Logistics in Germany, Autonomous Data Warehouse. Soar [ph] Gen2 Infrastructure. Swiss Post, Gen2 Infrastructure, Autonomous Data Warehouse. Target, based in the United States, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Data Warehouse. Technip, energy company, but I\u2019ve mentioned that bought I believe, the HCM, ERP, bought the full suite and Gen2 Infrastructure and Autonomous Database. The Boston Globe, Gen2 Infrastructure, Autonomous Database. Thermos, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Transaction Processing. Cybersoft, Autonomous Database. Tideworks Netherlands, Gen2 Infrastructure. Tokyo Gas and Electric, Autonomous Data Warehouse, Gen2 Infrastructure. TriMark USA, Gen2 Infrastructure. Walgreens, Autonomous Data Warehouse, Autonomous Transaction Processing, Gen2 Infrastructure. Wizink Bank, Autonomous Data Warehouse, Gen2 Infrastructure.

AXA Equitable Life Insurance, Autonomous Database, Gen2 Infrastructure. Banco de Chile, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Data Warehouse, Gen2 Infrastructure. Baxter Healthcare, Autonomous Data Warehouse. Cigna Corporate Services, Autonomous Data Warehouse, Gen2 Infrastructure. Eventbrite, Gen2 Infrastructure. Ford Motor Company, Gen2 Infrastructure, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Warehouse. Mary Kay, Gen2 Infrastructure. Samsung Electronics, Gen2 Infrastructure, Autonomous Database, Autonomous Transaction Processing. VeriFone, Gen2 Infrastructure, Autonomous Database and Autonomous Transaction Processing. With that, I will turn it over to the audience for questions. Ken Bond : Thank you, Holly. Thank you, Larry. Holly, if you could please prepare the audience for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Michael Turits, Raymond James. Michael Turits : Hey, good evening, everybody. Safra, it was great to see that you reaffirmed your guidance for the full-year per revenue acceleration and double-digit EPS growth. But with the 3Q guide, it does suggest a very strong fourth-quarter on top of what was the fourth \u2013 strong fourth quarter than last year. So can you give us a little bit of visibility into what\u2019s driving that confidence.? And also I know it\u2019s early, but given what that means for fourth quarter, what does it mean in terms of what it implies about fiscal 2021? Safra Catz : So we\u2019ve got everything finally out and available. And as Larry and I both mentioned, we\u2019ve got Cloud@Customer. We have a lot of orders for that, that we have not deployed yet. So we\u2019ve got a lot of demand there. We\u2019ve got Autonomous Database. We\u2019ve got new versions of Autonomous Database on track. We\u2019ve got the entire Fusion suite rolling even \u2013 including all of the additional modules have all been continuously upgraded. So we\u2019ve got an immense amount of demand. And we have enormous pipelines and our conversion rates are increasing. And so the pipe has just expanded so dramatically than I know we\u2019re going to have more bookings, but also previous bookings as those deals are ramping up and more users are using the products were very, very upbeat about the second-half. But even more so next year, we believe that the momentum we will have in the second-half of this year will more than carry through to 2021. Michael Turits : Great. Thanks very much. Safra Catz : Sure. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you so much for the time and I\u2019m going to try and get away with two questions. But I guess, the first one, Safra, as you mentioned about license this quarter, it was a little lighter than what, I think, people were expecting. I know we\u2019re talking about a big base. But if there\u2019s anything you could call out in terms of whether it\u2019s the sales force reorg or just macro or whatever in terms of the results in the quarter on that line. And then I know just covering the company for a while, given the lumpiness historically between Q2 and Q3, I know sometimes deals push from one quarter to the next and typically, it\u2019s better to just average those two quarters. But how do you feel about the outlook for the Q3 license number? And then I just have one follow-up, if you don\u2019t mind. Safra Catz : I generally feel very good about the Q3 license number, as you said, it is lumpy. The one thing we do have is that the GBUs, which, of course, not a giant part of our license business, but are significant. They have moved and their cloud products have become available. And I do expect that most of the orders for new services in the GBUs will come through as Cloud Services instead of just plain License. But I don\u2019t think that will be as significant. I do expect that licenses, in fact, will be just fine in Q3 other than the GBU piece. Heather Bellini : Okay. And then just my follow-up. I mean, these calls just still don\u2019t feel the same without Mark being on them. And with all due respect to him to his passing just knowing how hard it is going to be to replace him, I mean, is there anything to share with us regarding you getting some \u2013 getting someone to kind of help take his place in some of the responsibilities that you\u2019ve taken over? Lawrence Ellison : Okay. This is Larry. I know how to answer that question, because I get the question is, so how\u2019s our search for a second CEO guy? Remember, when we announced two CEOs, the first time was people thought that was a bit odd. And so now people are finding that we have one CEO is a bit odd, two CEOs \u2013 so it\u2019s so simple. So let me make it very simple. How\u2019s our search going for the new \u2013 for a second CEO, we don\u2019t have plans. We have no plans for having a second CEO, it was an unusual situation, where Mark and Safra were an absolutely fantastic team. But we have complete confidence in our existing management team. We\u2019re doing a lot of recruiting and you\u2019ll see a lot of announcements at the next layer down that we\u2019re hiring a bunch of people at the next layer down who are potential CEOs, when both Safra and I retire and which is not anytime soon. And so we\u2019re going to strengthen the management team, but one of the strategies for strengthening that team is not to hire a second CEO. Heather Bellini : Thank you very much. Ken Bond : Next question, please. Thank you, Heather. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much. Larry, the momentum in Autonomous Database is fantastic, growing over a 100% in your Public Cloud. But having been in market now for over a year, I know investors are wondering when we might see an inflection in your financial results from Autonomous. And I appreciate many customers are including some of the required database option in their deals. But now that you\u2019re making it available on Gen2 Cloud@Customer. How should we think about the appetite from your installed base? How material can it be to your financials? And is there anything you might compare it to in Oracle\u2019s history? Lawrence Ellison : Well, no. I mean, there \u2013 either in terms of a technological breakthrough. Well, I guess, we\u2019re the first commercial relational database. Brad Zelnick : Wow. Lawrence Ellison : The very beginning, that\u2019s kind of created Oracle Corporation, right? So that we had the very first commercial relational database. We had one before IBM did or anyone else did. So that traded \u2013 that turned this company from an idea into the company that manages most of the world\u2019s information. So I would say, Autonomous Database is that same kind of thing. It\u2019s \u2013 it is so much different, so much favored to use, so much more reliable than anything else that\u2019s in the market. I think everyone is going to use it. Virtually, everyone is going to use it. Now that said, it is \u2013 it takes a while when you introduce an all new products. The good news is, we have a huge installed base here. It takes a while for that \u2013 for us to shift a, if you will, a next-gen technology and get people comfortable with it and using it. And that first year, we\u2019ve seen a lot of early adopters. But the early adopters are now in the thousands. And we think eventually the only database will offer, it\u2019s Autonomous Database. It will replace everything else. And by the way, at Autonomous Database, it\u2019s only available in Q4. If we put a cloud in \u2013 if we put our cloud in your data center, that\u2019s our Exadata machine and our Middleware machines and all of that is in our storage in your data center and our Public Cloud. So it \u2013 we think it will be consumed in one of those two ways and that will replace our entire base. So it means that our existing database business from a financial standpoint will more than double or triple or triple probably is a reasonable estimate to look out. Now, of course, when you are in your business, it\u2019s all about timing. And I wish I could tell you exactly how much will sell over the next 18 months. That\u2019s kind of tricky. Now we don\u2019t have that many data points. We have four quarters of data points. And then the first couple of quarters, it was so new. So we really only have a couple of quarters of data points. All I\u2019ve been saying is none of us ever seen an adoption rate like this before. Brad Zelnick : Fantastic. Thank you, Larry. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Phil Winslow, Wells Fargo. Phil Winslow : Hi, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to focus in on the applications business. Obviously, you saw a nice tick back up here quarter-to-quarter in terms of the year-over-year growth rate. I guess, the question to Safra and I guess, Larry, too. What do you think about the sort of the different curves that buildup that business? Obviously, you\u2019ve talked about in the past some of the headwinds from things like Data Cloud and then also some of the wins that we saw on your Fusion, Fusion ERP and NetSuite this quarter? Where are we when we stack all those curves together? Are we past for those headwinds and we\u2019re now looking at sort of acceleration from here? In other words, Q1 was a trough or just help us kind of, Larry, take that up, if you could? Safra Catz : So let me get started and then Larry can add when he needs to add. So first of all, the Data Cloud has stabilized. I don\u2019t know if it will stay that way, but that was a very significant headwind for us. In that whole business, it has completely stabilized. It grew ever so slightly. Additionally, the adoption in our ERP Cloud is now such that it\u2019s in the thousands. We\u2019ve many, many references. And what happens in our business is that, once you are sort of obviously referenceable, it becomes much, much easier for other potential customers to move ahead. One of the things that had been to some extent leading to a wait-and-see attitude by some historically business suite customers was the adoption of first availability and now adoption of supply chain. Our supply chain now has many, many customers, and so more of our customers are willing and interested in moving. Remember, every single quarter, a 100-plus new features become available. And some of those have been must-have features for extremely happy customers in the business suite. Simultaneously, as Larry mentioned, SAP customers have realized that SAPs\u2019 offerings are not cloud offerings. If you use SAP\u2019s technology, you don\u2019t get a 100 new features every quarter. There\u2019s a simply a hosted offering, which means that we are the obvious choice for customers who are \u2013 who want to go through and really adopt a digital approach in their business. And so for us, this is going to be success leads more success. It\u2019s an incredibly virtuous cycle. And as Larry mentioned, what it also means is that additional modules are going with and that\u2019s clearly showing up in our other segments and, of course, HCM, which is obviously a match and then ultimately, the front-office, where we\u2019ve got a lot of new technology rolling out that is being adopted. Lawrence Ellison : Yes. I think a lot of SAP\u2019s \u2013 again, in the mid-market, where we are replacing a lot of SAP customers and we\u2019ve got them live and we have references. But right at the very impacts of SAP\u2019s customer base, they\u2019re top 50 customers around the world. They\u2019re \u2013 looking at this one particular implementation that where we expect to go live in March of next year. And I would describe them as rooting for us. They want to have an alternative to a billion-dollar SAP upgrade. SAP end-of-life, their current stuff in 2025. So if you\u2019re a big SAP customer, you\u2019ve got to make it \u2013 that some people have bought \u2013 actually bought ahead, actually bought as we\u2019re having in the cloud with no plan \u2013 with no really good plan to implement it. It\u2019s a five-year implementation. They\u2019re getting price quotes of a billion-dollars for the upgrade. Imagine going from your existing SAP system, taking out Oracle and replacing HANA and that\u2019s the only change. Basically, that\u2019s the only change and it\u2019s hosted. It\u2019s not cloud. There is no cloud. Anyway, I want to say, well, it\u2019s easy for Oracle and say, go to SAP\u2019s website and try to find the SAP Cloud for ERP. I mean, you can find it for the stuff they bought. You can find it for Callidus, which is on one cloud. You can find it for Ariba, which is on another cloud. You can find it for little SurveyMonkey, and all the stuff that they bought. But they forgot. They forgot to write ERP, that\u2019s your business and they forgot to rewrite ERP there. There are projects that they had to do that whole business by design fails, they canceled it. So there is no cloud option for SAP customers. They can\u2019t go to Workday. Workday can\u2019t even handle mid-market ERP. So we\u2019re at \u2013 so believe me, they want an alternatives to SAP, makes sense, right, that they should want an alternative. But we\u2019ve just got to demonstrate that we can safely take these enormous companies to the cloud in a way that they\u2019re not putting their business than any risks. And that\u2019s why this one particular giant implementation they\u2019re watching closely. But by the way, they\u2019re not just watching and waiting. A number of their biggest customers in the heart of German, lots of them are working with \u2013 these are German customers the core of SAP are working with us. And taking some of their \u2013 moving some of their divisions already on some of their divisions to Oracle\u2019s Fusion to persuade themselves that we can do this safely. They\u2019ve gone that far. They don\u2019t want to continue with its obsolete code. This is \u2013 this opportunity is gigantic, because we have one European customer on \u2013 competitor on-premise. They don\u2019t have a cloud offering. That\u2019s SAP. And we\u2019ve got one ERP Cloud competitor that just as not doing very well, having a hard time getting their business off the ground. It doesn\u2019t scale there a lot. There are a lot of problems. So we have a chance here to be \u2013 to get what used to be in the old world called gates share for ERP and getting \u2013 like Microsoft Office to be \u2013 the Microsoft Office of ERP, where \u2013 and it\u2019s sitting there. And we just have to get this last proof point out to SAP\u2019s largest customers. Yes, we can do this. We can do it safely. And we will be overwhelmingly the largest application company in the cloud. Phil Winslow : Thank you, Larry. Ken Bond : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Moerdler, Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much for taking my questions. Autonomous Database sounds like, it\u2019s really starting to gain traction. Given the shift of sales personnel to selling Autonomous, can you give us some more color specifically? Specifically, are you seeing the customers buying the required modules as license or they including it with the cloud? Are you seeing changes in the size of the customer, size of the pipeline, the time it takes from customer interest to adoption. Any of that would be really appreciated? Lawrence Ellison : Okay, I\u2019m happy to do that. I think the most interesting thing that\u2019s going on is, we\u2019ve decided to take, if you will, in AWS approach to selling Autonomous Database in the cloud. So we almost prefer selling our $30,000 deal to a $100,000 deal, because in a $30,000 deal, we can close in four weeks. So we think the way to sell Autonomous Database is to get it installed on a project in one of our customers, get it going, help them become successful. And then once they under \u2013 once they actually get their hands on Autonomous Database and they have working app, they have working projects, working data warehouses, working transaction processing systems, you start some new land and expand. So we\u2019re selling thousands and thousands of small deals. And some of those deals are already coming back as larger deals. But our approach, again, is to \u2013 and most of it is not BYOL, because they\u2019re small. I mean some of it is. Not \u2013 yes, some of it is BYOL, but the majority is not BYOL. It was interesting in the early days in ERP. When we had ERP, people moving our e-business suite customers. No, they were new logos. In the early days in Cloud ERP for us, they were new logos. Believe it or not, we\u2019re actually seeing new logos and database. But again, most of them are our customers, but they\u2019re not using their existing licenses. They\u2019re going ahead and using a standard cloud and license, what we call [indiscernible]. They pay us as we get. You pay for what you use. I mean, it\u2019s the promise of the cloud. And we\u2019re getting in thousands of these, because we think the best selling techniques for Autonomous Database is try it, get it running, watch it backs itself up. It upgrades itself. It tunes itself. It configures itself. There\u2019s nothing like it. We just got to win those hearts and minds. And the way to do that is go wide across our entire customer base. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on. And again, it\u2019s working very, very well. I think it\u2019s working very, very well, because we\u2019re seeing just beginning to see the first people coming back and going from $30,000 a month to $600,000 a month. Ken Bond : Great. Next question, please? Operator : Our final question for today will come from the line of Kirk Materne, Evercore. Stewart Kirk Materne : Yes. Thanks very much and thanks for taking the question. Safra, I was just wondering if you could comment on just sort of the geographic landscape for you all. It looked like Europe was perhaps a little bit softer in your other geographies this quarter. Maybe that\u2019s just macro. I was wondering if you could just add a little bit color on sort of what you\u2019re seeing across the different theaters? Thanks. Safra Catz : Yes. This quarter, EMEA only grew in the single digits. Some of the other regions did grow in the high double digits, some very high double digits. And I think there\u2019s nothing really special going on one way or the other. Some of it\u2019s just the way the quarter falls out for them. But overall, our business remains very strong. And I think that next quarter could be completely different. So it was \u2013 it\u2019s really nothing. We\u2019re not seeing a massive change even month-over-month or quarter-over-quarter from what it looked like. Obviously, there are some regions doing very, very well for a number of different reasons as they get to roll out new capabilities. We\u2019ve got a lot of \u2013 we\u2019ve got data centers opening and have opened very, very successfully in Latin America and in Asia and in Japan. And so we\u2019ve got a lot of usage and increase in some of those areas, which helped explain some of the big growth in some of those areas. But EMEA, I think, we will see \u2013 there\u2019s nothing special, in particular. I have no real color to add and we\u2019ll see what happens after today\u2019s selection in the UK. Stewart Kirk Materne : Sounds good. Thank you. Ken Bond : Thank you, Safra. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call and we look forward to speaking to you. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Holly for closing. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for joining us for today\u2019s Oracle\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are our Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz.  As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.  Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks, and with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. As you can see, we had an excellent quarter in Q3 with total revenue growth of 3% in constant currency and EPS of $0.97 in U.S. dollars. Both revenue and EPS were above the midpoint of my guidance even though we saw a strengthening U.S. dollar, which resulted in a negative headwind to total revenue.  It was really a remarkable quarter with a lot of product and customer momentum in both applications and infrastructure. The quarter demonstrated the acceleration of revenue that I've been forecasting. Our Cloud Services and License Support business, basically our subscription business, which includes SaaS, IaaS and software updates, powered our revenue growth. Those subscription revenues for the quarter were $6.9 billion, up 5% and accounted for nearly 71% of total company revenues, up from 69% last year. License revenues were $1.2 billion, the same as last year.  We are seeing a lot of momentum across our applications portfolio, with GAAP application subscription revenues at $2.8 billion, up 7%. Fusion apps were up 32%, Fusion ERP was up 38% and Fusion HCM was up 27%. NetSuite ERP was up 26%. Vertical SaaS was up single -- high single digits, and data cloud was up low single digits. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 4% with total database revenue up 5%, highlighted by BYOL and Autonomous Database revenues both up over 150% but off a small base.  As you can see, we've replaced ecosystem revenues with subscription revenues, which will make it easier for you to see the revenue growth rate of the largest part of our business more clearly. You'll still be able to determine the growth rates for our entire software ecosystem by combining subscription and license revenues. Our cloud renewal rates continue to go up. The gross margin for Cloud Services and License Support was 86%, up 1% from last quarter. Both SaaS and IaaS gross margins were up more than 1% from both last quarter and last year. As we continue to get to scale, I expect our cloud gross margins will increase further, driving an acceleration in our gross profit growth.  Total revenues for the quarter were $9.8 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.4 billion, up 3% from last year. The operating margin was 44%, essentially unchanged from last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 19.1%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20%. EPS was $0.97 in U.S. dollars, up 12% in constant currency and 11% in USD. The GAAP tax rate was 16.4% and GAAP EPS was $0.79 in USD, up 5% in constant currency, 4% in USD. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $13.9 billion. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $26 billion in cash and marketable securities, and the short-term net deferred revenue balance is $7.8 billion, down 1% in constant currency due to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was up over 1% in constant currency and would have been up over 3%, if not for the ASC 606 transition changes. Now we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 73.5 million shares for a total of $4 billion. And over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 366 million shares for a total of $20 billion. And over the last 5 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 28%. The Board again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $15 billion for the repurchase of Oracle shares.  Now before turning to guidance, I need to say a few words about the impact of the COVID-19 virus. Over the last few weeks, we've observed the growing public concern. We're largely conducting business as usual with some modifications such as using video conferencing and asking our employees to postpone nonessential travel. Likewise, we're seeing other companies take precautionary actions. It's not yet clear what the effect that the virus will have on our customers and suppliers and, as a result, what the impact will be on our business in Q4.  So with that backdrop, let me share with you my thinking on the modeling for Q4. The subscription part of our business, cloud and product update, will continue to grow, and we expect minimal impact from the virus in the quarter, given that much of the subscription revenue is already contracted. Last year, the subscription business was 61% of the quarter. Consistent with the trends over the last year, I expect it to be a larger percentage of Q4 this year. In meeting with my executive team, we reviewed the enormous pipeline of transactional business for Q4. As you know, Q4 is typically a seasonally large quarter for software licenses and, to a lesser extent, hardware. Given the uncertainty in the current business climate, I am going to provide a much wider range in my estimate for total revenue.  My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have no significant effect on revenues or EPS. Now of course, that may change, but that's what it is right now. So for Q4, total subscription revenues are expected to range between 3% to 5% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Total revenues are expected to range between negative 2% to positive 2% in both constant currency and U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 3% to 9% and be between $1.20 and $1.28 in both constant currency and USD. Total CapEx for FY '20 is expected to be around $2 billion but it could vary.  My EPS guidance for Q4 and the FY '20 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2020. Now in June, assuming the global economic situation has stabilized, I will share with you the basis for my optimism around our revenue growth acceleration for fiscal year 2021. It will be based on the ever-growing portion of our revenue attributable to our faster-growing subscription business. You saw a bit of it in Q3, and it would have been even more obvious but for the early impact of the virus.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Safra. There are two key product areas that will determine Oracle's future, cloud ERP applications and Autonomous Database infrastructure. Being #1 in both of these 2 giant market segments will enable the success of our other application and infrastructure products in adjacent market segments. We expect the cloud ERP market segment to be 2 to 3x larger than the prior on-premise ERP software market. We already have a huge lead in the cloud ERP market with over 7,000 Fusion ERP customers and 21,000 NetSuite ERP customers.  Our primary ERP competitors are struggling. SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. And today, many of SAP's largest customers are actively working with us to migrate from SAP to Fusion ERP in the cloud. Workday, the other competitor, is seeing very little success in cloud ERP. Workday's ERP market share is tiny compared to ours. What's even more interesting is Workday's lack of success in cloud ERP is also creating opportunities for Oracle in cloud HCM. HCM increasingly is being purchased as a part of an ERP Cloud application suite. As a result, Oracle now has more HCM customers than Workday, and Fusion HCM revenue is growing faster than Workday.  And we're beginning to see the same integrated suite strategy drive our sales of CX, customer experience, applications in sales, service and marketing. I want to highlight a couple of our multi-pillar wins because these sales demonstrate the power of having an integrated cloud application suite like Fusion. First one, Johnson Controls. They signed a $15 million annual recurring deal that included ERP, Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP, enterprise performance management, supply chain management and CX for marketing, Fusion Marketing, Fusion service, Fusion Sales, e-commerce and Configure, Price, Quote.  Skanska similarly bought Fusion ERP, Fusion EPM and Fusion HCM -- Fusion Supply Chain and HCM in the cloud. So we're seeing a lot of multi-pillar deals where they buy most of or all of the Fusion suite. We had a lot of ERP and EPM wins in the cloud. We won Unisys, ERP, EPM, SCM and CX. We -- S&P Global bought ERP. United Services Automobile Association bought ERP. RECO bought ERP. SCL Health bought both ERP and HCM. Adecco bought ERP. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering bought ERP and HCM. United Airlines bought ERP. Snap bought ERP. CDK Global bought both ERP and SCM.  We had a number of SCMs -- a number of supply chain wins in the quarter. Big one was Dow Chemical, bought Fusion Supply Chain. National Oilwell's bought Fusion Supply Chain. RECO bought Supply Chain in addition to ERP. Unisys bought Supply Chain. Citrus World bought Supply Chain. ConAgra, Supply Chain. UC Health bought Supply Chain. National Convenience Distributors bought Supply Chain and so did Total S.A. buy Supply Chain. As I said, selling the suite has enabled us to sell a lot more HCM as a part of the suite. CSX bought HCM. UC Health bought HCM, along with Supply Chain, ERP and EPM. Nemours bought ERP and Supply Chain and replaced their Workday HCM with Oracle Fusion HCM. Molina Healthcare bought HCM. Sensium Technologies bought HCM. Ford Motor Company dramatically expanded their Oracle Fusion HCM Cloud implementation, as did Kaiser Health, another big expansion of their -- Kaiser's Fusion HCM Cloud implementation. Keurig Dr Pepper bought our CX products, marketing, Fusion Sales, Fusion service. IKEA expanded dramatically their implementation of Fusion service. Micro Focus bought Fusion Marketing, Fusion service, Fusion Sales and Fusion e-commerce. Banco de Chile bought Fusion Marketing and Fusion service. Comcast bought Fusion Sales. Cargill bought Fusion Marketing. Thermo Fisher bought Configure, Price, Quote. Motorola bought Configure, Price, Quote. And Participia [ph] bought Fusion Marketing, Fusion Sales and Fusion e-commerce. Okay, that's the application part of our business.  I'm going to spend -- I'm going to give you a little more detail about our infrastructure business being driven by our database business. Our Autonomous -- our new Autonomous Database. Oracle has long been the market share leader in the database business. This quarter, our overall database business, both cloud and on-premise, grew 5%, with our cloud database business growing in triple digits. We have an enormous technology advantage with our Autonomous Database. And we expect our database growth rates to accelerate from that 5% number we experienced this past quarter as customers transition from legacy databases to the Autonomous Database in the cloud.  I'm going to give you quite a bit of detail on a number of these wins that we think are strategic and very important to give you a sense of how much momentum our infrastructure business is beginning to pick up. Nomura in Japan made a $20 million commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They are moving their production systems handling mission-critical transactions to the Oracle Cloud. These are the applications that service a number of large-scale financial institutions. It's a very big commitment from Nomura.  Fiserv similarly made an $8 million commitment to move their payments applications into Oracle's Gen2 infrastructure. They'll be using both our public cloud and our Cloud at Customer. This allows Fiserv to gain tremendous ongoing cost savings as they benchmark our cloud versus the clouds from competitors. WorkForce Software is the SaaS -- made a $4 million commitment. They're moving their SaaS application to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud. Their application helps customers digitally manage time and labor. They will move out of their own data centers to the Oracle Gen2 public cloud because after a good deal of testing, they got better performance from the Oracle public cloud, better security and a huge reduction in cost for them.  Gap has made a $6 million annual commitment to the Oracle Cloud. They're moving their retail applications. Their most critical workloads will move into the Oracle public cloud. And they will leverage our new interconnect with Microsoft Azure and the Azure public cloud. Manhattan Associates is moving their warehouse and asset management system, their SaaS application into our cloud, and they're expanding that business. T-Mobile is moving into our Gen2 public cloud for their mission-critical Lendlease application to manage financing mobile device sales for both T-Mobile and now Sprint. This one is really interesting. Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation 98% of all global trades go through -- global trades through any accredited brokerage firm, settle and clear using Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation's repository trading system. DTCC is migrating their multi-terabyte Amazon AWS Redshift system out of Amazon and into our public cloud using the Oracle Autonomous Database. They're also moving their analytics from Amazon to the Oracle Analytics suite.  Sonoco, international provider of diversified consumer packaging products, is migrating their e-business suite, their product life cycle management, integration, analytics, all of that to our public cloud. National Bank of Canada is migrating all of their Oracle databases running on IBM pSeries to Oracle's Generation 2 Cloud at Customer.  Norfolk Southern has decided to move their entitle warehousing environment away from Teradata and away from Microsoft SQL Server to the Oracle database in our Gen2 public cloud. They will also use the Oracle Analytics Cloud for visualization. I just wanted again to give you some ideas of the big wins that we're getting. And with customers moving away from Microsoft SQL Server, away from AWS, away from Workday and into using our -- into our cloud using both our applications and our infrastructure. It has been a very exciting quarter for us. We had some huge wins.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Ken. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Operator, if we could please queue up the audience for questions, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : I was just wondering, Safra, Larry, if you could talk a little bit about the rebound that you mentioned that you can start seeing show up in the numbers, in particular, around your database business. I know in Q1, you called out a little bit of dislocation, and it looks like things are starting to progress in the direction that you've been telling us about. But is there anything you could share with us to kind of give us more detail about what exactly you think is driving this? Is it things like OCI, for example, as well? And then how -- Safra, you mentioned that you might be able to share with us in May when you get a little more stability in the picture from a macro perspective kind of how you see this progressing, but any high-level thoughts you would be comfortable sharing with us now about kind of the acceleration that you're seeing in terms of how we should think about it going forward? Safra Catz : Okay. So I will start and then, Larry, you can add what you'd like. Obviously, the power of having great products is what overwhelms everything. And the momentum we have with Autonomous Database and the more and more success, all of these projects start as small projects and expand very dramatically. Our average consumption rate is just increasing dramatically, and it's the result of Autonomous Database being incredibly powerful and very, very popular with our customers.  In addition, the database itself, database license, the technology business, which I had mentioned earlier in the year, we had a little reorg in North America, a few things like that, that is really chugging. In fact, it probably would have been even better but for this coronavirus showing up at the end of the quarter. Basically, the last week in February, market was down a lot, and so I expected but for this coronavirus for Q4 to be really impressive. By assuming that we have some stability in the economy globally, I will be sharing with you the fact that it's a bigger and bigger number. That consumption revenue is going way, way up. And that this entire subscription side of the business, the infrastructure subscription side of the business is just getting bigger and grows and grows. So overall, good products, good services lead to success for our customers and then adoption takes care of itself. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that. Lawrence Ellison : Yes. I want to amplify on what Safra means by great products. So Autonomous Database really is a unique product. There is no human labor. Therefore, there's no human error. So it's a combination of -- Autonomous Database costs a lot less to run because human beings don't do the driving. The Autonomous Database drives itself. So there's no labor associated with running the Autonomous Database. And if there's no human labor, humans can't make mistakes that cause security vulnerabilities. That's one big thing.  But another big thing that people may not know about Autonomous Database, it is both serverless and elastic. What I mean by that is when your application isn't running on the Oracle public cloud, you don't pay for any CPUs. You got no CPUs dedicated to you. When your application isn't running, you're not paying for servers. That is not true of Amazon's databases. If you have Redshift, you pay for the Redshift processors. If you have their MySQL implementation, you pay for those processors. We're not only serverless, we're instantaneously elastic. So if you suddenly need to go from 2 servers or 2 cores to 20 cores, we do that instantaneously while the database is still running. And then when you don't -- no longer need the 20 cores, we automatically go back to the 2.  So it literally is the promise of the cloud. It's serverless when it's not running, and it's fully elastic so you only pay for what you use. What this has translated to is people benchmark us. They actually bring an application to Oracle and they bring an application to AWS. They are shock to find that we are much, much less expensive than AWS even though we're more secure and we're faster. And once they discover that, once they do a trial and they do a comparison and they discover that, they're picking us. And some of the interesting ones that are picking us are some of the SaaS application providers, and that's their business. Their business is to run applications. And they try all of the different clouds. And we are the most secure cloud, the highest-performing cloud, but maybe most importantly, the most economical cloud. So we're winning more and more business, and we expect this trend to continue. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad? Brad Zelnick : Larry or Safra, I just wanted to ask a question about the hardware business, which I know isn't typically in focus for most investors, but I know many customers have been anxiously anticipating the availability of Autonomous Database to be supported on Cloud at Customer. So my question is, can you give us any sort of update on the impact that supply constraints might be having on the hardware business? And in any way, can that impact the availability of Autonomous to be shipping on Cloud at Customer? Safra Catz : So there was a little bit of an impact actually in Q3 as certain components were in short supply. And so in fact, once again, Q3 would have been even higher but for some shortages in components to our suppliers and to our suppliers' suppliers as a result of the coronavirus in China. I think that we're trying to work through all of that, and we'll see what the availability is in Q4. We think we -- some impact may continue, but my guidance on this does include our ability to deliver some but not all of what we could possibly sell in Q4. Lawrence Ellison : Yes. I'd like to comment as well. Our Exadata cloud -- database Cloud at Customer product is actually made up of the same components as conventional servers. Therefore, we can reallocate the parts away from the conventional servers into the Exadata machines. So -- and the Exadata machines are much higher value because they have a much larger software component to them when we sell them, and the Exadata machines are Gen2 Cloud at Customer. So I think you'll see us -- if we have to do some reallocation away from plain old commodity servers into our Exadata machines, and thereby, if there is a shortfall, it should be in the lower -- the less expensive commodity servers, less profitable commodity servers and the high-value, high-margin Cloud at Customer servers, we're going to do -- work very, very hard to meet all of those orders. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow : Congrats on a great Q3. I just wanted to focus in on the apps business. Obviously, Safra, you called out the acceleration there but also some pretty strong growth rates, ERP Cloud, 38%, HCM Cloud Fusion, 27%. So 2 questions here. First, what's actually driving this growth? Is this your existing customers flipping over from on-premise to the cloud? Or is it net new customers to Oracle? And I guess a question for Larry, too. What are you hearing about sort of why customers are choosing you? Or how much is the breadth of your ERP suite impact that buying decision? Safra Catz : So let me just say -- sorry. First of all, let me just answer your exact question, which is, yes, yes, yes, yes. Is it new customers? Yes. Is it upgrading customers from e-business suite? Yes. Is it taking customers from our biggest competitors? Yes. Is it replacing out some of our SaaS competitors? Yes. It is all those things. All right. Now I'll let Larry talk. Go ahead. Lawrence Ellison : Yes. Well, again, this is back to the maturity of our product, the combination of we think we have the best technology. Our products are built on top of our database, which is faster and more secure than other databases, so we think our applications inherit those capabilities. But our applications are also built on top of technologies like our voice digital assistant. So we have -- so when we do a demonstration against Workday, and Workday has long claimed to have a better UI than Oracle, and they'll show their computer interface. And we'll say, \"I don't think they have a better UI,\" and you just talk to your smartphone and you get your reports and you do your transactions by talking -- by saying Oracle and not Alexa, you say, \"Oracle, how many vacation days do I have? Oracle, I'd like to schedule a 1-week vacation starting August 17.\"  And so we make our applications much more accessible with a much more modern user interface, taking away -- showing the technology difference between us and a company like Workday. The biggest advantage we have against Workday and SAP, I would argue, is that our applications are built on top of our infrastructure. SAP doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have an infrastructure cloud. Workday doesn't have a digital -- a voice digital assistant. Workday doesn't have an autonomous database. Workday doesn't have integrated machine learning to detect fraud and to detect security intrusions. They don't have those technologies. Our applications inherit all of those advantages, and it allows us to compete very effectively against them from demonstration to deployment.  And finally, we have this very, very broad suite where it's going to be very difficult for a company like Workday to build out everything from CX to HCM to ERP and supply chain and manufacturing. So it's very difficult for a small company to do that. And it's very difficult finally for SAP to do that because they haven't started yet. They haven't started writing for the cloud. So we're winning everywhere in applications. We have a suite. We have the most modern technology. We have the best security and the best performance. We're doing very well, very, very well against all of our application -- competitors in the back office and HCM and ERP. And we're making some progress against Salesforce though they are a -- but they're a very formidable competitor in the front office. That's a different competitive dynamic. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital. Raimo Lenschow : Can you talk a little bit, like we're obviously in uncertain times but you guys have been in uncertain times before. So can you maybe contrast a little bit Oracle today with its recurring revenue stream whether there's -- where we were in 2008, where this -- and where we were in 2001? And then also talk a little bit about what you see on renewals around the database but also the cloud. Safra Catz : Yes. So as I pointed out in my opening remarks, the percentage of our revenue that is recurring, which is generally the support business and our cloud business, which is -- just continues year after year building off a growing base is a very, very large percentage. This past quarter in Q3, it was 71% of the quarter. By the way, in Q1, it will be a very large percentage because there isn't a big chunk. And in this next quarter is the quarter that it is historically, Q4, it's historically the lowest as a percentage because our transactional business is the biggest. Last year, it was 61%. Assuming it does, at least what -- at least what this quarter did and I expect it to be actually a little bit more, it would be about 63% at a minimum because this was 2 points. I expect it to actually be more.  So we have much less variability in -- especially like I remember 2001 when the Internet bubble imploded. That was just a totally different world. At that point, our license revenue was a very large percentage of our business. And at that point, it dropped very significantly because it had been, some would say, inflated or very high during the Internet bubble because of those kind of companies. Our business now is strategic and central to the operations of our customers, whether it's our SaaS products on which they run their businesses or it's the infrastructure and the database. The database is very strong, and it remains strong. Our tech business is very strong. And now that we've gotten everything sort of organized correctly in the past few months, it's really starting to show the power of our business. Lawrence Ellison : Yes. I'd like to add a couple of comments. One is just to reiterate what Safra said, our business is much -- is not a onetime license business very much anymore. This past quarter, 71% of the business that we had in the quarter was contracted before the quarter began. So these are just ongoing subscriptions. That's very close to accurate. The other comment is -- we've got all this recurring business. The other comment is our business model has changed radically in that we used to have lots and lots of small offices spread all over the place. And we've gone away from those small offices spread all over the place to a hub model, where we have a big office in Austin, Texas, big office in California. We have these hubs, and we do digital selling. We do digital support. We're communicating with you across the Internet. We do demonstrations where we're not necessarily there. We're just -- we're demonstrating our products to you, selling our products to you. We're doing implementation consulting out of India. We're doing implementation consulting out of the Philippines where the people aren't going on site. So our model, our business model, selling and services are more and more provided digitally. Our revenue model, more and more of it is subscription-based and reoccurring. So our business has changed radically from the time of the Internet bubble, from 2001, from 2008. It's a very different situation. Operator : And our next question is a line from Mark Moerdler from Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Congratulations on the quarter. You increased your buyback authorization this quarter. How should we think about how you will use the buyback given the market downturn? Also, how should we think about your ability to support the dividend, expand the dividend, given the economic downturn? It seems to be a very positive statement you're making. I'd like to get whatever color you can on that. Safra Catz : There's no question we can support our dividend with ease, okay. And any kind of increased dividend, we could support that. Also, I mean our business is very strong, as is obvious. It generates very large amounts of cash. We believe, as you can tell, I'm not going to comment on future buyback, but obviously, you can tell we have been buying back our stock. We think it's an incredible deal. It's basically gone on clearance sale in the past few days, and we think it's an enormous -- it's a fantastic investment. And it reduces the number of outstanding shares or otherwise known as partners we have to share our very good profits with.  So our business has hit an obvious inflection. I've mentioned that it would accelerate in the second half. I never would have imagined that we would have the kind of reaction worldwide by companies and governments. So I really -- I've done my best at modeling what Q4 will look like. To the extent that next year is -- that this stabilizes, I believe we will be just continuing on in our -- we've changed our model and it's becoming obvious. So I think our stock is obviously a bargain. It was a bargain before, and we are authorized to buy back, and we will let you know after we have done it. Operator : And our final question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James. Michael Turits : Nice to see strong results, particularly in a tough time. I want to come back to applications. Applications accelerated in this quarter and Fusion apps continue to grow at high rates. Is there anything left in terms of headwinds that could keep you from seeing further acceleration in app subscription this year and next? And where do you think that growth rate could end up for this year? Safra Catz : The business is fantastic, okay? It's obviously accelerating. The base of the business keeps growing. We are winning, we are winning constantly. The products are \u2013 it gets stronger every quarter, and it really ultimately is well on its way. Larry, I'm sorry, I interrupted you. Lawrence Ellison : No. I was going to say, in applications, the new news is, I mentioned it last quarter, that we are engaged with lots, more than 10 of SAP's very largest customers. In terms of doing -- actually looking at taking a couple of divisions of these very large companies. And we're talking about American companies, Asian companies, German companies, large German companies that are giving us divisions to put Fusion into. And there is -- one company has given us multiple divisions because the question they're trying to answer is, \"Can I replace all of SAP throughout my company with Fusion? And you're just doing one division in my company, it isn't enough. I need you to do multiple divisions within my company.\"  So we have lots of examples of that, believe it or not, with the most famous companies in the world. SAP -- it is astonishing to me that SAP's largest customers are now looking at moving away from SAP because SAP never moved to the cloud. They never rewrote their applications. Ask them a very simple question. Is that code the same code you had 35 years ago? SAP's programming language, by the way, SAP's -- they're still programming in a language called ABAP. It's their proprietary programming.  We program in Java, but they program in ABAP. This is a 35-year-old technology. They never rewrote for the cloud. Their largest customers are aware of that. They are looking at us, and I have never seen -- except in the early days when we had the first commercial relational database and Oracle grew its franchise, which really created our brand, the Oracle brand, I've never seen an opportunity like this to take out the winner of the on-premise ERP wars. They beat us in the on-premise wars, and it looks like -- and they missed the cloud entirely. So the scale of this opportunity is enormous. We're getting real deals signed with their largest customers. We're implementing divisions and their largest customers will -- we have a -- by this summer, some huge SAP customers going live, live on Oracle Fusion applications that we'll be announcing this summer. It's not that we just started working with them, we started working with them 18 months ago. And we're taking their first division, it will be live this summer. So the scale of this opportunity is just enormous. And that's going to help drive our growth -- our applications growth higher than we ever dreamed it could be. Operator : And with that, I would like to turn the call back over to Ken Bond for any closing remarks. Ken Bond : Sure. Thank you. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department for any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you. With that, let me turn it back to the operator for closing.

As a result, we caution you from placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks Ken and good afternoon, everyone. I know that many of you listening to this call are still working under unusual circumstances because of the pandemic. A lot has happened since our March 12th earnings call when we were all still conducting business as usual. Within a couple of weeks the mitigation response to COVID-19 reached levels that few could have imagined. Overall, we found ourselves working with our customers and we believe we have weathered the pandemic well and we're pleased with our overall performance in the quarter. To start, we successfully transitioned our global workforce to working from home and our employees rose to the occasion. They focused on their jobs, building technology, selling technology, and most importantly, helping our customers with some of the challenges that have come with this pandemic. Whether it was supporting systems for federal loan programs with partners or helping states get unemployment checks out or supporting the National Red Cross systems around the world handle the massive volume spikes, or helping HHS, the CDC, and other health authorities around the world or supporting over 100 clinical trials that were hurriedly stood up, we were there to help our customers and I think we are much closer to them as a result. There are many, many, many more stories like this, and they all underscore how proud I am of our employees and customers as we are all actively engaged in the ongoing fight against COVID-19. In addition, we decided to provide training and certification on Oracle Cloud infrastructure and autonomous database through Oracle University free of charge to all who wanted it. We saw a huge surge around the world in demand, with hundreds of thousands of individuals across 150 countries being trained and certified on Oracle's latest technology. Now we entered Q4 with an enormous pipeline of transactional business. As the quarter progressed, we saw a drop-off in deals, especially in the industries most affected by the pandemic. As countries begin reopening their economies, many of these discussions have already resumed. Since these were not losses to competitors, we believe that most of this business will ultimately be booked. And while some customers have deferred projects, were also rapidly building new pipeline with customers that are moving their on-premise workloads to the cloud. COVID-19 created challenges that forced companies to reconsider how they work in the cloud, including looking to us as an alternative to AWS and Azure. As we engaged with these customers, they found OCI was more performant than our competitors, more secure, less expensive and easy to use, making OCI now a serious part of the infrastructure discussion. We are also seeing this on the application side of the business as many customers entered the pandemic unprepared and are now showing renewed interest in modern cloud applications with mobility, social and machine learning built-in. Moving to the numbers, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar rates unless I say otherwise. Keep in mind for your USD models that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the quarter resulted in an unexpected currency headwind as there was a flight to quality, which is the U.S. dollar. The incremental currency headwind was more than $200 million to total revenue and $0.02 to earnings per share, both negative. Total Cloud Services and License Support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 3% from last year and accounted for 66% of total company revenue, up 61% -- up from 61% last year. GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.7 billion, up 3% with Fusion apps up 31%. Fusion ERP was up 35% and Fusion HCM was up 29%. NetSuite ERP was up 25% and Vertical SaaS was up 7%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.1 billion, up 3% with database subscription revenue up 6%, which is up from 5% last quarter. License revenues were $2 billion, down 21% after being up 15% last Q4. All in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.4 billion, down 4%. As we saw the pandemic begin to take hold, we acted swiftly to lower our operating expenses by 8%. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, down slightly from last year, and the operating margin was 49%, up 2% from last year. As a reminder, to take advantage of very favorable interest rates, we issued $20 billion in debt in the quarter and the added interest expense, which lowered EPS by $0.03, was not in my early March guidance. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.6% below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items, and EPS was $1.20 in U.S. dollars, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up 5% in constant currency. As I mentioned, currency had a negative $0.02 impact on EPS. The GAAP tax rate was 15.7%, also a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was $0.99 in U.S. dollars, down 8% in USD and down 5% in constant currency. Now for the full fiscal year, total Cloud Services and License Support revenue was $27.4 billion, up 4% and accounting for 70% of total company revenue, up from 68% last year. Total company revenue for the year were $39.1 billion, up slightly in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.85 in USD, up 9% and up double-digits for the third consecutive year at 11% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was up slightly at 44%, and I expect we will see record margins in the coming years as our revenue growth accelerates, and we benefit from greater scale in the cloud. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.1 billion. During Q4, we saw delays in customer payments due to the pandemic as some customers suffered financial hardship. We worked with those customers, and we expect that these payments will be collected in full over the course of this fiscal year. Capital expenditures for the year were $1.6 billion, and free cash flow over the last four quarters was $11.6 billion. We now have more than $43 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion. Now that's down 3% in constant currency, due to timing differences in customer payments, which were more pronounced this quarter, because of COVID-19. But I want to remind you, gross deferred revenue was up 3% in constant currency. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholder through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 107 million shares for a total of $5.2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of $19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 40%. In addition, we have paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share. Now, before moving to guidance, I'd like to restate what I said on our Q2 and Q3 earnings call, which was that our business is expanding and our revenue is accelerating and our relationships with customers is broadening. But for the timing of the pandemic, we had every reason to believe that this momentum would have carried forward to Q4. And though delayed by a few months, we believe, the pandemic has actually focused customers more clearly on the need for the modern technology, which are uniquely at the core of Oracle's offerings. We are confident in our growth, because our mix of business is becoming increasingly favorable. Our revenue is now clearly in one of three distinct groups : one growing, one stable and one declining. What I see is that while overall revenue growth has averaged around 1% to 2% over the last few years, underneath, the growing businesses have grown at a 30% compound annual growth rate. The declining businesses averaged almost double-digit decline and our stable businesses were up 1% or 2%. We are now at a point where our growing businesses are now larger than our declining businesses. And this favorable shift will inevitably drive revenue acceleration going forward. Second, I believe our SaaS business momentum will increase as our very large installed base of application customers continue to move to the cloud and as we take share from our on-premise competitors, SAP for One, that do not have a true SaaS offering. Our products are modern, secure, performant, mobile and importantly, highly referenceable. As more of these ERP workloads move to the cloud, we believe that they will move to Oracle Fusion. Third, we have four decades' worth of Oracle database applications, which have only recently started to move to the cloud. These databases contain the most mission-critical and valuable information of our customers. Now with Autonomous Database, they have a place to go where they get far better technology at a lower price. For those who care about security, performance and cost, the Autonomous Database will be the standard that everyone else is measured against. The Autonomous Database runs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in our public cloud and in a customer's own data center with Cloud@Customer. The Autonomous Database is, without question, our most significant database release and will absolutely drive revenue acceleration going forward as it grows. Lastly is the momentum in OCI that I've already mentioned. We're thrilled that once companies see our differentiated OCI technology, they become believers. This is evidenced by the fact that annualized consumption revenue for Gen2 OCI grew over 140% in Q4. By the way, the ACR for Autonomous Database grew nearly 70% in Q4. These two are getting to be a large number. Across all these product categories, industry analysts are universally recognizing our technology innovation and leadership in the cloud. Pick your favorite independent publisher, whether it's Forrester, Gartner or IDC or any others, you will see Oracle in the upper right of every chart. In summary, it's the continuation of leading technologies favorable mix shifts in our existing businesses and higher growth rates from our growing businesses that give me the confidence that our revenue growth will accelerate this year. Now to the guidance. My guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Currency is extremely volatile, as you've all seen, and it is clear what happened in Q4. However, assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, though I'm not projecting that, I'm just telling you, currency should have a negative 1% effect on total revenue and $0.01 negative effect on EPS in Q1. Total revenues are expected to grow from 0% to 2% in constant currency. And assuming a 1% currency headwind, total revenues are expected to grow from negative 1% to positive 1% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 5% to 9% and between $0.85 and $0.89 in constant currency, and assuming a $0.01 headwind, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 4% and 8% and be between $0.84 and $0.88 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our tax rate will, in fact, average around 20%. Now given the -- I've taken into account, as much as I can, the uncertainty related to the pandemic. Now I'm not going to be providing guidance for the entire fiscal year 2021, but as I said earlier, I have a high level of confidence that our revenue will accelerate as we move on past COVID-19. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. Look, this quarter, we announced new customer relationships with Zoom and 8x8. They were great wins but there were many others. And before I start listing the additional wins, I want to explain why we're winning. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is the world's only second-generation autonomous cloud. Autonomous software technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database, Oracle Autonomous Linux, autonomy is the defining technology that separates our Gen2 cloud from Amazon's, Microsoft's and Google's generation-one cloud. Autonomous self-driving computer systems eliminate human labor and eliminate human error. There is nothing for humans to learn and nothing for humans to do. Eliminating human labor dramatically lowers the cost of running an autonomous system. Eliminating human error dramatically increases data security and system reliability. All of the big data losses at Amazon were caused by human error. There is no opportunity for any human error if your data is stored in an Oracle autonomous system. This is a very big deal. The Oracle Autonomous Database provisions itself, configures itself, encrypts the data itself, patches itself and updates itself, automatically scales itself up and down and continuously tunes itself as the database grows and user access patterns change, and it does all of those things while the system is running. There's no downtime required to patch. There's no downtime required to installing new version. There's no downtime required to double the number of processors that you're currently using or reduce the number of processors to have. It all happens while the system is running. Oracle Autonomous Linux is the world's only autonomous operating system, which provides 99.95% [ph] availability while maintaining itself with continuous security and monitoring, continuous patching and remediation while the system is running. Furthermore, soon all the popular OCI services, compute, storage, et cetera, will be truly serverless and elastic. The other guys don't have this. The Oracle OCI will have elastic compute, elastic storage, all the popular \u2013 all about popular things would be serverless and elastic, scaling itself up and down automatically while you are running. So we keep the promise of the cloud where customers only pay for what you use. Quite often in other clouds, you have to reserve compute capacity, and even if you don't use it, you have to pay for it. That's not the case. That's less and less the case in the Oracle Autonomous Cloud. Okay. The Oracle public cloud now has 24 OCI Gen2 regions live. Soon, we will have more regions live than AWS, which is currently at a count of 25. We will, this fiscal year, add another 14 Gen2 OCI regions, allowing more customers to run in a public cloud without compromising data locality or data sovereignty requirements. For customers who are wanting or needing to run their applications in their own data center behind their own firewall, we uniquely offer Oracle Cloud@Customer, either for just the Oracle database or for all of our OCI cloud services, including our SaaS applications. None of the other cloud vendors have this kind of cloud customer offering. To summarize, Oracle's Gen2 autonomous, serverless, elastic cloud infrastructure delivers better performance, higher security at a much lower cost than AWS, Azure or the Google Cloud. And that's why we won Zoom. And that's the other \u2013 and some of the other deals I'm about to tell you about. Okay. Let's start with Zoom. Demand for Zoom's services has increased almost 20 times since January. Zoom needed additional cloud capacity immediately. Within hours of the first Oracle deployment, OCI supported hundreds of thousands of simultaneous meeting participants. Usage has continued to ramp, where Oracle now supports millions of simultaneous meeting participants. Zoom selected OCI because of our advantages in price, performance, scalability, reliability and cloud security. Every day, our Zoom -- our Zoom conferences move more than 8 petabytes, through the OCI network. That's an extraordinary amount of data. We've been able to scale and help Zoom scale as demand grew. Okay. Another win, in addition to Zoom 8x8, a great example of our sales process, the customer began by moving some services to OCI for performance enhancements. 8x8 was very surprised by the extent of their performance gains by moving out of AWS, moving part of their system out of AWS and into OCI. They were so surprised by the performance gains they achieved and the cost savings they achieved, that they decided to move all of their services out of AWS and into Oracle. Once OCI demonstrated much better performance at a much better price, that sealed the deal, for 8x8, and its growing base of 20 million monthly active users. Another win, the Omani Information Technology and Communications Group, a three-year contract, they built a dedicated OCI Gen2 Cloud@Customer data center, in Oman, offering OCI services, OCI public cloud services to all the different government agencies within Oman. This means they'll be able to have the full benefits of the public cloud, OCI Gen2 public cloud, again without compromising their data locality or their data sovereignty requirements. Another win, Jefferies, the world's largest ninth-- world's ninth largest investment firm plan to move over 500 workloads to Oracle's Gen2 public cloud. Jefferies picked Oracle over both AWS and Azure. They are also using OCI to extend their Fusion HCM applications. Another win, General Authority of Civil Aviation in Saudi Arabia, Cloud@Customer, in the customer's own words, 'The key factors that were considered when we chose Exadata Cloud@Customer was cost reduction by approximately 50%, while being in compliance with government requirements for data sovereignty. Additionally, with Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer, our team could save time and effort. And focus on business innovation by leveraging its self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing characteristics of the Oracle Autonomous Database.' Quest Diagnostics, Quest is the world leader in diagnostic testing. And they continue to invest in the Oracle cloud to support the ongoing battle against the coronavirus pandemic. Quest expanded its current Exadata Cloud@Customer environment, so that the company could migrate, MyQuest portal an anticipation of dramatically increased COVID-19 antibody testing. Quest also upgraded its existing Exadata on-premises environment to new -- the new Gen2 Exadata Cloud@Customer to support both corporate and line-of-business, business functions. Another win, Santander Bank, Santander is consolidating their databases on Oracle's Exadata Cloud@Customer and adopting our Autonomous Database to support the bank's digital transformation. Another OCI win, TD Bank Group in Canada. TD Bank made a multiyear commitment to use Oracle's public cloud, including Oracle's Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure, along with Oracle SaaS, data integration and Autonomous Data warehouse to move their financial reporting systems from an on-premise configuration to a public cloud deployment. Verizon Business Group, a four-year contract. Verizon has already moved over 25 mission and business critical workloads to the OCI Gen2 public cloud, serving its customers around the globe. These workloads process more than 200,000-plus IOPs, I/Os per second with 120 terabytes of data. Verizon uses the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure with Exadata Cloud Services, including RAC and Data Guard, and Verizon plans to dramatically increase its commitment to the Oracle Public Cloud and move more and more workloads over to Oracle. Another win, Cybereason, a four-year contract. Using the OCI Public Cloud to run its own SaaS platform to provide their customers with endpoint protection, response and analytics as a service. Cybereason will be using Oracle's bare metal service plus the Autonomous Database to run their analytics. Another OCI win, a very large European auto manufacturer. This customer is looking for a highly elastic, high performance compute environment in the cloud to reduce their capital cost and introduce deployment flexibility. They will run computational fluid dynamics to simulate car crashes in the OCI Public Cloud to support their car development and scale up -- and they expect to scale up using many thousands of cores by the end of this year. Another win, SGS, formerly Societe Generale, a three-year contract. Moving multiple workloads to OCI Gen2 Public Cloud, including a 34,000 user e-business suite application with the goal of lowering costs, while improving security, reliability and performance. This wins open doors to the next phase of SGS's transition to the Public Cloud, focused on peering Microsoft Azure with Oracle's OCI Gen2 Public Cloud. Another win, Synacor, three-year contract. They are migrating some of their production SaaS businesses to OCI, which enables them to shutdown a number of their data centers. In May, they expanded their initial contract as they continued migrating existing and new SaaS environments to Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure. Sky.One, three-year contract. Sky.One is a Brazilian ISVs that again has their own SaaS applications. After running on both AWS and the Oracle Cloud, they found that Oracle's cloud gave their customers much better performance at a much lower cost. As a result, they are moving all of their workloads to the Oracle cloud. Another one, another win for infrastructure. Manappuram Finance in India, a five-year contract. They decided to move entirely to the Oracle Public Cloud in our Mumbai Gen2 data center. With our newly launched, Hybrid Gen2 -- Hyderabad Gen2 data center as their disaster recovery site. And I'll stop with -- and the last infrastructure win, I'll talk about is Altair, a three-year contract, five times the size of their initial contract, and they're migrating more of their high-performance compute and commercial workloads to OCI. There are a lot more infrastructure deals in the fourth quarter, which was a spectacular quarter for OCI and Infrastructure, but I don't have time to name them all. So, right now, I'm going to move on to cloud application wins. Currently, Oracle is the cloud ERP market and technology leader with over 7,100 Fusion ERP customers and nearly cloud ERP 22,000 NetSuite customers. We have taken a huge lead in the cloud ERP market because our largest competitor, SAP never rewrote their ERP applications for the cloud. Gartner lists Fusion, Oracle Fusion at the very top of their ERP ranking, with SAP in the lower half, listed with the lower half of competitors. This is a dramatic change from a few years ago. Workday has a cloud ERP system, but most of their successes come in HCM. And more and more customers these days are purchasing HCM as a part of an overall ERP purchase, an ERP decision. We've now seen our Fusion HCM growth rates as a result of the fact that HCM purchase decisions are now getting bundled with ERP purchase decisions. We've seen our HCM Fusion growth rates surpass Workday's HCM growth rates. We are already, by far, the biggest cloud ERP player, and it looks like we're going to be able to leverage our advantage in ERP and our scale in ERP to also become the biggest cloud HCM player. Before I go on to the key ERP and HCM wins this quarter, I'd like to highlight a few Fusion customers that went live in Q4 during the pandemic. First was JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase in this past quarter went live in 100 countries, with over 256,000 employees on Oracle Cloud, HCM and Recruiting. JPMorgan Chase has already moved over two million of their recruiting candidates to the new Oracle Cloud Recruiting system. Maybe the most interesting one, Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs initially purchased Workday HCM, but their implementation was not successful. Thereafter, Goldman Sachs acquired Oracle Cloud HCM and they went live a little over a month ago. It's interesting to note that both Gartner and Forrester Research rate Oracle HCM much higher than Workday. Don't believe me, go look at the reports. They're online. Okay. So, where we really distinguished ourselves in addition to capabilities and also other things was in customer satisfaction. Look at the Gartner report, look at the Forrester report. Our customer sat rating is 5.0 right at the top and Workday is right in the middle is right in the middle with 3.0 far behind us. Another company that went live during the pandemic was Mount Sinai Hospital and the Icahn School of Medicine. They went live with Oracle Cloud HCM, amid the COVID-19 pandemic to support more than 26,000 frontline employees with more modern, accessible tools that they could use at home. They replaced a 30-year-old HR payroll system, all right. Those were go-lives that happened during the pandemic, and I think they're very interesting. Okay. We also added a lot of customers in ERP and EPM and supply chain management. First one, KPM Netherlands bought Fusion ERP. They're going to start a complete back-office transformation of nearly 2,000 applications going from multiple vendors' ERP systems to Oracle Fusion ERP, standardizing an Oracle Fusion ERP. A large global networking company is leveraging Oracle's digital supply chain with a single data model to achieve end-to-end view of innovate to commercialize, manufacture to fulfill and design to recycle operations. Another \u2013 a large global insurance provider where we beat Workday for an ERP replacement. Workday was the incumbent in HCM, but we were able to win the ERP deal even though they were already there in HCM. The customer chose Oracle because of our accounting hub and our global capabilities. They also bought Fusion Procurement and Fusion Project Management. A large multinational conglomerate in Asia signed a $13 million ARR deal. We'll be rolling out ERP, supply chain management, HCM to their over 200,000 employees and multiple subsidiaries worldwide in a wide ranging program to modernize their corporate system and remove tens of millions of dollars of operating cost. Another win in the quarter, ERP win in the quarter was Westpac New Zealand. They'll be using Oracle Cloud ERP and Oracle Cloud EPM to reduce cost and complexity of their current environment while meeting local banking standards to operate independently from their parent in Australia. Okay. I'm going to stop doing ERP and supply chain wins. I'm going to move to HCM wins. Okay, first, we won Kroger, North America's largest grocery is replacing their SAP system with Fusion HCM. The key enablers that allowed us to win this deal were our capabilities around all of HCM can operate from a smartphone, AI, machine learning integrated into the application, chat box integrated into HCM, and all of our modern SaaS applications and our Oracle Voice Digital Assistant. You can do a lot of things expense reporting, calling up reports using a voice interface on your mobile phone, makes a huge difference between us and our other cloud competitors is our Oracle Voice Digital Assistant. Another HCM win was at Petronas in Malaysia. Once again, there, we're replacing SAP with Fusion HCM. A very large U.S. Managed healthcare company, they acquired Fusion HCM to replace 40 separate systems managing HR activities. These silos of disconnected data result in a loss of visibility of their most valuable resource, their enterprise workforce.  Other significant HCM wins in the quarter were the United Nations, Norfolk County Council, the University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center. There were lots more, but I'm going to stop right here and turn it back over to Safra. Safra Catz : Okay. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Holly, if we could move to the Q&A portion of the call now? Operator : All right. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Thanks very much for taking my question. Larry, you talked about OCI quite a bit in your prepared remarks, but I don\u2019t think we can hear too much about the success you\u2019re having. In particular, the traction outside your typical customer base with wins like Zoom and 8x8 in the quarter, very impressive. Can you talk more about the impact that the pandemic might be having on your Cloud Infrastructure business? And any change in your confidence level there based on what you're seeing? Larry Ellison : Well, I think what we\u2019re seeing is now that some people are actually trying. The people \u2013 the first group of people that are coming to OCI are people who are in the business providing their application. Its not -- I mean, it\u2019s great we have Verizon, we have end user customers like Verizon, a very big success. They came to OCI. I think, they tried a number of other clouds and they found OCI is better than other clouds. Zoom found that OCI was faster and cheaper, which makes a big deal in their business, right? So they had to expand capacity, but they prefer paying less and getting more when they run on someone else's cloud. So if your business is to build an application in the cloud, and you're going to use someone else's cloud, we think OCI is where there -- a lot of them are going to end up once they try our cloud. Not everyone believes, in fact, most people don't believe that Oracle has the fastest cloud and the lowest cost cloud. But when you come here and try it, that's exactly what you find out. And you're just seeing the beginning of that happening. And I think a bunch of people were shocked that Zoom picked Oracle. Zoom -- I think Zoom was shocked also. I think Zoom was shocked when they looked at the results after they moved their application to Oracle, and we were faster, much faster, and we were much less expensive and we were more secure. So we think as people compare our cloud, our infrastructure, our second-generation infrastructure to AWS and Azure and the rest, they're going to pick our cloud. They just have to come look as opposed to just assuming, hey, AWS is bigger so they must be better. Azure is bigger, so they must be better. Once they look, we win. And I think as far as our end users are concerned, Verizon is a perfect example of someone who tried other clouds and then tried Oracle, found that Oracle could do a lot more for a lot less money than they could get done with AWS or Azure. We have a lot of customers. We've got to get them in. We've got to get them looking. We've got to get them trying our cloud and comparing that to the results of AWS, and we think we're going to get the lion's share of our installed base, our database installed base moving to our cloud. If I'm right, if that's right, our Infrastructure Cloud business is gigantic. We have hundreds of thousands of database customers, including all the largest companies and governments on the planet Earth. Brad Zelnick : Thank you very, Larry. Much clear. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Heather Bellini, Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you both very much for taking the question. I wanted to talk a little bit about the launch of Cloud@Customer Gen 2 that you mentioned with Autonomous Database. And with the ability now to be able to run Autonomous on-premise, can you give us a sense for how you see this accelerating adoption of Autonomous? And then I just was wondering, when you factor in both now that it's available in the cloud, on OCI and on-premise, how much of a tailwind, Safra, is this factored into your view that you think that revenue growth could accelerate in fiscal year 2021? Is this one of the biggest levers to your estimations there? Thank you. Safra Catz : Let me just answer the end of that, and then, Larry, I think you should cover it in much more detail. I have not counted on that in my underlying assumptions, but I do believe that it is going to be incredibly successful. And as our initial customers are using it, this is, I believe, a very, very important, very differentiated capability that only we have. And so, though I've not relied on it for the acceleration, I do believe that it will be an incredible tailwind for us and not just this year, but really for years to come. Anyway, Larry, why don't you comment on Cloud@Customer and Autonomous Database? Larry Ellison : Okay. So when we pivoted strongly to the cloud, we did a lot of database development for the public cloud and the most conspicuous thing that came out of our development team was the Autonomous Database. But it only ran in a public cloud. And we had this huge installed base. We have this huge installed base, hundreds of thousands of customers. Most of the world's valuable data is in an Oracle database. But that's sitting on-premise. And a large bank wanted to use our latest technology, the Oracle Autonomous Database. The only place they could buy it was in the public cloud, they couldn't get it. They could not get it in their data center in Cloud@Customer. We didn't have it. So for years, several years, our on-premise customers had no access to our latest database technology. Amazing. So now after developing all of this for the public cloud and continuously improving the Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle autonomous transaction process system, the Oracle autonomous data warehouse, we finally have gotten around to making it available to our on-premise customers via our Cloud@Customer, Exadata -- Exadata Cloud@Customer service offering. And so, now all of our on-premise customers, big banks, big government agencies, smaller customers who want to upgrade their databases on-premise can now use Cloud@Customer. And we make it very attractive for them to get access to the latest technology. We own -- there's no upfront capital cost to get this thing. It's just like buying public cloud, except we put the database cloud, the Cloud@Customer in your data center in the form of a number of Exadata machines. And then we manage it for you across the network, across -- attached to our public cloud and we manage it for you. Again, what's happened is, for years, our installed base on-premise customers had no access to our latest database technology, our best database technology, Autonomous Database. Now, all of a sudden, they do. We think this is going to be a gigantic shift and a great product for us. We're very excited. And by the way, the other thing that's great about Gen2 versus Gen1 of Cloud@Customer, Gen2 Cloud@Customer has been engineered to be amazingly easy to install and use. You kind of plug it in and it just amazingly easy to install and use. You kind of plug it in and it just works. So we think \u2013 we think it's an easy-to-use system. There's no capital upfront to use the system. We think it's going to be attractive to all of \u2013 all of our on-premise customers, large and small, and it will ease their transition from on-premise and into the public cloud during that long period of co-existence when you have your own data centers and you have a public cloud both operating together. We think it's going to be one of our biggest and hottest new products ever, Autonomous Database Cloud@Customer. Heather Bellini : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Sarah Hindlian-Bowler. Sarah Hindlian-Bowler: Great. Thank you, Larry and Safra for taking my questions. And I'm really glad that everybody is safe and well, definitely important right now. I'd like to pivot and focus on the applications business, especially Safra, given your commentary around growing parts of the business getting larger than the shrinking parts. Can you elaborate a little bit on what trends you're seeing in application software? And perhaps, in particular, I'm interested in knowing if you're seeing any accelerations in customer migrations from on-premise into your cloud, and just any color and insights will be greatly appreciated? Thank you so much. Safra Catz : Certainly. So we have a number of drivers in this business that basically is accelerating the adoption of our products. First of all, we have more and more referenceable customers, both small to a very large, as you heard Larry talk about it. So we have many, many references, which makes it far easier to convince new customers to go ahead and choose us. Secondly, we have a lot of success upgrading on-premise customers that customers that are \u2013 they use products that are on-premise with really no possible way to reach the cloud, and so we've been incredibly successful with the with the old Lawson base and all that. In addition, the E-Business Suite customers, which is a massive installed base has only recently started to upgrade and only about 6% of our installed base has upgraded to the cloud in absolute ERP. So though they picked up pieces around financials, now they're really starting as they build confidence and especially as larger and larger customers have adopted Fusion ERP, many of them have just been waiting until they could do that. And one of the things, by the way, that was a very important was the releases on the supply chain side of the business. Many of our customers are manufacturers and they wanted to \u2013 they like having the suite. They wanted a full suite, of course our financials and HCM, but in addition, they wanted a mature supply chain product and now we have many references in the supply chain, of course including ourselves. And so the momentum has really increased. Now part of that, by the way, is that once customers, start with us many of our customers grow over time. So, they'll start with some module, and year-over-year, it is very common that they will grow their installation at least 20% with us. So, we have a lot of different drivers to the relationship. So, some adopt HCM, some take on more divisions, some role in additional capabilities. And I'll tell you, this pandemic has actually been very, very interesting for some of them, because they got one of the immediate benefits of being in the cloud. And that is for our HCM customers, we rolled out, at no charge, health and safety, which is a module in HCM. And in working with some partners, many of our customers adopted it and to start using it, so that they could better support their employees through this pandemic, and so that they could assist them and help keep track of them and help them where necessary. Of course, nothing like that could have been possible on-premise. And it's those kind of things where we can just roll out new capabilities, which is the big difference between being on-premise but hosted like SAP, and being actually in a software-as-a-service model where new functionalities can just be rolled out for you without you calling in a giant system integrator team to put it in. So, we have a lot of momentum right now in this business. Larry Ellison : Yeah. And I'd like to add to what Safra said. We rolled out the new module. That's something that Oracle made available in our cloud. But then, our customers will be able to access that new module at home, if they\u2019ll take it out. So, and the fact is, all these cloud systems are accessible at home, obviously. They are accessible on your smartphone. So, they're just much more accessible than the previous generation of technology. And that's made a huge difference where people are able to continue operating out of their homes. If you are an accountant, and you're using an Oracle financial system, there is no reason to get in your car and drive to the office. You have the same exact tools sitting in your home office on your laptop computer. Safra Catz : Yeah. I mean these capabilities are not only -- they are modern, they are mobile. You can get to them. But not only that, you can work with them by voice, totally modern UI, much more capable. I mean, it is literally night and day between 21st century technology, which came in incredibly handy during this pandemic, and all 20th century stuff, some of these customers are using. And that's why the moment they get started with us and build the confidence, they realize that this is very, very important and critical for their success going forward. Thank you. Sarah Hindlian-Bowler: Thank you. That was very helpful. Operator : Thank you. And our last question for the day will come from the line of Mark Moerdler, Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Thank you, and appreciate you have time to take my question. Safra, my understanding was that Company didn't furlough employees. They didn't lay any one off. You treated your employees well. Your license sales were down a bit, and yet you beat big on margin. Can you give us some color on exactly what's driving such a big margin improvement? Thanks. Safra Catz : Well, I think you know that we have a very long history of being very careful about how we spend money. And during this pandemic, obviously, there were no people flying around. Only our essential employees that had to go in to somewhere did any kind of traveling at all. We had moved entirely to work-from-home. And so we didn't have T&E expenses. In addition, of course, our compensation expenses were down because of commissions. That's clear. And we really just tried to carefully watch our spending, while continuing to invest in our future. We are very, very optimistic about the strength of these products. I cannot say that enough. And as a result, we're also very optimistic about the capability of our field to kind of, fan out and share this with our prospects. And so we want to make sure we have a very strong technical team in place and a very strong field. So we just did what are the -- the reasonable smart things to do. Everyone, the entire senior management team, Larry and I don't take the credit, it is really the credit of the entire management team that just got a lot more careful about extraneous spending and we were able to bring this in. Larry Ellison : I'd like to comment also. I think, I'll add a little color to that. I think Safra is -- I totally agree with everything Safra said. I think we've always been actually pretty good about controlling our expenses and this is another example where we have executed very well there. I think just as important, maybe even more important, is the fact that our profitable businesses are getting bigger while our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. So the mix, what Safra was talking about very early on in the call, we have some businesses that are in decline that we don't care much about. I mean, we don't care that this SPARC servers are selling less than when we first bought Sun. You know, there are a bunch of businesses we have storage systems. We have a number of businesses that are in decline that were lower margin businesses and we have a bunch of businesses that are on the rise; like Fusion HCM, like Fusion ERP, Fusion SCM, our infrastructure, our OCI Gen 2, Autonomous Database. These are much higher profit margin products. So as some of our lower margin businesses get smaller and our higher margin businesses get bigger, it's really what's going -- what's going on is a mix shift, the fundamental mix shift. And I think you should see margin expansion in good times and margin conservation in bad times because of this mix change. I think the mix change is a very big deal and explains a lot of why even though -- if you look at Oracle by and large over the last several years someone will say, guy, I mean, their top-line growth has not been very strong, but their bottom-line growth has been spectacular. Well, they just must be cutting costs and cutting costs and cutting costs. That is not true. Our mix is changing. Our profitable businesses are getting bigger. Our less profitable businesses are getting smaller. That's allowing us to improve our profitability and hold on to our margins, even when the topline is challenged. I don't mean to take away anything from the team, which did a wonderful job of watching every penny in traveling. Obviously, we traveled less. We were in fewer hotels and all of those things. But it's really the combination of those two things, everything that Safra outlined in terms of how we manage our expenses plus this mix change that had a big impact and allowed us to deliver an earnings beat in a very tough quarter. Mark Moerdler : Thank you. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call and we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you again for joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Holly for closing. Operator : Thank you. Once again, we'd like to thank you for participating in today's Oracle quarter four 2020 earnings conference call.

Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks Ken and good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, I want to make sure you understand that we will be making no comments regarding the press reports about TikTok, so there's no need to ask. So, now to Oracle's results, as you can see, we had a great quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I state otherwise. This quarter revenue was more than 150 million above the midpoint of guidance and EPS was [$0.70] above the mid. Currency helps a little, but this quarter was all about solid execution on the sales side, and disciplined management of our operations as operating income grew 8%, our best result in three years. As I've said previously, and only briefly interrupted by COVID-19, our mix of business is increasingly favorable. What that means is that our growing businesses are growing faster and are now larger than our declining businesses. Our fusion fast momentum is very strong. We're seeing the success of autonomous database, which will continue to get even better now that we have autonomous database available on Cloud@Customer. Our total Cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were 6.9 billion, up 2% from last year and accounted for 74% of total company revenue. GAAP application subscription revenues were 2.8 billion, up 4%, but our Fusion app were up 26% with Fusion ERP up 33% and NetSuite ERP up 23%. Fusion HCM was up 22%. On our Fusion retention rates, which are already high continue to go up. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were 4.1 billion, up to 1%, but with database revenue up 3%. Autonomous database consumption revenue was up 64% and annualized consumption revenue for OCI was up 130%. Licensed revenues were 886 million, up 8%. So, all-in total revenues for the quarter were 9.4 billion, up 2%. As usual, we have continued to be disciplined in our spending with operating expenses actually down 3% this quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was 4.2 billion and as I said, up 8% from last year and our best operating income growth in three years. Obviously, we're thrilled with this result, and I expect that Q2 will be good as we're beginning to see our operating income become a bigger part of our EPS growth. Operating margin was 45%, up nearly 300 basis points from 42% last year. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.1, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items, and EPS was $0.93 in U.S. dollars, up 16% in U.S. dollars, 14% in constant currency, and that is despite an interest expense being $120 million higher year-over-year for the quarter. The GAAP tax rate was 13.3%; also a result of some discrete items and GAAP EPS was $0.72 in U.S. dollars, up 16%, and up 15% in constant currency. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was 13.1 billion, with capital expenditures of 1.6 billion and free cash flow of 11.5 billion over that same period. We now have more than $42 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is 9.9 billion, down 4% in constant currency from a year ago, due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. Gross deferred revenue was in fact up in constant currency, and it was a 2%. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased nearly 90 million shares for a total of 5 billion. Over the last 12 months, we've repurchased 361 million shares for a total of 19.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by 40%. In addition, we've paid out dividends of $3 billion over the last 12 months, and the board of directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24. Now, to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now, currency though is extremely volatile, as you can see in what happened in this quarter, but assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should have a slightly less than 1% positive impact on total revenue and potentially $0.02 positive income effects on EPS for Q2. So, with that, total revenues are expected to grow between 1% to 3% in U.S. dollars and this because we will have slightly under 1% tailwind, so, in constant currency that kind of rounds into 0% to 2%, probably at the higher side. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 8% to 12% between $0.96 and $1 in constant currency, but again that's assuming a $0.02 tailwind. So, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 10% to 14% and to be between $0.98 cents and $1.02 in U.S. dollars. Now, my EPS guidance for Q2 assumes our base tax rate of 20%. However, as you see, it's usually a little below it, sometimes it's a little above it. However, one-time tax events could cause the actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary, but I expect to [normalizing] for these things, it'll average to 20%. So that's what I targeted in this guidance. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Larry Ellison : Thanks, Safra. Let's say, Oracle occupies a unique position in the Cloud markets. Oracle is the only Cloud vendor that competes in both the enterprise applications market SaaS, and the infrastructure as a service market IS, our competitors in SaaS are people like Salesforce and Workday. Our competitors in IaaS are people like Microsoft and Amazon. They're different markets. We're the only one that spans these two markets. It's a very interesting dynamic. I believe we have the best technology in the market today at both the applications layer and the infrastructure layer of the Cloud. Well, analysts have ranked Oracle Cloud applications number one in both market share and customer satisfaction for some time. We're number one in customer satisfaction in HCM. We're number one in customer satisfaction in ERP, I can go on, but what's interesting is that those same analysts are beginning to take notice of the technical quality and customer satisfaction associated with Oracle's Cloud infrastructure as a service business. I'd like to read an approved statement from IDC about their recently published survey. In the 2020, Industry CloudPath survey that IDC recently released where it surveyed 935 IaaS customers on their satisfaction with top IaaS vendors including Oracle, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, IBM, and Google. Oracle IaaS, OCI received the highest satisfaction score and the biggest year-over-year score increase of all IaaS vendors. In addition, 86% of those surveyed said, they expect their spend on Oracle IaaS and OCI to increase in the future. I suspect this comes as a big surprise to many of you, and many of our competitors. Just as Zoom picking Oracle Infrastructure surprised a lot of people in the recent past. I know the biggest question for investors has been, can Oracle preserve its huge market leading database franchise into this new Cloud era? Well, interesting question. Obviously an extremely important question to me and everyone here at Oracle, but if Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI is in fact as IDC describes the best IaaS platform in the market, the IaaS platform with the highest customer satisfaction. And that same IaaS, OCI is the foundation for the world's only autonomous database. Where do you think the Oracle Database installed base is going to go? What we're beginning to see is that it's just starting to migrate. And it's migrating to both the Oracle public cloud the only place you could get the autonomous database and Oracle Cloud@Customer, excuse me, the only other place you can get the Oracle Autonomous Database, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, all together. Customers are picking Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and the Oracle Autonomous Database for a few very basic and very obvious reason; much better security, much better reliability, much better performance, and dramatically lower cost, much, much lower cost than AWS. And that's why people are and I'll talk about the people like 8x8 are another video conferencing system are moving entirely from AWS onto the Oracle Cloud. In fact, there is not a major video conferencing company that isn't talking to Oracle that moving to the Oracle Cloud. Zoom is a perfect example of why customers are choosing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. We see the benefits of choosing OCI and Zoom\u2019s results. Zoom\u2019s recent earnings were stunning. Zoom may be the fastest company ever to have their company named become a verb. At Oracle, we love the Zoom, as most of our employees continue to work from home. And we love that Zoom\u2019s usage of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services delivered triple digit revenue growth in sequential quarters from Q4 last year to Q1 this year. OCI Cloud data centers are opening all over the world at a record pace. We now have 26 OCI regions live around the world, edging out Amazon AWS, which currently has 24 regions, and will be adding at least another 10 regions in the next nine months. We're not slowing down. We're speeding up. Oracle\u2019s Database Cloud@Customer is functionally identical to the Oracle Database in the public cloud. That's why we're seeing the migrations going both places. They're going to Database Cloud@Customer, which is unique Oracle offering and they're going directly into our public cloud. So, the price is the same in both cases. The database is fully serverless and elastic in both cases. You only pay for what you use in both cases, and there are no upfront fees in both cases. We're seeing very rapid adoption of Oracle Database Cloud@Customer among our very largest customers, and this is just the beginning. In 2018, we delivered the world's first autonomous database, and the Oracle Autonomous Database is still the world's only autonomous database. When in 2019, we introduced the world's first autonomous operating system. And today Oracle economists Linux is still the world's only autonomous operating system. Now in 2020, we've introduced Oracle Autonomous Data Guard, which effectively eliminates [site downtime]. If the data center running your application goes down for any reason, Autonomous Data Guard immediately switches and automatically switches that application over to another data center. No human intervention is required to keep your application running without interruption, and no human labor is required to set up and configure an Autonomous Data Guard. To use Autonomous Data Guard, there's nothing to learn and nothing to do, you just have to turn on a single switch. Only Oracle offers this economist reliability feature. Another unique OCI offering is our dedicated region Gen 2 Cloud@Customer. Customers can now put our entire Gen 2 public cloud behind their firewall, in their data center, all of it. It's not just the Oracle Database behind your firewall. It's every service that's in our public cloud, compute storage fusion application, plus the economist database, the Autonomous Linux, Autonomous Data Guard, everything, and we manage it, and maintain it for the customer. You get all the benefits of the cloud, but it's in your data center behind your firewall. No one, not Amazon, not Microsoft, not Google, nobody, but Oracle can give customers a complete public cloud in their data center behind their firewall. Our strategic services are growing rapidly. Autonomous Database revenue grew 64%, an annualized consumption. Our Gen 2 OCI consumption rate was 130%. We're clearly growing faster than the market. And we're taking market share in the process. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ken. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Erica, if you could please queue up the audience for questions. We'll go to Q&A now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : Thank you, and congratulations on the strong quarter and especially on license and margins. I'd like to ask about the guidance. Well, Q1 was strong while the economic destruction of COVID-19 is not yet over and get you guiding would look strongly, can you give us some more color on why you feel so confident? And specifically are you modeling to increase strength in database, SaaS ERP HCM, how big a factor is Gen 2 Cloud in the guidance? And the information would be appreciated. Thanks. Safra Catz : Sure. Thanks for the question. So, it's really following the path that we were on before COVID really hit in March. And so, we were \u2013 what is going on is very basically an extrapolation of what's happening in the business. So, the things that are going very well and are growing and are getting larger and larger is everything associated with the Cloud. And that so does have implications on license because options grew not only, database options grew not only double digits, but actually 20% something. And analytics also grew because, as you know, with Oracle licenses, you can bring them to our Cloud. But in addition, Exadata and some of our Oracle specific hardware that's very strategic, you know, continues to do well, but really the [big barn theatres] are, the fact that our SaaS business is large and growing quickly, and now OCI, and our database cloud products and services are growing and they're getting larger and larger.  And so because we've got annual consumption revenue growing over a 100% and this kind of \u2013 this is now overwhelms the fact that some of our businesses, I'll give you an example, on-premise consulting. This business continues to get smaller, and so it's completely overwhelmed by the businesses that are growing faster. And commitment to our database is incredibly strong. More and more of our customers want to bring their Oracle databases to the Oracle Cloud. And then of course, you have the cases that Larry's talked about, where our just Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Gen 2 is just so good, and so much cheaper and so performant and secure that more and more applications want to come to that. So that's really what's going on. I'm not seeing into the future. I'm basically looking at what's going on under the cover and it\u2019s a very easy extrapolation, as our installed bases of our cloud businesses continue to grow. Mark Moerdler : Excellent. Thank you. Ken Bond : Next question please. Thank you, Erica. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Great, thanks so much for taking the question. And I'll echo my congrats to the company as well. I want to ask about Cloud@Customer, clearly there's a lot of excitement for how it can enable very large customers to adopt autonomous database and have all the benefits of OCI behind the firewall, and I appreciate it's only really become available in the last few months, but maybe for Larry, from a product market fit perspective, can you explain why this is such a big deal? And for Safra, are there any leading indicators you can point to maybe backlog or anything else to help us understand the leading demand for these products, which I assume it supports your confidence in the overall business accelerating? Thanks. Larry Ellison : Yeah. I think I can explain it very clearly. So, we've been working on Oracle Autonomous Database for several years. As I mentioned, in my preamble, we came up with Oracle Autonomous Database in 2018, but if you're an on-premise user, there was no way to get access to the Oracle Autonomous Database until a couple of months ago. So, the Oracle Autonomous Database was available on our public cloud and has been for three years and it keeps getting better and better, but if you're an on a big on-premise customer, you know, you didn't have the late access to our latest and greatest database.  It was a very strange situation for Oracle that our late technology was not available for the vast majority of our customers. All of a sudden, with Cloud@Customer with our Database Cloud@Customer at very low prices you can get Oracle Autonomous Database and all the latest and greatest features we offer in the database. And have it delivered to your data center behind your firewall. And we think that growth here is going to be explosive. We had a version one, and I'll just, you know, full disclosure, we had a version one of this, that was rather difficult to install and difficult to use. And version two is kind of the extreme opposite we learned a lot. And version two is, you know really plug and play, goes in very, very fast. And it's very simple to use incredibly reliable and we're seeing \u2013 and we expect this to be one of the great stories this fiscal year. We think this is going to be triple-digit growth or, you know, Oracle Database Cloud@Customer, and the other thing is it's just going to preserve our database franchise. There's two ways; people are going to make the choice to upgrade or \u2013 and move from their current version of Oracle to Autonomous Database. And once with Autonomous Database they're not going anywhere. Ken Bond : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Thank you so much to the two of you. I just thought Safra, OCI had a great quarter, and obviously, it had really impressive growth with customers like Zoom that you've highlighted, and can you talk to us a little bit about the pipeline momentum you're seeing with OCI as customers accelerate their migrations to the Cloud? And also, can you share with us what type of workloads and applications are seeing the most traction with it or is it really broad based? Thank you. Safra Catz : Okay, let me start, but I know Larry is going to want to say few things about this. So first of all, you have to understand that our Fusion customers are also on OCI, which means that all of the applications that they want to build themselves all custom things, they're on the Oracle database. They\u2019re going to be putting them on OCI also. In addition, just realize that many of our database customers stayed on-premise and waited for us to have OCI Gen 2, which is powerful enough, secure enough, and capable enough for their crown jewels, and they've literally waited. And I know, and I have visibility into sort of the future because often they want to do what we call BYOL, Bring Your Own license, but they often need options. And so I can see their intentions when they're buying those options to bring those database workloads. Now, it is falling into the same categories that you've seen historically with us. The communication industry, the financial services industry, all of the industries that have very important high performance applications that run on Oracle they've been waiting to put them at OCI. And so we see that. Now some of them are putting it in the public Cloud, many of them, actually many more than I would have expected, and then others are doing Cloud@Customer. And this second generation of Cloud@Customers now with Autonomous Database is just so powerful for our customers. So, we're talking about app customers, database customers, custom applications, and then there are applications that otherwise just run as some of the competing Cloud services that when they do just like Zoom did, [but] 8X8, a whole bunch of others that really use a lot of network a lot of compute. May use a lot of storage, may have a lot of egress, you know, back and forth taking data in and out, they realize that Oracle is both more performance, and since you pay by the minute, the day, the hour, it's much, much cheaper. So we compete at every level of the stack. And it's really very, very, very broad based for us. I don't know, Larry, if you want to talk about \u2013 add some more to that. Larry Ellison : Yeah, I\u2019ll add a little bit of color. When Safra says our customers waiting for us, let me add a little more information. A lot of those customers actually tried to run Oracle at AWS. That\u2019s right. It just didn't work very well. So, they\u2019ve decided, maybe they should wait, and so they did. So, they did try. They looked around. They experimented, but the vast, vast, vast majority didn't work very well. We have an Exadata Cloud Service, we have, you know, autonomous database is not available anyplace, but the Oracle Cloud Exadata database service isn't available anyplace to the Oracle Cloud. We're much better \u2013 you'd expect us to be much better at running Oracle Applications than anybody else than we are, and a significant percentage of enterprise applications. You know, I don't know 40%, 30%, 40% are Oracle Applications. So, that's just a gigantic installed base that we think it's going to be moving to the Oracle. We're starting to watch it move to the Oracle Cloud. So that's one thing. So they tried, didn't work. So, they're coming to us. Next thing. A lot of our application customers, you know, we got well over 7,000 customers \u2013 Fusion application customer, 7,000 Fusion ERP customers. Now those customers are beginning to build data warehouses around their ERP data, everyone does. And they're building those data warehouses using Autonomous Database and Oracle Analytics and the Oracle Cloud using Oracle Infrastructure Services. As I said, the Oracle Analytic Cloud is an Oracle Infrastructure Service, is an OCI service. The Autonomous Database in OCI service. So, our application customers pretty much all of our medium and large application customers will become in the not too distant future, will become infrastructure customers, a lot again, and you've got to add them onto. So, these are people that our SAS customers are going to become infrastructure customers. On premise database customers are going to become infrastructure customers, either in the form of Cloud@Customer or Public Cloud. Then there are surprises like Zoom, you know, and 8x8, but there are more surprises like that. I think Zoom is a great example because it proves that the Oracle Cloud is secure, reliable, high performance, and economical. They pick \u2013 because it has nothing to do with the Oracle Database. It has nothing to do with them doing a SaaS customer that was just purely an evaluation of our Cloud versus Microsoft's versus Google's versus Amazon. And another example of that is high performance computing. Car companies simulating crashes. Now, why would anyone go to the Oracle Cloud to do high performance computing when you can go to Google, or you can go to Microsoft or you can go to AWS? Well, because we're much faster, therefore much of it \u2013 we\u2019re much, much faster and therefore they get the simulations on faster, but they got to be willing to pay less. Yeah, almost every car company, well, maybe that's too strong. Half the car companies around the world are now either using our high performance computing or evaluating our high performance computing because we benchmarked so well, against the competition. And this is all new business, like the video conferencing business. So, the OCI team did a spectacular job of building, you know, a second generation learning from what Microsoft did? What Google did? What Amazon did? And then building the next generation, and it's so good, we're winning business everywhere. So, and again, and these are very early days. Gen 2 OCI is relatively new. And, Gen 2 Cloud@Customer is even newer. And these are both fabulous products that I think are going to do extremely well over the next few years. Heather Bellini : Thank you very much. Ken Bond : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, congrats from me as well. Originally, I wanted to ask about the Enterprise Edition of TikTok, but you said, I shouldn't ask about TikTok, so different question, though. The \u2013 would you maybe discuss, like we talked about the strength in Cloud, but the other thing that stood out this quarter was how much better you did compared to your peers on the license side. You know, you were up where everyone kind of was down quite significantly, and you touched on some of the drivers, but maybe you could double a click on some of that again, because that stands really out as something that we haven't seen in the industry. Thank you. Larry Ellison : I'd like to comment on that, because I think our licensed business is really misunderstood. People think are license \u2013 they see licensed business, and they translate in their brain license means on-premise. That is not true for us. It may be true for everybody else, by the way, probably is true for everybody else, but it's not true for us. We have this thing called bring your own license to the cloud. We encourage our customers to buy licenses, buy more licenses and our pitch is, you can run those licenses in your data center on-premise or you can bring those licenses to the Cloud and get big discounts running database in the Cloud. So, you cannot look at our growth and our database license business and say that's the old \u2013 revival of the old on-premise business. That is not correct. A lot of these people we have, when we see [indiscernible] and these big these big contracts for database. The reason people are buying more licenses, a lot of them not all of them, but a lot \u2013 majority of them is because they have the flexibility of bringing those licenses to our public Cloud to Cloud@Customer and getting big discounts. Getting, you know getting a benefit. Getting better prices by doing that. And a lot of people are doing this. So, again, don't translate license to mean not Cloud. A lot of the license is in fact, Cloud, as well as [on premise]. Safra Catz : Right. It\u2019s driven. In fact, it's driven by their plan to move to the Cloud. And that is very, very clear because they're buying the specific option, which as I said, the options number, very high percentage growth this quarter, because it's really in preparation for their move to the Cloud. But I will also tell you that is available also in analytics and in some of the other some of the other techniques, you know technology licenses. So, analytics is very strong. The database options is extremely strong, very much pointing in the direction of moving to the cloud. So that's really what is driving it. It's not \u2013 it's generally not going to be staying on-premise. Some of course, stays on-premise and some will stay on-premise indefinitely, but many companies will be either hybrid, or will be Cloud@Customer, or of course in the public cloud. And that's really what's going on here. And it's, it's really quite clear. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Very clear. Congrats again. Safra Catz : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Derrick Wood : Right, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong quarter. I wanted to ask about the hardware side of the business. This is the first quarter seen without negative growth in a long time and to see you heading 70% gross margin, pretty impressive and far sooner than what we've thought. So, does this tell us you're mostly through bleeding off the commodity pieces, and that the majority of growth is driven by Exadata and Cloud@Customer and how should we generally think about the directional trends from here both in terms of growth and margins? Safra Catz : Yes. So, the hardware growth is entirely dominated by our strategic hardware products, which is really most focused around Exadata. Revenue in Exadata was up 15%. Bookings in our strategic hardware, also up very, very high double digit. And we have actually an enormous Exadata backlog really the largest. It's actually double what it was, more than double what it was last year. And the reality is that this segment is very, very strongly. It has now gotten large enough. And, you know, the issue for us in Q4, as I mentioned, was really around supply chain. And, you know, that's taking a while to resolve itself, but we were able to make and shift a lot of Exadata\u2019s, but we have an enormous backlog still behind that. And so that's really what's dominating. And of course, what that points to is, a commitment by our customers to Oracle, you know, you don't find Exadata to run anything, but Oracle Database, application, you know, Database Systems. And that commitment to the Oracle Platform is really shown up in this area. Cloud@Customer is not recognized upfront. Cloud@Customer is not recognized in the hardware line at all. In fact, it is recognized in the Cloud line when they go online and they consume, and they consume credit. So, Cloud credit, so it doesn't show up in that on-premise hardware line at all. Operator : Our final question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Phil Winslow : Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great start to the fiscal year. Just want to focus on applications. We haven't really talked about that a lot on this call. Obviously, you gave out some really strong numbers with Fusion Cloud, you know, Safra, you talked about some of the puts and takes in the overall business and I wonder if you could talk about those sort of applications specifically? Safra Catz : Sure. I mean, really, when you think of our application business, you really have to think about Fusion and especially Fusion ERP, HCM, our back office, you have to think about NetSuite those are the fastest growing segments. And you have to take into account that we have some other things in that business that are smaller, and some of them are from acquisitions. And that is the less, you know the less strategic part of our business. And as that gets smaller, sometimes replaced by Fusion, that's why that business is really doing very, very well. Because the ERP \u2013 everything is Fusion, but Fusion ERP HCM, this whole area really growing quickly. I mean, what you see is, many of our customers both E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft JD Edwards customers, but we also see a new phenomena, which is historically it would be hard to push a door of an SAP customer, an SAP on-premise customer to \u2013 but now we find that many of those doors are not only \u2013 can be basically are already open for us. So, as the only provider of ERP and the cloud for large, medium, large companies, the Fusion products are really taking off. And so, we've been replacing not only our own products and other companies, but we've made a significant foothold in SAP customers, simply because they're really very frustrated with the vendors that they have installed on-premise. So, this business for us is an enormous opportunity. And it's really just chugging on all cylinders worldwide, in fact. Phil Winslow : Great, thanks a lot. Keep up the good work. Ken Bond : Thank you Safra, thank you Phil. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department for any follow up questions in this call. We look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Erica for closing. Operator : Thank you for joining today's Oracle's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation.

Ken Bond : Thank you, Erica, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of customers mentioned on this conference call as well as many others which have purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will also be available from the Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect those forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-Q and 10-K and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. We'll begin with a few prepared remarks, and then we'll take your questions. However, I want to remind everybody we will not be making any comments regarding TikTok. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra. Safra? Lawrence Ellison : Hello. I can't hear anything. Ken Bond : Safra, are you on mute? Safra Catz : Yes, I'm here. Sorry. Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. As usual, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise. I first want to highlight that since our own migration to Fusion ERP, we've continued to close our books faster and faster. This quarter, we are reporting our results for our entire global operations 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter. In fact, using Fusion ERP, we submitted our 10-K and 10-Q filings faster than any other company in the S&P 500, in fact, 21 days faster than the average. Understanding our business performance sooner is an advantage that we enjoy by using Fusion ERP, and it's one our Fusion customers are rapidly beginning to appreciate. On to the quarter. So this quarter, revenue was $40 million above the midpoint of guidance, and EPS beat the high end of guidance by $0.04. The impact of currency movement was in line with guidance, meaning that our outperformance reflects both continuing execution on the sales side and disciplined management of our operations. Operating income grew 12%, our best result in 8 years. Our total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.1 billion, up 4% from last year. Over the last 4 years, we have doubled the percentage of revenue that is being derived from our cloud services. That is what's driving our recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue higher and higher, now reaching 73% of total company revenue. We anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services continue to grow. GAAP application subscription revenues were $2.9 billion, up 5%, with strategic back-office applications up 26%, including Fusion ERP which was up 33%; NetSuite ERP up 20%, and Fusion HCM up 24%. Also retention rates for strategic back-office cloud applications, which are already high, continued to go even higher. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.2 billion, up 3% with database subscription revenue up 5%. Consumption revenue was up 64% for Autonomous Database and up 139% for OCI, our cloud Gen 2. License revenues were $1.1 billion, down 5%. So, all in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.8 billion, up 2% in USD, and up 1% in constant currency. As usual, we've continued to be disciplined in our spending with operating expenses down 7% this quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.6 billion, up 12% from last year. Obviously, we're delighted with this result as we're continuing to see operating income become a bigger part of our EPS growth. I continue to have a very high level of confidence that our revenue growth will accelerate as our cloud business continues to become a much bigger portion of total revenue. The operating margin percentage was 47%, up more than 450 basis points from 42% last year, and as I said, our best result since 2012. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.7%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items. EPS was $1.06 in USD, up 19% and up 17% in constant currency despite interest income being $120 million lower than last year [ph] and interest expense being $135 million higher than last year. The GAAP tax rate was 17.8% as a result of some discrete items, and GAAP EPS was $0.80 in USD, up 16% and up 13% in constant currency. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $14 billion with capital expenditures of $1.8 billion and free cash flow in excess of $12.1 billion over the same period. Q2 operating cash flow was $1.4 billion compared to $0.5 billion last year, with collections especially strong this quarter from a bigger book of business and to a lesser extent delayed payments received from customers affected by the pandemic. We now have nearly $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is unchanged at $8.1 billion. However, the short-term gross deferred revenue grew 6% in U.S. dollars. The difference between the two growth rates is due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased more than 68 million shares for a total of $4 billion. Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased 338 million shares for a total of $18.2 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by nearly 42%. In addition, we've paid out dividends of nearly $3 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24. Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Assuming the current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 1% positive impact on total revenue, maybe even a little bit more like 1.5-ish, and potentially a $0.03 positive effect on EPS for Q3. Total revenues are expected to grow from 1% to 3% in constant currency and are expected to grow between 2% to 4% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow 10% to 14% and be between $1.06 and $1.10 in constant currency, and non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 13% and 17% and be between $1.09 and $1.13 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes our base tax rate of 20%, but however, as you can see, one-time tax events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to vary. But I expect that in normalizing for these one-time tax events, our tax rate will average this year at 20% or so. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Safra. We just completed a great quarter, but the quarter would have been even better if we would have had more -- and we would have had more revenue growth if we had not been capacity constrained in OCI during Q2. There was more demand than we had supply. To remedy this capacity shortfall, we are adding OCI capacity and building new OCI datacenters as fast as we can. We are now up to 29 regional data centers around the world, more than AWS. OCI added customers and grew revenue at a rate well in excess of 100% year-over-year in Q2. The Oracle Autonomous Database was up over 50%. We also introduced several new OCI managed services during the quarter. The most interesting of these new OCI managed services is for the popular open source database, MySQL, featuring an all-new, Oracle-developed, massively parallel query accelerator called Heat Wave. MySQL plus Heat Wave processes queries hundreds of times faster, hundreds of times faster than the current version of MySQL by itself and other MySQL-compatible databases, such as Amazon's Aurora. MySQL plus Heat Wave is so much faster, so much easier to use and less expensive than PostgreS, Redshift, Snowflake or any other database available on Amazon AWS. The amazing thing about Heat Wave is that you don't have to move your data out of MySQL and build a separate data warehouse to get the huge performance gains. You simply take any existing MySQL or Aurora database, run that exact same database on the new MySQL version that includes Heat Wave , and immediately, your queries run hundreds of times faster. You don't have to change a single line of code. It can't get any easier to use than that. Now I'd like to change subject and talk about our multibillion-dollar application businesses in the cloud. Fusion EPS -- Fusion ERP grew 33% in Q2 to over 7,500 customers. NetSuite grew 21% to over 24,000 customers. We have the top-rated ERP products on both Gartner and IDC. There is no large-scale enterprise application business in the cloud that's growing as fast as we are. In the coming months, our cloud ERP market leadership will become even more obvious when we announce that several major large-scale SAP ERP customers are leaving SAP and moving to our Fusion ERP cloud. Oracle is the clear market leader in cloud ERP. Finally, I'd like to talk about our all-new, cloud-based national electronic health record system and health management application suite that Oracle built in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This system has already been used to register more than 0.5 million people for clinical trials run in the United States for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies. Last month, in partnership with the Tony Blair Institute, we used this same exact national electronic health record system to manage the distribution of yellow fever vaccine in Africa. 7,000 people in Ghana were vaccinated during the first week of the program. We're very proud of that. We are currently in discussions with dozens of countries around the world to adopt Oracle's new national electronic health record system to modernize their national public health infrastructure, thus enabling efficient COVID-19 vaccine management therapeutic monitoring and diagnostic testing. Normally, at this point, I'd begin to read a list of notable new customers that we acquired during the quarter. But our new more efficient track will be to provide you with a list of those customers attached to our detailed financial quarterly numbers. So immersively, you will be able to read the list for yourself and no longer will you have to endure me reading it to you. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Ken. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Erica, if we could queue up, I'll start off the Q&A. And just a reminder no questions on TikTok. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini : Safra, I wanted to go back to your comments from June. On your Q4 call, when you talked about what was going on under the hood of your constant currency revenue growth, and you mentioned that the growing businesses were growing at a 30% CAGR, the declining businesses at about a double-digit decline and the stable ones were up 1% to 2%. I'm just wondering taking a look today and kind of how you're thinking about the future, how is the pandemic changing these growth rates, if at all, especially as OCI and things like Cloud Customer become even bigger areas of focus for customers? Safra Catz : So, the pandemic affects us, in some ways, negatively; in some ways, positively, simply because of our size and the breadth of our customer base, it affects them differently. And so obviously, our hospitality customers have had a very difficult time of it in the main. Some of our retail customers have done horribly, some have done very, very well. What has become very clear to our customers is that those that are digitally forward and that can work also under -- with a lot of automation using a digital tool, using our technology, using the cloud, they are faring far, far better. And as a result, we see change occurring, and you can see it in our ERP SaaS numbers, in our HCM numbers, NetSuite numbers, you can just see that those numbers continue to do very, very well. And then, of course, our Gen 2 cloud, whether it's compute where many of our customers are using way more than they expected to, and as Larry said, just blowing out our internal forecast such that we will need a few more weeks to really catch up with our demand while we're also expanding globally simultaneously. So, we actually believe that this remains very consistent. Obviously, there was uncertainty before because of the pandemic. At this point, I think it's very clear that our business is accelerating, our stable businesses remain stable, and our shrinking businesses whether it's nonstrategic hardware or other things, those continue to get smaller. But generally, the overall revenue number will be showing acceleration even in this pandemic, and I almost feel badly saying, maybe it helped ultimately because many of our customers have realized the importance of using technology to deal with their customers, their employees, and their suppliers. Heather Bellini : Great. Thank you. And happy holidays to you and your families. Safra Catz : Thank you. You too, Heather. Operator : Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Great. Congrats on a good quarter and strong guidance. Larry, I've got maybe a bigger question -- a bigger picture question for you. I know you appreciate there are generational aspects to IT where, most often, the winner in the last generation isn't the winner in the next. But under your leadership and vision and Safra's operational discipline, Oracle has been an industry leader for over 4 decades by thinking strategically about the future. And today, we hear amazing feedback on Oracle's latest innovations, the actual underlying technology like OCI and Autonomous. And by that alone, it would seem the future is bright for Oracle, but we've also seen in the past that the best technology doesn't always win. What gives you confidence that Oracle can remain successful and appeal to younger generation, many who think cloud-first and want to move really, really fast? Lawrence Ellison : All right. Well, let me start in two areas. I've always said there are 2 key aspects of Oracle's future, one is the Autonomous Database, which is a cloud-only product. It works at Cloud and Cloud at Customer. So, it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So, query processing, we\u2019re much faster than Snowflake, the market's current darling. And in transaction processing, we're much faster than anybody. So, we have a single unified database that is fully autonomous. It never goes down. It patches itself. Nobody else is making claims anything like that. So, we have a vast leadership in -- plus we have, by far, the largest installed base. And our database business continues to grow. Some of our other businesses, our middleware businesses have declined, but our database business continued to grow throughout the move to the cloud. So, we're very confident we're going to hold on to our database franchise. We're convinced that -- I mean, they really don't have any strong competition. One of -- and you can see there's not a lot of strong competition from Amazon because what's going on with Snow -- if you're curious what's happening with Snowflake, Snowflake is a decent product, it\u2019s a good product, I think. And it's just killing Redshift over at Amazon. So, it's doing extremely well, but it doesn't remotely compare to Oracle's Autonomous Database. It doesn't do transactions at all. And in fact, query processing is not even close to assess as the Oracle database. So we're -- but it's much better than what Amazon has. And when it's competing inside of AWS, it does very well. It will kill Redshift. Redshift is not very good. So, we think we have a huge lead in database, and that no one's trying to do what we're doing. I mean none of the stuff patches itself. None of the stuff never goes down. That's true. The -- okay, that's holding on to our database franchise. The next thing is ERP. SAP forgot to move their ERP system to the cloud. They just built -- they decided instead to go compete with Oracle with HANA. They don't have a cloud product. We have -- if you look at Gartner and SAP, SAP asked to be moved off the Gartner list because SAP was in the lower left-hand corner. They're not even considered a cloud system by Gartner, SAP for ERP. So, we are -- we have dominant -- we have over 30,000 customers in the cloud, running our Cloud ERP systems. Who's second? Workday with a few hundred? I mean it's not close. And that's the largest applications business. That's the largest applications business on premise, and it will be the largest applications business in the cloud, and we're the overwhelming technology and market leader. So, I think those 2 lynchpins, the Autonomous Database and the Oracle ERP in the cloud secure our future. Now add to that, OCI, which is new for us, we've never been a platform company. We -- Linux is a platform. In the old on-premise days, Linux was a platform, Windows was the most famous platform. There was HP-UX and IBM Metazone offering. So there were a lot of platforms. We weren't ever in that business. We were portable and ran on lots of different platforms. Now we have our own platform for the first time. And our platform is competing very well against AWS and Microsoft, and we think we have way better technology on our platform than the other guys. And we're winning lots and lots of customers to our platform. That's an all-new initiative for us to go into the platform business. So again, we're moving from #2 to #1 in cloud applications. Again, we have the fastest-growing, cloud -- large-scale cloud applications business on the planet. Who has a multibillion-dollar cloud business that's growing at 33%? I mean maybe there's somebody, I don't know who it is. Who has anything like autonomous database technology? And who has a cloud platform that's being picked by some of the most sophisticated technology companies on earth over AWS and Microsoft? So I guess those are the 3 pieces : OCI, Autonomous Database and Fusion ERP in the cloud that gives me confidence that we're going to get our fair share of the new generation of cloud applications and infrastructure. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : Congrats on the quarter. Larry, following up on the last questions, if you don't mind. Given that the world is going to start to vaccinate and we would expect that IT focus could be more on on-premise in the cloud and work from home, I'd like to get a better understanding of what you're seeing and what you're expecting to Autonomous Database running in the cloud and Cloud at Customer, when do you think we see that big inflection we've been hoping for that could drive revenue acceleration? Lawrence Ellison : Yes. So again, the interesting thing about Cloud at Customer, the change in our business model. So you've got to remember, when we sign a huge Cloud at Customer deal and we deliver a bunch of Exadata to a customer, we recognized, let's see, how much revenue, nothing, versus selling a bunch of Exadata. So what's happened -- remember, we're going from selling Exadata machine to delivering them for free and then charging, if you will, rental or usage on the machines as we go from selling hardware to selling Exadata Cloud at Customer. So our accounting model, you say, well, wow, Oracle's revenue is flat. Well, flat, maybe not so bad, actually it's growing somewhat. But keep in mind, where we used to get paid for Exadata machines right away, we now deliver them at Cloud at Customer, and we have to wait to get those monthly revenues over a 4-year period. So what you're seeing is this change in model, and Cloud at Customer is already doing pretty well. It's just there's a huge lag. There's histories. From the time -- there's a lag from the time we start selling a bunch of these things until all the revenue starts coming in. So that's what's going on right now where it's already a very successful product. We're selling a lot of them. Our sales are accelerating, but there's this time lag between sales and the revenue, very different than selling a database license or selling an Exadata machine. As we move to the new model, it's a more profitable model long term, but it doesn't have the instantaneous impact. So there's this time lag. And that's what you're seeing. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Turits with Keybanc. Michael Turits : Congrats on the quarter. Larry, you talked a lot about ERP, and that's been a lot of where the messaging has been around Fusion apps. But this has been a really strong year even during COVID, around front office. Can you talk a little bit about your CX business and whether or not you could see acceleration there and particularly how some of your AI capabilities are playing into that, if they are? Lawrence Ellison : Yes. Well, they are actually because we're making -- actually, I've been directly involved with a major push in CX. And we've come out with several new CX products, one of which is our product and references system where we have a product references database that we sell, and we have an AI engine that sits on top of it. And what it does, it tells -- it interfaces to our sales automation system. And it tells customers or it tells salespeople what product they should be selling this particular customer next. It's got a recommendations engine. And it will tell -- it will also tell the salesperson what are the best references when you're selling customer A Fusion ERP. And then it will actually -- go out and find those references and prepare a micro -- a website, a micro site for that prospect to go to. So we are enhancing our sales automation which, heretofore, sales automation really has not been about automating sales. Sales automation, which was pioneered by salesforce.com, sales automation is all about opportunity management and forecasting. Our new sales automation is all about giving salespeople tools, enabling them to sell more. It automatically generates proposals. It automatically generates reference list. It automatically generates micro sites. It automatically generates recommendations of what the salesperson should be selling to this customer next, what module. So these are the kind of products, what we call automated lead generation and qualification built into the selling system, the product reference system. We also have another new product that's coming out in CX, which we think is very important, which is the ability to launch an advertising campaign from a computer console without going through ad agencies. It's funny, this disintermediates the ad business, so that you can, again, target -- let's say, we're selling Fusion ERP to an oil company, a large oil company, and we want to advertise to people in that oil company, the decision makers, the CEO, the CFO, people in accounting, all of that, we can then launch an ad campaign targeting those people and with references for Fusion ERP. So rather than when they log on to look at Google News, rather than them seeing ads for Nike shoes where they were recently browsing the website, they're going to see ads for Oracle Fusion ERP. So we have an ad system. So we're doing a bunch of that -- by the way, no one is doing this but us. We're the only one that's doing this ability to target people and launch ads from a console. We're the only ones that -- I mean people do it on the consumer side but not on the B2B side. We're doing that on the B2B side. We're the only ones that are using the recommendation engine the way that we are not only to recommend what to sell next but who the best references are and actually preparing the micro site for the prospects to examine those references. So I think the CX is a huge opportunity for us. The fact that we have CX linked to our ERP, we have front office linked to our ERP, linked to our HCM system, it's a huge advantage that we have front office, we have HCM, we have back office, we link it all together. It's much more valuable when you have all the front office and back-office data in a single database. It allows you to do the kind of innovative things we're doing in the front office. So again, that's -- you're going to see a major improvement in our portfolio in the front office over the coming months. Operator : Our final question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Congrats from me as well. You guys have been very good and disciplined. So you wouldn't kind of build data centers just for the sake of building data center. So if I look at the momentum here, like 14 new this year, at 29 now, going up to 38 in a few months. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? What's kind of driving that momentum because that's super impressive. Safra Catz : Larry, do you want to take it? Lawrence Ellison : Safra, do you want to... Safra Catz : Well, let me -- you go ahead, Larry. Go ahead. Lawrence Ellison : All right. We're just seeing demand for our products all over the world. Our data -- we're going to 1 data center, an OCI data center, that runs not only all of our technology, like Autonomous Database and our high-performance computing, all of that stuff, but it runs all of our applications as well. So we're seeing demand for these products all over the world, and we are going into more countries. We've decided -- our strategy is, because we have a large existing business, we have a large existing installed base, we believe we just have to get into more countries than someone -- than Amazon, let's say, because we have to serve those countries where we have a large installed base, like Indonesia, let's say, which is a very big country, but a lot of people don't have data centers in Indonesia. Israel, I mean, it's very important to get a good data center in Israel. Some of the cloud companies has been late to get there. We think that's a very important marketplace. So we think we have been building as fast as we can, but we've been trying not to build ahead of demand. And we were doing a pretty good job actually until this last quarter where demand was actually turned out to exceed our ambitions, where our plan for growth, though it's a very ambitious plan, still on the demand side, we have some large customers that just wanted more capacity than we could supply. And that bit us in Q2. Hopefully, it will be -- as Safra said, we're probably a month or two away from correcting that and getting ahead of that curve. But we just see right now there's more demand than we can supply. So we're going -- as I said, what are we doing? We're going as fast as we possibly can. Safra Catz : Yes. Let me just add a couple of things. One is we have upped our capital spending plans because the demand is so strong that we've increased it by probably this next quarter, probably be 50% higher than this last one just to keep everything going and growing. I also want to point out that some of our customers do not want to go into a big public data center but for different reasons, regulatory reasons or others, one have Cloud at Customer, and that's very important that we are able to offer that. And in addition, some of them have extremely a large requirement and are basically a private region. Those aren't in the numbers you were mentioning as far as data center build-outs, but that's another area where we are expanding and consumption is increasing at very, very large rate. So we're very busy here just keeping up with demand. Ken Bond : Thank you, Safra. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you. Appreciate you joining us today. With that, I'll turn the call back to Erica for closing. Operator : Thank you for joining today's Oracle's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your participation.

We'll begin with a few prepared remarks, and then I'll turn the call over to Safra. Safra? Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken. And good afternoon, everyone. We are again, reporting earnings 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter, faster than any other company in the S&P 500. Fusion Cloud ERP enables us to understand our business performance sooner and with greater insight, which is an advantage our customers are rapidly beginning to appreciate. As you can see, we had a great quarter and executed well against our growth plan. Revenue was in line with our USD guidance while EPS beat the mid-point of guidance by $0.05. Our total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.3 billion, up 5% in U.S. dollars, 2% in constant currency, driven by Fusion, Autonomous Database and our Gen2 OCI cloud. Recurring revenue, as a percentage of total revenue now represents 72% of total company revenue and we anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services grow. Application subscription revenues were $3 billion up 5% in U.S. dollars, 3% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office cloud applications now have annualized revenue of $4 billion and grew 24% this quarter, including Fusion ERP up 27%, NetSuite ERP up 22% and Fusion HCM up 21%. Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars, up 2% in constant currency. Infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 123%; autonomous database was up 55%; cloud customer consumption revenue was up over 200%, but on small numbers. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in constant currency. License revenues were $1.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars and unchanged in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.1 billion, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up slightly in constant currency. Operating expenses were down this quarter. And non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, up 6% from last year. Q3 operating margin was 47% in USD, up 300 basis points from 44% last year, and our best Q3 results in more than 10 years. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.7% slightly below our base tax rate, as a result of some discrete items. EPS was a $1.16 in U.S. dollars up 20% in U.S. dollars, up 16% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was a $1.68 in U.S. dollars, up 113% and up 104% in constant currency. In the quarter, the GAAP income statement was impacted by a one-time net tax benefit of approximately $2.3 billion related to the transfer of certain assets between subsidiaries. To facilitate comparison across periods, we have excluded the effect of this event from our non-GAAP calculation. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.7 billion with capital expenditures of $1.9 billion and free cash flow in excess of $12.8 billion over the same period. For the quarter operating cash flow was $3.7 billion up 23% and free cash flow was $3.3 billion up 26% from last year. We now have nearly $36 billion in cash and marketable security. The short-term deferred revenue balance was down in constant currency at $8.1 billion, while the short-term gross deferred revenue was up 4% in constant currency. As you know, the difference between the two growth rates is due entirely to timing differences in customer payments. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $35.3 billion, up 2% in constant currency versus last year. Approximately 61% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, up from 60% a year ago. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In this quarter we repurchased more than 64 million shares for a total of 4 billion. In addition, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividends, 33% from $0.24 to $0.32 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $20 billion for the repurchase of Oracle shares. As I mentioned last quarter, we experienced capacity constraints for OCI cloud services as customer workloads expanded dramatically. In addition, we continue to land many new customers, including ISVs, and we have some very large users coming online shortly that will require significant amounts of capacity. As a result, we're investing aggressively this quarter, this Q4, both OpEx and CapEx to prepare for this increase in cloud consumption and associated revenue in FY2022. As such, we are going to target a 49% operating margin for Q4. This will enable us to continue to deliver double digit earnings growth, once again, in FY2022 for the fifth year in a row. Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and assumes current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, which is a 4% positive effect on total revenue and $0.07 positive effect on EPS in Q4. It may look like a positive effect of $0.08 to EPS due to rounding, but it's $0.07. However, actual currency impacts could be different [so here it goes] [ph]. Total revenues are expected to grow from 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars and are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. Cloud services and license support will grow faster than in Q3, as well as strategic back-office cloud applications. As a result of the increased investment in the quarter, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 7% to 11% and be between a $1.28 and a $1.32 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be flat to up 4% and be between a $1.20 and a $1.24 in constant currency. CapEx for Q4 is expected to be $1 billion. My EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary, but I expect that normalizing for these one-time tax events, our tax rate will average around 19% or so. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. Three months ago, Bob Evans posted an article on the Cloud Wars\u2019 website in which he quotes SAP, CFO, Luka Mucic making the following statement at an investors conference. And I quote, \u201cI have checked and we have not lost a single ERP customer to Oracle.\u201d In other words, after personally, checking SAP\u2019s Chief Financial Officer could not find a single example of an SAP ERP customer move into Oracle Fusion on ERP, not one. Perhaps he should have checked a little bit more carefully. In Q3 alone we signed contracts, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to migrate several very large SAP ERP customers, to Oracle Fusion ERP. But this was not just a recent Q3 event. This has been going on for a couple of years. I'm now going to go and present a list of over a 100 companies and government agencies that have already moved from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP, or currently in the process of doing so. I've divided the list of SAP customers who are moving to Oracle Fusion ERP into two distinct groups. I want to be very precise here. The first group is moving their entire company to the fusion ERP suite, including core financials, it's Oracle wall-to-wall. The second group has started deploying Fusion ERP applications, but has not yet put in the entire suite and may still be running SAP financials in some places. They have begun the migration, but they are not committed to doing the entire suite as yet, or they are not in the process of doing the entire suite as yet. Okay. So let me go to start the list. TPS Company, an industrial manufacturer of rail cars in North America replaced out all of the SAP ERP with Oracle Fusion, including financial accounting, procurement, enterprise performance management, supply chain, HCM, everything with the fusion cloud, complete replacement of SAP ERP to fusion ERP. G4S plc security services firm, the world's largest security company by revenue, complete replacement of SAP R/3 with Oracle ERP and Oracle HCM. First Solar, North America\u2019s only remaining maker of solar panels in the United States replaced SAP's S4/HANA, Ariba, Concur third-party apps, all of SAP ERP with Oracle Fusion ERP, Oracle Fusion EPM, Oracle Fusion, HCM, and supply chain management. Transit Wireless, a North American telco completely replaced out SAP R/3 with Oracle Fusion ERP and Oracle Fusion HCM. West Sussex County Council, a complete SAP replacement with Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM and Oracle EPM. ERP now, HCM, EPM is Oracle Enterprise Performance Management, complete wall-to-wall Oracle at West Sussex County Council, no more SAP. CEMEX, a concrete company in Mexico, completely replaced SAP with Oracle ERP and supply chain. Niagara Bottling, a North American beverage manufacturer, private labels bottled water, replaced SAP with Oracle ERP, supply chain, transportation management, et cetera. New Zealand Inland Revenue, complete SAP R/3 replacement with Oracle ERP and Oracle HCM. University of The Andes in Latin America, the number one university in Colombia, a complete replacement of \u2013 they had SAP for 10 years, replaced it with Oracle ERP, HCM, EPM, supply chain, sales, everything. Bip&Drive, a travel and transportation company in EMEA, electronic toll payment provider for the roadways in Spain, again, replaced \u2013 was offered a free S/4HANA upgrade, instead chose Oracle Fusion Cloud. GE Grid Software, an industrial manufacturer software for utilities and power transmissions, complete SAP replacement with Oracle ERP Fusion Cloud. Postcon, let\u2019s say the second largest mail carrier in Germany, SAP complete replacement of RP, replaced them with Oracle Fusion ERP and the cloud plus supply chain management. Birmingham City Council, complete SAP replacement using Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM. They are the biggest city council in the UK. Metro Pacific Tollways Corporation, a toll road developer in Asia. SAP replacement got rid of SAP and replaced with Oracle ERP and Oracle EPM. Africa World Airlines replaced SAP with Oracle ERP, EPM, HCM, sales, service and marketing. Batelco, that\u2019s the Bahrain telephone company, they had been running SAP for a decade and they moved to Fusion Cloud, ERP, EPM and HCM. European Logistics and Applied Engineering group, actually the name \u2013 they don\u2019t want their name specifically mentioned. They are the largest private company in Belgium. And they completely replaced SAP R/3 and they thought the cost of moving to S/4HANA and the cloud was much too high and they instead went with Oracle Fusion ERP.  TICO Logistica, a logistics company in Latin America had SAP \u2013 had SAP replaced with Oracle ERP at the end of the sales. FedEx, FedEx had SAP ERP in some places and Oracle ERP in some places. They replaced out all of the \u2013 they are in the process of replacing out all of the SAP ERP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP and supply chain management. Grupo Bimbo had SAP in some divisions and Oracle in other divisions. They\u2019re replacing out all of the SAP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion ERP and supply chain management. Western Digital, a complete replacement, they had SAP. Western Digital had SAP and SanDisk. They had SAP at HGST, replaced all of that out and have standardized an Oracle Fusion in the \u2013 Fusion ERP in the cloud. VP World, they had SAP S/4HANA, SAP HR, R/3. They eliminated all of that. By the way in EMEA marine terminal operator, they are located in EMEA. They are global. They replaced out all of their SAP and standardized an Oracle Fusion ERP and the cloud. Cohu, they are a semiconductor test and handling equipment company in North America. They had a combination of Oracle ERP and SAP ERP replaced out all of the SAP ERP and are standardized on Oracle. This one is interesting. They don\u2019t want their name mentioned. They are a huge European \u2013 North American and European manufacturer of ATMs and they\u2019ve replaced out all of SAP and the German subsidiary BOSSY throughout the world and they standardized on Fusion ERP, SCM and HCM and they have added Oracle Performance Management, Fusion Performance Management. Let\u2019s see. Another company whose name they don\u2019t want to be mentioned, let\u2019s see, they are a high-tech manufacturer in North America. They replaced out SAP R/3, ERP, HCM and standardized an Oracle Fusion, Oracle Fusion in the cloud.  Albelli Group, they are a manufacturer of photo products in the UK. They replaced an SAP with, guess what Fusion ERP. Consol Energy, utilities company in Pittsburgh replaced out SAP with Oracle Fusion in the cloud.  Enbridge, Enbridge is an oil and gas multinational based in Calgary, Canada, replaced out all of SAP with Oracle Fusion ERP. Gemini Industries \u2013 Gemini Energy, they are an LAV, they are an energy transmission system, the largest in Brazil with substations all across Brazil, replaced SAP with Fusion ERP. GoodStorage in Latin America, the self-storage company in Brazil, again, got rid of SAP, put Infusion ERP. Grupo Globo, they are on media and entertainment, Latin America\u2019s largest media and entertainment company, replaced SAP with Oracle ERP and HCM standardized on Oracle ERP and HCM. IQVIA, a complete SAP replacement. They are manufacturing pharmaceutical company in North America. They\u2019ve moved away from SAP standardizing on Fusion in the cloud. Corrigan, a healthcare company in EMEA, long-term care nursing homes, 300,000 senior citizens across Western Europe replaced SAP with Oracle Fusion. NatWest Group, NatWest Group includes NatWest, ABN AMRO, Royal Bank of Scotland, Ulster Bank and more. They had a combination of Oracle ERP and SAP ERP. They\u2019re replacing out all of the SAP ERP and standardizing on Oracle Fusion in the cloud. Wind Tre, Wind Tre is a telecommunications company, the largest mobile operator in Italy, again completely replacing out SAP with Oracle Fusion ERP, SCM and EPM. Okay. Now I want to go onto the second group \u2013 second group of companies and these are companies that had started putting in Oracle Fusion modules but have yet \u2013 they have not replaced core financials as yet. So they\u2019re buying our supply chain. They\u2019re buying our procurement, They\u2019re buying our transportation management. They\u2019re buying our global trade management. But they have not yet bought Oracle Financials. So I want to be very specific that they are buying lots and lots of Fusion products. GN Airlines, Apollo Tyres, Achema, an adhesive solutions company in the UK, Aarhus Kommune, their municipality in Central Denmark, Caesars Enterprise Services, they have an idea \u2013 they bought Procurement in Supply Chain, a big hospitality company obviously in North America. Sheppard Danaher a product lifecycle management, they are a healthcare company. Department of Education and Training in Australia, they bought procurement.  DHL with an SAP replacement in some countries. So some countries are still running on SAP, but the new implementations they\u2019re going in are in other countries, not in Germany as yet, in other countries are, Oracle Fusion ERP. Dove bought supply chain management and transportation management. Temsa [ph] bought \u2013 replaced all of SAP and some of their subsidiaries and bought supply chain warehouse management, supply chain planning, ERP. Again in some \u2013 and some subsidiaries all of ERP including an accounting procurement, all of that. Fujitsu Services, a manufacturer in Japan. Again the parent is running SAP financials but subs all over the world are moving to Oracle Fusion ERP. Keurig Dr Pepper, again \u2013 bought supply chain. Guardian bought all of \u2013 financial services company in North America, bought all of ERP. Honda bought supply [indiscernible] SAP Financials just recently bought Fusion supply chain, Fusion transportation management and has moved into the \u2013 from on-premise to the cloud. InvoTech, again a North American company \u2013 again, but parent still running SAP financials but the subs are running Oracle Fusion. Jackson Life, Lakshmi Cement, I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I am going to read this faster now, Juniper Networks, Lloyds Bank, Move Incorporated, Munich Re, the largest food company in the world, bought \u2013 just bought Oracle performance management. News America Marketing, Orlando International, PG&E, Porcelanosa, Republic Services, SAC Wireless and Nokia Company, Samsonite, Puma, Santander Bank, Therma-Tru Doors. Okay. I am going to stop right there or I\u2019ll take up all of the time you won\u2019t be able to ask Safra questions. Okay. I don\u2019t want to do that. Okay. All right. So again, the list is actually longer than 100-plus companies. I did read over 100 companies as I\u2019m sure you painfully aware of. List is actually longer than the 100 companies I have just read. Some are most important wins and are very largest companies in regulated industries such as banking and utilities who are currently in the process of migrating from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP, prefer not to be publicly named on this call for obvious reasons. They don\u2019t \u2013 even though they are often a reference for us, private reference where people are considering the same move, they don\u2019t want to be on \u2013 their name on this call, because they want to maintain the best possible relations with SAP as they \u2013 even though they are in the process of transitioning away from SAP. All right. So I\u2019d like to make one last point and then turn it back over to Safra. Specifically trying to answer one key question. How come so many customers are moving from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP? This has never happened before. A major migration between ERP vendors. Well, if you want to know the answer read the Gartner report comparing Oracle ERP to SAP ERP. Please don\u2019t take my word for it. Read the report, it\u2019s very short and it\u2019s to the point. Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front, I mean far \u2013 you can find a magic quadrant where there is more a bigger gap between number one and number two. And so, Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front of all the other cloud ERP systems. But what\u2019s surprising is SAP isn\u2019t number two. SAP is at number three. SAP is listed among the leaders. SAP is listed among the lagger. Gartner \u2013 if you read the text, Gartner points out, and I quote, SAP\u2019s own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors. I want to read that again. \u201cSAP\u2019s own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors.\u201d SAP, the once-dominant on-premise ERP market leader is currently not competitive in the cloud ERP market. How could that has happened because SAP never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud. It\u2019s that same with 30-year-old code. They never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud and it\u2019s too late for them to start now. I'll turn it back over to Safra. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Erica, if you could please pull the audience for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Turits with KeyBanc Capital. Michael Turits : Larry, thanks for all the color on ERP. I'd like to switch over to your database. You've made meaningful improvements in both cloud customer and OCI too which both one of the two are required for ADB. So, are those improvements enough that we're now starting to see the upgrades to ADB? And are you able to monetize those upgrades to the point where we'll start to see database growth acceleration? Larry Ellison : The answer is I think there's no question. You're going to see a lot of database growth \u2013 a lot of database acceleration starting next year which we're a quarter away from. But we'll be fine in Q4. Again, its autonomous databases is growing pretty rapidly. But we expect it really to explode next year. And I really do mean very, very rapid growth next year. I'm not really ready to disclose our plans as to why I think it's going to suddenly spike but we expect very, very rapid database growth next year. Michael Turits : Thanks, Larry. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Yes. Hi Larry. This SAP replacement wave, feels like kind of a historic moment because that kind of activity it's usually so rare and these are the logos are pretty large that you're mentioning. So when we see\u2026 Larry Ellison : I acknowledge for interrupting. The really spectacular logos [indiscernible] there's some of them are pretty spectacular on there. But we have some that are much larger and much \u2013 and absolutely shocking. I've been alluding to these, but sometimes we're in the middle of an 18-month implementation. And the customer doesn't want any mention. If I could mention them all, it would be \u2013 it\u2019s front page news. I mean it's a very big deal. Yes. I agree with you. It's an historic event. It is \u2013 I think a long time ago, I said there are two technologies that will drive Oracle's future, one is the autonomous database and the other is ERP. We are \u2013 reading the Gartner report, we are so dominant. Our product is so much better than anyone else's product in the cloud. We expect to get a significant number more than half of SAP's customers we\u2019ll get. But keeping our own, yes, plus getting a lot of it from the smaller companies like M4 and Lawson. Mark Murphy : So Larry, the ones that we see, which aren't too savvy, you mentioned DHL and Honda and Lloyds Bank. Is that a precursor to moving to Oracle core financials eventually. And I'm just wondering which of Oracle strength is really catalyzing that wave of replacements? Larry Ellison : Okay. So there are two lists. One, the first half of the list that I read and they're about equal sized lists where people that are already moved from SAP financials to Oracle financials. The second list where people that had partially moved to Oracle, but still were running SAP financials in some places. In other words, we don't consider it a complete win until we replace out. If we just sell procurement and supply chain and manufacturing and things like that, but they still run SAP financials we don't consider that a complete win. That's what we call our surround strategy. But once you start using our cloud products and compare that with SAPs on premise products, we think the vast majority of these companies that it started the journey, we'll finish the journey. And they'll want financials in the cloud, just like they have supply chain in the cloud, in procurement in the cloud. So yes, we expect company \u2013 we've already seen companies migrate off the second list. They buy procurement, they buy supply chain and they see, okay, I like that. And I'm going to buy financials. So yes, we expect all of those or excuse me, the vast majority of those customers to eventually standardize on Fusion Cloud ERP for everything. Mark Murphy : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Thank you. Thank you very much for taking my question and appreciate the additional color that Safra you gave on the call. I'd like to turn to OCI Gen2. We've been hearing about security concerns from consumer internet companies. To what extent has OCI security technology helped you in business with these companies and is consumer internet a big driver for OCI Gen2, also to be clear, this is not about TikTok, it's that all the other consumer internet company opportunities. Thank you. Larry Ellison : Yes. Well I think there are two things that are interesting about OCI. One on the security front. One is we believe security should be always be turned on and in other words, there is no light switch, security on, security off. We have these things called max security zones in OCI where you cannot turn security off and max security is always turned on. It's a safe place to go inside of OCI. No one has anything like this, where security is always turned on. You cannot turn it off. You cannot open up a link \u2013 a network link that puts your infrastructure and your data in jeopardy. That's one thing. So security is always on. The second thing is autonomy is very interesting, because the Oracle autonomous database, by the way, the Oracle autonomous database is not the only autonomous product we have. We have autonomous Linux that is the foundation of OCS, the foundation operating system inside of the OCI network. Oracle autonomous, Linux, Oracle autonomous database has no human labor associated with them. Okay. So everyone says, well, that's a huge cost saving. It is, but that's not the most important benefit. The most important benefit if there is no human labor, there is no human error. If there's no human labor, there's no human mission, there's no opportunity for an insider to corrupt the system. There's no opportunity for a user to misconfigure a system that creates a security vulnerability that will lead to the loss of data. So, we think one of the most attractive aspects of OCI, other than its high performance, low cost, all of that, everyone likes to pay less and they do with OCI. But we do a better job of securing your data than any other cloud vendor. We've seen that be the decisive feature in winning a lot of these deals with ISVs and end user customers. Mark Moerdler : I appreciate it. Thank you for the additional color. Operator : Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Phil Winslow : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong quarter. I just wanted to focus in on the license line it was up 4% as reported to be a flat constant currency off of what was actually the toughest comp for this fiscal year. Wondering if you can provide some context of sort of what is driving that particularly sort of relative to the strength that you are also seeing in the cloud side? Is this the Oracle database, is this the add-ons to the Oracle database? Any sort of more color there. And then also in particular in sort of in conjunction with the cloud, that'd be great. Safra Catz : So let me take that. So the Oracle database remains very strong and what's good about the Oracle database is you can also bring your own license to the cloud. So it's both on-premise and in the cloud can be used there. And it remains very, very strong. The installed base of the Oracle database continues to grow. And that is of course our central piece. Now, in addition, Java on-premise continues to do very well as more and more companies continue to invest in Java and trust Java for their own applications. And in addition, our vertical applications, some of our industry applications still require on-premise license for the customers\u2019 use. We also have cloud services in many of these verticals, but especially in telecommunications, as many of the communications companies move to 5G, we are a very central part of their transition to 5G and need our license in those areas. So database tops, doing incredibly well, Java doing very, very well and our vertical applications. And then pretty much everything else of course as you know is offered just in the cloud. Phil Winslow : Perfect. Thank you very much for the color. Appreciate it. Operator : Our final question comes from Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. And congrats as well on a great quarter. Larry, it's so great to hear every single one of those SAP wins, especially since investors think of SAP's customer relationships as being so deep. So clearly by displacing them in so many accounts, it speaks volumes to the quality of your product and trust that these companies place with Oracle. So, my question is this, why now, and why from a product perspective, you mentioned Gartner's take, but since Oracle has always competed on having better products, what have you been doing product wise that's enabled you to pull ahead of them like this and what do you need to continue to do product wise to remain ahead? Larry Ellison : So well we started 10 years ago to build fusion financials for the cloud to rewrite all \u2013 PeopleSoft ERP, JD Edwards ERP, and of course, Oracle E-Business Suite, we had these three separate on-premise ERP systems, and we decided a decade ago to rewrite all of that with the cloud. And SAP unbelievably, they just, I mean \u2013 and we did a very good job. We started a decade ago and we did, I think, a very good job redoing a big job, to say the least, redoing our ERP products for the cloud. That said, SAP chose not to rewrite their ERP products. Instead, they made a bunch of acquisitions. They bought Concur, they bought Ariba, they bought SuccessFactors, but they never \u2013 and we made some acquisitions also by the way, [indiscernible] and others right now at other things. But we rewrote everything for the cloud. SAP instead, embedded their own database called HANA and focused on this new database and never really rewrote their ERP code for the cloud. I mean, it's just an unbelievable error. They worked on a new database and the, the thing we're competing with at so-called S/4HANA in the cloud, is what the SAP calls it, is not a cloud product at all. It is the 35-year-old ABAP, this is written in a programming language called ABAP. Oracle Fusion is written entirely in Java. And it's been entirely rewritten overload over the last decade. SAP stuff is literally 30 years old. The same that they've always had, that they now will host for you. So I would say we did a competent job rewriting for the cloud, SAP just entirely missed the boat.  So SAP really is more responsible for our leadership position than we are. Again, they never rewrote their application for the cloud. It's unbelievable what's happened. And their customers are noticing. We offer a new release of our ERP system every 90 days. We offer new features and functions. That's how the cloud works. You are on the cloud, you get new features and functions, you are on this 90-day cadence. We give you more features and more capabilities every 90 days. SAP has nothing like that. It's not a cloud system. It's simply is okay, you can get the SAP S/4HANA and you can get it hosted by somebody, but they don't even have a cloud. They never built a cloud. That's what happened. Brad Zelnick : Thank you, Larry. Larry Ellison : It\u2019s amazing. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for the next 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. And we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today. With that, I will turn the call back to Erica for closing. Operator : Thank you for joining today's Oracle's third quarter of 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Ken Bond : Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from our Investor Relations website as well. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements being made today. As a result, we caution you from placing undue reliance on these you from placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and encouraging you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking the questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We are again reporting earnings earlier than last year. And with Fusion ERP, we are now filing our quarterly and annual financial statements faster than any other company in the S&P 500. This is possible because of the highly automated and machine learning-enabled system that helps us complete the accounting of financial transactions much more quickly. As you can see, we had a fantastic quarter with revenue nearly $200 million above my guidance. Q4 is really a story of every product, every region, and every metric exceeding expectations. The credit for the excellent full year results in the quarter goes to our global team of employees who supported our customers without interruption this past year. We were successful by continuing to deliver best-in-class products and services, both infrastructure and applications to help our customers in their digital transformation, many who\u2019ve reinvented themselves in real time because of the pandemic. Now, the growth rates we are reporting today are entirely organic, reflecting true [Technical Difficulty] related growth across our product portfolio. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.4 billion, up 8% in U.S. dollars, 4% in constant currency driven by Fusion, Autonomous Database, and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues were $3 billion, up 11% in U.S. dollars and 7% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office cloud applications now have an annualized revenue of $4.4 billion and grew 32% in constant currency for the quarter, including Fusion ERP, which was up 42%. NetSuite ERP, up 22%; and Fusion HCM, up 30%. Our back-office cloud application revenue is not only bigger than our nearest competitor but also growing more than twice as fast. Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 6% in USD, up 2% in constant currency. Infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $2.3 billion. OCI consumption revenue, which was up 103% in constant currency; Autonomous Database, up 56%; and cloud customer revenues, up 50%. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 8% in USD, 4% in constant currency. Customers are adopting OCI because of its unique focus on performance and security at the most competitive price. The highly differentiated Autonomous Database, which is available there and the flexibility of deploying Oracle Cloud, both in our own data center, what we call public cloud or behind our customers\u2019 firewall, Cloud@Customer. License revenues were $2.1 billion [ph], up 9% in USD, 5% in constant currency. So, all-in, total revenues for the quarter were $11.2 billion, up 8% in USD, 4% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 6% in constant currency this quarter, and we made significant investments in our cloud business. And while you can see some of the ROI in FY21\u2019s revenue growth, we expect the most of the return will be realized in FY\u201922 and beyond. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.4 billion, up 6% in USD; and the operating margin was 49%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 10.7% and below our base tax rate of 20% as a result of some discrete items that hit in the quarter. EPS was $1.54, up 29% in USD and up 22% in constant currency. By the way, GAAP EPS was $1.37, up 39% in USD, 31% in constant currency. Now, for the full fiscal year, total cloud services and license support revenue was $28.7 billion, up 5% in USD, up 3% in constant currency. Total Company revenues for the year were $40.5 billion, up in 4%, USD, 2% in constant currency. FY\u201921 recurring cloud services and license support revenue as a percentage of total revenue now represents 71% of total company revenue, up from 70% last year, and we anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services grow and accelerate. Non-GAAP EPS for the year was $4.67, up 21% in USD, up 18% in constant currency, marking the fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. The full-year operating margin percentage was 47%, actually our best result in seven years and up 245 basis points from 44% last year. Operating cash flows over the last four quarters was a record $15.9 billion, up 21% in USD. Our free cash flow was also a record, $13.8 billion, up 19% in USD with capital expenditures of $2.1 billion during the year. For the quarter -- back to the quarter, operating cash flow was $4.8 billion, up 34% in USD; and free cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 30% from last year. As in the side, free cash flow would have been about 30 -- $300 million lower as some CapEx targeted for Q4 was actually spent in the last two weeks, so in early June. We now have more than $46 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.8 billion, up 10% in USD, 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO balance is $41.3 billion, up 8% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 60% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As you\u2019ve heard me say many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 107 million shares for a total of $8 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 329 million shares for a total of $21 billion. Over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 44%. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Now to the guidance. Let me first start with my confidence in the continuation of our revenue growth acceleration for fiscal-year 2022. As I\u2019ve said many times over the last two years, our overall revenue growth is continuing to accelerate as our fast-growing cloud business becomes a larger portion of our total revenue. I see total revenue for fiscal 2022 growing faster than fiscal \u201821 with constant currency revenue growth somewhere in mid-single digits. Given our increasing confidence in revenue growth and our unique and differentiated position in the market, we are going to invest back in the business at a greater rate, so we can further accelerate the top line. We also see cloud as being fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise. And as everyone knows, our annual non-GAAP margins of 47%, and that\u2019s what we run the business at, are in fact the highest non-GAAP margins of all of our competitors. And we believe that now is the right time to increase our investment to capture market share. As such, we expect to roughly double our cloud CapEx spend in FY 2022 to nearly $4 billion. We are confident that the increased return in the cloud business more than justifies this increased investment and our margins will expand over time. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q1. I\u2019ll review this on a non-GAAP basis and assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now. Currency should be about 2% to 3% positive on total revenue and $0.03 positive on EPS in Q1, however, currency fluctuates and the actual impact could be different. Total revenues for Q1 are expected to grow from 3% to 5% in USD and are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. Cloud service and license support revenue growth for Q1 will be about the same as Q4 at 4% in constant currency and then climb through the year. As a result of the increased investment in the quarter, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 2% and 6% and be between $0.94 and $0.98 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS growth in constant currency is expected to be anywhere from negative to positive 2 and be between $0.91 and $0.95 in constant currency. Now, my EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to vary, but I expect that normalizing for these onetime events, our tax rate will average around 19% or so. Finally, we want to thank our employees around the world for working so hard and staying focused on our customers and partners during the pandemic. And we also want to send particular thanks and warmest wishes to our employees in COVID hotspots who\u2019ve been hit particularly hard in [Technical Difficulty] and with whom we have been working very hard to support them, including providing vaccination. We just want to thank all of you and congratulate you all on a successful year and year-end. You\u2019ve all been remarkable. So, thank you. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Larry Ellison : Thanks, Safra, and great job. Your team delivered a spectacular Q4. Clearly, our strategy to develop cloud applications with cloud infrastructure is now beginning to drive top line revenue growth to go along with years of consistent double-digit earnings per share growth. Our strategy is as easy to explain as it is technically challenging to implement. That\u2019s a good thing. If it wasn\u2019t hard to do, others would be able to do it. Our strategy and applications depends on Oracle becoming the world\u2019s largest provider of cloud ERP systems. Then, building upon that strong ERP foundation, we\u2019re going to expand into manufacturing, CRM and industry-specific applications. We are successfully executing this strategy. Oracle Fusion and NetSuite are now the world\u2019s two most popular cloud ERP systems. SAP, the leader in on-premise ERP, never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud. This has caused hundreds of customers to abandon SAP and migrate to Oracle Fusion ERP. That\u2019s already happened. But over the coming months, several more major banks and utilities and a lot of other companies will complete their Oracle Fusion implementation projects and go live on Fusion ERP. Oracle is taking massive amounts of share away from SAP ERP. It\u2019s crucial to our future. While our Fusion and NetSuite [Technical Difficulty] have long been growing, we have also developed a complete new generation of cloud application suites. Our new manufacturing systems fully support and manage automated robotic factories. No one else does that. Our new cloud CRM applications help you sell more by fully automated internet advertising, lead generation and qualification. Nobody else does that. And we\u2019re launching cloud application suites for 2 new industries, health care, and state and local government. Our health care initiative is an outgrowth of the national public health management systems that we built to manage the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and vaccine distribution in the United States and in other countries around the world. In summary, our cloud application portfolio is more complete than other apps vendors and better integrated because almost all of our applications were developed internally, not acquired. Our infrastructure strategy depends on AI technology, specifically, neural networks and machine learning that we use to develop second generation autonomous cloud services, such as the Oracle Autonomous Database, the Oracle Autonomous Linux operating system and an array of autonomous cybersecurity defense bots that automatically identify and neutralize cyber attacks. All of Oracle\u2019s cloud applications then run within the defensive perimeter of Oracle\u2019s autonomous cloud infrastructure, the most reliable and secure platform in the world. And that\u2019s increasingly important in a world plagued by cyber warfare, data theft and ransomware. Oracle\u2019s Autonomous Database and other autonomous services eliminate human labor. No human labor means no human error or opportunity for human mischief. Autonomy makes computer systems and cars much safer and more reliable. The Oracle Autonomous Database offers 99.995% availability. That means only a few minutes of downtime a year. And we have zero downtime security patching and upgrades, available today for infrastructure and very soon available for all of our applications. Economics is also important. OCI has, by far, the best cost performance of any infrastructure hyperscaler. That\u2019s why so many service providers, like Zoom, have chosen to expand into OCI. OCI\u2019s cost performance is continuously getting better. Our new version of MySQL, the world\u2019s most popular open-source database, just got between 10 and 100 times faster. And when you charge by the minute, every minute you don\u2019t use is money saved. Our new ARM microprocessors from technology partner Ampere delivers much better compute cost performance than either Intel or AMD, and by far, the lowest energy usage of any server microprocessor in the world. So, our latest infrastructure technologies are Good for our applications, good for your budget, good for the health of the planet and very good for Oracle\u2019s future. Back to you, Safra. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Erica, if you could please now prepare the audience to poll for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : Thank you. And congratulations on to the team on a clean, nice quarter. I\u2019d like to try to get some more color on the drivers of the success of the Oracle Cloud ERP solution. Can you give us some more sense of how much of Oracle Fusion ERP is from new Oracle ERP customers? How much is international versus the U.S.? How much is large enterprise? Where is the sweet spot? Any color you can give to get a sense of what\u2019s really driving the growth, and how much of that is new to versus existing customers would be very helpful. Larry Ellison : Yes. This is Larry. There are more new customers than upgrades from on-premise ERP with Oracle Fusion. So, it\u2019s probably about 60-40, in the 60s, it\u2019s probably not quite two to one new customers, but most of the -- a majority of the business is coming from new customers. We\u2019re also upgrading our installed base of the E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft and JD Edwards to Fusion. But again, more revenue is coming from new customers, [Technical Difficulty] customers, people like that. They are coming from our on-premise installed base. So, that\u2019s really the trend. And we think that trend is actually going to accelerate in favor of new customers because the SAP migration phenomenon is relatively recent in the last 12 months -- over the last two years, but it\u2019s really accelerating now in the last 12 months. So, we think that\u2019s going to hold. So, another way to look at it is it\u2019s a very -- as people migrate to Oracle Fusion ERP and smaller companies migrate to NetSuite ERP, these are both enormous businesses. Fusion ERP, I mean, it is certainly much bigger than $10 billion -- and NetSuite is bigger than $10 billion, Fusion is probably bigger than $20 billion as these businesses mature. Safra Catz : Yes, and as far as where it\u2019s happening, I have to tell you, it is so broad-based. It is a worldwide phenomenon for us. Our Fusion, NetSuite are just chugging along. It was an incredible, incredible Q4, and Q1 looks enormous. So imagine, bookings are way up, and there\u2019s just a lot of success. We have so many customers that have gone live. So, we have references from some of the largest companies in the world to really small or medium-sized companies that it\u2019s pretty consistent, almost any prospect can find many companies just like it already being incredibly successful. And I think that, frankly, the pandemic taught many of our prospects and customers that moving quickly is really required these days. I think that folks used to think moving quickly is risky. I think, they really saw that they had to move to much more modern, flexible, digital businesses, and that we are the [Technical Difficulty] destination for them for the back-office without a doubt. Larry Ellison : I\u2019d like to add one thing. We almost never lose a competitive ERP deal in the cloud, virtually never. Operator : And our next question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the questions, and congratulations on another year of 20% -- or a year of 20% plus earnings growth. And frankly, nice to see the stock starting to reflect the durability of earnings growth you guys have seen over the past couple of years. So, it\u2019s nice to see that. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the infrastructure side of the equation, and in particular, OCI. Another quarter of, I think you said, 103% growth in OCI consumption. Can you dig in a little bit on sort of what are the workloads that are being done on OCI? Is this just all Oracle Database workloads? We know there\u2019s a lot of those out there that just run so well on OCI, or is there a broader perspective of the big workloads that guys are bringing over, not looking for commentary on any specific customer, but just broadly what do you see in this space? Where do you guys do well? Where do you win with OCI? Larry Ellison : Okay. I mean, it\u2019s really easy to remember. About half of it\u2019s database, half of it\u2019s everything else. So, I mean everything else -- I mean, the database, you understand. They\u2019re lifting and shifting existing database workloads and developing new Oracle Database workloads on OCI. The other thing varies from things like Zoom who have moved over, but also in simulations, and we\u2019re very, very good at running simulation software. So, almost -- so a large number of car companies have moved all of their PaaS simulations to the Oracle Cloud because we do it faster and cheaper than any other cloud. So, we have actually a pretty balanced portfolio right now where we have the Oracle database contributing to half of the workloads running on -- running in OCI and the other half is a variety of new customers doing new applications, not database related. Safra Catz : Keith, thank you. First of all, thank you for [Technical Difficulty]. The reality is that any customer that is really focused on performance, security like Larry mentioned, and cost, which happens to show up in many, many workloads, one of the areas we\u2019re doing particularly well are ISVs who are obviously experts at running their workloads. They\u2019re in the business and they are coming to us extensively because they\u2019re really studying the benefits that we bring them. And of course, as I mentioned and as we never stop mentioning, security with what\u2019s going on these days. You really have to be in a cloud that is basically obsessed with security while still giving you incredible performance at lower cost. I mean, once we are given a try, what happens is the workload comes, one workload comes, and it\u2019s usually followed by many others. And so, it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve got a lot of momentum, let\u2019s say. Larry Ellison : And I want to emphasize one thing, I said it, but I want to say it again, is there are new Oracle workloads being developed, especially in the area of genomics where there have been a number of new databases moved to Oracle and OCI that track things like the genetic variants of COVID-19. But, there are a number of these things, and you\u2019ll see a whole series of announcements coming out where we\u2019ve moved aggressively into health care, and one of the big new applications for our database is just -- is tracking the genomics of pathogens, and those databases are being developed right on Oracle Autonomous Database from scratch. Operator : Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen & Company. Derrick Wood : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. And congrats as well on a strong quarter. I\u2019ve got one for Safra and one for Larry. Safra, in the past, you\u2019ve talked about the potential revenue opportunity for the app space, if you were to migrate everybody to SaaS. So, I wanted to ask about the database side and in particular, Exadata. Can you give us a sense of what the revenue potential or uplift could be if you shifted all Exadata customers to Cloud@Customer? And how you feel about the strength of those motions heading into the new fiscal year? And then, for Larry, I mean, as you guys push to drive adoption of Autonomous Database, should we think of Cloud@Customer being the biggest vehicle for adoption, or what routes to market do you see working best? Safra Catz : Okay. Let me get it started, and then Larry can finish. So, Derrick, I\u2019m glad you asked because when customers move from running their own dozen or 100 Exadatas, when it\u2019s time for a refresh or a new set, we prefer that they go to Cloud@Customer and -- or have a dedicated region. However, just so that you know since you all focus on the numbers, you have to understand that when we sell hardware, regular way, we recognize all that revenue once it\u2019s delivered, all that hardware is delivered. But, when we install Cloud@Customer, Exadata Cloud@Customer or dedicated region, we don\u2019t recognize that revenue upfront. And so, -- and you don\u2019t even see that that is all happening right now in our income statement and yet we\u2019re still growing. So, as a general matter, first of all, it is much -- even though we believe we make around 3 times, maybe more, in revenue in the case of Cloud@Customer versus selling -- just selling the hardware can be anywhere from 3 to 5 times, the customer actually ends up spending less because we manage their entire estate. We update their databases, et cetera, depending on what services they\u2019re using, and they get the benefit of always having capacity, always having the most up-to-date system, the most secure system and patched and fully managed by us. So, though, ultimately, they give us significantly more money 3 to 5 times as much, in fact, they end up spending much less to maintain that estate. So, for -- it\u2019s kind of a win-win because we\u2019re much more efficient, fully automated and save them the immense amount of labor it takes to run these very critical production systems. Okay. I guess, Larry\u2019s question, what was it again, Derrick? Derrick Wood : It was around Autonomous Database and what\u2019s kind of the route to market to drive adoption, is Cloud@Customer really the biggest vehicle, or are there other routes that are working well too? Larry Ellison : Well, the Autonomous Database only runs in the cloud. It does not run on-premise. It doesn\u2019t run on -- even at the Exadata appliance. It runs on [Technical Difficulty] or public cloud. So right now, the public cloud is the most popular route for Autonomous Database and Cloud@Customer is becoming more popular as people scale up, so. But right now, the most popular way to use Autonomous Database is in the OCI public cloud. Operator : Our next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much. And thanks for taking the question. I was wondering, Safra, could you just talk about sort of the performance in Europe this quarter? It looks like it bounced back nicely. And I guess, along those same lines, can you just talk about cloud adoption on certain [Technical Difficulty] just maybe what you\u2019re seeing in the -- I assume you guys are probably leading the charge. But what you\u2019re seeing in other regions just following maybe close behind it? Thanks. Safra Catz : Sure. So, first of all, I have two new leaders in Europe, Middle East, Africa. I have a very refreshed and new and really successful management team in Europe. And they are pretty much firing on all cylinders. It is extremely broad throughout Europe, Middle East, all of EMEA. [Technical Difficulty] tell you incredible strength worldwide. Latin America doing phenomenally; Japan doing phenomenally; as a result, JPAC doing very, very well; and of course, led by North America. I have to tell you, it\u2019s been an amazing year. It was a phenomenal quarter, but truly an amazing year worldwide. And I\u2019m more than satisfied. I am delighted by the results of the team. And for me, this was my first full year with the field. So, I really applaud the team for doing a spectacular job worldwide. Operator : Our final question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. Safra, the one thing that was interesting that we didn\u2019t really talk that much about is your RPO and RPO growth. Can you talk about it again? Because like the growth there is actually even better than I see on the revenue line. And that, to me, suggests that this wasn\u2019t just Q4. It looks like things are coming together broad-based in the coming quarters as well. Thank you. Safra Catz : Yes, Raimo, you are so right. Q4, but really, it\u2019s just coming together all around, the RPO. I\u2019m glad [Technical Difficulty] really, really strong bookings are -- were truly enormous. Obviously, they don\u2019t show up in the income statement right away, but they -- the future is just so positive. And you might have heard me, I was hinting to that in my comments. And one of the reasons we\u2019re so comfortable leaning into our investment because we really want to make sure we\u2019ve got the capacity to take on the enormous amount of bookings that are flying in and that both were [Technical Difficulty] during the year and are going on line, and so, will be recognized over this next year and beyond. But, there is just an enormous backlog for us of customers that are going live and that will start consuming and we\u2019re very optimistic. So, thank you so much for asking, and I\u2019m glad you noticed that. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Okay. Congrats. Ken Bond : Thank you, Safra. If there are any questions coming out of this call, please feel free to call the Investor Relations hotline. Otherwise, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Erica for closing. Operator : Thank you for joining today\u2019s Oracle\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from Investor Relations website following this call. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you from placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a great quarter as total revenue was $100 million above the midpoint of my constant currency guidance, with outperformance coming from all parts of our business. EPS was also very strong and was $0.08 above the midpoint of my constant currency guidance. As the dollar strengthened from when I gave guidance and it strengthened significantly, we didn't get the benefit we would have gotten had it stayed at the same level throughout the quarter. Now from here on, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise. So total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.4 billion, up 6% in USD, up 5% in constant currency and accounted for 76% of total company revenue. Total cloud revenues are now at an annualized revenue of $10 billion with an accelerating growth rate that we expect will exit the fiscal year in the mid-20s. GAAP application subscription revenues were $3 billion, up 7% with Fusion apps up 26% in USD and 24% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office applications grew 25% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up 30% and NetSuite ERP, up 26%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 3%. And excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew in the mid-30s, and we saw triple-digit booking growth this quarter. So I expect the infrastructure revenue growth will ramp higher through the fiscal year. OCI consumption revenue, which includes Autonomous Database, was up 80% in constant currency and Cloud at Customer revenue was up 44%. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 6% in USD, up 5% in constant currency and that's up from 4% last quarter. License revenues were $813 million, down 8% after a tough compare from last year's Q1. So all-in, total revenues for the quarter were $9.7 billion, up 4% in USD, up 2% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 3% this quarter. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 84%, and the gross profit dollars grew 2%. I expect the full-year growth in gross profit dollars for cloud services and license support will be similar to last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 2% from last year, and the operating margin was 45%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18%, slightly below our base tax rate of 19%, and earnings per share was US$1.03, up 11% in USD and up 9% in constant currency. As a result of some discrete items, the GAAP tax rate was 8.4%, and GAAP EPS was US$0.86, which was up 19% in U.S. dollars and up 16% in constant currency. Operating cash flow for the last four quarters was $15.3 billion, up 17% in USD, and our free cash flow over the same period was $12.6 billion, up 9% in USD with capital expenditures of $2.8 billion, also over the same period. CapEx for Q1 alone was $1.1 billion. We now have more than $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $10 billion, up 1% from a year-ago due to timing differences in customer payments, but with gross deferred revenue up 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation or RPO, our balance is $38.7 billion, up 10% in constant currency, due to strong bookings. Approximately 60% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 94 million shares for a total of $8 billion. And over the last 10 years, we have reduced the shares outstanding by 46% and in average price, that's about half the current share price. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.2 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Now to guidance what you are all waiting for. I remain highly confident that fiscal year 2022 revenue growth will accelerate because our fast-growing cloud businesses are becoming a larger portion of our total revenue. I see total revenue growth for fiscal year 2022, which is the one we\u2019re in, somewhere in the mid-single digits in constant currency and accelerating. Cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise. And as we look ahead to next year, we expect company operating margins will be the same or better than pre-pandemic levels. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q2. And I will review this on a non-GAAP basis. Assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a very minor positive effect on total revenue and EPS in Q2. Total revenue for Q2 are expected to grow between 3% to 5% in both USD and constant currency. Cloud services and license support revenue for Q2 are expected to grow more than 5% in both USD and constant currency and then climb higher through the second half of the fiscal year. Non-GAAP EPS for Q2 is expected to grow between 2% and 6% in both USD and constant currency and be between $1.09 and $1.13. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a base rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary both up and down, but I expect that in normalizing for these one-time tax events, our non-GAAP tax rate will average around 19% or so. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Safra. Oracle Cloud business, infrastructure plus applications has rapidly grown to $10 billion a year. Oracle and NetSuite were pioneers in cloud application. Oracle and NetSuite being the very first cloud company of any kind. Several years later, Amazon launched the very first cloud infrastructure company. Oracle Fusion ERP has over 8,000 cloud customers. NetSuite ERP has over 28,000 cloud applications customers. Oracle is the overwhelming market leader in the global cloud ERP market. Oracle Cloud ERP is currently used by many of the largest, most complex companies on Earth. This past quarter, in Q1, a company I couldn't name until now, major portion of Bank of America went live on Oracle Fusion ERP consolidating ledgers in 33 separate countries into one global cloud ledger. Also in Q1, another huge bank, Macquarie, the largest investment bank in Australia went live with Oracle Fusion ERP. Also in Q1, Vanguard, the largest global mutual fund provider went live with Oracle Fusion ERP, not just in Q1. Oracle Fusion is building a very strong position in the world's largest financial services company. HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon, JPMorgan Chase, they are all live on Oracle's Fusion applications. We have started working with our strategic partners and banking to develop a new generation of cloud B2B financing and payment systems. There are things you can do on the cloud you could never do on-premise. There are opportunities in the cloud. If you are the largest ERP supplier, there are opportunities to go into new businesses like financing and payments with banking partners that would have been impossible with the old on-premise systems, and those are opportunities we are aggressively pursuing with the world's money center banks. Banking and healthcare will be Oracle's two largest verticals going forward. Speaking of healthcare, Humana was an important Fusion ERP win in Q1. In the infrastructure part of our cloud business, we continue to innovate in several technical areas. We have made great progress and we are now on our way into the big four global hyperscalers, and I'll give you a list of those in case you don't know. They are Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle and Google, note the order. I was not the one who sorted that list. Oracle has come a long way in the cloud infrastructure business. Our technology is getting really good and very competitive. And of course, we continue to deliver breakthrough innovations in areas where we have long been strongest like database. The Oracle Database remains unrivaled and running the world's biggest and most critical systems. And our other database, the open-source system, MySQL, is now on a new generation, and it now includes an ultra-high performance in-memory query processor called HeatWave, plus a new set of management tools called the AutoPilot. Amazon's version of MySQL, again MySQL is an open-source database, anyone can have it. Amazon took the version of MySQL renamed it Aurora and put it up in AWS. Now, the open-source version of MySQL, the old version of MySQL pre-HeatWave is very, very slow with query processing. In fact, the way you use Aurora typically in Amazon over the years is you do your transaction processing in Aurora, also known as MySQL. And then when you do your query processing, you moved your data out of Amazon's MySQL on to Aurora and put into a thing called RedShift, a data warehouse system from Amazon. Recently, SnowFlake has come up with a data warehouse that runs at AWS and SnowFlake competing quite effectively against RedShift because SnowFlake runs on multiple clouds, and SnowFlake like RedShift is way faster at queries than the old MySQL or Aurora. Okay. So Oracle introduces this new version of MySQL, this new generation of MySQL with HeatWave. And the customer reaction has been stupendous simply for the reason that over and over again, they measure Oracle's MySQL to be 100x faster than Amazon's Aurora for query processing. Now, this was actually not unexpected. The old MySQL, which is Aurora, that's what Aurora is, the old MySQL, it's terrible for query processing. What was unexpected is that Oracle MySQL proved to be more than 10x faster than Amazon RedShift or SnowFlake for query processing. So suddenly, there is one database, you can do transaction \u2013 one open-source database, you can do transaction processing on, MySQL with HeatWave. And that same database, MySQL with HeatWave is the fastest place to run your queries. So you don't need to move your data into RedShift or SnowFlake anymore just to do query. This is excited so many customers that they asked us over and over again. We made it available this quarter Oracle's MySQL with HeatWave is available at the Oracle Public Cloud, but they asked if we would make it available on other public clouds. And we thought that's what our customers want, that's what we are going to do. So we plan to make Oracle MySQL with HeatWave available on other public clouds in addition to the Oracle Public Cloud and compete aggressively where we have huge technical advantages over Amazon Aurora, Amazon RedShift and perhaps most interestingly, huge technical advantages, performance and cost over SnowFlake. I'll turn it back to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Larry. Ken, I think we're ready to take questions. Ken Bond : Yes, absolutely. Erica, if you could please prepare the audience for questions, please. Operator :  [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you, and congrats from me as well, and especially on the RPO disclosure and growth there. My question is around Fusion and NetSuite. We obviously are in a somewhat recovery scenario. And I'm looking at your professional services as well, which is kind of very strong there. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there in terms of people wanting to do now that they're coming out of the pandemic, more around digital transformation and hence you had actually an extra boost on demand despite what you saw already beforehand? Or how do we have to think about the dynamic there? Thank you. Safra Catz : Raimo, maybe I'll start and then Larry can add in. I think that one of the things has become incredibly obvious during this pandemic is that companies that have closer digital relationships with their customers, their employees and their suppliers are doing much better than those that don't. And the work from home and all the data, that capabilities, whether it's mobile or otherwise, once you have that implemented, your ability to adapt to changing business situations is so much better if you've moved to the cloud, and also capabilities that you may need can be supplied by a vendor like ourselves where, for example, as we've discussed, we rolled out health and safety to our HCM customers, so they could better work with their employees and monitor and advise them regarding COVID. And there is no question that digital transformation is the top goal of companies and those companies that had been delaying or moving slowly have brand-new urgency on it. And of course, because we are ranked and I think it's our third year in a row in the top right-hand quadrant on Gartner really with no one even close to us, we are the number one choice for moving to Fusion ERP and other back-office applications. So for us, I have to say that there is just incredible momentum and commitment from our \u2013 from prospects and customers and for companies who have been on-premise either with our products or historically with SAP where they just can't continue like they did. Lawrence Ellison : Yes, I'll add. Your question about services, we have pretty much made the migration away from on-premise implementations where all of our staff is focused on cloud implementations. And during that transition, every time we go through one of these transitions, it looks like something isn't growing or worse yet something is shrinking. Well, in this case, the on-premise stuff went down until it almost went away. And basically all of the implementation services you see for applications are cloud implementations. We've now made the migration and that should just grow steadily as demand for those systems increases. We really don't have a lot of competition. That's the understatement of the year in cloud ERP. I'd love to know who the competitors are. SAP doesn't have a product. When we \u2013 we're in a competition with the SAP right now and we've just gotten \u2013 we just found out, we're vendor of choice and their big thing was SAP doesn't have a cloud product. They have hosting. They're willing to put a custom computer in Amazon and just build a specialized version for the customer. That's not the cloud. We update our applications every three months, the entire fleet of 8,000 Fusion customers are updated every three months. The entire fleet of 28,000 NetSuite customers are updated every six months. You get SAP, they install it and then they probably will update it again five years now. It's an on-premise system. They don't have a cloud system. We're winning every deal against them, everyone, and we're taking a lot of their customers away. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much for taking my questions, and congratulations on the size and strength of the IaaS plus SaaS cloud. OCI Gen 2 passed Google GCP in the Gartner IaaS/PaaS feature functionality ranking this month. Let me ask, is the functionality checkbox enough to capture market or do you believe that customers fundamentally view OCI different than AWS, Azure and GCP and why? Thanks. Lawrence Ellison : Well, I think the big question was, I think, the big issue that remains open about Oracle \u2013 I would say, it probably still remains open about Oracle is can Oracle compete with database against Amazon? It's interesting question because Amazon doesn't really have it. Well, Amazon has like 13 separate databases where the Oracle data, we do everything in a single database. We don't think an application should talk to five or six separate databases. We think it's a very risky security architecture. But the question is Amazon is the big leader in cloud. We're the big leader in databases. Well, if forced to choose, will they pick the Amazon Cloud and a database other than the Oracle Database? And - or are they willing to move to migrate their Oracle applications to the Oracle Cloud to get the Oracle \u2013 all the security and performance advantages of the Oracle Database? That\u2019s been the big question out there. And with our cloud good enough to compete with Amazon and Google and Microsoft, and I think we have answered those questions. It's not only good enough to compete. It\u2019s - in many cases, it's much better for security, for performance, for reliability, for cost, we're cheaper. And that's one of the reasons we have such a big ISV business. And so many people have left Amazon and come to the Oracle Cloud was because we cost less. So we have significant cost advantages. And I think this is another big step to proving that the Oracle Cloud is part of the big four. It's not a big three. It's a big four. I'm not including the Chinese players because they're regional or not global. I'm counting the Gartner sequence and the Gartner sequence is Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, Google. And if we're in the big four and virtually every important database application on Earth runs \u2013 I mean, not everyone, but the vast majority run on the Oracle Database. If those migrate to the Oracle Cloud, we have a very, very large business, and we're seeing people moving more and more things to the Oracle Cloud. Now in this Gartner report, we will just help \u2013 we'll move that along quite nicely. Mark Moerdler : Thank you. I appreciate it. Lawrence Ellison : By the way, it's not just the Gartner report. If they come and look and they run, if they do a comparison, a straighter comparison us, Google, us, Amazon, they test the application in both places. We win all of those. It's when they don't come and look that we have a problem. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Erica, next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Derrick Wood : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Safra, nice job at accelerating recurring revenue growth, while still growing operating income in Q1. Last quarter, you had alluded to the fiscal 2022 being more of an investment year for you guys. Can you just remind us how you're thinking about balancing topline growth versus operating income growth or operating margins for the fiscal year and maybe touch on where you want to be adding more investments to help with accelerating growth either from a geo perspective or a product go-to-market standpoint? Safra Catz : Well, you and your colleagues have been following Oracle for a long time and you know that when we talk about investing, we still focus on increasing profitability, okay. We're not like many of these other companies that when they invest, they lose money or they don't make more money. We will make more money this year, while investing and accelerating than we did before. So that's our expectation is we don't have to pick. We've never believed we have to pick because we have differentiated products that are very high value. You know how we run the company. We don't waste money. We spend it on things that bring returns, and we're very careful about that, but we have so much demand worldwide right now for really our cloud product lines pretty much across the Board, whether it's our Database Services, our Cloud at Customer, our OCI Gen 2, our Fusion products, it's just such a great time that even though we're going to invest more, we will make more. And so we just don't think you have to pick one or the other. It's just a matter of \u2013 this is an important time for us to invest, but we're going to make more money. Lawrence Ellison : Yes, I'd like to just second that with an example in the past, recent history where when we bought NetSuite, we considered NetSuite strategic. We thought this is a company that it should be growing even faster than it was independently as a part of Oracle. And so we made a number of investments in NetSuite, and we've seen their growth \u2013 NetSuite has gotten bigger obviously, but their growth rate has increased and we've invested, but we've made more money and we're growing faster in NetSuite. So I think that's the model that Safra likes to implement. And it seems to be working pretty well at NetSuite. We don't see why it would be any different in a larger business like the Oracle Public Cloud. Derrick Wood : Understood. Thanks for the color. Ken Bond : Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Thanks very much, and thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess Larry, can you sort of double click on OCI and specifically, I was curious what you're seeing with some of your early OCI customers in terms of net expansion, meaning how are those customers growing with you in terms of either net workloads or new infrastructure services? And within those customers, do you feel like you're taking wallet share versus some of the other public vendors? Just to give us a sense on how those might act as a proxy for others? Thanks. Lawrence Ellison : Absolutely. We have corporate customers. They've been with us for a while that are expanding. Maybe the most interesting thing about this is, are the ISVs because the ISVs, I mean they are in the cloud business. I mean, that's their whole business. They run \u2013 their primary expense is running their cloud operations. And when a number of those companies move from Amazon to Oracle, I mean, I'll give you a bunch of examples, then they really take a close look at the economics of what they're doing the reliability of the system. Zoom is a famous example, but there are a bunch of other ISV examples of companies that have moved from Amazon to Oracle. So that is really very encouraging. But we're seeing it now in our corporate customers as well. They move a workload. That works, they wait. They move in two or three more workloads. That\u2019s continuing. So we think again, as Gartner report is one more step in the right direction in terms of encouraging our corporate customers to move even more workloads and accelerate the rate. But have we seen a pattern? Yes. We move a workload for a customer, and move a second workload to third workload. Once they understand, it works smoothly and the economics are advantageous. They just move more workloads on a continuous basis and that's what we are experiencing. Kirk Materne : Thank you. Ken Bond : Okay. Next question please. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Turits with KeyBanc. Michael Turits : Hey, Larry and Safra. I wanted to ask about Cloud at Customer. I think you mentioned, Safra, it's growing 40%. So what tailwinds and if there are any headwinds is this Cloud at Customer seeing. And is that now able to start driving sustainable database acceleration beyond the acceleration that you saw this quarter? Safra Catz : Yes, I mean, one of the things I didn't mention was that consumption at Cloud at Customer is up over 150%. So you need to understand that once Cloud at Customer, they take a while to set up and then once they start getting set up because it's a little bit more complicated. We follow a very, very special security model and what we do is, it's really a land-and-expand model. The customer brings in some workloads and then they realize how incredible it is. And it runs their database workloads, it runs their other workloads so quickly, so cost effectively that it just builds in momentum. The thing that, as I said, it takes a while to actually land and get it all set up, but now it's gotten to be a good size and then it's just accelerating for us. And so that's really where we're at. It is a global product. It is completely differentiated, and it is very profitable for us. And it fits the need of our customers because remember their Oracle workloads in particular really, really run amazingly, but also those are their most important workloads often and those have to be perfect. And that's really \u2013 they have to be secure, they have to be performing, they have to be always up, and they have to be economical for them, and it's just a \u2013 it's a perfect match for what they need. Michael Turits : Great. Thanks, Safra. Ken Bond : Okay. Next question please. Operator : Our final question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Yes. Thank you very much. So you seem to have pivoted your CapEx approach a bit from just-in-time purchases to carrying a bit of a capacity buffer, so that you can deploy all these OCI wins. I'm just curious Safra, does it take a quarter or two and then, you have enough of a buffer there or do you see such a pipeline for OCI demand that this CapEx rise perhaps could last a while longer, which might be a good news for future revenue growth? Safra Catz : Well, I don't like to be cut short. That's for sure. And so I want to make sure I have enough, but we do have enormous demand frankly. So this is what I always call a high-class problem, but we try to make sure that we manage it very, very carefully. I thought it was worth it to take on quite a bit more inventory, but it is getting used up very quickly all the time. And we stay very, very focused on being able to deliver to our customers, the demand, but we have such accelerating demand that we have to stay vigilant to make sure we've got what we need, where we need it and in the quantities that we need it. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. Safra Catz : Thank you. Ken, we can't hear you. Ken Bond : Thank you. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for closing. Operator : Thank you for joining today's Oracle first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation.

Ken Bond : Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's second quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website following this call. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements being made today. As a result, we would caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another quarter of increasing revenue growth as the fastest-growing parts of the business continue to become a larger percentage of our business. We had a fantastic quarter as total revenue grew 6% in constant currency, above the high-end of my guidance, with broad-based outperformance across the company. Q3 revenue growth looks like it will continue even higher, but let me save that for the guidance discussion. Earnings were also strong, with non-GAAP EPS $0.09 above the high-end of my constant currency guidance. We achieved this outperformance despite the U.S. dollar strengthening since I gave guidance, as we saw a currency headwind of nearly $100 million to revenue and $0.01 to EPS, so the USD results, which are excellent and above guidance are even stronger than they appear. Before I go through the numbers, though, I wanted to comment on what we are seeing in the market that is driving our accelerating revenue growth. As I've mentioned on previous calls, we have a highly differentiated strategy from our competitors where we are the only company able to offer the combination of applications and infrastructure in the cloud. We have best-of-breed capabilities in both infrastructure and apps like HR and ERP, but also a highly differentiated set of industry-specific cloud SaaS applications and of course, our second-generation cloud with Autonomous Database are unique in their performance, security and dependability. And because we have decades of experience in mission-critical systems, our customers can depend on us being up and available when they need us. Our unique capabilities are attracting customers, especially as they consider how to conduct their own digital transformation in the complex industries in which they compete. They want us to know as much about their business as they do, whether it's telco, financial services, utilities, retail and many others and to partner with them to modernize. Once a company thinks beyond simple dev test and other rudimentary cloud workloads and move their technology focus to mission-critical projects, they invariably turn to Oracle. Our focus on customer success is driving more references and new opportunities with both existing customers and with entirely new accounts. And of course, we ourselves are an Oracle Fusion full suite user, and I'm sure it is not lost on any of you and it's not lost on our prospects and customers that we are announcing our results nine days after the quarter closed because of our systems and their embedded processes. Okay. Back to the numbers. And from here on, I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates, unless I say otherwise. So total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.6 billion, up 6% in constant currency and accounted for 73% of total company revenue. Total cloud revenues, when annualized are now $10.7 billion and grew 22%, with cloud bookings growing faster than our cloud revenue growth rate. And as a result, we expect cloud revenue will accelerate further and exit the fiscal year in the mid-20s, potentially higher. GAAP application subscription revenues were $3.1 billion, up 8% organically in constant currency and our highest growth rate in four years. Fusion apps were up 30% with strategic back-office applications now having annualized revenue of $4.9 billion and growing 30%, including Fusion ERP up 35%, Fusion HCM up 25%, and NetSuite ERP up 28%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.4 billion, up 5% and excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew more than 50%. I expect the infrastructure revenue growth rate will continue to ramp higher through the fiscal year. OCI consumption revenue, which includes Autonomous Database, was up 86% in constant currency and total Cloud at Customer revenue was up 45%. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services were up 3% in constant currency. License revenues were $1.2 billion, up 16% amongst our very best quarters over the last 10 years and license growth was not dependent on any mega deals. We saw excellent performance in technology, our vertical businesses as well as North America and Latin American regions. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.4 billion, up 6% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 6% this quarter. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 84%, and gross profit dollars grew 5% in constant currency. I expect the full-year growth in gross profit dollars for cloud services and license support will be similar to or better than last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.9 billion, up 7% from last year and the operating margin was 47%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%, slightly higher than our base rate of 19% and earnings per share was $1.21 in U.S. dollars, up 14% in U.S. dollars, up 15% in constant currency. During the quarter, we recognized GAAP acquisition-related and other expenses totaling $4.7 billion, which substantially consisted of litigation-related charges that will not recur. They relate to a dispute that arose when we hired my former co-CEO in 2010. As a result of this one-time charge, GAAP net income was a negative $1.2 billion. The GAAP tax rate was 16.6% due to some discrete items and the GAAP loss was $0.46 per share. Operating cash flow for the last four quarters was $10.3 billion, and our free cash flow over the same period was $7.1 billion. Both results were negatively affected by the litigation charges I mentioned. Capital expenditures for the last four quarters were $3.1 billion, and CapEx for Q2 alone was $925 million and we are on track to invest $4 billion in CapEx this year. We now have nearly $23 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is nearly $8 billion, up slightly in constant currency from a year ago due to timing differences in customer payments with gross deferred revenue growing 5% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $37.2 billion, up 11% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 59% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said so many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 77 million shares for a total of $7 billion. And over the last 10 years, we've reduced the shares outstanding by 47% at an average price that's about half the current share price. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by an additional $10 billion. We've paid out dividends of $3.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Now the guidance. I'm going to start by reiterating our expectation that full-year 2022 revenue growth will accelerate from 2021 for all the reasons we've already seen so far this year. Given the strong performance in the first half, I now expect that we will see full-year total revenue finish solidly in the mid-single digits, led by cloud revenue growth exiting the year in the mid-20s. Cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business compared to on-premise, and I expect that our operating margins this year will be the same or better than pre-pandemic levels of 44%. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q3, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically in November. I know you all saw that. And assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, which we have no idea if they will or not, I expect we will see a currency headwind of 3% for revenue and $0.05 for EPS in Q3. Total revenue for Q3 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5% in USD. Clearly, the midpoint of the range is 7%, and that is higher than the 6% we just reported in Q2 and higher than the 2% we reported in Q1. So everything is trending in the right direction. Cloud service and license support revenue for Q3 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS for Q3 is expected to grow between 2% and 6% in constant currency and be between $1.19 and $1.23 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter is expected to grow between negative 2 and positive 2 in USD and be between $1.14 and $1.18 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to be higher or lower. But I expect that in normalizing for these one-time events, our non-GAAP tax rates will average around 19% or so. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Safra. All right, I'm going to discuss Oracle's Cloud ERP status and strategy. So how big is our on-premise ERP business today? I mean a lot of the people \u2013 a lot of the companies like Microsoft did a great job of moving their entire Microsoft Office installed base into the cloud to dramatically increase the size of their cloud business. Unfortunately, we didn't have the same option or opportunity, so I think it's \u2013 to me, I think you are going to find this interesting. So how big is our on-premise business today? Well, we had 7,500 customers in Oracle on-premise, their ERP made up of E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft and JD Edwards. Only 1,000 of those 7,500 have moved to Fusion Cloud ERP. Now we have not lost any of these customers to competitors. We expect all the remaining 6,500 to move to Fusion ERP, but it hasn't happened yet. That's all upside. That's all upside. And I think a lot of people don't really realize that how \u2013 so now let's migrate over and look at how big is our cloud ERP business today. Well, round number is $5 billion a year revenue, and we have 8,500 Fusion customers. But remember only 1,000 of those 8,500 came from our old on-premise business. 6,500, plenty to come. So 7,500 of these 8,500 were not running Oracle ERP before we came out with our cloud product. Those are all new customers. Add to that the 28,000 new NetSuite customers. So Oracle has a total of 35,500 cloud ERP customers that are new to Oracle. Only 1,000 of our on-premise installed base has migrated so far. Let me repeat that. 35,500 net new cloud ERP customers we got in the last few years. Only 1,000 from our installed base that's going to be coming to us later on. So how fast is cloud ERP revenue growing about? So growing about 30% a year. And so let's look out five years and ask the question, how big will we be in five years? And I think the number would be approaching $20 billion in cloud ERP, where the majority of those customers are not people who are migrating, our customers that are migrating from Oracle's on-prem business, but they're migrating from other people's on-prem business. Whether it's a small company like Infor or a large company like SAP or a variety of other companies, the vast majority of our cloud ERP customers are not coming from our installed base, they are coming from someone else's installed base. And again, yes \u2013 85% of our current \u2013 that we have are from someone else's installed base. So what are our margins in this five year? Let's say, we are estimating $20 billion cloud ERP business. Well, it's scale, at that scale, that's about an 85% margin in that business. And as Safra pointed out earlier in her comments, the cloud business is inherently much more profitable and much more predictable than our old on-premise business. So we expect five years from now \u2013 and again, these are just estimates. But based on growth rates and the size of our current business, we expect to have about 30,000, five years now, 30,000 Fusion customers plus 100,000 NetSuite customers bringing in $20 billion at 85% margins. All right. So what's happening? I mean how are we winning so many new customers? Where are they coming from? Who are we competing? Well, we have \u2013 really we only have two significant competitors. We have two significant competitors, SAP and Workday. I've said this before. SAP did not build a true cloud product, and I'm going to explain what a true cloud product is in just a minute. But SAP, because they didn't build the cloud product, they bought some edge products around the cloud, but they didn't actually rebuild their software for the cloud. That's the same old 35-year-old software they've been selling forever. Their goal is simply to hold on to their installed base, but they are losing customers to us. For example, this quarter Petronas, oil and gas \u2013 big oil and gas customer moved over. I gave a long presentation about a couple of us taking already a couple of hundred pretty good-sized SAP customers. So we are doing very well against SAP and continue to do it well SAP, winning Petronas and others this quarter. But Workday is very interesting because Workday does have a cloud product. And they've done quite well in HCM, but they have very few live. Try to go out and find live Workday ERP customers. Try to find any. So we're winning almost everything in cloud ERP. We are beating Workday 90 \u2013 I don't know, 98% of the time, we beat Workday and we are taking customers from SAP's installed base. They are still holding on to more of their base than we are taking, but we are making inroads. So again, what's going on? Why are we winning? Well, we are winning because we have a true cloud product that is very, very feature-rich and Burberry has a very low cost of ownership. So it's enormously capable, and it's not expensive compared with the old on-premise systems. Our implementations, I mean we've got implementations of medium, large companies that sometimes take six months. Now don't get me wrong. Someone like Bank of America took a few years. That was an SAP customer that we won. And that was just doing the Merrill Lynch division. It took a few years. And then hopefully, we are going to continue to make progress at Bank of America. So in general, it's much faster and lower cost to implement our cloud product than implement, let's say, SAP or even Workday, but a gigantic difference was SAP. Very easy to use. We have the user interface. There is two aspects. There's the computer interface that works on mobile phones and tablets and things like that. And then we have a voice digital assistant. You talk to our applications. You talk to all of our applications. You ask for reports. You ask questions. And I think it's like Alexa for the enterprise. All our apps run on smartphones, tablets, desktops, every app. Not a handful of apps are mobile, every single app runs on smartphones, tablets, desktops, every single app has a voice interface. And this is what I mean by a true cloud product. We deliver a new version of Oracle Cloud ERP to 100% of our customers, all 8,500 customers for Fusion every three months. That's right. They get a new version with sometime hundreds or sometimes even thousands of new features. Every three months, they get that. Now why is that important? Well, I mean because our customers want \u2013 specifically in different industry, they don't all want the same new feature depending on the industry you're in, depending on your size, depending on the country you're in, your three most important new features you must have are different among a lot of different customers. So in the old days with SAP, customers built this themselves. They went out and hired Accenture or somebody else, IBM Services when it was IBM Services to build these features for them. Now the new model is \u2013 it don't customize your product. You don't have to. Give us your list of new features that you need and we'll build them and put them in the next release, and we can build them faster than you can. And you might have to wait three months or four months or five months before you get a new version. But you get them quickly, and we are the ones that build them. And they are part of the standard product. They are not some customization you have to maintain forever. So they're not expensive. In fact, they're free. They come with the product. This is radically different than what SAP offers in their and what they call their cloud product, which I say is not a true cloud product because they don't have new versions every three months. They don't have new versions every three years in their so-called cloud product. You make all the same modifications you used to make by hiring people and customize. That's not the new model. That's not how it works in a real cloud system. That's a fundamental and every time they go in and modify the system, what if they make a mistake? What if they have a bug? That's going to make the system less reliable and more expensive, potentially slower. That doesn't happen with real cloud systems. We, the vendor, are responsible for enhancing it and testing it on a regular cadence and responding to their requirements and delivering things to them in months, not years. We are also on schedule to deliver some unprecedented new technology. We won't be long before when our customers upgrade every three months, they upgrade. And sometimes they are down for an hour or so, and we are on schedule to deliver zero downtime upgrades. So it won't be long now when our customers move to the new version, there will be no downtime. Nobody else has this. Nobody else is working on. And soon all of our applications will be on the autonomous self-tuning Maximum Security database. I've said this before, what's the most important thing about the Autonomous Database? The money you save because there's no human labor. No actually, the money is good \u2013 the money you have to save is no human labor is good. But no human labor, no human errors, no security risks, no stolen data. Almost all of the \u2013 not all, but almost all of the data that's been hacked out of other clouds has been hacked because some human being made a mistake, left a port open, created a vulnerability. You can't do that with the Autonomous Database because human beings don't touch it. It\u2019s just like a self-driving car is safer than a car driven by human being, a self-driving database is much safer and more secure than a database that is managed by human beings who make mistakes and cause problems. Okay. So I'll stop there and I\u2019m going to slightly turn a little bit and describe what's going on in the marketplace kind of on an, in from an industry perspective. Fusion ERP has been out for a while, and we are beginning to roll up entire industries. We are adding the features for banking. I think on an earlier quarterly call, I said our two largest and most \u2013 strategic industries going forward in ERP would be banking and healthcare. Maybe not just ERP, but for the company in total will be banking and healthcare, and we are doing extremely well in those industries. Some of our live banking and financial service customers include JPMorgan, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, HSBC, State Street, NatWest, Santander, Macquarie. I can go on and on and on with a long list of banks all over the world. But also we have insurance customers, USAA, Nationwide, AAA and again and a lot more. I'm not going to list everybody. In fact, we provide a printed list at the end of every quarter of our all the new wins we had in the quarter. And we had a lot of new logos in banking and financial services in Q2. We won Barclays. That was another big bank that we won. First Bank, in insurance. We won Ameritas, MoneyGram. And we had some major go-lives, huge go-lives at MetLife, Blackstone and Assurant. We are doing very well in financial services and specifically banking. Healthcare, the other industry I identified as being strategic and above the \u2013 and on par with banking in terms of the importance to our future. So large healthcare customers include Kaiser, Cleveland Clinic, Providence Saint Joe. I would say that we have a lot of healthcare wins around the world, but I'd say our healthcare wins are concentrated more in North America as compared with banking. New healthcare wins this quarter : Mayo Clinic, the number one ranked hospital in the United States, [Tay Markel], Syneos Health and PPD. Again, I can go on and on, but again, we print those out for you, and you can read them at your leisure. Let me talk about one other industry before I give my closing remarks. That's logistics customers. We've become very, very strong with logistics customers. FedEx was a key win from us, takeaway from SAP. UPS, we have UPS, DHL, FedEx, DP World, SS, TTS. I can go on and on. We have most of the big logistics companies around the world. And FedEx, which is \u2013 a lot of our companies aren't through rolling out Oracle Fusion ERP. But FedEx, for example, is now live in 98 countries. We are winning in lots of other industries as well, but I wanted to highlight these three industries because they are essential to our plan to add major new capabilities to our cloud ERP system. Before I describe these capabilities, I have a confession to make. We are not \u2013 I don't believe it anyway. We are not on our way to building a $20 billion cloud ERP business in five years. I think it's going to be a lot bigger than that. Let me explain why. As more and more companies adopt and run Oracle Cloud ERP, I ask the question, what does a B2B procurement transaction look like? In other words, how does it work when one Oracle Cloud ERP system is talking to another Oracle Cloud ERP system and placing an order? We are working in concert with our banking and logistics partners to originate purchase financing, products shipped, delivery tracking, invoicing and payments right inside the two transacting Oracle Cloud ERP procurement systems. Oracle Cloud ERP will soon bring an entirely new level of automation to B2B commerce, one that very much resembles the ease of doing business and efficiency of B2C e-commerce. This new ERP automation system, all these new capabilities will dramatically simplify our customers' procurement and supply chain processes. And as such, it represents a huge new opportunity for Oracle to grow its cloud ERP ecosystems. Thank you. Back to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Larry. I think Ken is going to take questions. So... Ken Bond : Yes. Erica, if you could queue the audience, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you so much and congrats on a great quarter with accelerating growth. Larry, you shared quite a bit with us, really, really helpful. But I wanted to ask you about OCI because we continue to hear great things from customers. And I think people understand Oracle's cloud is hypersecure, highly automated, and there's real price performance advantage. But as we think about your product road map and what it takes for Oracle to capture more than its fair share of the broader public cloud market, how much are you investing in breadth versus depth? Because we just see in this quarter alone, like the partnership with Airtel in India, Orange in West Africa, new regions in Singapore, UAE, France, and I'm probably missing some. But clearly there's demand. Otherwise, I know Safra wouldn't be making these investments. But when a new competitor posts \u2013 Larry, when your main competitor posts over 200 services up the stack, how far should we expect to see you build up the stack competing on functionality versus continuing to go broad with what you already have? Thanks. Lawrence Ellison : Well again, we have a bunch of things the other guys don't have. We have applications. So \u2013 but I know you want to talk about this. Yes, you want to talk about infrastructure. We think of those as two separate businesses, but of course, they're not. I mean everyone who is running Oracle ERP is building data warehouses on top of their ERP data. They're mashing it up maybe with Salesforce data. They're doing all of these things. They're doing a combination of big application customers. Bank of America, for example, is doing a combination of running our apps and building bespoke apps around those. So this is a huge opportunity for us that are other infrastructure customers, other infrastructure providers don't have. We've often had the discussion, do we want to support 10 databases, or do we want to support 30 databases? And do we want to have every single service that let's say an Amazon has? And I think our view is we want to have some really good choices, but not every single choice on the menu. We want to have all of the popular databases, but not some of the obscure databases. So we are not going to try to feature match every single thing they do. We will, however, have development environments they don't have at all. So if you're building data warehouses on top of Fusion ERP or on top of Fusion HCM or on top of NetSuite, we have a whole set of tools that makes that easy for you over on the infrastructure side of our business. So we have some \u2013 we do \u2013 we have all the popular stuff around. I mean obviously, you have Kubernetes and the like. And we have Postgres and the popular databases. We have MySQL, but our version of MySQL is much better than Amazon's version of MySQL. It's much faster. I mean more than 10x faster because of HeatWave. We have this Query Optimizer, they don't have at all. So our idea is to look at the most popular products to have recommended development environments and recommended systems, and be able to do things they can't do at all. I think one other \u2013 let me mention one of these fundamental differences in our strategy versus their strategy. They are building a small number of very, very large data centers. Our strategy is to build a large number of smaller, less expensive data centers. We think that improves reliability dramatically. We don't have this giant data center going down. It reduces the blast radius of what happens when things go down. Less goes down. It allows us to go into sovereign nations in some smaller countries that they can't \u2013 never afford to put a data center in. And we could not put one, but two, a primary and a backup data center in sovereign countries that care about data sovereignty. We can put a complete cloud. I don't mean just database cloud. I mean a complete cloud at a customer like NRI in Japan. And we did that with that \u2013 we put in a primary and a backup. So we can \u2013 if people want to run a cloud, if a large financial institution wants to run our cloud inside their firewall, inside their data center, we can do that. And how will that cloud differ from the cloud that we run in the public? It won't differ at all. We can make that small enough, that we can fit it into their data center. Nobody else can do this. So we think \u2013 and then let me close with a note that I'm going to paraphrase from a very large telecommunications company who uses our cloud and all the other three North American clouds, Google, Amazon and Microsoft. And the note basically said, the one thing we've noticed about Oracle, Oracle\u2019s Cloud is that it never ever goes down. We can't say that about any of the other clouds. We think this is a critical differentiator availability. Another critical differentiator is security, where we have \u2013 where the only way you can achieve security, I promise you this is true, is through autonomy. If you have human beings deploying and tinkering with your systems, they can make mistakes that expose your data. The only way we've been able to solve that problem is to get human beings out of the equation. No human beings, no human error, no human malice. So we think we have a bunch of differentiators. And we'll be able to compete very, very effectively with security, reliability, combination of apps and infrastructure autonomy and a bunch of other things the other guys just will not be able to do. Brad Zelnick : Larry, that's super helpful. Thank you, again and congrats. Lawrence Ellison : I will not have an answer that long again, ever. Safra Catz : Brad, you're not going to believe this, I've got more to add to that answer. So first of all, you missed a few data centers, not the least of which is Israel, France and another one in Italy. But the real answer is the fact that I'm sure you've seen Gartner's scorecard where we actually passed Google this year and are higher than where Microsoft, who's been in this longer than us, was a year ago. But in addition, that scorecard doesn't even measure the capabilities we have in handling very large databases which, of course, we do uniquely of all the other hyperscalers. So it's all very interesting, but we have things in addition to applications in the infrastructure world that they cannot handle. And that has just put us in an incredible position, and that's why customers are coming to us. All right, I will stop right there. Brad Zelnick : Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital. Raimo Lenschow : Hey. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats from me as well. I wanted to go back to ERP, and I apologize for that. But I remember when I used to work in the industry, Larry, the changing an ERP system was like volunteering for root canal treatment. Kind of, you kind of try to avoid it as much as possible. But if I look at the numbers now, NetSuite had the strongest role I've seen for forever, I think. Fusion ERP is accelerating. So what's going on in the industry in terms of kind of like the pressure or the willingness to do it now? Thanks for that, and congrats again. Lawrence Ellison : Yes, thank you very much. I think we spend a lot of time in automating our install. Installing the product, making it very easy to configure, having \u2013 I think our consulting infrastructure, the implementers around our products now are much more experienced. The products have gotten much better. The people have got more experienced. The customers themselves have gotten more experienced. So the cost of putting one of these things in has dropped precipitously. The time it takes to put it in, obviously related to the cost has also dropped precipitously. There's just no comparison to the way it used to be to the way it is now. Well, the way it used to be a customer bought his own unique computer configuration and added some modifications to the ERP system and installed it over a period of \u2013 I mean, it wasn't unusual back in the day for an SAP implementation to take five to seven years. I know it sounds crazy, but some of them cost billions, billions of dollars. Now for a medium-sized company, six months is not unreasonable to get you live on \u2013 maybe not your entire business, but financials and procurement and a big chunk of your business, we can get live very, very quickly at a very, very low cost. So it's just a totally different world. And then the other thing I'm going to mention one more time. Customers are not encouraged to go ahead and build their own extensions. If you need an extension, tell us what you need, and maybe we can schedule it in the next quarter or two in the upcoming releases. That's a fundamentally different model. It's so much less expensive to have us do it for nothing, than to try to do it yourself. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Ken Bond : Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you for taking the question, guys, and really impressive quarter. I think Brad had a really good point earlier that investors are more and more looking at sort of your CapEx intentions and looking at data center count, frankly, as a leading indicator of growth for Oracle. So I was hoping you could update us on that. And maybe digging into that data center side, capacity expansion isn't just in data center expansion. You could expand within data centers as well. Can you help us think about how we should think about overall capacity to deliver through both data center expansion and expanding those existing data centers to really capture all of these investments that you're making? Safra Catz : I guess I'll take that. I'll get started with that. Well, first of all, the public database data centers are the ones that we announced that are up and running. Of course, we have many in the offing. We also have, as Larry talked about, a private region for certain customers. But in addition, we've made very significant investment in government, especially United States government-focused data centers. And I'm sure you've seen that we've been invited to submit for the JWCC. We also have data centers at different levels of security for different government requirements in other countries. And those, we don't generally announce, so you don't see those. What you do see is the fact that we have invested ahead of revenue and we invest when we see revenue potential. We have been rolling out on track. So we feel very good about it. We have just continued to make sure we have capacity for customers. And some customers start in one data center, and when we open in their countries, they move to those. And that's working out for us. We have a lot of demand worldwide where you're going to see us make these investments, as I've guided for the whole year. Keith Weiss : Okay. Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much. I'm going to follow-up on the discussion on OCI Gen 2. Oracle's dedicated regions seem to be reasonably unique offerings and a different spin on the hybrid cloud, which the largest hyperscale providers are not offering. Can you explain how you're able to deliver this successfully with good margins, and why others cannot? And can you give us any sense of how large do you see that opportunity? Thanks. Lawrence Ellison : Yes, I'll take a crack at that one. Well, everyone says we\u2019re late to the party. So we saw what everyone else built. In fact, we built two versions of our cloud, right? We built Version 1, which we weren't very happy with and then we built our Gen 2 cloud. And one of the things that we decided, as we had a chance to re-architect it, we were sensitive to \u2013 we needed special super high security zones for government. We need to build a lot of data centers. And the magic to building a lot of data centers is twofold. One is compressing the software to a smallish number of servers. But that's really not it. It's really the art of being able to operate a lot of smaller data centers without people or with very few people. Think about what Elon Musk did with his satellite system. Why was he able to build a low earth orbiting satellite system, and nobody else? And a lot of other people have tried, but no one else could. Because he figured it out \u2013 he built the software to manage thousands of satellites. No one else could do it. NASA couldn't do it. Other people couldn't do it. That's why they kind of failed in the past. Our automation software for rolling out and managing a large number of data centers is very different software that you would build for managing a small number of super large data center where you had a lot of people. So we've relied much more heavily on automation to do this. And Safra knows all about it because it wasn't easy. It took us a while. And we were worried a bit and we've made a bunch of commitments. And the only way we can meet all those commitments was to have fully automated lights-out data center, cloud data centers. And we \u2013 the team did a fantastic job prioritizing that automation. And that automation software is what allows us to have a large number of data centers rather than a small number of large data centers. It's just a different \u2013 it's a different suite of software to do it, to manage it. Mark Moerdler : That makes a lot of sense. Safra Catz : Larry, I want to comment also on the private data centers that are truly a full cloud, but at customers. So that's just... Lawrence Ellison : Yes, a lot of people talk about \u2013 they talk about \u2013 I think its hilarious. I hear people talk about hybrid cloud. So a hybrid cloud means there's someone's public cloud. And then whatever you have in your data center is the hybrid. This is ridiculous. That's not a cloud. People say, well, that's the most common cloud there is, whatever you got plus some link to a public cloud. That is not a hybrid cloud. We offer identical hardware, the identical automation software. We'll put a region. It runs all of our apps, it runs all of our services, 100% of them. And we'll put it in your data center. We can do that now because we can run that \u2013 we have the automation software to run that on your floor behind your firewall. We can build that. So it's true. So our notion of a hybrid cloud is basically the same thing, but it's located on your data center floor behind your firewall with high-speed network interconnects where you're comfortable and feel safe, safer than if you were in the public cloud. That's the only hybridy thing about it. Otherwise, it's exactly the same thing. You can move a workload from a public cloud into your private region and then back out of your private region back in the public cloud. They are identical in every way except for the security protection and some firewalls in your private data center. That's a real hybrid cloud. The other guys don't have it. Mark Moerdler : That makes a lot of sense. I really do appreciate it and congratulations on the strong quarter. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Philip Winslow : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter and outlook. In a quarter where a lot of numbers jumped out, I mean, the one that jumped out to me the most was the license growth year-over-year. I had to go back nine years to my model to find a quarter that was actually higher than this. And obviously, when I think about license for Oracle, I was assuming its being driven by the database business. And then when you think about that\u2026 Lawrence Ellison : By the way, I'm really glad you said that. That's what it is. I mean think about it. I mean Marc Benioff over at Salesforce.com, they run their business, their cloud business entirely on Oracle. Now people say, well, that's not cloud revenue. You just license that revenue. Well, it's the Oracle database running all of Salesforce's cloud. And we don't count \u2013 and you're right, we don't count that as cloud revenue. We count that as license revenue. But is that a modern cloud application? I think so. But again, the license stuff is being driven by the use of our database in some very large clouds. Philip Winslow : That's great. That partially answers one of my questions. But when you think about that license and your example of the \u2013 for example, like Salesforce together with just the cloud services and the acceleration you see there, I mean just that overall business seem to accelerate during Q2 here and even versus Q1. And if we think about some of the other smaller competitors in the space, they've seen acceleration as well. So I guess what my question is there's seems to be something going on in the data world and the data infrastructure stack. And obviously when Oracle moves at your scale at these percentages, there definitely seems to be something going on. So what is that? And how do you think about the sustainability of those drivers? Safra Catz : Larry, it's either you or me. We're going to talk about data. I mean listen, this is not new news in that what is going on is getting insights from data, being able to capture large amounts of data, and analyzing it. And of course, that's coming and so much of it is in Oracle. We're the ones who can handle high performance, high reliability requirements. And the Oracle database continues to grow. But in addition, we have the other technologies that are also doing very well. Java continues to be incredibly strong, and it's leading application development environment. But remember, when people buy the Oracle database licenses, they can bring those to our cloud, and that's a very economical way to operate. And really, what's going on is huge amounts of data growing exponentially. And when it's important data, especially data you want to use for analysis, for data warehousing, for transactions, you're going to pick Oracle in nine times out of 10. And so this is great for us. And of course, as more businesses just digitize, this just draws more of our technology. Lawrence Ellison : Yes. And I would say that as SAP moves their applications to S/4HANA in the cloud and they do what I call hosting and they call cloud. The vast majority of those SAP databases do not run HANA. Way over 95% of them still run Oracle. It's a big business for us, even when it migrates to the cloud. I mean Amazon has customers who have taken their Oracle database licenses, and they're running those Oracle database licenses in the cloud. So license does not mean on-premise, and license does not mean the cloud. It's a bit of a \u2013 it's a mixed bag, right? Some of that license revenue and most of the new license revenue is on its way to the cloud. Philip Winslow : Great. Thank you, Larry. Ken Bond : A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on the Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Erica for closing. Operator : Thank you for joining today's Oracle's second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. We appreciate your participation.

It's now my pleasure to hand today's conference over to Oracle Senior Vice President, Ken Bond. Ken Bond : Thank you, Holly. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from the Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website following this call. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments, for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. However, we will be making no comments regarding Cerner. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start by acknowledging the tragic events unfolding in Eastern Europe as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We are working incredibly hard to help our Ukrainian employees and support our customers and partners. We have suspended all Oracle operations in Russia, and we did so well over a week ago. I'll now turn to Oracle's third quarter results. I'll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. And clearly, we had an excellent quarter with total revenue growing over 7%. Not only was total revenue above the midpoint of my guidance, but it was also the highest organic growth rate since we began our transition to the cloud. We saw broad-based outperformance in all segments. And for the first time in more than 10 years, all segments of our business saw growth. Total cloud revenues, when annualized, are now $11.2 billion, and they grew 26%. I expect the cloud revenue will exit the fiscal year growing in the mid-20s. Total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $7.6 billion, up 8% and accounted for 73% of total company revenue. GAAP application subscription revenues saw record level organic growth of 10% and were $3.2 billion. Fusion apps were up 29%, with strategic back-office applications now having annualized revenue of $5.1 billion and growing 30%, including Fusion ERP, up 35%, and Fusion HCM, up 22%, and NetSuite ERP, up 29%. GAAP infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.5 billion, up 7% and higher than last quarter. And excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew more than 60%. And I expect the infrastructure revenue growth rate will trend higher over time. OCI consumption, which includes autonomous database, was up 93%, also higher than last quarter. And total Cloud at Customer revenue was up 43%, with the backlog for Cloud at Customer machines growing to triple digits. Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 4%, and again, higher than last quarter. License revenues were $1.3 billion, up 4%, with strong performance in our tech business. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.5 billion, up over 7%, and as I mentioned earlier, our highest organic growth rate in over 10 years. Operating expenses were up 10% this quarter as we invest to meet growing demand for our cloud services. The gross margins for cloud services and license support was 84%, and the gross profit dollars grew 5%. I expect the full year growth in gross profit dollars for cloud services and license support will be higher than last year. Our plan is to continue to grow profits while we push our top line growth into double digits next year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, up 4% from last year. And the operating margin was 46%, higher than all of our competitors. Earnings per share was adversely affected by around $0.05 per share, primarily due to share price declines of equity investments impacted by the widespread downturn in equity markets last quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19%, in line with our base tax rate. And earnings per share was $1.13 in U.S. dollars, up 1% in constant currency and down 3% in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 18.4%, slightly below our base rate and the GAAP earnings per share was $0.84 in U.S. dollars. Operating cash flow for the last 4 quarters was $10.4 billion, and our free cash flow over the same period was $6.6 billion. Both results were negatively affected by a one-time litigation charge in Q2. Capital expenditures for the last 4 quarters were $3.8 billion, and CapEx for Q3 was $1.1 billion. And we're on track to invest $4 billion in CapEx this year. We now have more than $23 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.9 billion, up 1%, with gross deferred revenue growing 6%. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO, balance is $38.5 billion, up 13% in constant currency due to very strong bookings. Approximately 59% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said many times before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 7 million shares for a total of 600 million as we reduced the buybacks in advance of the purchase of Cerner. We've paid out dividends of $3.5 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Our business is strong as our fast-growing cloud business continues to become a larger proportion of the overall business. A few points. First, my guidance assumes that Cerner does not close in Q4, though it very well may close in the quarter. And again, Cerner should be accretive in the first year. Secondly, cloud is fundamentally a more profitable business to on-premise. And I expect that our full year non-GAAP operating margins for fiscal year 2022, which we're finishing now, will be 1% to 2% higher than pre-pandemic levels of 44%. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. Now the U.S. dollar strengthened dramatically in November. And as you all know, it was a lot of fluctuations this quarter. But assuming currency exchange rates remain the same as they are right now, I expect we will see a currency headwind of 2% to 3% on revenue and $0.05 negative for EPS in Q4. Of course, the dollar could easily strengthen from here. Total revenue for Q4 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 3% to 5% in USD. Cloud service and license support revenue for Q4 is expected to grow between 6% to 8% in constant currency and grow between 4% to 6% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS for Q4 is expected to be between 1.40 and 1.44 in constant currency. GAAP EPS is expected to be between 1.35 and 1.39 in USD. Now both non-GAAP and GAAP EPS are expected to decline year-over-year due to some large investment gains we saw last year as well as a very low tax rate last year. It was 10.7%. Both of these masked the strong earnings growth and momentum we continue to see out of our core cloud business. My EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. As I always say, however, onetime tax events could cause actual rates for any given quarter to be higher or lower, but I expect that in normalizing for these onetime tax events, our non-GAAP tax rates will average around 19% or so. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Safra. I have 2 parts to my comments. I'm going to start with, if you will, business as usual. And that is going from strength to strength in our ERP and HCM cloud businesses. I'm going to go over the wins and the go-lives for our SaaS -- strategic SaaS business. Second, I'm going to talk about our brand-new MySQL HeatWave product. I think it's fair to say, and I'm going to read the quotes -- what I'm going to do is speak a little bit about it, and then I'm going to read the quotes from analysts and customers. And I think you'll find that we've never had a product so well received by customers and analysts in our history. I'm not sure the industry has either. These are really -- it's a remarkable innovation, but I'm going to get to that in a second. First, how is our SaaS business doing right now? Overall, we have incredible progress, winning more and more in the ERP and HCM back office. Q3 was an exceptionally strong quarter for ERP cloud sales. We now have over 10,000 Fusion ERP, HCM customers. And for the first time, we're beginning to see -- we've been in this business long enough. We're beginning to see us roll up certain industries, starting with the largest industry on Earth, health care. Okay. So how are we doing in health care? We already have Tenet Health, Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Northwell Health, Mount Sinai, Atrium Health. I can go a long list of ERP and HCM wins in the health care -- those are all health care providers. We've added some additional health care providers, mainly hospitals and clinics. We've added the CHS Community Health Services. That's a consortium, that's 83 hospitals, and it's an ERP, HCM, SCM win there. And we're replacing Kronos. I call that out because Kronos -- hospitals really are -- while they're not recognized having some similarities to Uber, they have a lot of people that work at hospitals that are not employees at the hospitals. Hospitals have a gig economy. Doctors work in multiple hospitals, multiple clinics, have their own offices. Nurses, same thing. Scheduling and paying the workforce in hospitals is one of the most complicated things ongoing in our changing economy. And we have adapted our HCM systems so that we do help the hospitals recruit, track, schedule and pay for their health professionals. The only other company that was doing that, someone not very well known is Kronos. And we're beginning to replace out Kronos in the hospital space, and we did it to community health systems. We won an HCM deal over Workday at TriHealth. Loma Linda University's health care, health centers, we won an HCM over there, and they already have our ERP. Health care is interesting. I started by talking about hospitals, provide -- people who provide health care. Health care industry is much bigger than that. There are medical device manufacturers. They are pharmaceutical companies. They are the payers, insurance companies and government agencies that are all part of this health care ecosystem.  So we're not just focused on providers like hospitals and clinics, but also we won a big ERP deal over SAP at Johnson & Johnson -- at J&J. We won a big ERP deal over SAP at the medical device company, Haemonetics. We won an ERP deal at Saskatchewan Health Authority, one of the government payer, and most of the payers in health care are governments. So it's this entire ecosystem that we're building specific features and functions for to automate health care across the board. No one has been able to roll up health care. It was pack a little bit. This portion of just the providers, just the ambulatory clinics, just the inpatient hospitals, just the payers, just the pharmaceutical company, just the medical device. We're going after the entire integrated ecosystem, and we're having some great results. Obviously, that influenced our decision to buy Cerner. We have great go-lives at Franciscan Missionaries health system. That's a consortium of over 20 hospitals. We wanted INTEGRIS Health. They went live on our ERP, HCM, FCM, 16 hospitals. Nemours Children's Health went live in HCM with 34,000 users. So health care has been a real strength for us. And obviously, we'll get stronger with Cerner as we provide additional capability to providers. Okay.  The other industry that we've always outlined as being a key strategic target of ours in addition to health care are -- is financial services. And we have a very strong position in financial services, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Santander, Bank New York Mellon, HSBC, Lloyds, Macquarie, Credit Suisse, UBS, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and a lot more are our customers in ERP and HCM. We just won TD Bank, ERP win over SAP at TD Bank. We just won Silicon Valley Bank, another win over SAP. We won Societe Generale in France. We now have 2 of the 3 largest banks after winning Cr\u00e9dit Agricole in Q2, and we will get the other one. We will get Paribas very soon. JPMorgan Chase just did a huge expansion of our -- on our HCM product. Discover, the credit card, just went live on ERP. So again, strong in financial services, getting even stronger. In Communications, our big customers, AT&T, Orange, MTN, Birdie, [Ultra], all around the world -- we just added a big ERP win at Rogers Communications. Huge go-live at Windtree, and that was a replacement. The go-live at Windtree was a replacement of SAP, not a win over SAP, but replacing an existing SAP system. In logistics and transportation, we had -- where -- our big customers are UPS, FedEx, Knight Swift, Yellow, Schneider National and so on. We had a big ERP HCM win over SAP at U.S. Express. We had an HCM win at TD for its freight where we replaced Workday. Didn't beat Workday. We replaced an existing Workday system. Go-live at DHL. DHL is really interesting. It was a go-live in Germany and Austria right in SAP's backyard. And we have a number of wins in Germany. I think this is why we're pretty confident these days against the former winner -- the winner on the on-premise ERP wars, SAP. In Germany, in SAP's backyard, we won DHL. We won Deutsche Post. We won Deutsche Bahn. We won D\u00fcrr IT Services, and we just added a win at Daimler truck over SAP. In Japan, a country really not known for buying package application software very much, we've got a pretty good position in Panasonic. We're in Panasonic. We're in Toyota. We're at Mizuho Financial Services. This quarter, big wins at Canon -- a big ERP win over SAP at Canon. A big win at Taisei that's one of the 5 largest general contractors in Japan. So doing well in Germany, doing well in Japan, doing well in these big economies where, historically, we have not done that well in applications, but we are now. In grocery, where we have Sainsbury, Kellogg, Tesco, Auchan, Kroger and Albertsons. We had a huge ERP expansion at Kroger and a big go-live at Albertson with 280,000 users. Albertsons is now live on both HCM and financials. So very strong in grocery. Hotels and resorts were our big logos are Marriott, Hilton, Caesars, MGM. We just won Intercontinental Hotels and Resorts replacing as an HCM win -- replacing -- we're not allowed to name who we replaced in HCM other than to say they're a very large cloud competitor of ours. Hilton, we went live with HCM, the biggest HCM expansion in the UK.  Higher ed. Higher ed where our big logos are UCLA, Princeton, Rutgers, Vanderbilt, Penn State, University of Texas. We added an HCM win at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. We added 3 more campuses of the University of California system for ERP. We now have 6 of their 9 -- of the 9 campuses for ERP. Tennessee, University of Tennessee, we won ERP and HCM. The University of Arizona, big ERP win, all higher ed. But some of the other industries, in consumer goods, we had a really important win in ERP HCM at a division of Unilever. And that was an SAP replacement, not a win over SAP. We replaced them. In aerospace and defense, we won ERP and SCM at BAE Systems, a win over SAP. We won HCM over SAP at Tata Steel. We won a big -- a full suite expansion at Cummins. Eni, in oil and gas, which has always been an SAP -- very, very strong industry for SAP. We beat them, Eni, at a gas company. In the public sector, we got, well, a very important agency these days. The IOM, the UN agency, International Organization from Migrants. This, again, was a replacement of SAP. We also won the U.K. Ministry of Defense. We went live with a big bang, ERP, HCM, SCM for over 50,000 user go-live. In high tech, Zoom went live on ERP and SCM. Iron Mountain went live on ERP, SCM. Bed, Bath and Beyond went live on ERP. Tiffany went live on an HCM expansion for 300 of their stores. In engineering and construction, Jacobs went live on ERP and SCM. Environmental services, waste management, big suite go-live on ERP and supply chain. And I'll finish it off in professional services where ABM went live. Okay. So very, very strong quarter for us in the back office in ERP and HCM. Now I'd like to switch from SaaS to infrastructure. And we had a major announcement and -- are making a major announcement about our other database. The 2 much popular databases in the world are Oracle and MySQL. MySQL is the world's most popular open source database. MySQL is very good at transaction processing, but historically, has not been good at query processing. So MySQL customers usually use the MySQL database for query -- for transaction processing. And then they'll move their data from the MySQL database into Redshift, at Amazon or into Snowflake to do the query processing. That's how it's typically used. MySQL for transaction processing, Redshift, Snowflake for query processing. By the way, the AWS has their own version of MySQL. They call it Aurora. And the AWS, my Redshift, MySQL Aurora, Redshift business is a multibillion-dollar business. Oracle -- now we're going after that business in 2 ways. We built a product, MySQL HeatWave, which is different than earlier versions of MySQL. MySQL HeatWave is good at both transaction processing and query processing. So MySQL HeatWave doesn't simply replace Aurora. It replaces both Aurora and Redshift or it replaces both Aurora and Snowflake because MySQL HeatWave does transaction processing very well, replacing Aurora. And it does query processing a lot better than Redshift or Snowflake. Because HeatWave runs -- and we decided for the first time to make this a multicloud product. So Oracle HeatWave will run already in the Oracle Cloud, but it is -- we also have it up and running in AWS. And Azure users will be able to use it as well. So it is a multicloud product. AWS users -- why did we do that? We did that because we're going after the Aurora user base and the Redshift and Snowflake user base. We want to make it really easy to convert from Aurora and Redshift or Aurora and Snowflake to Oracle HeatWave. And if we're running an AWS, for example, you press a button, a couple of buttons, and your data is moved immediately to Oracle, MySQL HeatWave. You do not have to change your application at all. You press a couple of buttons, and you move it. Okay. Why would you do that? Well, because the cost performance benefits. So moving to MySQL HeatWave are extraordinary. Now I'm going to stop talking, and I'm going to start reading. And I'm going to start reading analyst quotes, and I'm going to read them word for word. So when I say the benefits are extraordinary, I'm understating what they're saying. So let me bring up the slides. I'm going to just start reading a few quotes. Okay. One industry analyst, combined with HeatWave and Autopilot, combined with HeatWave and Autopilot, MySQL database service may very well be the single greatest innovation in open source cloud databases in the past 20 years. MySQL HeatWave and Autopilot represent a quantum leap with top light query performance and superb transaction support. Oracle wants to open up a second front in the battle for the database market leadership. They're attracting an entirely different user base with this product. Wikibon believes that the technology underlying MySQL HeatWave is an inflection point in database design and architecture. The MySQL HeatWave technology is by far the best in the market. Oracle have shown AWS and Snowflake how to design and architect a true MySQL cloud database. Customers can expect MySQL HeatWave to outperform about 7x faster than Amazon Redshift or Snowflake at 2.5 -- 2 to 5x lower cost. The benefits against Amazon and Aurora are even greater. New entrants such as Snowflake will need to improve their cloud technology fast to stay competitive with HeatWave. This is all word for word what analysts are saying. And these are the most distinguished database analysts in the business. The bottom line is we believe the competition just got outplayed in every measurable metric imaginable. This represents a wake-up call for the industry and a rude awakening to the database cloud competition as they all must respond now to the MySQL innovation juggernaut. HeatWave is the physical manifestation of nearly 10 years of deep database engineering techniques, over 5 dozen patents and demonstrates what real cloud database innovation looks like in 2021. Oracle introduced MySQL HeatWave, and they did send shock waves because they named and shamed basically every database company out there. And my favorite is what they talked about with Snowflake. You can spend $80,000 on HeatWave, and that would cost you $420,000 to run on Snowflake. It's a no-brainer. These new fully transparent benchmarks -- by the way, we put all of our benchmarks on GitHub. It's all public. The code, the data, the customers can reproduce all of these benchmarks that the analysts are talking about. That's what the analysts did. The analysts went out and ran their own benchmarks. And they were shocked. These new fully transparent benchmarks demonstrate HeatWave's performance, price and scale advantages over all other MySQL and cloud databases. Clearly, the cloud data warehouse market wasn't ready for this. And now the competition needs to scramble as they grapple for answers. For organizations using MySQL, Oracle has given them yet another reason to invest in its HeatWave offering by delivering 7x the performance at 1/5 the cost of solutions such as Snowflake. Together with massive scale-out capabilities, this combination makes MySQL HeatWave melt down Snowflake and vaporize -- it sounds like I wrote it, but I didn't. These are -- and we'll provide you with all of these quotes, all in -- full context, names, quotes. These are all analyst quotes. Taken together with massive scale-out capabilities, this combination makes MySQL HeatWave melt down Snowflake and vaporize Amazon Redshift with AQUA. MySQL HeatWave's TPC-H analytics testing literally blows away Amazon's Redshift with AQUA in both performance and cost performance. It's 6.8x faster and 47% less expensive. Amazon Redshift with AQUA is 18x slower, resulting in MySQL HeatWave coming in at an extraordinary 17x better, 17x better cost performance. MySQL HeatWave with Autopilot sets the bar orders of magnitude higher than AWS, Azure, Google and Snowflake. I think I'll stop right there and turn it back to Safra. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Holly, if you could please prepare the audience for Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question for the day will come from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Congrats on the continued momentum and especially all those great customer wins, Larry. I have one quick one for Safra and then a follow-up for you. Safra, just looking at my model, it looks like you had your strongest organic revenue growth in 10 years this quarter. And I just want to make sure I've got that right, and I'm not missing anything. Safra Catz : Yes. You've got that right. And it's basically because of what I've been telling you all for a while, which is our fastest-growing business, which is our cloud, is now getting to be very big. And when you're growing different parts of the business, 25%, 30%, 40%, 60%, and it's a big number. It causes these -- it's just math here. It increases the overall rate of growth of the business. Brad Zelnick : And Larry, you now have an increasing number of ISPs that are now supporting and embedding OCI as well as targeted programs where you have some of the largest global SIs in the world really leaning in. Can you talk to us about how you're winning the ecosystem with OCI? And as well, if you can update us on the mix of traditional versus nontraditional Oracle workloads. Just help us get a sense of how the use cases are evolving and where you see that mix going. Lawrence Ellison : Well, I think it's broad based. I think one of -- the back office -- one of our partners -- we're working with one of the largest banks on the planet with -- on a payment system, a B2B payment system because the ERP customers are coming to Oracle. So if you look at the future with the fact that we're so strong, dominant, I'd argue, in Cloud ERP, what does the B2B purchase look like? A B2B purchase looks like in a modern cloud world, one Oracle ERP system making a purchase from another Oracle ERP system. And we want to automate that B2B transaction. There's 2 Oracle ERP systems are talking to one another. To automate that transaction, we have to be able to pay for that. We have to be able to check credit, finance the payments, a range of logistics. So we're working with large -- a very large bank and a very large logistics company to automate that aspect of our ERP business. Some of it's never been -- you don't think of ERP doing that, but it's this network of these ERP systems talking to one another. That's a huge business revenue opportunity to turn on that B2B payment system. So the banks are joining in. Logistic companies are joining in because the customers are here. Once the ERP customers started coming to Oracle, all of the adjacent applications and all the ISVs with adjacent applications wanted to be in the same cloud as the ERP customers. The integrators had to become familiar with the cloud because that's where the customers are, and that's where customers are going. The ISVs -- and these are kind of interesting ISVs. Giant banks, giant logistics companies putting up their logistics and payment systems in our cloud to facilitate B2B transactions between our ERP system is just a gigantic business opportunity that no one really had ever thought about before. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital. Raimo Lenschow : I'm trying my luck here, Safra, but like any comments on the TikTok rumors that came out today? And then in case you want to answer that. Larry, one for you on, on that success in the back office systems, like is that driven by post-pandemic people realizing, oh, shoot, I really need to update that. So that's kind of more temporary boom that you're seeing here? Or do you think there's more legs to that? Safra Catz : The one thing I can tell you is we have an excellent relationship with the folks at TikTok. Lawrence Ellison : Yes. I'll second that. It's excellent. Let me take the other part of your question, which is, do I think this is a kind of a year 2000 like pandemic boom, people rushing to get to the cloud, and it's going to slow down after? Now that the pandemic, thank God, it's beginning to recede. Just the opposite, we're really still in the early days. We're in the early days of either understanding how different Cloud ERP is from on-premise ERP. And I just mentioned this one interesting example in that in the modern world, as more and more people go to Cloud ERP and you buy -- you procure something, that it's really one Oracle ERP system talking to another Oracle ERP system, but it needs to be facilitated through -- with a financial -- a finance partner and probably multiple finance partners and multiple logistics partners and -- to automate and finance and move that product from A to B and finance that product and understand when it's going to be delivered, all of those things. And so no, I think we're really in the early -- really early days. Even though we now have 10,000 customers in Oracle ERP Fusion, another -- almost 30,000 customers in total, including NetSuite, I still think we're in the very early days of doing this. It's just getting faster. I mean the growth -- our growth is accelerating, accelerating, accelerating. You look at our growth rate, it's not going down. We're getting bigger and the growth rate, and we're sustaining that mid-30s -- high 20s, mid-30s growth rate with NetSuite and Fusion in spite of the fact we've more than doubled. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Philip Winslow : Congrats on another quarter of accelerating growth. One comment from your script today really stood out to me, and that was continued to grow profits while we push our top line growth into the double digits next year. Now obviously, this is continued reacceleration from the 6% to 8% the past 2 quarters and your guidance, obviously, on a constant currency basis for Q4. So my question to you, Safra and Larry is, can you help just unpack this for us in terms of the puts and takes between database and apps, cloud on-premise, et cetera, that give you confidence for continued acceleration in the double digits, but also, like you said, while growing profits? Safra Catz : Okay. So as you've seen, we've made a lot of investments. We basically -- our CapEx this year is double last year, and that's because we've been putting out a lot of capability around the world. Simultaneously, our revenues have been increasing. But over the past few years, we've had parts of the business that were significant parts of the business that were shrinking. And now, as you see in this quarter, for example, all lines of businesses are increasing. We have -- different lines of business have bookings growth, some of which are as high as well over 100%. And so what's happened is the -- most of the business is now growing. And so they're much less of the negatives. And the things that we're getting smaller like application license, for example, is a very small number now. And then, of course, our technology license is going very, very well, including, just this quarter, technology was up 9%. So the cloud business is on an absolute role. You can see it in the numbers already and ERP, HCM, but also, of course, OCI straight and autonomous database. And just all those parts of the business are now growing, and they're large. And the shrinking parts of the business -- first of all, there's a lot less shrinking. We grew and to the extent that we have some supply chain loosening where we are able to deliver all of our bookings, we just expect growth sort of all over the place. And so we're very upbeat about this next year. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Congratulations on a great quarter. It's great to see the momentum really showing through to the results now. Last quarter, you guys talked a lot about an increasing focus on verticals, particularly banking and health care. This quarter, you're talking about rolling up some of those verticals. Can you talk to us a little bit more about the approach on how you build up and create that roll up in the vertical? How much of that effort is building like vertical-specific products? How much of it is a new go-to-market strategy, if you will, or aligning the go-to-market strategy for those verticals? And how much work is left to be done on those 2 sides? Lawrence Ellison : Well, let me just start with health care because you think of health care as a vertical, and Cerner is certainly in a vertical, which is an epic they compete for providers. And people think of that as, well, that's health care. But that's not health care. There's clinical trials for -- in pharmaceutical companies. You want to integrate -- the clinical trials the pharmaceutical companies pay for and run, but actually not really. The providers run those clinical trials. So the whole ecosystem -- no one's ever tried to do the entire ecosystem. But to answer your question, we had -- we are greatly enhancing our HCM system for hospitals so that they can have nurses that work 3 days a week or 4 days a week and doctors that work in a couple of different hospitals. And scheduling these independent contractors, if you will, is very complicated. You don't of think of hospitals as being a collection of independent contractors, but it's full-time workers and independent contractors, and scheduling that is complex. Paying them is complex. Some of them are unionized. The rules are complex. So we're doing a massive -- we're doing a lot of industry-specific features for hospitals to help them manage their workforce. In inventory -- hospital inventory isn't in a warehouse. Hospital inventory -- the drug, they're scattered all throughout the hospital. Nurses stations have drugs -- there's an interesting drug called tranexamic acid, which is used to stop bleeding. Where you can't go to the warehouse, someone's bleeding, you can't go to the warehouse and look for the drug. You've got to be able to find it immediately, and it's got to be close to the operating room. It's got to be close to -- where intensive -- the intensive care unit. So the inventory is distributed all throughout the hospital. So we are paying RFID tags in all the inventory so you can find things very, very quickly. So how we handle inventory is being enhanced specifically for hospitals. And I can go on and on. One thing a doctor does is before I can authorize a test, before I can authorize prescribing a drug for a patient, I have to check with the insurance company to make sure they'll pay for it. Now -- so the doctors and hospitals spend a lot of time negotiating with the payer, the insurance company. Well, okay, given these symptoms, can I get this test paid for? Yes, no? Given these symptoms, can I get this drug paid for? Yes, no? We're automating that interaction between the payers and the providers. So yes, we're adding a lot of industry-specific features to automate the interactions in the entire ecosystem. And that's why we think we're in a good position to roll up health care, which is a gigantic industry. No one's ever really tried this before, but we have all the pieces. We have the payment pieces. We automate a lot of the insurers. We have HCM, which allows us to help them manage their workforce. We have ERP, which helps them keep track of inventory. And soon, we will have Cerner, which will help them to deliver care to patients. So we'll be -- and we have clinical trial system for the pharmaceutical noise. We have the entire portfolio, and we're interconnecting all the pieces so we can make that ecosystem work efficiently for the first time. And actually, the pandemic has showed we're in desperate need of such an integrated system. Keith Weiss : Yes. It sounds like a massive value unlock if it gets all pulled together. Lawrence Ellison : I think we can do it. We're on our way to do it. And the benefits to Oracle are great. But actually, it's -- this is -- at least for me, personally, this is a mission. I think the benefits to every patient in the world is going to be enormous. We need to do this. The pandemic has shown a variety of weaknesses in our health care systems. We have the technology to address those weaknesses, and that's what we're going to do. Safra Catz : Okay. Let me just say one other thing. So we have a number of vertical industries in which we have products, and our competitors don't have products. And this has been a core part of how we work. We work with retailers. We work in financial services. We work in utilities. We work in construction engineering. We don't just modify ERP systems slightly and say we're in the industry. We're actually in operational systems in the industry, and it brings incredible value to our customers to be able to use these products. Operator : Our last question for the day will come from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Safra, I was hoping you could expand a bit on the strength in Cloud at Customer. And just really 2 things about that. How should we think about Cloud at Customer being somewhat of a leading indicator for adoption of autonomous database? And then are any of the supply constraints starting to loosen up a bit on that front in terms of maybe helping to accelerate rev rec in that area over the next couple of quarters? Safra Catz : Well, I will admit that the past couple of years have been really challenging, and I'm incredibly proud of our team. I think our excellent relationships with our wonderful suppliers made it possible for us to build out our cloud as well as provide hardware to our customers. We couldn't meet every need as quickly as we would have liked, and we have an extremely large backlog. That is absolutely true. That backlog also gives me enormous visibility because those customers have told us they want Cloud at Customer or they want hardware. And I have a line of sight to get it landed in their facilities. The reality is that we have so much going on at the same time. We've built out our cloud internationally. We've built a number of private clouds where it is exactly the same capability as our public cloud for our customers who have regulatory requirements that require something special or whether it's data sovereignty or otherwise. And we are meeting everyone's needs. And I think that, again, the incredible optimism you hear from me and Larry is very much because we have line of sight to the massive demand that has been coming our way and that we've been handling and a line of sight on how to deliver it. So now I read the newspapers -- actually, I don't read the newspaper. I read the computer that used to be a newspaper, and so we see everything that's going on. But I'm extremely confident in the capabilities of my team to execute. Operator : And that will conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll turn it over to management for their closing comments. Ken Bond : Thank you, Holly. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn it back to Holly to close the call. Operator : Once again, we'd like to thank you for participating in today's Oracle Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call.

It's now my pleasure to hand today's conference over to Oracle's Senior Vice President, Ken Bond. Ken Bond : Great. Thank you, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and Chief Executive Officer, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. And these forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, we had an excellent quarter across the board with total revenue growing 10% in constant currency, the highest organic growth we've seen since 2011, and $240 million above the high end of my constant currency guidance. Earnings were equally strong as the EPS was $0.20 above the high end of guidance. What Q4 demonstrates is that our business is accelerating. A growing list of customers, many new to Oracle are choosing us for more products and services as they understand the benefits of Oracle technology. Our technology helps make our customers modern, efficient and more productive. And they got to see that during the pandemic, and now it's very clear. Those customers are then becoming larger Oracle customers. Fusion customers are buying OCI. OCI customers are buying Fusion and NetSuite. Database customers are moving to autonomous on OCI. Industry vertical customers are going all in on Fusion. We have real momentum all around. Going forward and despite the macro environment, we continue to expect the revenue growth in our cloud business will accelerate substantially in fiscal year '23. We are also excited about completing the Cerner acquisition. Larry spoke at our Oracle Health Strategy session last week, and he'll give you more details today, and I'll fill in with some numbers. As you can see in the financial statements, the currency headwind this past quarter was 5%, which was considerably higher than the 2% to 3%, it was during our last earnings call. Following my regular custom, I'll be reviewing our non-GAAP USD results using constant currency growth rates so you have a clear view of the business as we manage it. Now for Q4, total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.6 billion, up 7% in constant currency again, driven by Fusion, NetSuite, autonomous database and, of course, Gen 2 OCI. Total cloud revenues, that's IaaS plus SaaS was USD 2.5 billion, up 22% in constant currency. Application subscription revenues were $3.2 billion, up 9% in constant currency. Our strategic back-office cloud applications now have an annualized revenue of $5.4 billion and grew 24% in constant currency this quarter, including Fusion ERP up 23% and NetSuite ERP up 30%. Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.4 billion, up 5% in constant currency. Infrastructure, cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $3.2 billion, and excluding our legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew 49%, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 83%. Cloud@Customer consumption revenue, which was up 108% and autonomous database, which was up 29%. License revenues were $2.5 billion, up 25% in constant currency led by database sales for use in the cloud by major application cloud SaaS companies. As a result our database business had an exceptional quarter with total database revenue up double digits. So all in, total revenue for the quarter were $11.8 billion, up 10% in constant currency. Operating expenses were up 11% as we continue to invest to meet growing demand for our cloud services. For the quarter, the gross margin for cloud services and license support was 82% and the gross profit dollars grew 4%. The full year growth of this gross profit was 4% higher than the 2% we saw last year, and I expect it will be significantly higher in FY '23. Though we will continue to invest in growth, we should benefit from economies of scale of running our cloud business as it gets larger. You should keep in mind that our fundamental principle going forward is to grow non-GAAP EPS while accelerating cloud revenue growth. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.6 billion, up 8% from last year, and the operating margin was 47%, once again higher than all of our competitors. And even while we've been investing aggressively for growth, we've maintained our financial discipline. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 10.1 and below our base tax rate of 19% as we received a benefit from the resolution of some tax matters in Q4. EPS was $1.54 in U.S. dollars, up 7% in constant currency, unchanged in USD. GAAP EPS was $1.16, down 8% in constant currency, down 15% in USD. Now for the -- let me go through the full fiscal year, though I've given you some full year numbers so far every once in a while. For the full fiscal year, total company revenues were $42.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency and our highest annual growth rate in more than 10 years. Total applications revenue grew 8% compared to 5% last year, and total infrastructure revenue grew 7% compared to 2% growth last year. Clearly, our revenue growth accelerated this year as investments into our cloud businesses are paying off. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the year was $30.2 billion, up 6%. Total cloud services were up 22% to $10.8 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was 4.9 -- was USD 4.90, up 5% in USD, up 8% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was 46%, up 2% from pre-pandemic levels and down a little bit -- down 1% from last year. Operating cash flow over the last 4 quarters was $9.5 billion, and free cash flow was $5 billion with capital expenditures of $4.5 billion during the year. For the quarter, operating cash flow was $4 billion and free cash flow was $2.6 billion. At quarter end, we had nearly $22 billion in cash and marketable securities, but that's lower now that Cerner has closed. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.4 billion, up slightly in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $46.6 billion, up 17% in constant currency due to strong bookings. Approximately 57% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for a total of $600 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.5 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. With the completion of the Cerner acquisition, which happened after the end of Q4, actually, this last week, we've added about $15.8 billion of debt. And we anticipate retaining our investment-grade credit rating, meaning that for the time being, we're going to focus on reducing our debt balance while continuing our share repurchases at current levels. In addition, I don't believe the dividend will be impacted at all. Once the debt level has declined, we'll reexamine share repurchase levels. Now to the guidance. We feel very optimistic about our business momentum. And we also recognize that there is increasing macro uncertainty right now. In addition, since we ceased operations in Russia in March and made other adjustments in the region, we have factored out around $100 million per quarter from guidance that we used to receive from these customers. Taking all that into account, I do expect our cloud business, which grew 22% this year, will organically grow more than 30% in constant currency in FY '23. Cloud service and license support will also see growth acceleration and could well see double-digit organic growth. As I said earlier, our fundamental principle is to grow EPS while accelerating cloud revenue growth. Given our increasing confidence in organic revenue growth, we will continue to prudently invest back in the business and you can already see the returns in our performance. Revenue growth accelerated from 2% in FY '21 to 7% this year. Clearly, there's strong demand for our cloud services, and we intend to capitalize it -- to capitalize on it. As such, I expect our CapEx spend will be higher in FY '23 to meet the demand. We expect to add another 6 regions in fiscal 2023 in addition to the 38 cloud regions across 20 countries that we have already serving our customers. I also want to share how we will be running Cerner since it will impact their contribution to Oracle going forward. We are already working actively to build and implement world-class health care cloud capabilities. Larry will go over that. This means that we are reviewing their entire product portfolio to identify areas where we can include Oracle technology rather than third-party products as well as moving them to OCI. These efforts will deliver a more stable, secure and innovative product portfolio for customers while using less third-party products. We remain confident in our ability to grow Cerner's top line and bottom line faster than they were able to do so on their own as these changes are implemented. Now let me turn to my guidance. I'll review Q1 on a non-GAAP basis and if currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 3% to 4% negative impact on total revenue and maybe $0.05 to $0.06 negative effect on EPS in Q1. However, actual currency impact may be different. Total revenues for Q1, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 20% to 22% in constant currency, and are expected to grow 17% to 19% in USD at today's exchange rate. As with past acquisitions, have added conservatism for the Cerner revenue contribution to account for the transition. For Q1, cloud -- total cloud excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 25% to 28% in constant currency and is expected to grow from 22% to 25% in USD. As I mentioned above, for fiscal year 2023, total cloud excluding Cerner is expected to grow over 30% in constant currency. Total cloud growth in Q1, including Cerner is expected to grow from 47% to 50% in constant currency, 44% to 47% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 6% to 10% and be between $1.09 and $1.13 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 1% to 5% and be between $1.04 and $1.08 in USD. And as I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including Q1. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Safra. As Safra said, our plan is to accelerate cloud revenue growth, while continuing to grow earnings per share. First, let me provide some detail on how we plan to accelerate cloud revenue growth. It all starts with our two most important verticals : health care and financial services. In health care, we\u2019re in the process of building a complete suite of applications for the entire health care ecosystem, starting with health care providers like hospitals and clinics. We\u2019re modernizing Cerner\u2019s clinical systems by adding capabilities like a voice user interface and applications like disease-specific AI models for cancer and other diseases. We\u2019re including an IoT device network to improve patient diagnostics and monitoring. We\u2019re adding administrative systems, including managing the incredibly complex contract workforce that hospitals have as doctors are not bolt-on employees nor are nurses. We are going to help recruiting, scheduling and paying those contract workers according to their contracts. Inventory at hospitals is enormously complicated. Inventories aren\u2019t in a central location. You find inventory in nurse\u2019s stations outside operating rooms, outside the intensive care unit. There\u2019s inventory everywhere. Managing that inventory is very complicated. We\u2019re adding RFID tags and maps on handheld phones to help people find what they\u2019re looking for quickly. For payers, including insurance companies and governments, we\u2019re automating payment authorization and billing systems. For pharmaceutical companies, we\u2019re integrating our clinical trial system directly into the hospital clinical system, making clinical trials easier to start and faster to complete. We can do all of this and more because we\u2019re building these health care applications using the latest most productive technologies in the cloud, namely, the Oracle Autonomous Database and the APEX low code programming language. Using these tools, security and reliability are built into the technology platform, not the application. In our financial services vertical, we\u2019re working with major money center banks and leading logistics companies to automate B2B commerce from directly within the Oracle ERP Cloud. For example, when a hospital wants to buy an X-ray machine, that hospital simply enters a purchase request for the X-ray machine into their Oracle ERP procurement system. That procurement system then sends that order directly to the selling company\u2019s Oracle ERP order management system and automatically originates a corresponding loan request from that hospital\u2019s preferred bank. The company selling the X-ray machine uses their Oracle ERP order management system to check product availability and submit a shipping request to their preferred logistics provider to automatically quote a delivery date to the buyer. The entire B2B commerce process is automated within the Oracle Cloud. Purchasing, selling, loan origination, shipping, billing and payments. Automating B2B commerce is yet another huge opportunity for Oracle. We already have over 30,000 Cloud ERP customers, including many of the world\u2019s most important banks and leading logistics companies. Let\u2019s take a moment to look at the progress we continue to make in our Oracle ERP Cloud, starting with health care. We\u2019ve got a very strong position in health care with the providers, including Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Mount Sinai, Northwell Health, Tenet, HCM Health, Highmark Health, Humana, Cigna and many others. In Q4, we closed United Healthcare, a win over SAP. We won the NHS, the UK\u2019s second major move to the Cloud. We won New South Wales Ministry of Health in Australia for ERP and SCM. We won WellSpan, a regional provider in Pennsylvania with eight hospitals. We won Abcam, a UK life sciences company, increasing their footprint in ERP and SCM. Going live in Q4 were the Cleveland Clinic with ERP and SCM, UC Health for ERP and SCM, Pfizer on enterprise performance management, UK Health went live, Atrium Health went live, all in Q4. In financial services, our other really big vertical, we had, as I said earlier, we have a very strong position with the money center banks with ERP. Bank of America uses Fusion applications. JPMorgan Chase uses Fusion applications. So does Santander, Bank of New York Mellon, HSBC, Lloyds, Macquarie, Credit Suisse, UBS, Credit Agricole, SMFB, TD Bank, Societe Generale, Vanguard, State Street. I can go on and on, but let me go to the results in Q4. In Q4, we won at Citibank a big ERP win against SAP. We won at Chubb. We won at PNC, the sixth largest bank in the United States. We won at SMBC, the largest Japanese-owned bank in the United States. We won Oversea China Banking Corp. We won Mizuho, the third largest bank in Japan. TIAA, Desjardins, Mitsui Sumitomo also in Japan. GMP, one of Mexico\u2019s largest financial services company. We have a very, very strong position in financial services. That\u2019s one of the key groups of partners that we\u2019re working to automate B2B commerce, along with the logistics companies. In retail, we won, well, we already had Kohl\u2019s, Office Depot, Macy\u2019s, Kroger\u2019s, Albertson\u2019s, Petco, McDonald\u2019s, Chipotle, Tiffany, Sachs, Williams-Sonoma, Walmart, CVS, but in Q4, we added to that list. We added Lowe\u2019s and Albertson\u2019s and Sherwin-Williams and Abercrombie & Fitch. We had major go-lives at Macy\u2019s, Next Doors, and the Co-op Stores, all in retail. In communications, where we\u2019re already present at AT&T, Orange, MTN, Bharti Airtel, Rogers, Wind Tre, Telecom Italia, KPN and SEC, we won Virgin Media. We had a major expansion at AT&T, an ERP SCM expansion. We won a major expansion ERP and EPM at Verizon. Very, very strong quarter in telecommunications with a huge go-live at KPN, the Dutch telecom company, in ERP and SCM. Service wins, we already have PwC, KPMG, Booz Allen, True Blue, Securitas, Waste Management, Skanska, McDermott-Jacobs. We won in Q4 BDO, Verisk Analytics and the Mudafalo Group. Go-lives in Q4 in services included Pricewaterhouse, Manpower Group, TriNet and Republic Services. In the public sector, we had a major win at the State of Missouri, wall-to-wall at the State of Missouri, ERP, SCM, HCM. That was a win over Workday, SAP and everybody else. We won at the Scottish Government. We won at the UK Home Office. We won a State of Switzerland, Vaud. We won General Organization for Social Insurance in Saudi Arabia. We won a deal with the police department in the State of Victoria in Australia. We had major go-lives in public sector in the City of St. Louis and Norfolk County, UK. In hospitality, where we already have Marriott, Hilton, Caesar\u2019s, MGM, Lowes, Royal Caribbean and Park Hotels, we added Airbnb for ERP expansion, a win over Workday, and Intercontinental Hotels and Resorts. Logistics, again, this is our other big group of partners in our major effort to automate B2B commerce from within the Oracle ERP Cloud. We have a very strong position globally in logistics. Our customers include UPS, FedEx, DHL, Swift, Schneider, Union Pacific, Yellow. We added An Post, the postal service of Ireland. The go-lives included DHL, UPS and Deutsche Post. In higher ed, where we\u2019re already installed at Princeton, Cambridge, Julliard, Vanderbilt, UCLA, University of Chicago, Edenborough, Rutgers, Baylor, UCSD and lots and lots of others, we added the University of Maine, East Tennessee State, Villanova and the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Other notable wins in the quarter, on high-tech, we won Teradata. We won a big win at Toyota Motor, an ERP win. At Denso, again, let\u2019s see, what else we got. Berry Global, let\u2019s see, AP Team was another ERP win in energies. Okay. So it was a very, very strong quarter. We\u2019re very excited about our momentum in ERP and how we can expand ERP from what it was when it was an on-premise system to what it can be in terms of B2B commerce automation now that it\u2019s a cloud system. With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back to Safra. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. David, if you please poll the audience for questions, we'll go to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much and congratulations on the double-digit growth in the quarter. So Larry, your vision of a national health record database is very compelling. It would be a profound benefit to society. Just considering that several trillion dollars are spent on healthcare, what do you see as the size of the opportunity for Oracle and Cerner if you solve that particular problem? Lawrence Ellison : Well, the national health records database solves 2 problems, and it allows patients in the case of an emergency to have their caregivers get immediate access to all of their health records, which will deliver way better outcomes for people. The other is public health officials will get much better information about the state of health in their country. So I mean, the amount of -- having this knowledge, it's -- we dramatically improved healthcare but we also save an enormous amount of money by doing that. I don't know if you remember when we sent that hospital [shipped] (ph) in New York City because the officials in New York thought they were about to run out of the hospital beds. It turns out they were wrong. We didn't run out of hospital beds, but they didn't know. They don't have -- public health officials don't have access to that kind of information. They're a bit flying -- it was very clear there are -- in a lot of cases, they were flying blind during the pandemic. By providing this information, we save a lot of lives and we save a lot of money. The scale of the opportunity is gigantic because it's not -- people think of it as a national opportunity. It's a global opportunity. Every country -- I mean, if you look at Western Europe, the Western Europe budgets are dominated by health care. If they can save lives and save money by putting in modern information systems, they'll do it and they'll do it quickly. It's clearly going to be our largest business. Operator : Next, we'll go to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Congratulations on a really solid quarter. So Safra, you mentioned on the conference call that you guys are putting up this type of result even on the backdrop, that's not the most stable kind of macro backdrop. And we're seeing a lot of other software companies seeing slipped deals, seeing issues with the consumer, Internet companies lowering their spend. You guys seem to be working through this very well. Can you give us some color into how you're doing it? Is it better execution? Is the Oracle value proposition going through more clearly? Can you help us understand where you're able to put up a bigger beat when a lot of guys are working with skinnier beat if at all during this period? Safra Catz : Okay. Well, first of all, you have to understand, we're a very big company. We have thousands -- hundreds of thousands of existing customers. Our products also are so compelling that often customers save money by moving to OCI. They -- also many of our customers realized during the pandemic that they absolutely had to have modern systems. Those companies that didn't have modern systems fairly survived through the pandemic. They have to have a digital connection with their customers, with their employees, with their suppliers. Those are the kinds of products we have. And when customers move, let's say, from Amazon to us, the moment they try us, they realize, whoa, this is better and more economical. And of course, for Oracle workloads, you can't get anywhere close to what we can do. So we have a lot of things working in our favor. Our products, of course, our Fusion products are superb. I mean we have so many customers. This call is not long enough to reach them. And of course, NetSuite is, again, industry-leading like Fusion for a different part of the market, incredible momentum. And now we -- by the way, as I mentioned, there's about $100 million a quarter that is just the Russia, Ukraine region, that we stopped charging our customers in Ukraine when they were invaded even though we continue to help them. And of course, we suspended everything in Russia. So we just are just trying to meet our customers' needs. The biggest issue is having enough to meet demand. And I'm actually very happy with the way we manage the supply chain this past quarter, and I'm hoping that it will be -- it will continue to get better because that will give us more capacity and more capability to deliver to our customers. So I mean, we just have so much momentum. We have so many happy customers. And they're just -- new customers are just buying more. You get into the cycle that's very virtuous and people really build confidence in our capability to execute and also the overall economic message and offering that we're giving, We've always tried to give a compelling financial offering. And I think that's really resonating in these times. Operator : Next, we'll go to Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Thanks very much for taking my questions and congrats on the great results. Larry, we picked up a meaningful uptick in the number of large enterprise agreements or ULAs that customers are doing with Oracle. And in particular, to satisfy their database needs, both on-premise and also in the cloud. Do you have any telemetry or other insights into customer behavior to see where they're deploying these licenses? And can you talk about why BYOL is so important to your strategy and the longevity of Oracle database? And maybe just for Safra as well, that license number was so strong. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned license growth was led by database use in the cloud by major app cloud SaaS companies. Just wondering if there's any more color you can provide there. Lawrence Ellison : Yes. With the exception of Workday, most of the big application companies maybe conspicuously, salesforce.com is a very large Oracle user. And they license our database for use in their cloud. But they're not the only ones. There are a lot of SaaS companies that use our database in the cloud. And that keeps our license business very, very strong. Our database license business is very, very strong. We don't confuse a license for on-premise. Some licenses classically are used on-premise, but a lot of the new licenses that we're selling allow our customers to take those licenses and run them in the cloud, whether it's our cloud or other people's clouds or in the case of Salesforce in their own cloud. So it's -- the Oracle database is still the #1 database in the world by a significant margin. And it's the #1 database in the cloud when you start counting all of the SaaS companies that use the Oracle Database. Operator : Next, we'll go to Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : Congratulations on the strong quarter and the very positive commentary and guidance. I'd like to drill a little more on this question of people's concerns. With the increasing concerns of recession by many, can you tell me what you're seeing for the apps part of the business and more specifically for ERP? What I'm trying to understand is how will the shift in ERP to the cloud be impacted by any economic slowdown or won't it be? How should we think about that? Lawrence Ellison : Well, I'm not sure I call it -- I'm sorry, Safra, Pease go ahead. Safra Catz : No. You go ahead, Larry. You go ahead. Lawrence Ellison : Yes. Okay. I'm not sure I'd call it countercyclical, but the cloud systems cost a lot less than the on-premise systems to run. So -- and they give you much better information. They allow you to control expenses better. They don't cost that much to implement because you pay for them over time. So we -- what we're seeing is a -- let's take a look at NetSuite, which is the low end of the market, and you think those would be the companies to be most affected by the recession. It's not JPMorgan Chase. They'll keep building -- they'll keep putting in new systems. But some smaller entrepreneur-led companies, you think that the recession we got them. They had -- we got the most revenue we ever got from NetSuite this past quarter. and the highest growth rate that we've ever gotten from NetSuite this past quarter. They are accelerating into the recession because we think the benefits are enormous and it equips the companies to compete more effectively. And again, we don't see that business slowing down. Quite the contrary, we see our ERP business both Fusion and NetSuite accelerating. This in spite of the macroeconomic situation. Safra? Safra Catz : Yes. I think people don't realize how exorbitantly expensive it is to run those large SAP systems. They have data centers associated with them. They have hundreds, sometimes thousands of technicians to run them. They're old, they're clunky and moving to Fusion ERP. It's just a totally different world and costs So - the costs are tiny in comparison. I think people sort of forget that. And this applies really to all on-premise systems, but even more so to those old SAP systems. And our cloud offering in that area really is unrivaled. Frankly, unrivaled. And we -- our win rates just continue. And we're very optimistic about it, and we've sold a lot. A lot is still being implemented, and we expect that you'll see that in the numbers, while our customers end up spending less than what they use to spend with on-premise. Operator : Next, we'll go to Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Philip Winslow : Last quarter, Safra, you expected organic revenue growth to reach double digits next fiscal year. And so congratulations on reaching that double-digit milestone this quarter. Now within today's results, 2 numbers really stood out to us. First was the upside to license revenue. And then second was your commentary about total database revenue growing in the double digits. So my question is, Safra, Larry, can you give us more color on what's driving that reacceleration in license revenue in particular? Even as cloud revenue inflected to its highest growth rate in more than 4 years, is this BYOL bringing the heat? Is this autonomous database getting big enough and growing fast enough to lift the overall number, et cetera. And is this the broad-based demand that you mentioned on the Q3 call? Or is this more big deal driven? Safra Catz : So it's a little of both. You see, first of all, large enterprises understand that having an unlimited agreement for some period of time, an unlimited agreement gives them unbelievable flexibility. Any large customer, large database user that does not have an unlimited agreement with us is really not optimizing for their spend because it gives them incredible flexibility. They can use on-premise for as long as they need it. They can move to the cloud and get a much lower price in the cloud with BYOL, and they can move back and forth. And it just gives us the kind of flexibility. Those agreements are the ultimate sort of the foundation of so much of what goes on. In addition, of course, in technology, we also have our leading Java business, which on-premise is an extensive use and in the cloud is at no charge. So customers can be motivated to bring their Java to the Oracle Cloud and to use it at no charge, their Java program and to use it at no charge. So we have a lot of things that incent bringing your Oracle databases to our cloud and, of course, all your Java work to our cloud. So both of those are absolutely critical for our license numbers to be as strong as they are. And the Oracle database, I've been following Oracle for, well, since the '80s. And I always -- we always hear about some new product that's about to overtake Oracle. And the reality is that the Oracle database is beyond the gold standard. If you really need work done and if you want to protect your most critical data and you want to use large amounts of it, it is going to be the Oracle database that is head and shoulders above every other product. And invariably, some folks try other things when they get bigger, they always come back to the Oracle database It is irreplaceable because of its technical capabilities that are so far superior. And that becomes very, very, very clear to customers and more and more of them license -- continue their license and extend those unlimited agreements, whether for on-premise and in the cloud. It's not either or it's both, and that is the best use of it. Lawrence Ellison : I'll add 1 thing to that, which is the Oracle Autonomous Database is interesting because it's autonomous. In other words, it doesn't require human beings to run it like database administrators, things like that. Recently, inside of Oracle, inside of our cloud, virtually every database going up for -- to run our cloud, the autonomous database because people don't want to hire database administrators inside of Oracle Corporation. It's just much cheaper to run. And I think in that sense, the Autonomous database is countercyclical. You do save a huge amount of money just by moving from conventional Oracle database to the autonomous database. It's actually more secure, more reliable and cost Wales to run. You don't need a bunch of experts running it. You don't need anyone to run it. There is a programming language called APEX, which uses -- it's a low code programming environment where you use 10% the name amount of programmers that you would use if you were programming in our other programming language called Java. And APEX is also becoming very popular inside of Oracle to build applications. I see this as 2 interesting trends as people using more modern technology to dramatically reduce their labor costs, which I think will play very well in the next couple of years in this economy. Operator : And our final question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a good quarter. Safra, can you just give any additional color on the CapEx outlook for fiscal '23 relative to what we saw this year? And then just to clarify on the buyback, I just want to make sure I heard it correctly. Is the pace of buyback that we saw this last quarter still reasonable for the near term, even with the incremental debt from Cerner? Safra Catz : Yes. So let me hit the buyback first because I know I gave you quite a word sandwich there at the end. I was losing steam. We bought back $600 million this past quarter. I think we bought back about $600 million the previous quarter. I expect to do about the same this quarter. Usually, I don't give you the number in advance. But since previous quarter, to those 2, we did $7 billion and a couple of $8 billion. We're not going to be at that level. We'll be at the $600 million for a few quarters until I see where our debt levels are. And so $600 million a quarter is probably what I'm targeting. It could be a little bit more potentially but that's kind of where I'm at. And then on CapEx, okay. So you noticed how I mentioned how many regions we have, we have just put out -- put up so many regions over the past 1.5 years or 2. I think we now have more than Amazon or we're in -- I think we do already have more than Amazon already. We are going to build another 6, and we're going to expand the ones that we have because they are being used so extensively. In many cases, they are spoken for. And so I expect CapEx, which was where it was this year. I think it will be a little bit more than what it was this year, next year. I'll be giving a little bit more detailed guidance as I see it playing out over the year. But we have so much -- I mean we have so much cloud demand that I am going to continue to spend in capital expenditure. But I do believe that as a percentage of our revenue growth. I think I'll start really feeling those economies of scale and increasing my gross margins and my operating margin significantly. Ken Bond : A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on the Investor Relations website. Thanks for joining today. With that, I'll turn it back to David for closing.

It's now my pleasure to hand today's conference over to Oracle's Senior Vice President, Ken Bond. Ken Bond : Thank you, Josh. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's first quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz.

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we will begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had an excellent quarter with total revenue growing 23% in constant currency and beating the high-end of our guidance. We also had a great organic quarter with total revenue growing 8% in constant currency. This was on top of a fantastic Q4 last quarter. And as you can see from the numbers, we continue to get excellent returns on the investments we've been making over the last few years in products, infrastructure and our sales organization. We are seeing company-specific and product-specific momentum. We continue to expect organic revenue growth and our cloud business will accelerate substantially in FY '23. The currency headwind this quarter was much higher than the 3% headwind that was present when we gave guidance. It was actually 6 points, even though due to rounding, it may look like 5%. And that's a currency headwind to total revenue, it was in fact 6 points. And yet we still exceeded our forecasts on a reported basis and we beat our constant currency revenue forecast by $200 million. We saw similar currency headwinds in EPS which had an $0.08 negative effect much worse than the $0.05 headwind present at the time of guidance in June. It's because of the significant and volatile swings in currencies, that I always discuss our results using constant currency growth rate, and so that you have a clear view of the business as we manage it. Now to the numbers and there's a lot here. I'm going to go over the revenue results, including Cerner, and then some of the results, excluding Cerner, which many of you are focused on. I hope you're pleased with our expanded disclosure this year. So total cloud revenue that\u2019s SaaS and IaaS including Cerner, was $3.6 billion, up 45% in USD and up 50% in constant currency with IaaS revenue, a smidge under $900 million and SaaS revenue at $2.7 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $8.4 billion, up 20% in constant currency driven again by fusion autonomous database and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes support were $4 billion, up 37% in constant currency. Again, Q1 cloud application revenue that\u2019s SaaS was $2.7 billion, up 43% in USD, up 48% in constant currency. Infrastructure subscription revenues, including support were $4.4 billion, up 7% in constant currency. And to be clear, that's actually 7% organic growth with no contribution from Cerner. Q1 cloud infrastructure or IaaS revenue was $0.9 billion, up 52% in USD, up 58% in constant currency, again, with no contribution from Cerner. Now, the revenue results, excluding Cerner. Total cloud revenue that's IaaS plus SaaS, excluding Cerner was up 29% in constant currency at $3.1 billion. Organic revenue growth for both IaaS and SaaS was significantly higher than last quarter. Application subscription revenues, excluding Cerner were up 12% in constant currency. Our strategic back office cloud applications now have annualized revenue of $5.8 billion and grew 33% in constant currency, including fusion ERP, which was up 38%. NetSuite ERP up 30% and Fusion HCM up 26%. That means that SaaS revenues, excluding Cerner were $2.2 billion, up 20%. Infrastructure cloud service revenue was up 58% in constant currency. Excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services grew 70% with an annualized revenue of $3.2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 103%. Cloud@Customer consumption revenue, which was up 92%, and Autonomous Database, which was up 56%. And it's not only that our growth rates are higher than our hyperscale competitors, maybe you'd expect that because we're the newest and thus the smallest, but our growth rates are increasing as we get bigger. Our second generation cloud launched after our competitors first generation cloud, and so we've been able to architect it more performantly, more securely and more sustainably. As a result, as more companies test our cloud, they discover how much better it is on price, security, performance and sustainability. In addition, we now have cloud regions in more countries and cities than AWS and Azure, giving our customers more choices for their sovereign data. And finally, many of our customers appreciate how flexible our service and business model is. All of this is amazing our customers, and I can't wait to share the stage with some of them at Oracle CloudWorld in October. Now, to license revenues, including Cerner, were $904 million, up 19% in constant currency led by database options and Java. Total database revenues were up 3% in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $11.4 billion, up 23% in constant currency, excluding Cerner revenue of $1.4 billion, organic revenue was up 8% in constant currency. In addition, I want to point out that since we no longer operate in Russia, this negatively affected revenue by over 1 point of growth. Had we still, had we not left, actually, our growth rate would be over 9% this quarter. Operating expenses were up 34%, mainly due to adding in Cerner's expenses, and the mix of our business. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 81% and the associated gross profit dollars grew 15% with Cerner and 7% excluding Cerner. In fact, the gross margin percentage on IaaS increased dramatically in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.5 billion, up 10% from last year. And I expect that we'll see strong operating income growth again in Q2. The operating margin, including Cerner was 39%, which is lower than in the past, since we only just began to integrate Cerner in the quarter. As we drive Cerner and its profitability to Oracle standards, and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow margin dollars, but also grow margin percentages significantly. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19.4%, slightly above the guidance rate and non-GAAP EPS was $1.03, unchanged in USD and up 8% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.56, down 34% and down 26% in constant currency, that's our GAAP EPS. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $10.5 billion and free cash flow was $5.4 billion with capital expenditures of $5.2 billion. For the quarter, operating cash flow was $6.4 billion and free cash flow was $4.7 billion with capital expenditures of $1.7 billion. At quarter end, we had $11.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. In the short-term, deferred revenue balance was $10.5 billion, up 11% in constant currency. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $16.7 billion, up 62% in constant currency due to strong bookings as well as the addition of Cerner. However, I would note for you all that the organic RPO growth accelerated to 22% in Q1 from 17% in Q4, approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases and prudent use of debt and our dividend. This quarter we repurchased 7.5 million shares for a total of 559 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors today declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Our fundamental principle is to grow non-GAAP EPS, while substantially increasing cloud revenue. And given our increasing confidence, we will continue to prudently invest as their strong demand for our cloud services. Now, let me turn to my guidance for Q2, which I will provide on a non-GAAP basis. Now we are assuming the currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now. That's not a prediction, that's just giving it to you as a translation as it currently is. In that case, currency should have a 5% to 6% negative effect on total revenue, and at least a $0.07 negative effect on EPs in Q2. As I say every quarter, the actual currency impact may be different by quarter end. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a tax rate of 20.5, which is up from 19.2 last year. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. So now to guidance. Total revenues for Q2, including Cerner are expected to grow from 21% to 23% in constant currency, and are expected to grow from 15% to 17% in USD. Total cloud growth, again including Cerner, is expected to grow from 46% to 50% in constant currency, 42% to 46% in USD. I expect that total cloud growth for the fiscal year excluding Cerner will be above 30% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to grow between 1% to 5% and be between $1.23 and $1.27 in constant currency, again due to currency headwinds, non-GAAP EPS is expected to decline 1% to 5% and be between $1.16 and $1.20 in USD. As I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including in Q2. And with that, I turn it over to Larry for his comments. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. Last quarter, Microsoft and Oracle announced that we had built a high speed interconnect between Microsoft Azure Cloud and the Oracle Cloud. The purpose of this Multi-cloud interconnect is to enable Azure customers to directly use the very latest Oracle Database technology, even if their application is running in Azure. In other words, customers can now use any combination of Microsoft and Oracle Cloud services together as if they were in one cloud. That was last quarter. This quarter, Oracle is making the latest version of our mice MySQL HeatWave database available in Amazon's AWS cloud. Multiple published customer benchmarks have shown that MySQL HeatWave delivers 7x better performance than Amazon Redshift. 10x better performance than Snowflake and up to 10x higher throughput than Amazon's own MySQL database called Aurora. The Multi-cloud era has begun. Customers are already buying applications and cloud infrastructure from several different providers, including Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, Oracle and others. Our job is to give our customers the ability to choose application and infrastructure technology from multiple clouds and then have those different clouds coexist and interoperate gracefully. Multi-cloud interoperability is an important step in the evolution of cloud computing. Multi-cloud interoperability is one of the reasons our infrastructure business is booming, growing over 50% in U.S dollars, and almost 60% in constant dollars. We expect Oracle's total cloud business to exceed a $20 billion annual run rate next year. Now I'll highlight some of our big new infrastructure wins in Q1. Overall, we added about 1,000 new paying customers for infrastructure in Q1. Let's start off with NVIDIA. NVIDIA chose OCI to build their SaaS products for data scientists for machine learning and inferencing along with moving their entire health care platform called Clara to OCI. Mosaic has developed a state-of-the-art neural network on OCI, and they picked OCI because OCI outperformed all of the other clouds when running machine learning and AI. The Avis car rental company is moving their entire Oracle estate, along with their Oracle applications to OCI. The Chicago public schools are closing data centers and migrating their Oracle estate to the Oracle Cloud. Tanium, a leader in cybersecurity chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure to help safeguard their customers with industry-leading security. OCI deployment will be a part of its multi-cloud strategy and delivering its SaaS platform Tanium as a service. Cigna, a health care company is migrating their existing Exadata on-premise to the Oracle Cloud. Additionally, their SaaS ERP system is being integrated with Oracle Cloud Digital Assistant. Tennessee and Oklahoma are both new government cloud customers. This was the first group of customers were all from North America. I just finished my list beginning with NVIDIA and North America and Tennessee and Oklahoma in North America. I'm now going to move to wins in LAD. AT&T in Mexico is the first case of any telco to move their entire Amdocs stack to a cloud and they're moving it their Amdocs stack to OCI's New Mexico cloud region. Avianca, one of the largest airlines in Latin America will move all of their workloads to OCI. Entel, another telecom, in fact, the largest telecom in Chile is now moving all of their critical workloads from AWS to OCI. Banco Digimais, a fintech bank in Brazil is moving their entire on-premises VMware estate to run in OCI 100%. Serasa Experian, a financial services company is moving AI training for OCR biometrics and facial recognition to OCI. Bionexo, another infotech company -- in the health care business, serving 1,500 -- 15,000 hospitals and clinics is migrating their data lake and their data warehouses from Amazon Web Services to OCI. Santander, a large bank is moving all of their databases from mainframes and Oracle databases all to the Oracle Exadata Cloud Service. Unimed, also a health care, a company health care insurance company is beginning the migration of all of their applications and database to OCI. Sky Mexico, the largest satellite paid TV producer in Mexico will move all of their data lakes and all of their data warehouses to OCI in the New Mexico region. That's Latin America. In JPAC, and maybe this is the most interesting customer I'll talk about, NRI, Nomura Research, is continuously expanding their dedicated cloud region. In Japan, they've just added a second data center NRI has. The Oracle Cloud in Japan, the NRI Oracle Cloud in Japan already runs 50% of all transactions on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. That's a mission critical application. ICI [ph] Bank Financial Services is the new customer in JPAC, Japan, Asia Pacific. Hitachi construction in Japan is moving their manufacturing, their critical manufacturing systems to OCI. [Indiscernible] timing technology, an infotech company is the new customer in Asia Pacific. Daiichi Sankyo is the first big pharma in Japan that is moving their database -- their Oracle Database workloads to the cloud. Pacific International Lines, the big transportation company is the new customer in Asia Pac. Li & Fung, a trading company, another new customer, we had -- again, eventually, we had a 1,000 new customers this quarter in OCI. [Indiscernible] another fintech company is again another big new customer for us in Asia Pacific. H2O Retailing is moving their entire VMware on-premise VMware estate to OCI. They're one of the largest retailers in Japan. Again, Asian Development Bank is the new customer in Asia Pac. [Indiscernible] Vision is an infotech company new customer. We have, again, a bunch of new customers in OCI all over the world. That's JPAC. Now let me move to EMEA. Dojo, a financial services company chose Oracle Cloud Infrastructure for their payment platform because their benchmark showed that the Oracle Cloud OCI is more secure and has better availability than the competition. Al Rajhi Bank, the world's largest Islamic Bank is in the process of moving all of its applications and databases to the Oracle Cloud. Unilever is integrating a few -- their Oracle Fusion Applications with the autonomous database to build a next generation super secure, super agile platform for Unilever. Atlantic Financial Group, an infotech company, hosts core banking functions on the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which to many of their banking customers. Centrico [ph], an infotech company is moving all their workloads from their old data centers to a combination of OCI using OCI's multi-cloud services to access other clouds. Mio [ph], big telephone company moving over 300 Oracle Databases to the Oracle Exadata cloud. [Indiscernible], the government agency migrating all databases off their IBM mainframes and UNIX systems to the Oracle Database and to the Oracle Cloud. And I'll close with the U.K Home Office, the department is moving to the Oracle Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure with a focus on dramatically improving both security and reliability. With that, I will turn it back over to Safra. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Josh, if you could go ahead and queue up the audience for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John DiFucci with Guggenheim. Your line is open. John DiFucci : Thank you. Hi, Safra and, Larry. A little surprised to see your strong results here when most software companies, other than some of the pure security names really faltered some against the macro backdrop. And frankly, you just didn't hear. But I want to focus the question on one area that we've gotten the most questions on since we launched coverage, and that's on organic constant currency cloud services growth. It looks like you came in above the high-end of your guidance for the quarter and you reiterated Safra that you expect greater than 30% growth for the year, which doesn't seem like a stretch like it did when you gave that first. We understand the way a subscription model works, but we obviously don't see everything that you see. Can you give us some more color around what's driving the results this quarter and what gave you the confidence in this outlook for cloud services. Was it previously contracted revenue that's just starting to ramp up with an expected increase in consumption or something else or all the above? Safra Catz : So let me tell you, it is all of the above. But let me tell you what's really happening down at each customer level. When customers try us for some reason whether they're using Fusion and they start using OCI for their own applications, or they hear really from word of mouth and from really a need to run some of their Oracle workloads or otherwise, when they give a try to Gen2 OCI or to Fusion, for that matter, what they find is that it is phenomenal. Our Gen2 cloud is so much better than what they're used to, and is so much more flexible, and can be much more local, gives them so many more opportunities to really match to their own needs. But they're overwhelmed by the technical capabilities of our cloud and how great it is. So what happens is, they may start small, and then they accelerate in their consumption. And they sign larger and larger and more significant contracts. As you see in our RPO, there's a lot already contracted and that's without us adding a single additional customer or expanding the use. But we have, as I said so much company-specific or product specific momentum that as customers discover us, use us, give us a chance they become honestly overwhelmed by our capabilities and how much less expensive, more flexible, more secure and how differently we\u2019re architected such that we're also more sustainable for them. And so it's just incredible company-specific, product specific momentum. And nothing really has to happen for us to continue to do very, very well here. And whether they're trying to save cost or expand growth, we help them do that in an incredibly flexible way and super, super cost competitively for them. Larry Ellison : Yes, let me just add one sentence to that. We are the only infrastructure company that builds enterprise scale applications. As a result of building these enterprise scale applications, we have made our infrastructure much, much better. So we not only provide infrastructure and sell infrastructure, we consume the infrastructure ourselves. I think that gives us certain insights as to what we need to build at the infrastructure layer to make our application secure, reliable and so on. And easy to use and make people productive. That's why -- I think that's why what customers are discovering when they come to our cloud, that they're more productive, the system runs faster, it's more secure, it's easier to use, all of that. And that's what gives us confidence that we can build the next generation of health care applications, because we do both. We do both applications, enterprise applications and infrastructure. And we're the only one. John DiFucci : So it sounds like that the expansion within your customer base of cloud services is becoming or has become more predictable. And that makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Ken Bond : Thank you, John. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Philip Winslow : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on another strong quarter of organic growth. Now obviously Oracle has been delivering accelerating growth in its infrastructure and database businesses for multiple quarters now. Safra, can you give us some more color on just what the drivers are behind this and how sustainable they are, be it BYOL, database add-ons, Autonomous Database, et cetera. And then a question for Larry. Obviously, the expanded partnership with Azure announced in July received pretty universal positive feedback. And you just announced today that Oracle's MySQL HeatWave will be available on AWS. How do you think about these multi-cloud partnerships impacting the already positive existing momentum in your database business going forward? Safra Catz : Larry, why don't you go first, and then I'll fill in if you've missed any. Yes. Larry Ellison : Okay, boss, I will do that. Again, multi-cloud -- I think one of the issues I know a lot of people for years have been concerned about can Oracle sustain its leading market share in the database business? And I think what is clear is if our databases are available in multiple clouds, I think then the answer is clearly yes. If our database is not available in multiple clouds, then it's an interesting question whether we can and maintain it just in our own cloud. We've decided to make our best and greatest technology available in multiple clouds. And that gives customers choice, they can use it in OCI. They can use MySQL HeatWave at AWS. They have choices, but they will be able to choose between, let's say, Amazon's Aurora or Oracle's MySQL HeatWave. They will be able to choose between Snowflake or the Oracle Autonomous Database. And I think as long as we're available in multiple clouds, we're going to be very strong, very, very -- and very, very competitive against these other companies and these other technologies. Safra Catz : And the answering for you on how is the Oracle database doing? Well, you saw we had an amazing Q4. And in Q1, again, the Oracle database is what people choose if they have real work to do. It's very secure. It's very performant and they know it has so many capabilities that you don't have to have 16 different databases to get a complicated job done. You can do everything with it in different ways. And the database options are continued to be acquired. Many more customers still want enterprise agreements, so they can BYOL, bring your own license to the Oracle Cloud. Our technology remains unbelievably strong with Java. And so the business overall, our tech business remains incredibly strong, even though it's enormous. And for many, many of the reasons I think there was a period a few years back, where folks were thinking they would try lots of other things and things that were maybe more \" fashionable\". I think they've realized that actually getting your job done securely, performantly, sustainably, and also really least expensive is to actually use our products to do that. And so they've been doubling down and committing and bringing those workloads to the Oracle Cloud again, propelling just incredible momentum, whether it's Cloud@Customer, dedicated regions or our public cloud. Ken Bond : Thanks, Phil. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much for taking the question and congratulations on the strong quarter. Larry, Safra, historically, in increasingly difficult economic conditions, organizations focused on what drove revenue growth or immediate savings and thus products like Salesforce automation, with similarities received funding while back office projects were delayed. What is different this time, both from a ERP point of view and an HCM point of view? What's going to drive the sustained growth and strength that you're expecting in Oracle strategic back office? Thank you. Safra Catz : Sure. So let me start by since I'm also the Principal Financial Officer, if I would say that in another company, I'd be the one making the decision to buy fusion ERP, and Fusion HCM. And what is absolutely clear, is that saving money in the back office is basically automatic when you use our products, when you move from, from especially from our competitors products, which are so expensive to maintain and run. When you move to fusion, you can save so much in your back office, that you can use that money to invest in things that help you extend the differentiation of your business. Now, today's the 12 of September. In fact, I signed off with our auditors on Friday, but we don't do our earnings on Friday. So we had to wait all the way till Monday. Now no other companies report on the 9th or the 8th. In fact, most companies were reporting their July quarter on last week. And here we are announcing an August quarter. Well, what does that have to do with costs? Well, I can tell you that when you are in a position to know your results, and to announce them, and to file your earnings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, you've not only saved time, you've saved millions in process dollars, and in the way you run your business. And I just want to point out that we were able to do this after acquiring in the quarter, Cerner by putting their data from their old system into Fusion and consolidating it in fusion. So we actually believe that one of the most important ways to drive business transformation is to move to a much more streamlined cloud product than running old back office systems. Larry Ellison : Let me just add one thing. I\u2019m sorry, let me add one thing, which is Safra addressed the issue of using modernizing back office to save money. Let me tell you another way, you can save money we -- I personally have been talking to some of Amazon's most famous brands that are running at AWS. And the AWS bill is getting very large, and they can save a huge amount of money by moving to OCI. And we expect next quarter, we'll be announcing some brands and companies moving off of Amazon to OCI that will shock you. Mark Moerdler : I'll stop there. Amazing. Ken Bond : Thank you, Mark. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Mark Moerdler : Great. Thanks. And I'll echo my congratulations. And Larry, thanks for all the color on the OCI wins. I was hoping to get an update on your go-to-market strategy for OCI when it's clearly becoming a more critical growth driver for you guys. Is there a dedicated Salesforce? Are you doing more bundling of OCI with other offerings? Just hoping to get an update on how you're going to market and what kind of resources you're putting around us? Larry Ellison : Yes, because with 58% growth, it certainly seems like you're now gaining share in the cloud infrastructure market. It's a big market to go after. So any color on that would be helpful. Safra Catz : Let me start, Larry. Absolutely. Larry Ellison : Okay, so. \u2026 Safra Catz : So, one of the enormous changes we made in the past year, year or so euro2 is that we've invested in a lot more engineering talent in the field to help our customers bring over workloads. And once we've shown them how to do it, and the enormous benefit they get by doing it. This is the Ultimate Sales accelerator, because there's nothing like the customer who realizes that our solution is just so much better and so much less expensive for them. And you have to do that often, by let's say, priming the pump by sending engineers, field engineers who can help the customers move those workloads and that's really propelled what's been going on in our OCI Cloud. Larry, you go ahead. Larry Ellison : Yes, I think exactly what Safra said, and I'll add what I just repeat what I said earlier. The amount of money, these huge companies, these very famous companies spend with Amazon is kind of staggering. I mean, everyone assumes, hey, I move to the cloud, and I'd save a lot of money. It depends which cloud you move to. And Oracle is much less expensive than the competition. One, partially because we're faster, which time is money when you're when you're paying by the hour. So again, I'm going to repeat, we're talking to the most famous brands that are running at Amazon, and some of them are going to be moving very soon. Mark Moerdler : Exciting. Thank you. Ken Bond : Thanks, Derrick. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Excellent. Thank you, and congrats on the solid execution. Larry, we've heard of some very exciting things happening with Cerner pretty quickly after the deal just closed with some hospital networks, we heard from significantly expanding their existing contracts. Can you talk about the unique value you're able to deliver now that Cerner is a part of Oracle and the broader expansion opportunity that you see ahead. And if I could just sneak in one for you as well, Safra $1.7 billion in CapEx and q1 is a pretty big number. And I know very well that you don't spend frivolously What can you tell us about the big step up here? Larry Ellison : Okay, I'll go first, let's have a bug with 1.7 CapEx is there's just so much demand. Safra mentioned we have more data centers in more countries and in more cities than either Amazon, or AWS. And we're expanding because the demand is there. We expect to be growing in the 50% range for cloud services. And that means we're going to be -- we are going to be half to -- half to be adding a lot of data center capacity and opening a lot of new data centers and we're doing that. The fact that we're running in Oracle Cloud data centers running half of Tokyo Stock Exchange, as the other cloud vendors, how many stock exchanges they run. The -- our stuff is very secure, it's very reliable, it's very performance, it's very, very cost effective. And therefore we have huge opportunity, therefore, we're spending the money to expand. We have a huge opportunity for growth, and we're not going to miss it. But we're still going to be as you know, Safra is very cautious. We're very, we're always very cautious. We pay a lot of attention to profitability. But we also have to pay attention to the top line, as well as the bottom line and take advantage of this growth opportunity. And I think there was a second part of the question that [indiscernible]. Brad Zelnick : Cerner, he asked you all about Cerner. Cerner. a big other part. Yes, one of the things I think that we don't really talk about, but I alluded to the fact that we both build applications, and we run them with on our infrastructure. The tools we use for building applications, our latest generation of tools, are the autonomous database very different than from all the Oracle databases or any other database that came before. There are no DBAs. There is no human labor associated with running the Oracle Database anymore. So there can be no human error. The costs are so much cheaper. Our own internal cloud, our own cloud OCI, uses autonomous database to run all the control systems, because claim [indiscernible] doesn't want to hire a lot of DBAs to lower costs. Also, he doesn't want any errors of commission. It's much more reliable than when you have human beings driving the car. We use that for the next generation of Cerner, the Oracle Autonomous database. We pair that with an all new application development tool called Apex [ph], which is a low code tool. So our newest applications, our very newest applications that we were built, we are building, we're building any autonomous database with Apex, which allows us to do stuff that would have taken three or four years in less than a year. So we expect to have our first pretty complete new Cerner health management product out within 12 months, which I think is going to, again, it's something we never could have done with the previous generation of databases or the previous generation of application development tools. But all of that has changed. We have these phenomenal low code tools. I mean, one of the things about the low code tool is you almost -- you don't have to do security audits because security is built into the tool. You can't build an insecure applications using Apex [Indiscernible] tolerance is built into the tool, if the application should fail, it's a stateless application. So it immediately failover into another data center in a millisecond and keep running, no one will even know about the failure. So our new generation of application development tools is going to enable us to modernize the server -- the Cerner technology at a rate that would be inconceivable a couple of years ago. Brad Zelnick : Amazing. Thank you. Ken Bond : Thank you, Brad. That does appear to be our last question. So a telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Josh for closing. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect.",

And please be advised that this call is being recorded. After the speakers\u2019 prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Bond, Head of Investor Relations at Oracle. Please go ahead. Ken Bond : Thank you, Bo. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from our Investor Relations website as well. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Well, simply put, we had an outstanding quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was more than $200 million above the high end of our guidance range and grew 25% in constant currency. Even excluding Cerner, total revenue grew 9% in constant currency that\u2019s higher than Q1 and on top of a revenue beat this time last year. The strength of the quarter is even more amazing, given that the currency headwind was higher than what it was when I gave guidance with 6% for revenue and a $0.095 headwind for earnings per share. And yet, we still exceeded the high end of my USD guidance for both, total revenue and earnings per share. And as you can see from the numbers, we continue to experience clear company-specific and product-specific momentum. The reasons are many, but it boils down to a few key points of differentiation. First, more and more customers are recognizing our second-generation infrastructure cloud as being fundamentally better architected for higher performance, better security and unmatched reliability versus the older first-generation hyperscale cloud providers. Second, customers appreciate the flexibility of our service and business model that enables them to deploy our technologies where it serves them best, whether that be in the public cloud, in dedicated regions around the world or in a true clouded customer implementation. And third, customers recognize the value of an end-to-end integrated stack of applications, both horizontal, like ERP and HCM and supply chain, and industry-specific applications that focus on their industries. And all of it is on our Gen 2 infrastructure, which is designed perfectly for them as they move through. As customers increasingly look to better value out of their technology investments, many discover that Oracle is much better compared to other alternatives. Gartner formerly recognized OCI by moving us to Visionary status in its cloud infrastructure and platform services report for the first time. In addition, last week, we were awarded a JWCC award at the U.S. Department of Defense as they also recognized our capabilities. As all of these differentiators come together and our business continues to accelerate, we expect organic growth for our fiscal year 2023 cloud revenues will be over 30% in constant currency. Now to the numbers. As always, I\u2019ll discuss our results using constant currency growth rate. To provide a full picture, both organically and otherwise, I\u2019m going to go over the revenue results, including Cerner, and then some of the revenue results excluding Cerner, so you can see what\u2019s going on. Total cloud revenue, now that\u2019s SaaS and IaaS, including Cerner, was $3.8 billion, up 48% in constant currency with IaaS revenue, $1.1 billion, up 59% and SaaS revenue of $2.8 billion, up 45%. Now, excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue, SaaS plus IaaS was up 27% in constant currency at $3.3 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter, including Cerner, was $8.6 billion, up 20% in constant currency, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database and, of course, our Generation 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include support, were $4.1 billion, up 35% in constant currency. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which also include support, were $4.5 billion, up 9% in constant currency. Application subscription revenues, including support but excluding Cerner, were $3.3 billion, up 9% in constant currency. SaaS cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, was $2.2 billion and was up 16%. Now, our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $5.9 billion and grew 26% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up 28% and NetSuite ERP, up 29%. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 59% in constant currency. Now excluding legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 69% with an annualized revenue of $3.8 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 88% and cloud and customer consumption revenue, up 83% and autonomous database up 50%. Software license revenues, including Cerner, were $1.4 billion, up 23% in constant currency and up 9% without Cerner. What is increasingly resonating with customers is that in an environment where IT investments need to have a fast and tangible return on investment, only Oracle offers customers the flexibility to manage their technology estate, so they can deploy incremental investments where it brings them the most immediate value. It also helps that the purchase of technology licenses from Oracle enables them to move to the cloud as they are ready, effectively providing an on-ramp to Oracle Cloud services. So, all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.3 billion, up 25% in constant currency. Excluding Cerner\u2019s revenue contribution of $1.5 billion, organic revenue was up over 9% in constant currency. As a reminder, we no longer operate in Russia, causing total revenue growth to be negatively affected by over 1% of growth over last year. Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 79% as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenue with its mid-90s gross margins represented about 65% of the total number of cloud services and license support revenue. Now, it\u2019s down to 53%, and this is happening because our cloud services are growing much, much faster than license support. By the way, license support grew 4% this year. Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved again this quarter, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve in response to accelerating demand we have continued to build data center capacity. We have seen that as those centers fill up, margins go up like they did this quarter. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 13% with Cerner and 6%, excluding Cerner in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, up 12% from last year. Operating margin, including Cerner, was 41% as we continue to integrate Cerner in the quarter. As we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle levels and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentage. Further, I expect that this year, will be the trough year for operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.4. I think I guided to 20.5. So basically, it worked out where we thought. And non-GAAP EPS was $1.21 in U.S. dollars, down 1% in USD, up 7% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $0.63. At quarter end, we had nearly $7.4 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.7 billion, up 14% in constant currency. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $15.1 billion and free cash flow was $8.4 billion with capital expenditures of $6.7 billion. In addition, we now have 40 public cloud regions around the world with another 9 being built. In addition, 12 of these public regions interconnect with Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities. We also have many cloud customer implementations, dedicated regions in another 9 national security regions with increasing demand for more as customers want to have their data protected in their country. We are careful to pace our investments appropriately, but need to continue to build to meet our accelerating demand. CapEx this quarter was $2.4 billion as we continued to invest in our cloud to meet this accelerating demand. With triple-digit IaaS bookings growth the last couple of quarters we now expect to spend about this amount per quarter for the next few quarters as we build capacity for our customers\u2019 needs. This level of spend though will not negatively impact our operating margins as we scale. When I talk about accelerating demand, that demand is reflected in the remaining performance obligation or RPO balance, which is now at $61.2 billion, up 68% in constant currency due to strong cloud bookings as well as to Cerner. I will also note that the organic RPO growth rate in constant currency accelerated to 28% in Q2, up from 22% last quarter and approximately 48% of the total RPO is to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Now, as we\u2019ve said before, I know you\u2019re tired of me saying it, but I will, we are continuing -- we\u2019re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares for a total of $448 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $863 million in the quarter, and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. Our fundamental principle is to grow non-GAAP EPS while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. And given our increasing confidence, we will continue to prudently invest as there is strong demand for our cloud services. So now, let me turn to my guidance for Q3, which I\u2019ll provide on a non-GAAP basis. Using currency exchange rates as they are right now, currency should have a 4% negative effect on total revenue and at least a $0.06 negative effect on EPS in Q3. As I say every quarter, the actual currency impact may be different by quarter end, but we\u2019ve got to use a number, so we\u2019re using the number right now. Total revenues for Q3, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 21% to 23% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 17% to 19% in USD. Total cloud growth, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 46% to 50% in constant currency and 43% to 47% in USD. I expect the total cloud growth for the fiscal year, excluding Cerner will be above 30% in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 9% and 13% and be between $1.23 and $1.27 in constant currency. Again, due to currency headwinds, non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 4% and 8% and be between $1.17 and $1.21 in USD. And as I\u2019ve said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including in Q3. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes our base tax rate of 20.5%, which is up from 19% last year. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. Okay. I\u2019m going to go over -- primarily, I\u2019m going to go over customers and new wins in infrastructure and then customers and wins and go-lives in applications. But I\u2019m going to start with infrastructure. So, during Q2, we signed multiple customers to contracts exceeding $1 billion, infrastructure contracts exceeding $1 billion. Let me be clear, multiple customers signed contracts for $1 billion worth of infrastructure. So, given -- that\u2019s been added to our backlog, we expect our infrastructure business to continue to grow very, very strongly into the future. We now have 22,000 infrastructure customers. We have a total of 55 regions. That\u2019s public regions plus national security regions and the other kinds of regions and that\u2019s more than AWS or Microsoft or anybody, which may surprise some people. Gartner, as Safra mentioned, moved us into the Visionary Quadrant for the first time. So, let me just start naming specific customers and give you a flavor. I\u2019m going to name large customers, small customers. I\u2019m going to focus a little bit on a bunch of international customers to let you know that our investment in data centers all over the world is really paying off. So, our customers include -- big customers include, FedEx, Deutsche Bank, Tokyo Stock Exchange. Let me take a moment to emphasize Tokyo Stock Exchange. We\u2019re the only ones running a major stock exchange. And this is -- Tokyo is not the only one because our cloud is very secure and extremely reliable. It doesn\u2019t go down. In fact, my favorite quote from a big phone company in the United States was the difference between Oracle\u2019s Cloud and the other clouds are simply that Oracle Cloud doesn\u2019t go down. I think that\u2019s a very important issue when you have enterprise applications like a stock exchange where you can\u2019t ever go down. Fujitsu is another big customer; Vodafone that\u2019s phone company has similar problems. If you\u2019re a phone company, the phone system can\u2019t go down. Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Enbridge; Kaiser, a huge health care company in the -- primarily in the United States. NVIDIA has moved and a bunch of others have moved, lots of AI, artificial intelligence and machine learning workloads to the Oracle Cloud because it turns out we\u2019re really good at that. We\u2019re better than that than any of the other clouds, which may surprise some people. Schneider Electric, Telecom Italia, Verizon and lots, lots more. I\u2019m not just going to list them all. We publish a big list at oracle.com and every quarter, we add new customers to that. So, in the quarter, we added United Airlines -- database wins in the quarter, United Airlines, migrating all flight operations to the Oracle Exadata cloud. Albertsons, again, moving to the Exadata cloud service database. Mitsui in Japan, again, moving their databases to Oracle. Again, this is the beginning of a very major, very large business for us as our database franchise moves primarily from on-premise into the Oracle Cloud. Persol Career, a big professional services company in Japan, migrating to -- or moving their Oracle databases to the cloud. Unimed, LAD Healthcare, once again moving their databases to the Oracle Cloud. Penske Truck Leasing, doing using -- moving to autonomous database. HomeServe plc in the UK, government agency is moving the autonomous transaction processing system. So, they\u2019re not just moving an existing Oracle database to the cloud, they\u2019re upgrading from our on-premise Oracle database to our autonomous database, which is only available in the cloud. Iberia Express, a big telco, same thing moving to autonomous data warehouse. They just -- the idea is the autonomous data warehouse makes database administration very simple. In fact, it\u2019s entirely automated. There is no database administration. Delgado [ph] Auto Taxi, again, in APAC, a smaller company, again, moving their databases to autonomous system. MaxiTRANS, big transportation company in Australia, same thing, autonomous transaction processing. The Scroll, [ph] a big Japanese wholesale company, autonomous -- moving to autonomous database. Banco Safra, this is -- by the way, this is not -- our CEO does not own a bank. This is not an internal -- she didn\u2019t not buy our database. But there\u2019s a big bank in Latin America called Banco Safra and they\u2019re moving all their mission-critical apps to OCI, as is Bradesco, same thing. Yorkshire Building Society in the UK, again, autonomous data warehouse. And Nestl\u00e9, a food giant in EMEA is moving their analytics systems to autonomous data warehouse and that\u2019s a huge customer. Okay. I mentioned a couple of calls ago that we have a new version of our MySQL open source database, and we added a new ultrafast query processor called HeatWave to MySQL and that\u2019s doing extremely well. We have a number of companies doing that migration. Medallia, Infonow [ph] Credit Club. It\u2019s a long list of people that are moving to MySQL to take advantage of the fact that our query processor in our version of MySQL is 100 times faster. I really mean that. And we have all the benchmarks. We publish all the benchmarks, and we publish the source code of the benchmarks, so you can duplicate those results, 100 times faster than queries than the Amazon equivalent called Aurora; Aurora, Amazon\u2019s version of MySQL. As Safra mentioned earlier, our partnership with Microsoft Azure is going extremely well. We have a number of companies running applications in Azure. And then Azure is connected to OCI, so the database is in OCI and the application is in Azure. The Belgium Railways is one. Honeywell in the United States, Petronas [ph] the big energy and utility company, Telecom Italia Mobile A [ph], but that multi-cloud system is doing extremely well. And we think that is the future of cloud. We think the future of cloud is not 4-walled gardens, AWS, Microsoft, Google and Oracle. We think those clouds are all going to interconnect. And then customers will pick the most appropriate service for their particular needs and mix and match between the clouds. Okay. A lot more -- a major city in the southwest, which I\u2019m not allowed to mention is literally migrating everything to OCI. Lambda, which is a big AI machine learning specialist company is moving the bulk of their workloads to OCI using NVIDIA GPUs and our fast -- our very, very fast network to interconnect them. And this is a pattern. Lambda is doing that, Latent Space is doing that. NVIDIA themselves are doing that. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of machine learning and artificial intelligence workloads moving from other clouds to OCI because we\u2019re faster. And again, in the cloud business faster -- when you charge by the minute, faster means cheaper. Give me 1 second. Alexa, be quite. Sorry about that. I think Jeff Bezos did that. Okay. So, Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, National Institute of Health. These are all new cloud customers, new infrastructure cloud customers -- again from very large to medium-sized companies are moving to OCI and lots of them. Twist Biosciences is moving healthcare -- again, AI workloads to OCI using NVIDIA GPUs. AIA Life Insurance Company, a big financial services company, again, is moving to OCI and databases to OCI. In India, Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation, a giant utility, is moving all of their metering and billing applications to OCI. Win Win [ph] Intelligent Information Technology is moving their IoT platform from AWS to OCI, and they\u2019re also using MySQL HeatWave. Algar Telecom, Brazilian Stock Exchange, Claro, again, big media telco, moving to OCI; Ncell. Unimed Curitiba, a large health care company in Latin America moving to OCI; Vivo, again, moving to OCI. Banco de Chile, E-Banks [ph] another financial services company; Rabobank. DP World, the transportation and logistics company in the Middle East, Austin TranSit Partnership, a municipality in Texas they\u2019re perfect -- an interesting customer because they\u2019ve been using Oracle ERP and EPM and our applications for a long time. Now they\u2019re moving their infrastructure to OCI. Oman Telecommunications. A huge French telecommunication company, I\u2019m not allowed to mention. They\u2019re moving to OCI. Oxford Nanopore, a big -- a gene sequencing company is moving from AWS to OCI where they are going to store gene sequencing, but not only just store gene sequences in OCI, they also do analytics to figure out if -- what they\u2019ve sequenced is a new version of COVID-19 or another pathogen, if the pathogen they\u2019ve never seen before, extremely important application for world health. Reed Exhibitions, Saudi Ministry of Media, Ecobank, financial services in EMEA, GlobeMed Limited, Morrisons, a big retail operation, again, all moving to on OCI. HDFC Bank and Waafi Bank, I\u2019m going to stop there, but we published a long list, but there\u2019s tremendous momentum, tremendous momentum and a large number of customers from all over the world, very large and medium-sized companies moving to OCI, and the business is growing very strongly, as Safra pointed out in the numbers. Okay. In the back -- in applications, I\u2019ll try to do this quickly. We\u2019re just winning in the back office. We have 22,000 customers in infrastructure and the cloud. We have 11,000 Fusion ERP and HCM customers alone in applications, just Fusion customers. We have 11,000 now. We have probably close to 30,000, 30,000 NetSuite customers on top of that. So, we have a lot of customers and applications. We\u2019ve been in the Applications Cloud business for longer than we\u2019ve been in the infrastructure cloud business. We\u2019re extremely strong in healthcare, Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai, Providence Saint Joseph, Adventist Health, Kaiser Permanente, National Health Service in the UK, long list of providers, that\u2019s a partial list, are using Oracle ERP, supply chain and HCM applications. But it\u2019s not just the clinical providers that are using our systems, the payers, the healthcare payers. So again, as we tackle healthcare with -- in conjunction with our Cerner acquisition, we\u2019re not just automating providers, we\u2019re also automating payers. We\u2019re also automating pharmaceutical companies as they do clinical trials. We\u2019re trying, to automate the entire ecosystem, not just a fraction of it. So I mentioned a list of providers and payers, UnitedHealthcare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Humana, Highmark Health, Health Care Service Corporations, Independence Blue Cross, Bright Health, so payers as well as providers. We\u2019re extremely strong in that. I mean, we -- again, I\u2019ll just leave it with extremely strong. Healthcare wins in the quarter in Q2, Cigna, a huge payer win; Emirates Health Services, big provider where we beat SAP; Cross Country Health Services where we beat Workday and SAP. Henry Schein is a provider of healthcare products for -- and there -- we won there. But again, it is the entire healthcare infrastructure that we are focusing on as we try to automate healthcare systems around the world. Go-lives, go-lives in the quarter, Tenet Health, 65 hospitals, 235,000 employees, they went live on HR payroll and recruiting. Cleveland Clinic, is going live. I know it\u2019s called Cleveland Clinic, but they also -- they own hospitals all over the place. They\u2019ve gone live in a bunch of regional hospitals in Florida. University of Chicago Medical Center has gone live. Baptist Health Care has gone live, 12 hospitals with 26,000 employees. Lakeview Center has gone live in the quarter. So, we\u2019re just getting stronger and stronger in health care. And so, let me move on to financial services, our other -- another industry that we deem very, very strategic and key to Oracle\u2019s future is financial services, specifically banking. And we\u2019re very, very strong there, Bank of -- in terms of ERP, HCM, supply chain, our customers include Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of New York Mellon, Vanguard, Santander, TD Bank in Canada, HSBC in the UK, UBS, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Credit Suisse, Sumitomo Mitsui. It\u2019s a partial list. We are extremely strong in the banking sector. And what you\u2019re going to see in Oracle ERP with our strength in the banking sector is we will be offering loan origination for B2B commerce. One of the things we\u2019re doing with the new version of Oracle ERP is if you\u2019re a customer that\u2019s buying something and you have Oracle ERP, and we -- and you are a company that\u2019s selling something and you have Oracle ERP, the way that B2B transaction will occur, it will be entirely automated within the cloud. So you\u2019ll submit a purchase order, the buying ERP system will submit a purchase order to the selling ERP system. And if you need to borrow money, we will originate a loan with one of our banking partners. If the product has to be shipped, we will schedule the shipping and track the shipment with one of our logistic partners. And our ambition here is to completely automate B2B commerce between buying and selling companies that are running Oracle Cloud ERP and manage all of the financing and insurance and logistics associated with that transaction. We do a really good job, I think, of automating B2C transactions. Amazon does that extremely well. Walmart does that extremely well. But we don\u2019t do a great job of automating B2B transactions. And that\u2019s what Oracle\u2019s ambition is to do that. And we\u2019re in a great position because we are so strong in cloud ERP. So, it\u2019s an Oracle system that\u2019s -- an Oracle procurement system on one end of that transaction. It\u2019s an Oracle order management system on the other end of that transaction. We have very strong partners in finance, insurance and logistics so we can completely automate the entire transaction, where B2B transactions begin to look like B2C transactions. They\u2019re fully end-to-end automated. And that\u2019s a huge new business for us and our partners. Okay. Let\u2019s see. Financial Services wins in the quarter. We\u2019ve added M&T Bank, TD Bank, Daiwa Securities -- Farmers Insurance. Nexi, which is where we replaced SAP at Nexi, it\u2019s an Italian bank. We replaced SAP at TD Bank. Let\u2019s see what else. Financial services go lives. AmTrust, BlackRock, a big go live. They are -- they have $10 trillion of managed assets. Oracle now has 9 of the top 10 asset management firms, running on the Oracle Cloud ERP. FirstRand Bank, a bunch of other banks. I don\u2019t want to take up all the time. So, I\u2019m going to stop there. We have a lot more data on our website that will tell you -- that will enumerate still more customers that we acquired in this very strong second quarter and that went live in the second quarter. With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Safra. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Bo, if you could prepare the audience for Q&A. Appreciate it. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question today from Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. And congrats on the solid results. Larry, Oracle has a rich history of being a price performance leader in just about everything it does. But technically speaking, why exactly does OCI have an inherent cost advantage? And how sustainable is that advantage? Thanks. Larry Ellison : Well, maybe the most interesting thing is we have a much faster network than anybody else. We have a fundamentally different network than any of the other cloud providers. We have what\u2019s called an RDMA network that we had to build because our Exadata machines and our database -- actually glued together a lot of computers. And when you had a single database application, that could run on one computer or it could run on a cluster of computers, the 2 computers, 4 computers, 8 computers, whatever, so that there was no single point of failure. One of the beauties of the Oracle database, one of the big differences between the Oracle database and other databases is that the Oracle database, a single application could run on multiple computers. If one of those computers would fail, the application would keep running. It was fall tolerant. It would tolerate a failure of a machine. Other people don\u2019t have that. But in order to do that, we had to make our network, if we\u2019re going to have a cluster of 4 machines running a single database app, we have to make that network between those 4 machines very fast. And that\u2019s called an RDMA network. It means that one computer can immediately access the memory of another computer without going through an interrupt. It\u2019s a very fast way to interconnect computers and have them act as a group. We built that for our entire cloud, so we can run our database, our Oracle real application cluster database on any of the computers in our cloud. Now because we\u2019ve built this hyper-fast network, it turns out it has more utility than just running the Oracle database. So, if you\u2019re running a cluster of computers doing a simulation, a car crash simulation, that was one of the first applications people noticed, ran much faster on Oracle. Now, a much bigger application they noticed ran much faster on Oracle was on neural networks and machine learning workloads run much faster on Oracle. So, because our network is just intrinsically much faster and -- by the way, also there are security and reliability advantages to go along with that. So, our network configured. We actually have -- all of our computers actually have two networks. I\u2019m not going to go into all the details. But our computers are fundamentally different than any other cloud company. We have two networks, one of which is on the Internet -- I\u2019d say, one of which interconnects all of our customers\u2019 computers. And the other, which is our -- if you will, our control network where our -- and computers that run our cloud control software, which is isolated from the customer software. So, the customer can\u2019t tamper with our cloud control software. They can\u2019t get control of it. And we can\u2019t see the customers\u2019 data. That is unique to Oracle. But the -- because we have the two networks and because one of the networks is RDMA, we just run much, much faster, much more reliably than they do. And it\u2019s a fundamental advantage that they can\u2019t compete with unless they rebuild their cloud from scratch. Operator : We\u2019ll take that question now from Phil Winslow of Credit Suisse. Phil Winslow : Congrats on another strong quarter. And really two metrics jumped out to me this quarter. First was IaaS revenue accelerated at 59% from 58% and 39% in the prior two quarters. And organic ERP growth also accelerated to 28%, which is pretty phenomenal this quarter from 22% and 17% in the prior two quarters. Can you just give us sort of a breakdown of what\u2019s driving this continued strength compared to some of your cloud competitors in the past in IaaS world that have experienced decelerating growth in recent months? Are there any workloads in particular that are driving the relative strength of OCI? Safra Catz : I don\u2019t know, Larry, if you want to take it or I take it Larry Ellison : You can take it. I mean the workloads, I\u2019ll just say on the workloads. AI and machine learning is a huge -- is exploding NVIDIA. NVIDIA, the people who provide the GPUs for most AI workloads are -- they\u2019re moving a huge amount of stuff to the Oracle Cloud and a bunch of other companies that are doing that. But that\u2019s one new one. I mean, obviously, database, but I\u2019ll let that question really go onto Safra. Safra Catz : Well, it\u2019s really across the board, to be fair. We\u2019ve got high-performance computing. We\u2019ve got most of the auto companies doing their simulations on us. And then, we have Oracle workloads, autonomous database and other workloads. We have extremely broad, just extremely broad moves. I think I told you in previous quarters that, of course, our growth rates are higher because we\u2019re smaller, but yet as we grow, we\u2019re actually accelerating because of exactly the features that Larry covered in the last question, customers are coming to us, often not expecting the phenomenal results. And remember, time is money on the cloud. So, if you\u2019re more performant, it is much less expensive, whether it\u2019s Oracle workloads or straight compute or storage or other workloads. The other thing is you have to understand that our cloud of customers, our national security regions, all of those are being contracted, and we are clearly the choice for governments to maintain their sovereignty over their data. We can land a center very quickly, and they have -- and they fill up very quickly. So, we really have it coming from all areas. And then, of course, our applications business, Larry basically said it. I mean, we\u2019re in it. And we\u2019re winning consistently deal after deal, both as our e-business suite and PeopleSoft and JD Edwards customers moved to us but also SAP installations choosing us over what they had before. So, it\u2019s just on all fronts, frankly. Phil Winslow : Great. Well, it\u2019s awesome to see everything that you\u2019ve been talking about the past couple of years playing out. So keep up a great work. Operator : We go next now to John DeFucci of Guggenheim. John DiFucci : Larry, to the answer to the first question, that\u2019s actually something we\u2019ve been thinking about. That\u2019s going to help as we dig in to better understand the benefits of OCI. But it\u2019s amazing to hear the core differentiation of RAC continues to drive differentiation even 20 years later. My question is actually for Safra. Safra, you mentioned your flexible business model in your prepared remarks and which is unique. BYOL, you were a pioneer in doing that. And license was surprisingly strong again. Can you talk in a little more detail about what\u2019s really driving that license strength? Safra Catz : So contrary to, I think, the fears the people always have, the Oracle database is still the biggest part of license by far. So most important part, the database remains strong because customers understand that they can BYOL, bring your own license, and they can have coverage whether they\u2019re on-premise in the cloud or moving in between the two, so again, really always the big number. But we\u2019ve got growth rates that are very strong in analytics. We have growth rates that are super strong in Java, we have growth rates that are strong in the industry\u2019s areas, some of our industry\u2019s applications. And then -- so I want to make sure I gave you the numbers both ways. With Cerner, we have a growth rate of 23% because, of course, you add the Cerner license. Without Cerner, it\u2019s 9% growth. So, even without Cerner, we have license growth after a very strong growth rate a full year ago in license. So, again, big dog is, of course, technology. That\u2019s the bulk of it. But we\u2019ve got a few industry apps and a little bit of Cerner. And it just remains just super strong. John DiFucci : Okay. That makes sense. It sounds like a lot of things are working together here. Thank you. Thank you very much. Safra Catz : Absolutely. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next now to Mark Moerdler at Sanford Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much for taking question. I really appreciate the ability to ask the question, and congratulations on the quarter. Two related questions on Cerner. Safra, where are we on the Cerna integration process as well as taking out the cost? And where do you think you can drive those long-term costs over time. And Larry, we heard a lot of great features at Oracle World about Cerner and what you going to do in healthcare. It\u2019d be interesting to hear what progress you\u2019ve made recently. Thanks. Safra Catz : Sure. So Mark, we\u2019ve owned Cerner for about five months. And I will tell you that they continue to do better than we had projected internally. So, we\u2019re very, very happy. But we are still at the beginning. We don\u2019t want to do anything that will damage the business. And of course, we\u2019re very, very focused on those customers. But we are already having some level of savings. But ultimately, just so that you understand, our expectation is we will run them at typical Oracle margins. So, we\u2019ve got quite a way to go. And I think over the next couple of quarters, you\u2019ll see continued improvement as we\u2019ve done some of our operational integration. And simultaneously, I think they continue to over perform for us. So, we are doing this in a very careful way. So, it\u2019s not to put any issues for our customers and making sure they\u2019re successful. On the technical side, Larry, that\u2019s for you. Larry Ellison : Yes. Well, actually, on the technical side, of course, what we\u2019re trying to do is build -- not just provider systems. In other words, what Cerner did primarily in competition with EPIC is the automated hospitals. And yes, we want to automate hospitals and clinics and doctors\u2019 offices and do that. We certainly want to automate providers. But we\u2019re layering on top of that is we want to do national public health. We are doing national public health systems. I mentioned Oxford Nanopore that\u2019s an early warning system to detect the next pathogen that could lead to a pandemic. These global public health systems need to be built. And we are in discussions. We are in discussions with not companies, but countries about building and deploying a global early warning system so we can detect the next pathogen that threatens to turn into a pandemic, we can catch it early enough that we can prevent it from being a pandemic. God forbid, if there is another pandemic that we have up to the minute, up to the second data about how that country\u2019s infrastructure is managing the hospitalization rates and vaccination rates and all of those things, so we can better deploy and manage our resources during a pandemic. So, we don\u2019t have a repeat of the things that went on during COVID-19. So, I expect -- Safra just gone back from visiting some prospective customers that are countries that we will be signing contracts with a number of countries to build these national systems. And these contracts are enormous, I mean, absolutely enormous. And there will be several of them. So, as I said in my note in the press release, the scale of this healthcare opportunity is unprecedented but so are the responsibilities that go along with it. We have to -- we, as humanity has to do a better job of delivering healthcare to people than we have done historically. And we can never have a repeat of the COVID-19 pandemic. And I think there is this worldwide sense of urgency and national consciousness about getting a new generation of systems out there that help us at first prevent and then manage our healthcare -- prevent a pandemic and better manager healthcare systems. As far as I know, Oracle is the only company in the world that\u2019s trying to address this issue. And we\u2019re about to sign up a number of countries that will work with us on doing just that. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our final question this afternoon from Raimo Lenschow at Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. One quick question. If you think about the global environment, usually, it\u2019s not the time to look at or in the olden days, I remember when I was at PwC, it wasn\u2019t the time to kind of look at your back office systems, but you\u2019re kind of growing really nicely. NetSuite is actually kind of outgoing now Fusion a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers and what you\u2019re seeing out there? Thank you. Safra Catz : Yes. Let me start that, and Larry can add if you want. So I want to remind you that we are global, right, which includes whether we\u2019re in Europe and in the United States, but we\u2019re also in the Gulf states and really in Asia, different parts, Latin America. And there are always companies that get to the point where their business, they cannot afford to keep using their older systems. They spend too much using them. They spend too much running them. And they are actually holding them back, and they know that. And I think one of the things many companies learned during COVID was those companies that did not get on some sort of a track to get a digital connection with their customers, employees and suppliers that were at a huge disadvantage. And so that momentum continues. And it is possible that any individual country or location there could be some little slowdown here or there. And yet there are other countries and industries that are doing incredibly well and they view this as critical. When customers move to SaaS they end up spending less but also have much better capabilities to sell more to work with their employees and their suppliers, and of course, as I said, their customers. So that momentum has started, has started, and it just continues very, very strongly. And again, we are global. So, even when there are some issues in some regions, we\u2019re in other regions that are doing phenomenally well right now. Ken Bond : Thank you, Safra. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Bo to close the call. Operator : Thank you very much, Mr. Bond. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude Oracle\u2019s Q2 2023 earnings conference call. Again, we\u2019d like to thank you so much for joining us and wish you all a great remainder of your day. Goodbye.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Oracle Corporation's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]  Ken Bond, Senior VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Ken Bond : Thank you, Emma. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEO, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Q3 represented another great quarter with continued momentum on the top and bottom line. But before I get to the numbers, I want to share with you a few thoughts that explain what's behind our continued financial success. First, our cloud offerings drive operational efficiency. In fact, one of our competitors recently coined the term, the Oracle playbook, which I absolutely love, because the Oracle playbook is all about doing more while spending less. As you all know, we started this ourselves over 20 years ago and have kept it up over all these years, resulting in the highest margins in the software business for decades. Using our own products and services enables us to increase our investments for growth, while also growing profitability, including through acquisitions as well as during our move to the cloud. We are constantly talking with our customers about leveraging Oracle technology to accelerate their speed to market and reduce cost, all the while improving the experience they deliver to their customers. The combination of Oracle's infrastructure and apps, which is unique in the cloud market, increases the intensity of business transformation. Cloud is no longer about just renting commodity white boxes. It's about velocity and value. We have become the enterprise technology vendor of choice because we have products and services that help our customers drive cost efficiencies and modernize their businesses. Second, while AI has been dominating the recent news cycle, the truth is that our Fusion and Infrastructure customers have been using AI as an integral part of their business for some time. Oracle Fusion, with embedded AI, enables customers to close their books in days, not weeks. Oracle AI provides more relevant sales leads. Oracle AI increases infrastructure performance and security with no human intervention. And customers using OCI get AI as a service to help drive their own business transformation. Given our scale and our information advantage across industries and technologies, we are constantly training our applications to do more for our customers, whether it's further what our customers get when they use our platform. And on our Gen 2 OCI platform, the architecture and unique network capability has fast become the platform of choice for many AI companies because OCI runs workloads faster. And time is money in the cloud. So coming to us saves our customers money. Third, customers are putting Oracle's comprehensive and powerful ways to accelerate their businesses. The Uber win was notable because we have yet another example of an industry-transforming company concluding that Oracle's cloud, performance and security exceeds that of our competitors and at a price point that represents a sustainable long-term partnership. Uber will use more of our technology to drive value in their own business. And you're going to see a rising list of these types of strategic wins pile up in the quarters to come. Finally, before I move to the numbers, and hopefully, no one missed this fact, that we're announcing our earnings nine days after the close of the quarter, and we expect to file the Q right away. We continue to set the standard in operating efficiency which helps customers see what's possible when they are working with us.  Okay. Now to the Q3 results. As always, I'll discuss them using constant currency growth rate to provide a full picture both organically and otherwise, I'm going to go over the revenue results, including Cerner, and then some revenue results excluding Cerner. Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS plus IaaS, including Cerner, was $4.1 billion, up 48% in constant currency, with IaaS revenue of $1.2 billion, up 57% and SaaS revenue of $2.9 billion, up 44%. Now excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 28% in constant currency at $3.5 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter, including Cerner, was $8.9 billion, up 20% in constant currency, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes support, were $4.2 billion and up 33% in constant currency. Infrastructure subscription revenues, also including support, were $4.8 billion, up 10% in constant currency. Application subscription revenues, including support but excluding Cerner, were $3.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency. SaaS cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, was $2.3 billion and was up 16%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $6.2 billion and grew 25% in constant currency, including Fusion ERP, up against 28% and NetSuite ERP, up 26% this quarter. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 57% in constant currency. And when you exclude our legacy hosting services, infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 65%, with an annualized revenue of $4.4 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 86%, cloud customer consumption revenue, up 73%, and autonomous database, up 50%. Database subscription revenues, which include database support, were up 3% in constant currency, highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 40%. Database's subscription revenue is largely made up of on-premise database support. But as these databases migrate from on-premise to the cloud and cloud customer, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside back-office SaaS and Gen 2 OCI cloud services. Software license revenue, including Cerner, were $1.3 billion, up 4% in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.4 billion, up 21% in constant currency. Excluding Cerner's contribution of $1.5 billion, organic revenue was up 7% in constant currency. As a reminder, we no longer operate in Russia, causing organic revenue growth to be negatively affected by 1% of growth over last year. Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 79% as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenue with its mid-90s gross margins represented about 63% of cloud services and license support revenue. Now because our cloud services are growing so fast, it's down to 55%. Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved substantially from last year, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve. While we have continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 13% with Cerner and 6% excluding Cerner. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.2 billion, up 11% from last year. The operating margin, including Cerner, was 42% as we continue to integrate Cerner in the quarter As we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentages. For example, while we have only owned Cerner for three quarters, we have already improved its operating margin by over 5 percentage points compared to before the acquisition. And by the way, I actually expect this year, FY 2023, the one we are closing out in one more quarter, will be the trough year for operating margins and percentages as our margin improvement initiatives play out. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.4% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.22 in U.S. dollars, up 8% in USD, up 13% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.68 in U.S. dollars. At quarter end, we had nearly $8.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.6 billion, up 14% in constant currency. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $15.5 billion, and free cash flow was $7.3 billion with capital expenditures of $8.2 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was up 11% at $4.3 billion. The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $62.3 billion, up 66% in constant currency due to strong cloud bookings as well as Cerner, which Larry will discuss in a moment. I will also note that the organic RPO growth rate was 26% in constant currency. Approximately 48% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx this quarter was $2.6 billion as we continue to build capacity for existing bookings and our customers' growing needs. Given the demand you see reflected in the RPO as well as what we see in our pipeline, I expect that our CapEx investments will be about where it is right now for the foreseeable future. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends. We now have 41 public cloud regions around the world with another 8 being built. In addition, 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities. We have many cloud customer implementations, 10 dedicated regions and another 9 national security regions with increasing demand for more.  As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $863 million in the quarter. And the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 25% from $0.32 to $0.40 per share. Our financial strategy remains focused on growing non-GAAP operating and pre-tax income while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. And given increasing customer interest in our cloud technologies, we will continue to prudently invest to meet this demand. As a reminder, because now we're going to talk about Q4, last Q4, we had a spectacular double-digit revenue growth rate, highlighted by 25% constant currency growth in software license. With our continued migration to the cloud, we expect that we will continue to win big deals that are more subscription driven than license driven. These big subscription wins add to the backlog and are recognized over time rather than upfront. That is exactly what we want to see as our cloud business continues to see excellent growth. So now let me turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll provide on a non-GAAP basis. Now assuming the currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency would have a 2% negative effect on total revenue and at least 3% plus negative effect on EPS in Q4. But as I say every quarter, the actual currency impact may be very different by quarter end. Okay. Here we go. Total revenues for Q4, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 17% to 19% in constant currency, and thus are expected to grow 15 to 17 in USD. Total cloud growth, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 51% to 53% in constant currency, 49 to 51 in USD. I expect total cloud growth for Q4, excluding Cerner, will be above 30% in constant currency. I expect growth in operating profit to be double digits. As you all know, my non-GAAP tax rate guidance is typically 20.5. However, our tax rates over the last two years and Q4 have averaged around 11%, and I anticipate that in Q4, the most likely outcome is a non-GAAP tax rate of around 14.5%. And we've used this rate in determining our EPS guidance for Q4. Now mind you, that's comparing it to 11 or 10.5, I think, last year. Regardless, like past quarters, the actual tax rate for Q4 could be higher or lower and affect our actual EPS. With that, non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 3% and 5% and between $1.59 and $1.63 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 1% and 3% and be between $1.56 and $1.60 in USD.  What have I got here? Anyway, as I've said before, Cerner will be accretive to earnings this year, including Q4. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. Since June of last year, when we acquired Cerner, that business has increased its health care contract base by approximately $5 billion. We have signed a diverse set of new and expanding domestic and international customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, hospital groups in a dozen U.S. states, multiple hospitals in the United Kingdom, multiple provinces in Canada, the Australian Defence Forces, multiple hospitals in Puerto Rico and multiple countries in the Middle East. While we are pleased with this early success of the Cerner business, we expect the signing of new health care contracts to accelerate over the next few quarters. Well, the Cerner business has been booking billions of dollars in Millennium Clinical and electronic health record systems for hundreds of hospitals and ambulatory clinics. The overall Oracle Healthcare application portfolio is actually much broader, covering virtually the entire health care ecosystem. Hospitals are also buying the Oracle Fusion ERP system to manage their revenue cycle and from reimbursements -- from insurance companies to patient billing, plus their medical supply chain from ordering to inventory. Hospitals are buying Fusion HCM to manage their complex high-value workforce of doctors, nurses and technicians. Pharmaceutical companies are buying Oracle Clinical One to manage clinical trials. Government health organizations, public health organizations are using aggregated EHR data to monitor infectious disease and respond to outbreaks quickly and efficiently. Now I'd like to take a couple of minutes and go over a little more specifically some of the Cerner wins since we bought the company. One was a huge win at Labcorp and Ascension Health to deploy a single lab information system domain for 96 separate hospital-based labs across 10 states. Another one in Puerto Rico, Auxilio Mutuo, is an all-new electronic health record footprint to deploy in a 600-plus bed academic private hospital, replacing Altera, Paragon with Cerner Millennium. Vandalia Health, formerly Charleston Area Medical Center, consolidated all their EMRs into a single unified domain and added four new hospitals. UHS modernized their revenue cycle, migrated to CareAware with the CareAware Cloud and -- for their hospitals and ambulatory clinics. Banner Health implemented a complete revenue cycle management for their health business. The VA deployed our unified electronic health record system to 19 additional sites. The Department of Defense deployed Oracle Cerner EHR to all the OCONUS locations in the Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of Defense. In the UK, at the National Health Service, Sheffield Teaching Hospital deployed the full suite of Cerner applications across three additional sites and the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals. The Princess Alexandra Hospital, also in the NHS, is a 430-bed hospital that added the full Cerner suite. Mubadala Health was the first Cerner Millennium client to move from the Cerner data center directly now to the OCI Cloud. As we move our Cerner patients from the Cerner data centers into the Oracle OCI Cloud, we expect to get much better security, much better reliability, much better performance and dramatically lower our costs of providing that cloud service. OCI is just much more efficient than the Cerner data centers that we acquired. We've deployed the full EHR footprint, Cerner footprint to four Sheikh Khalifa Hospitals in the U.A.E. with a capacity of 1,200 beds, serving a population of 1.4 million citizens, again, in the U.A.E. The Australian Department of Defense, we delivered acute care capabilities and deployed an environment for all of the Australian Defence hospitals and field hospitals. In Canada, starting in Nova Scotia, we deployed a one-patient, one-record EHR system across the province for the citizens of Nova Scotia. One-patient, one-record, as you know, I've discussed a long time the fact that patient electronic health records are scattered across every provider they visit. That problem is now being solved in Nova Scotia by having a single unified patient record for every patient regardless of which provider they visit. Their records are still all in one place. Same thing in Niagara Health, a new HR footprint to support delivery of care for 450,000 citizens, again, in Canada. Okay. I'm going to stop with that. I mean those are direct Cerner wins since we acquired Cerner. But on top of that, we have all of the -- all of -- if you will, the rest of the health care suite, which is made up of Oracle ERP, Oracle HCM, Oracle Clinical One for clinical trials. Oracle ERP for managing everything from procurement and inventory, the entire supply chain or HCM from managing the enormously complicated scheduling and paying of their professional workforce and doctors, nurses, technicians, et cetera. We're very strong in this part of the business. Our customers include the Cleveland Clinic, who use our ERP system in their hospitals and our supply chain systems; the Mayo Clinic, also ERP, supply chain and HCM to manage the workforce; Mount Sinai Hospital, ERP, SCM and HCM; then Providence St. Joseph Health, ERP, SCM, HCM and actually -- and CX customer engagement; Adventist Health, Adventist Health uses Oracle ERP, SCM, HCM and CX; Kaiser Permanente, a huge Oracle HCM user, to manage their workforce; the NHS in the UK, ERP and SCM; UnitedHealthcare, ERP and HCM; BlueCross BlueShield, ERP, HCM, HCM and CX; Humana, ERP and SCM; Highmark Health, ERP, SCM, all Fusion products or HCM; Health Care Service Corporation, you see a pattern here, ERP, HCM and CX; Independence Blue Cross, ERP and HCM; Bright Health Care, ERP. Now in this past quarter, we had major wins at Ascension Health buying ERP, HCM, SCM and HCM, where the primary competitor in HCM was Workday. As we add specific features to manage the health care workforce to our HCM product, Oracle becomes more and more successful in selling our HCM products within the health care ecosystem. So our win rates are going up dramatically. Our sales cycles are going down. University of Texas Health in San Antonio was a big HCM win there. Labcorp bought ERP and HCM, where the competitor in ERP was SAP. And the -- we won BlueRock Therapeutics, where they bought ERP, SCM and Fusion Analytic Warehouse. Again, the competitor there was SAP. And this, by the way, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bayer AG. So it was nice to win in a German company, German-owned company, ICU -- against SAP. ICU Medical expanded their HCM for vascular therapy and oncology. Dexcom, ERP, EPM, SCM; Sitel, ERP, EPM, SCM, a winner over SAP. We had some huge go-lives in the quarter. Providence Health, huge SCM customer, rolled out to 12 additional ministries. The National Healthcare in the UK, supply -- I have all the trust -- all the trust hospitals are all now live with ERP. Baptist Healthcare has now 10,000 employees live on HCM; Texas Children's Hospital, 21,000 employees live on HCM. Kelsey-Seybold Clinics are now completely live in HCM. I can go on and on, but rather than doing that, I'm just going to turn it over -- back over to Safra. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Emma, if you could please poll the audience for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : With the slowdown we're seeing across so many IaaS PaaS vendors over the last couple of quarters and especially this quarter, why has OCI Gen 2 held up so well? You have born in the cloud customers, which you're seeing weakness elsewhere, you have enterprises. Is it simply low price? Is it performance? Is it you're at the right time in the economic cycle to be capturing new customers? Is there some dynamics around expiry credits that you're -- that are driving this? The difference is too stark. I think it's really important. So the more color you can give, the better. Larry Ellison : All right. I'd like to take a crack at that. So I'll start by check with Jensen over at NVIDIA. He and I had a very interesting conversation. Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud is quite different than the other hyperscalers. We have an RDMA network, a non-blocking RDMA network. Our network is very much faster than the other guys' network. What this means is if you're running a large group of NVIDIA GPUs in a cluster doing a large AI problem at Oracle, we can build these AI clusters, these NVIDIA GPU clusters and run them. We can build those things dynamically because we use -- our standard network supports the clustering, the large clustering of GPUs and allows them to communicate very quickly. So we can create these groups of GPUs. We can marshal them together. The other guys can't do that. They can build clusters, but they actually literally are physically building a new cluster. They're building new hardware. Our existing hardware, standard network, allows us to group these things together dynamically, these GPUs together dynamically, to attack AI problems. No one else can do that. So we have a lot of business, a lot of new AI companies coming to Oracle because we're the only ones who can run their workloads. And by the way -- and we are cheaper. But so we're faster and we're cheaper. Let me give you an example where we use it ourselves. We have a partnership in health care -- back to this health care thing. We have a partnership with health care with MD Anderson Hospital, and one of our independent software vendors called Ronan, where we built these AI -- disease-specific AI modules that make recommendations to doctors about care. And then what they really say at MD Anderson, if we see a patient with these symptoms, this is how we respond. And that's a big AI model that's built by MD Anderson working with Ronan running in the Oracle Cloud. And we've actually shown or I should say MD Anderson has actually shown, if you use the system, you reduce hospital admissions and readmissions by 30%. That's a stunning number. People talk about ChatGPT being really cool because they can write my high school essay for me. Well, how about reducing the hospital readmissions at MD Anderson by 30%? You decide which is more important. But AI is fabulous stuff, yes. And ChatGPT is very cool. There are other applications other than generative language in these large language models. We've really focused on on health care in the last year or so since the acquisition of Cerner and are working diligently with others to apply AI to health care and especially the management of the complex diseases like cancer. This is a cancer AI system. But we're also doing wellness, heart disease, et cetera, down the road. We think -- so our platform runs AI very, very well because we create these clusters of GPUs that we -- that can attack big problems very quickly. We do it economically, then we build the applications on top of that. We provide the service to a lot of the startups in the AI world. This is one example of where we're just way ahead of the other hyperscalers in terms of our network and our ability to do AI. Let me point out one last AI thing. The Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't have any database administrators. It's completely self-driving. The Oracle Autonomous Database is self-driving because it is driven by -- it is an AI module that is the DBA. We've replaced the DBAs with AI inside of our own cloud. The Oracle Autonomous Database actually it runs all the databases inside of the administrative part of our cloud, keeps track of all of our users, our billing, all of those things, recovery data sets, all of that stuff is now done using AI and our autonomous database. So we're a huge consumer of AI. We're a huge vendor of AI, GPU capacity, clustered capacity is -- we build AI modules in health care. And people are coming to us. NVIDIA is often recommending us as the best cloud for AI, and this is a good time to be there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Thank you, Larry. My question was very much related to that, but maybe from a slightly different angle. I'm wondering if you could drill into the opportunity that you do see on the generative AI side? We're repeatedly hearing that companies are running those kinds of models on OCI. NVIDIA is moving some of those workloads to the Oracle Cloud. And the other concept being that these AI models are so data hungry and that you have all the data already contained in the Fusion applications. I am curious if that piece of it, the generative AI piece, is something that you see lining up as a growth driver that is material overall on the entire business. Larry Ellison : The answer is absolutely yes. There's actually more demand for AI processing than there is available capacity. So -- and we're the only ones, again, that can dynamically -- and by the way -- and we're short. We are expanding as fast as we can. It's really -- it's an exciting opportunity, but it's challenging when there's more demand than supply. But the great -- the difference with us is our standard network allows us to group together these GPUs and have them attack these problems. Whether it's a medical diagnostic problem or it's a generative language problem, a la ChatGPT. So we have a lot of ISVs seeking us out because we have the -- not only do we have the most cost-effective solution, we can make the solution available to them very quickly because it runs on our standard network. So they can -- we can create a cluster for them, they run their workload. And the moment their workload is through running, we can reallocate that cluster or break that cluster up and allocate it to other users. The other guys can't do that, they can't do it dynamically. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Derrick Wood : Thanks for taking my question and I'll echo my congratulations, especially on sustaining very high OCI growth. Larry, one area we've been doing more work on is how cloud vendors can help transform the telco market, including migrating their IT infrastructure and their network operations to the public cloud, which should lead to greater efficiencies and also give them a more effective platform to roll out new 5G and edge application services. I know you guys touched on this a bit at last year's Analyst Day, but I was just hoping to get an update on how you're thinking about that telco opportunity with the Oracle Stack, especially with OCI? Who's some of the telco operators you're partnering with? And how you see this playing out over the next couple of years? Yes. This is an exciting business for us. I mean, we're actually creating dedicated data centers for Vodafone. I'm not sure how many we've already built as yet. But if you will, Vodafone is moving a substantial part of their business into the Oracle Cloud. And again, we have this ability to build data centers for customers. And those data centers are OCI data centers that we run for them, but they are dedicated to workloads at a particular customer. Nomura, the first of them we built a few years ago in Japan for Nomura. And they have a primary and now they have a backup, they run the Tokyo Stock Exchange on that, and they sell it into financial services in Japan. But that's an OCI data center that we built for Nomura, where they're reselling the capabilities. Vodafone is again another example of someone who were building dedicated data -- these are OCI data centers that we run there. In our constellation of data centers, they look like all the other OCI data centers. They're automated like all the other OCI data centers. So we take advantage of those economies of scale and that skilled labor that runs them. And a lot -- again, a lot of it is AI, but a lot of it we still have human beings. We've done that for Vodafone. Same thing with DISH Network's entry into telephony is enabled by similar architectural approach using OCI. I can go on and on. But we have -- but it's one of our industries of emphasis. And I think you'll see us -- and that's going to be a huge area of growth for us. As telcos, we've always been very strong in telcos. And now they're beginning to move to the cloud. And we're seeing some major commitments from some of our largest customers around the world. We're also seeing financial services companies take a slightly different point of view, but where they want to keep things, if you will, \"on-premise.\" But since we can build an OCI region and dedicate it to a bank, there we're doing more, if you will, call it, clouded customer where we built a dedicated region for a financial service. Nomura was an example, Nomura in Japan, but there are other examples. We build these clouds for banks.  So I mean, huge industries moving to the cloud in a slightly different way than other industries, not moving to public cloud, but rather preferring to have these dedicated regions. So it's just their application, just their applications in this cloud. We have the ability to do that. Again, the Amazon does not, and Microsoft does not, and Google does not. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim. John DiFucci : I think this question is for Safra. We've heard a lot about your committed cloud mega deals, but you sometimes have talked about pure consumption or pay-as-you-go deals. Other vendors that employ the pay-as-you-go model, such as Mongo and even Snowflake, to some extent, who had been getting a ton of traction in the market, have either seen or they anticipate dramatic slowdowns. We haven't seen anything like that in your results at all and certainly not in your guidance. But can you talk about your exposure to such deals and how they're progressing? Safra Catz : So as Larry was touching on it, we have many, many enterprise customers, phone companies, banks, governments who make commitments to us as part of their move to cloud. So we do have some pay-as-you-go customers, but the bulk of our revenue, first of all, our SaaS revenue, as you know, you implement an accounting system, you're not going to pay less tomorrow. You still have to run your accounting system. So the SaaS side of the business, again, is fully committed. And then because we have so many important enterprise customers who are bringing basically their crown jewels into our cloud and had been waiting really for us to be in the position to receive those, they want to have a two-way commitment. They want to know that we have the capacity for them, and they want to get a slightly better price. So first of all, those that go into the public cloud, whether it's Telecom Italia or Verizon or some of these others, they obviously would like a better price, so they make commitments to come in, usually committing less than they expect to use, and almost always, over using more than they expected. However, other customers have cloud customers, as Larry mentioned, or other different arrangements, the alloy arrangement where we have a combination with the telco or a data center provider, those are all committed. And so we're very -- we're very strong in the commitments from our customers. And by the way, they want to make sure we have available capacity back for them because many of them get rid of their data centers when they're finished. And that's the ultimate goal for them. They don't want to be running back and forth. These aren't toy workloads. These are critical workloads for their business, and they want to know that they've got a place to put those. John DiFucci : So the commitment is these -- a lot of these, it sounds like these people are committed to ramping up to the full capacity of their data center and not until they do that, do they shut down for the most part their -- the data centers they're replacing? Safra Catz : Yes. John DiFucci : Okay. Safra Catz : Yes. Just so that we're clear here. Pay-as-you-go at Oracle is less than 5% of our business. Okay? John DiFucci : Okay. Safra Catz : Okay. Is that helpful? John DiFucci : That's very clear. Thank you very much, Safra. Operator : Your last question today comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Larry, as I think about the strong momentum in Cerner, expanding the contract base by $5 billion and your expectations for the business to accelerate, can you parse through the drivers in terms of new logo win rates versus the expansion in cross-sell you're doing with Fusion, for example? And then also, Larry, you touched on the idea of a single medical record. People have been talking about this for decades. When does it become clear that Oracle is helping improve the quality of care and saving lives? And I've got a quick follow-up for Safra if Ken will allow. Larry Ellison : Well, I think there are two things. One is the system we're putting in for the DoD and for the VA is one patient, one record. So that's a model of it. The one going in, in Nova Scotia is the same. We are bidding on a huge contract for the NHS. Again, some of these contracts are enormous and the responsibility to go along with the contracts is also enormous. But our system, that's how our system works. Our standard system that we have built is one patient, one record in the database. So if you visit Stanford and UCLA and Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic, even if you go to these four different providers for a variety of different issues, all of your data will be in one database. All your patient data will be in one place immediately accessible in a time of emergency or just a routine visit to the doctor. That's how our system is architected. That's how we're delivering it to us to customers right now. It's attracted a lot of attention. Actually, it's not only much better for the patient, helps deliver better -- gives doctors better information, deliver better outcomes, but it's also less expensive to do it that way than every hospital maintaining their own system to -- rather -- it's better that they should share a system in the cloud and integrate their data for the benefit of the patient. Saving lives is exactly what it's doing -- what's happening with our partner at Ronan and our partner at MD Anderson and other partnerships I could go into in more detail, and I'm happy to but not on this call, is these disease-specific AI modules where -- and the telemedicine modules that we're delivering, allows a patient in a community hospital in Montana to get the benefits of the wisdom of the best specialty cancer specialists at MD Anderson Hospital in Texas or a Memorial Sloan Kettering doc in New York or a Mass General doctor who's on faculty at Harvard Medical School. The fact that we're now using AI and telemedicine and instrumenting these diagnostic devices so the docs -- so -- in the community hospital, we have diagnostic devices that the Harvard faculty, then there at Mass General can look at and then they inspect the AI module to, a, gather much better information. And with that better information, have the best minds and AI -- real minds and artificial intelligence processing that information and prescribing, hopefully, the best procedure or the best medication for that particular patient, which translates into reducing readmission to the hospital as they did at MD Anderson and ultimately saving lives. Brad Zelnick : The mission is so important. If I could just sneak in a quick one for Safra to follow up. Safra, 30% organic cloud growth for the year implies significant acceleration in Q4. What supports your confidence in delivering that? Safra Catz : Well, remember, as I told you, we have dropped a large number of data centers. And as they become available, we have customers waiting to get started and use them. So we have commitments from customers to quite an enormous amount of consumption. And so they've basically been waiting for us. We've -- it's taken a while in all these different countries to open these data centers and to make them available to our customers. And so we know they are actually very impatient to use the capacity as it becomes available. And we just have a lot of momentum and a lot of commitment from our customers and a lot of enthusiasm around our offerings. And so this is -- that's how the math works. Ken Bond : Thank you, Brad and Safra. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Emma for closing. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Ken Bond. Please go ahead. Ken Bond : Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and Chief Executive Officer, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be cause actual results to differ from what we are talking about today. Throughout today\u2019s discussion we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you can see, Q4 was another fantastic quarter and the end of a great year. But before I get to the numbers, I'd like to go over our journey to get here. Three years ago, I shared with you that our own business transformation had reached a crossover point as our fast growing businesses had eclipsed the size of our declining businesses. And as a result, this would inevitably drive revenue growth acceleration going forward. Now, I don't blame you for not believing me at the time. Fiscal year 2020 growth was zero. Well, as you can see, this has played out with organic revenue growth accelerating significantly. And that's despite the closure of our nearly half a billion dollar Russia business. Since fiscal year 2020, our strategic back office SaaS business has more than doubled in size. And consumption of our Gen 2 cloud infrastructure service is now seven times larger. And while competitors have seen their growth rates drop precipitously over the last year, our cloud infrastructure growth rate has essentially doubled from last year to 77% this quarter and with Gen 2 OCI growth even higher. And we're far from done. In fact, I just told my team, I think we're at about the middle of the beginning. Looking ahead, I see even more growth opportunities that should help power future growth acceleration in the future. We remain committed to the fiscal year 2026 targets that we shared with you last fall at our financial analyst meeting. And our exploding AI demand leaves us significant upside. Our momentum has been driven by two fundamental differences from our competition. One, highly differentiated technology. And two, a much better customer experience. Firstly, our cloud applications are very popular with a growing base of customers in part because we are the most modern, comprehensive, and innovative set of apps across back office, CX, and industry applications. We implemented AI machine learning capabilities years before anyone was talking about it. And it helps our customers run their businesses every day. To complete the picture, we can serve customers of any size around the world from small businesses on NetSuite to global enterprise on Fusion in all industries. Having the best cloud application technology has helped us grow the business to $11 billion in SaaS revenue while expanding gross margins. On the infrastructure side, we're seeing more and more media articles reporting on the unique capabilities of OCI and our database technologies. Larry will explain our unique differentiation in a moment. But the result is that customers are choosing to run on Oracle infrastructure for all their requirements, be they new services like AI training or services we're known for, like database and Java. To complement the technology, we've changed our culture such that we are totally focused on our customers' success. That partnership spirit starts with engineering as we work hand-in-hand with companies as they try out our technology and continues all the way through their success with us. There's no question that this close partnership with our customers has led to our success. As part of that, we've also created an organization called Customer Success Services, or CSS. This group ensures that customers get the most value from their Oracle purchases, from planning to activation to implementation to support to anything else they need to succeed. We think this unique approach, which customers already tell us they love, ultimately drives overall customer satisfaction, and that results in higher renewal rates, expansion rates, and referencing. Now, I'll turn to Q4. As always, I'll discuss financials using constant currency growth rates, and also provide a full picture. I'm going to share with you results, including and some excluding Cerner, so that you have it all. Total cloud revenues, SaaS plus IaaS, was $4.4 billion, up 55%, with IaaS revenue of $1.4 billion, up 77%, and SaaS revenue of $3 billion, up 47%. Excluding Cerner, total cloud revenue, SaaS plus IaaS, was up more than 33%, at $3.8 billion. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.4 billion, up 25%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database, and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which include product support, were $4.4 billion, up 37%. Application-specific revenues, including support, but excluding Cerner, were $3.4 billion, up 11%. SaaS cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, was $2.4 billion, was up 17%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $6.6 billion, and grew 24%, including Fusion ERP, up 28%, and NetSuite ERP, up 24%. Together, our strategic back office businesses are now larger and have grown faster than our local competitor for four straight years. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which also include support, were $5 billion, up 15%. As mentioned already, infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 77%, excluding legacy hosting services. Infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 89%, with an annualized revenue of $5.2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 112%. Cloud at customer consumption revenue was up 60%, and autonomous database was up 47%. Database subscription revenues, which include database support, were up 6%, highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 41%. As on-premise databases migrate to the cloud and cloud at customer, we expect these cloud database services will be a third leg of revenue growth and revenue growth acceleration, alongside back office SaaS and Gen2 OCI cloud services. Software license revenues were $2.2 billion, down 14%, following the 25% growth we saw a year ago in Q4. So, all-in total revenues for the quarter, including Cerner's revenue contribution of $1.5 billion, were $13.8 billion, up 18%. Shifting to margins, the gross margin percentage for cloud services and license support was 78%, as a result of the mix between support and cloud. Last year, Oracle license support revenues, with its mid-90s gross margins, represented about 62% of cloud services and license support revenue, and now it's down to 53%. But this is happening because our cloud services are growing much, much faster than license support, even as license support continues to grow. Most importantly, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 19% with Cerner, 10% excluding Cerner in Q4. Additionally, I would note that IaaS gross margins improved substantially from last year, and I expect IaaS gross margins will continue to improve. While we have continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.2 billion, up 12% from last year. The operating margin was 44% as we continued to integrate Cerner. As we drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards and continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 9.2%, and the non-GAAP EPS was $1.47 in U.S. dollars, up 8% in USD, 10% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $1.19. For the full fiscal year, total company revenue was $50 billion, up 22%. And excluding revenue, total revenue grew 7%. Total application subscriptions were 35%, and 10%, excluding Cerner, compared to 8% last year. And total infrastructure grew 10%, compared with 5% growth last year. Clearly, our revenue growth continued to accelerate again this year as investments into our cloud businesses are paying off. Total cloud services and license support revenue was $35.3 billion, up 21%. Total cloud services by itself were up 50%, to $15.9 billion. And excluding Cerner, total cloud services were up 29%, to $13.6 billion. And with revenue growth acceleration in both strategic back office cloud applications, which were up 27% for the year, and cloud infrastructure services, which were up 63% for the year. Non-GAAP EPS was $5.12 in USD, up 4% in USD, and up 10% in constant currency. The full year operating margin percentage was 42%. At quarter end, we had nearly $10.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. And the short-term deferred revenue balance was $9 billion, up 9%. Operating cash flow for the quarter was up 42%, at $5.6 billion. While free cash flow was up 46%, at $3.7 billion. Now over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17.2 billion, up 80% from last year, as we're now seeing cash flow benefits from our cloud transformation. With capital expenditures of $8.7 billion this year, free cash flow was $8.5 billion, up from $5 billion last year. And I expect that we will see very good results in our fiscal 24 free cash flow. The remaining performance obligation, or RPO balance, is $67.9 billion, up 47% in constant currency, due to strong cloud bookings as well as Cerner. I would also note that organic RPO was 15% in constant currency, as a result of our customers burning through their commitments at a heightened rate. I expect that you'll see this number run up as customers reload and new customers sign up. Approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.9 billion in Q4 and $8.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, as we continue to build capacity for existing bookings and our customers' growing needs. Our investment strategy for adding capacity remains to build many, many identical cloud regions. Our starting point is smaller, which allows us to go where competitors cannot. And this continues to be an advantage for us. Given the demand we have and see in our pipeline, I've increased our CapEx projection and I now expect the fiscal 2024 will be similar to this year's CapEx. I also expect our Gen 2 OCI business will have another excellent year of revenue growth as existing centers fill up and new centers come online. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends, which is why our gross margins are up in our cloud. We now have 42 public cloud regions around the world with another 7 being built. 12 of these public regions interconnect with Microsoft Azure, giving customers true multi-cloud capabilities. We have many, many clouded customer implementations, 10 dedicated regions, and 9 more planned. And lastly, we have 9 national security regions live with immense demand for more. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This year, this fiscal year, we repurchased 17 million shares for a total of $1.3 billion. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.7 billion over the last 12 months as the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now to guidance. And as I've said before, our fundamental principle is to grow EPS while substantially increasing cloud revenue growth. Let me turn to my guidance for Q1, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis like everything else. If currency exchange rates remain as they are now, currency should have a 0 to 1% positive effect on total revenue and a $0.01 positive effect on EPS in Q1. However, actual currency impact may be different. Total revenues for Q1, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 7% to 9% in constant currency and are expected to grow from 8% to 10% in USD at today's exchange rate. Additional upside depends on how fast we can put out even more capacity to our customers. Total cloud revenue, again, excluding Cerner, is expected to grow from 28% to 30% in constant currency and 29% to 31% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 8% to 12% and be between $1.11 and $1.15 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 9% to 13% and be between $1.12 and $1.16 in USD. My EPS guidance assumes a base tax rate of 19.5. However, as you see nearly every quarter, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. Now, before I finish, let me also give you some initial thoughts on fiscal year 2024. As I described, and Larry will elaborate in depth, we are seeing unprecedented demand for our cloud services and especially our AI services. As a result, I expect cloud revenue, excluding Cerner, will continue growing at at least similar rates to what we experienced in fiscal 2023, even though our base is much bigger and may be higher. As our high-growth cloud revenues are becoming a larger, larger portion of total revenue, we are seeing an acceleration of our total revenue growth. I expect this trend will continue in fiscal 2024. And of course, we also expect to deliver a higher non-GAAP operating margin percentage this coming year as well. Okay. Before I hand off to Larry, I want to take a moment to thank our customers for making fiscal year 2023 such an enormous success. You've been wonderful partners, and we thank you for your trust in us. And I want to thank our employees for being focused on advancing our customers' missions so spectacularly. Some of you are new, and many of you have been with us for years, in fact, even decades. And I think you all see that our best days are, in fact, ahead of us. Thank you for your loyalty and for your incredibly hard work. And thank you, Larry, our CTO, our Chairman, and our founder for leading with brilliance, determination, and vision, and allowing us to all be part of this incredible journey, which is just getting started. So thanks, Larry. And with that, I'll turn it over to you for your comments. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. The hardware and software in Oracle's Gen2 Cloud is fundamentally different than other hyperscalers' clouds. The CPUs and GPUs we rent to customers are interconnected using an ultra-high-performance RDMA network, plus a dedicated set of cloud-controlled computers that manage security and data privacy. Oracle's unique set of hardware and software building blocks enable our Gen2 Cloud to deliver much higher performance than any of our cloud competitors. And in the cloud, since you pay by the minute, if you run twice as fast, and we do, you pay half as much. What is especially interesting in today's world is that all of Oracle's cloud data centers have a high-bandwidth, low-latency RDMA network that is perfectly optimized for building the large-scale GPU clusters that are used to train generative large-language models. NVIDIA themselves are doing AI development in the Oracle Gen2 Cloud. And we are partnering with NVIDIA to build the world's largest high-performance computer, an AI computer, with 16,000 GPUs. The extreme high performance and related cost savings of running generative AI workloads in our Gen2 Cloud has made Oracle the number one choice among cutting-edge AI development companies, including Mosaic ML, Adept AI, Fouhear [Ph], Modal Labs, Character, HyperReal, SliceX, Vector Space Bio, Falconry, Respeacher, Altair, InfoWorld, 12 Labs, Layton Space, plus many, many others. In the aggregate, our generative AI cloud customers have recently signed contracts to purchase more than $2 billion of capacity in Oracle's Gen2 Cloud. One last thing. In partnership with Cohere Oracle is launching a generative AI cloud service for enterprise customers. This new service protects the privacy of our enterprise customers' training data, enabling those customers to safely use their own private data to train their own private specialized large language models. Oracle's application development teams were early adopters of this new AI cloud service. We used our own private data to improve and extend the training of existing Cohere large language models. This supplementary training resulted in two new specialized large language models, one for medical professionals and one for first responders. Specialized large language models will be instrumental in helping highly trained professionals use their precious time more efficiently. As I said, Cohere and Oracle are working together to make it very, very easy for enterprise customers to train their own specialized large language models while protecting the privacy of their training data. Over the next few years, lots of companies are going to train their own specialized large language models. Our partner, Cohere, is also using the Oracle Gen2 Cloud for training their own large language models. In health care alone, specialized large language models will speed the discovery of new life-saving drugs, improve the quality of patient care, and increase access to health care by lowering costs. A technology revolution is dawning. Back to you, Safra. Safra Catz : I think we're going to take some questions. Ken? Ken Bond : Yes, thank you, Safra. Thank you, Larry. Lisa, if we could please prepare the audience for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John DiFucci with Guggenheim. John DiFucci : Thank you. My question's for, I think, mainly for Safra, but maybe Larry has some thoughts, too. It's somewhat surprising to see the acceleration across all your cloud businesses when others, whether it's the other hyperscalers or even other cloud-based vendors, are seeing just the opposite effects in this environment today, in today's environment. And that's important. We get the better performance at a lower price. That makes a lot of sense, at least in, I've been around quite a while, I guess. And usually, in tough environments, we see people just freeze. But that's not what's happening here. So the question, in addition to what I just said, better performance at lower price, why? Is there anything else, outside of like Oracle, even, that would show your cloud business accelerating when other pretty good companies are doing just the opposite? Safra Catz : Let me take a start at it. And Larry, you add in here. First of all, the fact that OCI is just growing and accelerating is because customers want to spend less. And they also need to do more. They need to stay competitive. They need to stay agile. And so our technology, whether it's our applications, which allow them to spend a lot less and make better decisions running their business, so that's very, very natural. So our Fusion, and there's just so many things about Fusion that are so compelling. It costs less, it just helps them run their business. But then you go to OCI, where some of these customers are coming from our competitors. And as Larry said, imagine, Larry talked about the workload being twice as fast on OCI. But imagine it's 10 times as fast, or 100 times faster, or as is common in some cases, 1,000 times faster. So imagine what that bill looks like. So we have compelling technology at a much lower price. And that's without a doubt causing our customers to move to us more quickly. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add into that. Larry Ellison : Well, I'm just going to be a little more specific, because Safra says, I said, if we run twice as fast, we cost twice as much. No, we cost half as much, half as much. We run twice as fast, we cost half as much. But sometimes we do run a lot more than twice as fast. And we cost a lot less than half as much. We announced a new database, a new version of MySQL with a fast query processor called HeatWave. And we have customers moving from Amazon Aurora, where they're experiencing 1,000 times speedup, versus Aurora, we're 1,000 times faster in query processing than Amazon's version of MySQL. It's an open source database that we added a fast query processor to. We're much, much cheaper. And that's one example. In a lot of cases, it's much more than two to one. We can build GPUs that other people can't build because we have a fast network. We use this very fast RDMA network, and we started with that. In our Gen2 cloud, we had nothing but our entire network was a super-fast network, which means most of the applications, most of the things you run in the Oracle cloud are going to be much faster than our competitors' clouds because they don't use that kind of network. So we have huge cost advantages, huge cost advantages across a broad portfolio of applications. Let me throw in one thing. It cost one-tenth, one-tenth to implement Fusion ERP versus SAP's new ERP system with HANA. So the cost of implementing our applications are dramatically lower than our competitors. So we have a lot of people moving from AWS to our cloud for infrastructure services, a lot of people continuing to move from SAP to Fusion. We're seeing that migration, and we're taking a lot of market share from our competitors. That's why we're doing better, and they're not doing quite as well. John DiFucci : Okay. Well, thank you, and really nice job. Thanks. Larry Ellison : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great, thank you so much. Congrats on a strong finish to the year. Larry, Oracle is somewhat unique in being a leader in both infrastructure and applications. And when we look back, I don't know, maybe five years from now, how much of the generative AI opportunity will have been captured on the infrastructure side of your business versus within apps? And I'm not just thinking strategic back office apps. I'm thinking front office, Cerner, and all the other verticals as well. Larry Ellison : Yes, absolutely. It's very hard to answer that question. A long time ago, I said the biggest difference between - the biggest strategic difference between Oracle's cloud and everyone else's cloud is actually not the RDMA network. That's a technical difference. The biggest strategic difference is that we do both that we use our infrastructure and build applications with it. So we learn a lot about how we can improve our infrastructure by building lots of applications, enterprise-scale applications, on top of our infrastructure. So we have this continuous feedback loop. We're building applications, obtaining insights, making improvements in our productivity. We have a new programming language. We have Java, and we love Java. We use it a lot for building applications. But we have this other low-code application development tool called APEX. And we're now building a lot of our applications in APEX. And our productivity gains are, again, a factor of 10. And we build the applications in one tenth the time, or one tenth the amount of people, or at one tenth the cost. But these are not typical low-code applications. These are applications that can scale to millions of users and all over the world. So most low-code applications are for small projects. We use them for applications we've rolled out globally. And we've made our underlying infrastructure, the APEX development environment, the underlying APEX database, which is the Oracle Autonomous Database, has made our application developers dramatically more productive. It's one of the reasons why we bought into the idea that we could rewrite a whole suite of medical applications in a very, very short period of time, that we could redo Cerner very, very quickly because of these underlying tools. Let me close with one last thing. Again, we use AI technology to make our database better. And it's an autonomous database. You don't need DBAs. It recovers itself. It updates itself. It adds more space. It really is a self-driving database. We've used AI technology to do that. We've used AI technology throughout our cloud, where our cloud is self-healing. We repair bugs while the cloud is running. We have an autonomous Linux operating system that's different than all of the other Linuxes. You can patch it online. It patches itself online. It repairs itself online. So again, by being in those two businesses, applications and underlying infrastructure, we again, use our infrastructure and make it better to make our applications better and we gain insights as what we need to do with our, what we need to add to our infrastructure to make the applications better. So, infrastructures make the applications better, applications make the infrastructure better. We're the only company with that continuous feedback loop and I think it gives us a huge competitive advantage in technology. It's why we have technologies that other people don't have. Brad Zelnick : Very helpful, color. Thank you, Larry. Operator : We'll take our next question from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you and congrats on a great quarter. I want to dig into the application part of the business. Very impressive SaaS growth, especially in Fusion Apps and Cloud ERP in this macro environment. So, what are you hearing from your customer in terms of migrating to the SaaS application and what's driving that? And also, the CloudWorld last year, you talked about the opportunity in combining horizontal application with vertical offering. So, how is that helping SaaS growth? Safra Catz : Okay. Well, I will tell you that there's no question. Our secret weapon is the fact that we have vertical applications also. Many of our customers end up wanting to buy a vertical application and Fusion together and it's industry by industry. We will be posting online probably some of our wins for the quarter, but what you'll see is when we have existing customers in a segment and a vertical application in that, we truly are, without a doubt, the most popular. Whether it's healthcare with all of our existing customers, whether they be Cerner customers, the fact that we have ERP and HCM, SCM, all of our horizontal applications, CX, as well as the vertical applications, it makes us very tough to beat. New healthcare wins are going to be listed many, many, many go-lives, the same in financial services, retail, hospitality, these whole segments end up wanting to buy their entire solution from us. And that really makes us also very sensitive to their needs and we can fill them much better. So, that's been a big winner for us. And I will tell you that our customers also, when they move from on-premise, they realize that they're moving into the 21st century with a much better system, but also a much lower cost system that also is kept current every 90 days. New capabilities become available. They'll never have to do that big implementation every five years like some of the older companies who say they're cloud, but aren't actually cloud. They're just hosted. So, our products are just so differentiated all around that we're just building momentum around the world. Go ahead. Larry Ellison : Let me just add one example to Safra's comments, which I think are right on. But there's an interesting example. Everyone knows we compete with Workday in HCM or HR, whatever. When we bought Cerner, we decided that we were going to take our HCM system, our HR system, and specialize it, add features specifically for the healthcare industry. Now, it turns out managing a workforce in a hospital is very complex because the nurses might have private patients at home that they're seeing. They might work for two or three different hospitals. They might do some work in clinics as well. So, scheduling these people who have multiple jobs, doctors may have teaching assignments in universities. Obviously, they travel and they also have their own office hours. They may have a private practice in addition to working at the hospital. Scheduling these professionals is very, very tricky. Recruiting the professionals is very, very tricky. Paying them when you're working three days a week, one week, two days the next week, six days the following week, paying them can be very complex. So we have had a major effort in our HCM system, the Oracle Fusion HCM system, and adding all the features that hospitals need to manage their professional staff. Now, there's no way, there's no way we would have done that unless we had a focus in the healthcare industry. So we not only have all the Cerner healthcare apps for hospitals, we've specialized our ERP system for hospitals, we've specialized our HCM for managing the hospital workforce. We've done a bunch of things around the healthcare industry. One of the things we want to do is, we're the largest provider of clinical trial software. But the clinical, the results of the clinical trial goes to a government regulator. And we're now working with the government regulators to develop the software that allows them to take the clinical trial output in digital form and get it through the regulatory process much faster at a much lower cost. So we're looking at the entire healthcare ecosystem and trying to automate both sides of the transaction. The pharmaceutical company that's designing the drug, the hospitals that are testing the drug, and the regulators that are approving the drug should all be digitized. And we are well on our way to doing that because of our investment in Cerner. And now what has blossomed into an investment across the entire healthcare ecosystem. Siti Panigrahi : That's a perfect example, Larry. Thank you both for the color. Operator : We'll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Raimo Lenschow : Hey, thank you. Could I switch gear a little bit? A question for Safra. Safra, we now have Cerner in as part of Oracle. Where are we on the cost, on the synergy capture and cost takeout? And so are we, do you see we are done there or are we kind of still at the beginning of a journey? Thank you. And congrats for me as well. Safra Catz : Thank you. I actually feel like we're still at the beginning if you want to know the truth. We wanted to stabilize the operation. We definitely didn't want to risk breaking anything. You will be seeing some more significant changes and we have legal entity combination imminently and that actually gives us a lot more flexibility regarding the way we operate the business. We are just at the very beginning of it. Their margins are nowhere close to the way we run our company and we are right at the, I'd say we're at the beginning-ish, sort of at the beginning of the middle at most. We've got a long way to go on just operationally and we've got a lot of work going on on the development side as we bring our technical capabilities into the product and move them into the Oracle Cloud. There are a lot of savings as we do that also. Raimo Lenschow : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Safra Catz : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter and frankly on the guidance. I'd like to get a better understanding about the underpinning of the OCI Gen 2 business. Specifically, can you give us some color on the customer concentration, industry concentration, both in the existing customer base as well as the pipeline and how you think that's going to change over time? Thanks. Safra Catz : I don't know, Larry, if you want to take a stab at it. The reality is that our customers run from very small to very large. As a general matter, we're a small percentage of their IT costs when they get started and sometimes a small percentage of their cloud spending. As they try us out, they move larger percentages of their business off of other clouds or from on-premise. We're at the very beginning of this movement, especially on the database side as more and more of our customers, our big customers often have cloud a customer or dedicated regions is sort of their ultimate goal for their most critical database workloads. We're at the absolute beginning of that with most of our customers. It's basically what we find is if you give us a chance, it is so much better, so much more cost effective, of course, so much more secure that customers very quickly realize how advantageous it is to move. It's all industries. As some of you know, auto companies are doing their simulations with us. It's really across industries, across sizes. It's very, very diversified. Larry, I don't know if you have additional comments. Larry Ellison : Yes, maybe the most interesting industry that's adopting the Oracle Cloud are people who are in the technology business. So a lot of our customers are, I mean, their business, I mean, Zoom, in the early days of Oracle, it wasn't long ago we were talking about Zoom and still very excited about Zoom. And they came to us, one of our earliest, very, very large customers. And a lot of their business is just running an app, if you will, an application on the cloud. And a huge amount of their expense is running that application in the cloud and doing it efficiently. And where we're most obvious, I mean, NVIDIA is an extraordinary company, but Cohere is a great company. But a lot of their expense is running AI training in the cloud. And when it's that much of your expense, if we're a lot faster, they do a lot of due diligence about the technology. And it became very apparent, a lot of the early adopters, if you will, and we're still in the early stages, a lot of the early adopters at scale of the Oracle Cloud were highly technical companies like a Zoom or an NVIDIA, I can name a bunch of others, or a highly technical industry like phone companies, telecommunication companies, where they see the advantages, not only, by the way, the performance and cost advantages. Another thing that we're very proud of is because of our network, we're highly reliable. And because of the autonomy, we're highly reliable. If, for example, the Oracle Autonomous Database doesn't lose your data, because you can't make a pilot. Usually a lot of the data loss is caused by pilot error. Well, with the Oracle Autonomous Database, the driver is the system. It's a self-driving database. So you can't make a human error that causes you to lose data. So it's very, where a phone company has to be up 24 hours a day, where a bank really is not supposed to lose your data, where a huge percentage of your expenses are your own cloud expenses, and your technology company delivering technology services from somebody else's cloud. In those areas is where we've seen adoption of Oracle at scale. And the less technical companies are now beginning their journey of looking more closely at the Oracle cloud. And when they do look closely, we compare very favorably with the other clouds. Mark Moerdler : That's very helpful. I really appreciate it. Operator : And we'll take the last question from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Kirk Materne : Hi, thanks very much. Just a quick one for Safra, if I could. Safra, obviously, a very strong free cash flow quarter. We've gotten some questions from investors wondering about the CapEx this quarter, where you saw some efficiencies, how you're able to keep CapEx flat going into next year, given the fact that you're going to seeing this great demand for OCI. So could you double click on that a little bit for us? Thanks. Safra Catz : Yes. I mean, this past year was a big CapEx number as compared to usual. And we put out a lot of capacity. It is getting filled up, and getting used up. And I think we're getting real economies. In addition, one of the things you don't realize is that our underlying infrastructure, for example, I'll give you one example, our underlying infrastructure becomes more and more efficient, even under the best example actually is under Fusion. As we move, as we've moved to OCI, we are also moving to Autonomous Database Serverless, which again gives us added capacity. So we're constantly, constantly becoming more efficient. Our original landing was 12 racks. We're moving to 10 racks to have all the services. We're just continuing to sort of miniaturize our capabilities and it's giving us enormous efficiencies and cost savings. So staying the same as this year, again, if it just becomes overwhelming, it may go up higher, but I think we've got it very much in hand. We've laid out a lot this past year and I think if we stay where we're at, we're going to be able to fit a lot more workloads within that envelope, straightforwardly. Kirk Materne : Great, thanks and congrats on the order. Safra Catz : Thank you. Ken Bond : Thank you, Safra. Thank you, Kirk. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us on the call today and with that, I'll turn the call back to Lisa for closing. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's presentation.

And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. As you know, 22 years ago today was a traumatic day for our country. Like many of you, it feels like yesterday when the country lost nearly 3,000 souls. And we at Oracle, we lost 11 employees. I remember exactly where I was when the tragedy unfolded, and it is still so hard speaking about it even all these years later. Today, we honor and remember each one of the victims and heroes and we hope that their memories are a blessing to all of us. Now before I go to our Q1 numbers, I thought it would help to start with some of the things that are going on at Oracle that you'll be hearing about over the next couple of weeks. Next week, we have Oracle CloudWorld, which will showcase the latest innovations, including AI on OCI, the progress of Oracle Autonomous Database, our multi-cloud strategy, the use of Oracle Analytics throughout our portfolio to drive better decision-making and the use of generative AI to differentiate Fusion, NetSuite and our industry application. Now, CloudWorld is our marquee event each year where current and prospective customers take time out of their busy calendars to join us in person and share their experiences. We know that there are no better spokespeople for our products and services than our existing customers. Our innovation results directly from our development teams interacting with customers to anticipate and build the next generation of products and services. Some of the customers you will hear from next week include NVIDIA, Uber, Ascension Health, Cohere and many, many, many, many more. You'll also hear from our expanding set of strategic partners that are driving the Oracle ecosystem and this includes Amdocs, VMware, Microsoft. Overall, it's remarkable the interest we are getting from the ISV community to work with Oracle. There are a lot of discussions going on and you will see more announcements shortly. From a financial standpoint, we see this customer and partner ecosystem as a leading indicator of our income statement. I've been talking with you about our revenue acceleration for some time now. In Q1, our remaining performance obligations or RPO, climbed to nearly $65 billion, with the portion excluding Cerner, up 11%. We have now signed several deals for OCI greater than $1 billion in total value. In the first week of Q2, we booked an additional $1.5 billion in business, which isn't even included in the Q1 numbers. Approximately 49% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. My point here is that customer momentum is continuing to build. This momentum is turning into bookings and that gives me the confidence that our annual revenue growth will continue to accelerate moving forward. Now to the Q1 results, which I remind you, I am announcing on day 11, only because day eight when we were ready was a Friday and I know none of you like that. So this quarter we saw a modest currency tailwind, but as always, I'll discuss our financials using constant currency growth rates. Clearly, Q1 was another great quarter with total revenue at the midpoint of guidance and earnings per share $0.02 above the high-end of guidance and our cloud growth was 29%. Total cloud revenue, SaaS and IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4 billion, up 29%. Now including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 29% also at $4.6 billion, and with our IaaS revenue at $1.5 billion, up 64%, and SaaS revenue of $3.1 billion, up 17%. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.5 billion, up 12%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, Autonomous Database and our Gen2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes product support, were $4.5 billion, up 11%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of $6.9 billion, and they grew 20%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $5.1 billion, up 14%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 64%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen2 Infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 72% with an annualized revenue of $5.6 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 91%. Exadata Cloud Services revenue was up 46% and Autonomous Database was up 42%. Database subscription services, which includes license support, were up 6% highlighted by cloud database services which were up 44%. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud of database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and Gen2 OCI cloud services. Software license revenues were $0.8 billion, down 11% following an amazing Q1 last year of 19% growth, which made it a tough compare this year. So in all, total revenue for the quarter were $12.4 billion, up 8% including Cerner, up 9% excluding Cerner. Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 78%, with IaaS gross margins improving substantially from last year. And while we\u2019ve continued to build data center capacity, we've also seen our IaaS margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. We monitor our expenses very carefully to ensure our gross margin percentages expand as we scale up. To this point, gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 9% in Q1. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion, up 12% from last year. The operating margin was 41%, up from 39% last year. As we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also grow the operating margin percentage. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.19 in US dollars, up 16% in USD, up 14% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was $0.86 in USD. At quarter end, we had nearly $12.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $11.1 billion, up 5%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was up 9% to $7 billion, while free cash flow was up 21% to $5.7 billion and I expect that we will see a very good result in our free cash flow for the rest of the year. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17.7 billion, up 68% and free cash flow was $9.5 billion, up 76%. Capital expenditures were $8.3 billion over the last four quarters and we are clearly beginning to see the cash flow benefits stemming from our cloud transformation. CapEx was $1.3 billion in Q1 as we continue to build capacity for bookings and our customers\u2019 growing needs. Given the demand we have and see in the pipeline, I expect that fiscal year 2024 CapEx will be similar to this past year's CapEx. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends, which is why our gross margins are up in our cloud business. We now have 64 cloud regions live with 44 public cloud regions around the world and another six being built, 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Microsoft Azure. We also have nine dedicated regions live and 11 more planned, nine security regions and 12 EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And of course, we have many, many clouded customer implementations. The cost advantages, sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continue to make us so compelling in the marketplace to customers. As we've said many, many times before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividends. This quarter we repurchased 1.3 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $3.9 billion over the last 12 months and the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now before I dive into Q2 guidance, I'd like to share some thoughts on what I see longer-term. Per my earlier remarks, we have a great line of sight into the trajectory of the business, given the bookings momentum. We are extremely confident about our revenue acceleration for the year, even though in any quarter there may be small fluctuations. Because we have far more demand than we can supply, our biggest challenge is building data centers as quickly as possible. In addition, we are in an accelerated transition of Cerner to the cloud. This transition is resulting in some near-term headwinds to the Cerner growth rate as customers move from license purchases, which are recognized upfront to cloud subscriptions, which are recognized ratably. Again, excluding Cerner, I remain committed to accelerating our total revenue growth rate this fiscal year as well as maintaining our current high cloud growth rate for the year. And as you will hear at our financial analyst meeting next week, we remain firmly committed to our fiscal '26 financial goals. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q2, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a 2% positive effect on total revenue and a $0.03 positive effect on EPS in Q2. However, the actual currency impact may be different. Here we go, total revenues including Cerner are expected to grow from 3% to 5% in constant currency, and are expected to grow 5% to 7% in USD at today's rates. Total revenue excluding Cerner are expected to grow from 6% to 8% in constant currency and expected to grow 8% to 10% in USD. Total cloud revenue excluding Cerner, again, I give you these numbers, so you can see the mainline business, is expected to grow from 27% to 29% in constant currency and is expected to grow 29% to 31% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 5% to 9%, and be between $1.27 and $1.31 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 7% to 11% and be between $1.30 and $1.34 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. So, is generative AI is the most important new computer technology ever? Maybe, and we are about to find out. Self-driving cars, computer-designed antiviral drugs, voice user interfaces. Generative AI is changing the automobile industry, the pharmaceutical industry, how people communicate with their computers. Generative AI is changing everything. As of today, AI development companies have signed contracts to purchase more than $4 billion of AI training capacity in Oracle's Generation 2 cloud. That's twice as much AI training as we had booked at the end of the last Q4. I'm also very pleased to announce that Exai has signed the contract to do training in Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud. The largest AI technology companies and the leading AI startups continue to expand their business with Oracle for one simple reason, Oracle's RDMA interconnected NVIDIA superclusters train AI models at twice the speed and much less than half the cost of other clouds but growth in our AI cloud infrastructure business is not the only exciting news we have to report at Oracle. Our cloud applications business is doing quite well and it's about to get even better. In the current quarter we expect our Cerner Health business to be awarded two large new contracts with a total value of over $1 billion. And I\u2019m now able to announce that all nine utility companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway are in the process of replacing all their existing ERP systems, and standardizing on Oracle's Fusion Cloud applications. Let me conclude with a few words about our database business and our upcoming announcement with Microsoft later this week. We will be substantially expanding our existing multi-cloud partnership with Microsoft by making it easier for Microsoft Azure customers to buy and use the latest Oracle cloud database technology in combination with Microsoft Azure cloud services. Satya and I will discuss the details of our expanding partnership at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond on the 14th. Please tune in, and thank you. Back to you, Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Larry. And maybe, Ken, we could start taking questions at this point. Ken Bond : Absolutely. Before we do that, Lisa, just one quick clarification, that we currently have two EU sovereign regions live with more to come. Lisa, please poll the audience for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks very much, and congrats on the strong start to the year. Larry, I think it's fair to say that you understand the laws of data gravity better than anyone and you have monetized this fundamental concept as well as anyone over the years. And I recently heard someone say, we are moving from a world of data gravity to one of AI gravity, and I'm not sure exactly what that means, or they even knew what that meant, but with AI and other use cases attracting more and more data to central clouds, with many vendors preaching data sharing instead of what used to be making multiple copies of things and keeping them synchronized, does AI plus cloud in any way break what we've always understood about data gravity? And what does that mean for Oracle? Larry Ellison : Well, you can't build any of these AI models without enormous amounts of training data. So if anything, what AI -- generative AI has shown that the big issue about training one of these models is just getting that -- this vast amount of data ingested into your GPU supercluster. It is a huge data problem in the sense you need so much data. To train -- OpenAI to train ChatGPT 3.5, they read the entire public Internet, they read all of Wikipedia, they read everything, they ingested everything. And to specialize, and you take something like ChatGPT 4.0 and you want to specialize it, you need specialized training data from electronic health records to help doctors diagnose and treat cancer, let's say, and we are partners. Imaging for example, that is ingesting huge amounts of image data to train their AI models. We have our own -- another partner of ours in AI, ingesting huge amounts of electronic health records to train their models. AI doesn't work without getting access to and ingesting enormous amounts of data. So in terms of a shift away from data or a change in gravities at AI, AI is utterly dependent upon vast amounts of training data. Trillions of elements went into building ChatGPT 3.5, multiple times that for ChatGPT 4.0 because you have to deal with all the image data and ingest all of that to train image recognition. So we think this is very good for our database business, and Oracle's new Vector database will contain highly-specialized training data like electronic health records, while keeping that data anonymized and private, yet still training the specialized models that can help doctors improve their diagnostic capability and their treatment prescriptions for cancer and heart disease and all sorts of other diseases. So we think it's a boon to our business, and we are now getting into the deepwater of the information age. Nothing has changed about that. The demands on data are getting stronger and more important. Brad Zelnick : Thank you so much for your perspective, Larry. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Mark Murphy : Thank you so much. So Larry, companies are starting to understand that OCI has a very fundamentally different architecture than anything else out there in the market because of the non-blocking, low-latency network design. I'm wondering, if you think it's possible to actually pull further ahead through some of your other initiatives. For instance, the Azure Interconnect, it sounds like you're going to expand that. Having more regions, running a stronger database, providing greater isolation, just wondering if you think there is a possibility of extending the lead? Larry Ellison : Well, again, our -- we have -- we are on our second generation of data center, and our second generation of cloud. Now a lot of people notice that we were a little bit late to the party, but that's because we moved from a generation which we were not very happy with to a second generation, which we think solved a lot of problems the other cloud companies have not yet solved. So the non-blocking ultrafast RDMA network is not only useful for AI -- training AI models, it's useful for almost everything. It's certainly useful for building a much faster database. It's useful for, in terms of the automation level we have in our data centers, our data centers are 100% automated. They configure themselves. They run themselves. We don't have a lot of labor. Now that saves us a huge amount of money, a lot of labor cost is saved. But the biggest advantage is, if you don't have human beings involved, you don't have human labor, you don't have human errors. You don't have mistakes. You can ensure security. Most security problems are caused by people that make mistakes or people that engage in mischief. We don't have that in our data center. That's another huge advantage. Our data centers are -- because they're all identical, the only way we could automate them was to make them all the same and they vary only by scale. There are big ones and small ones, but they are identical, they all have the same hardware pieces and the same software pieces. They all have the same automation and that automation allows us to put these data centers in very small countries. We expect to have many, many more data centers than any other cloud provider. But we also put those data centers at customers. Nomura Research, NRI, which resells Oracle Cloud capacity in Japan has two dedicated regions and are building two more. They run the Tokyo Stock Exchange. I don't know of any clouds that are running stock exchanges other than ours. And, again, it's because of the extreme reliability and security that we get with all of the automation that's included with our data center. So we have cost advantages, we have performance advantages, we have security advantages. And that's why we are growing much faster than any of the other hyperscalers. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays Capital. Raimo Lenschow : Thank you. Larry, you mentioned Berkshire, and them moving over to Fusion. I just wanted to talk in -- more bigger picture on the back-office systems, like, in the olden days, back-office, you wouldn't touch, in kind of tougher times because they are big complex project. But you guys are still kind of growing this nicely with over 20%. Like what are you seeing there? And do you see a change in pipelines, change in customer interest of doing something there? Thank you. Larry Ellison : Yeah, well the back-office in the cloud is very different than the back-office on-premise. And we have a big advantage that we are by far and away the biggest. I don't know, 95% of the cloud ERP market in terms of actual live customers using it. And we have an important partnership with JPMorgan Chase and we'll be announcing some more partnerships in the financial community at the upcoming CloudWorld, where we automate a lot of e-commerce, B2B e-commerce right in the cloud. So what is B2B big e-commerce between two Oracle Cloud customers, two Oracle ERP cloud customers? It's one Oracle procurement system talking to another Oracle order management system and financing the transaction through their bank. We automate that entirely in the cloud. If your bank is JPMorgan Chase, they originate the loan right along with your purchase. It\u2019s e-commerce for B2B, with banking and shipping and insurance, all included and rolled together. No one -- we've done a great job as an industry, automating e-commerce for B2C. I mean, Amazon, Walmart, others have done a brilliant job in that. We've been doing that for a long time. We have not got the equivalent in B2B commerce because B2B transactions are much more complex. In the cloud, you can get all the parties together, the shippers, the insurance company, the manufacturers, the purchasers and we can automate that entirely within the Oracle Cloud. One ERP system talking to another, talking to their bank, talking to their insurance, doing a loan origination, getting it shipped and insured. So we make doing business much easier for our customers when they move to a modern cloud ERP system versus the on-premise ERP system that came before. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Mark Moerdler : Thank you so much for taking my question. The top-of-mind questions I'm getting are related to AI in general as you'd expect and were specifically as it relates to Oracle, what the impact of AI will be on OCI Gen 2. Two related parts to the question. The first is the profitability of AI supercomputers and whether if some clients try to tell me, it's low-calorie, empty-calorie revenue or can you maintain margins as this business grows? And the second part is about the Oracle ecosystem, and is it strong enough that its workloads transition from model training to inferencing and grounding, could AI compute create a revenue air pocket or [is the ecosystem] (ph) strong enough so you don't have that. Thank you. Larry Ellison : Well, if you're -- you're constantly training these models. Keep in mind, you have to bring in new data if you're in -- obviously in the healthcare field, in the legal field, new cases are being judged, new researches being published all the time and for your AI models to be relevant they have to be up-to-date. So it's not that you train and then do nothing but inferencing thereafter. So you're training and your inferencing sit right next to each other. As long as we can do this stuff twice as fast as everybody else that's on the -- not just on the training side, that's also on the inferencing side, then we are going to be half the cost or better. So we think we are going to be very, very competitive across the board whether it's training or an inferencing. So we don't -- so we are pretty confident that we've got a cost-performance advantages. Again, if you run twice as fast in the cloud, you cost half as much because you pay by the hour. So the performance advantage is really an enormous cost advantage for us. We don't see that going away anytime soon, and it applies to inferencing as well as well as training. Now as far as GPUs, are GPUs a low-margin business? Not for a 100% automated cloud with very, very low cost. We think, in some cases, our prices for GPU training, which are very profitable by the way, for us, but are often lower -- our prices are lower than the cost of other hyperscalers doing the training. Mark Moerdler : Thank you. That's very helpful. Operator : We'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss : Excellent. Thank you, guys, and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to drill in on Cerner, basically, the one-year anniversary of that acquisition. And maybe from Larry, get an update on where we are with modernizing that solution and modernizing that product? And basically then whether Cerner has kind of lived up to your expectations thus far? And then maybe for Safra. If we could dig into the expense synergy side of the equation, you guys have done a great job increasing margins on a year-on-year basis in this quarter, how much is left to go within Cerner and getting that margin profile to match the broader Oracle margin profile? Larry Ellison : Okay. I'll talk about the progress on taking the existing Millennium\u2019s Cerner software and moving it to new Millennium. We basically rewriting that software piece at a time by the way. It's not going to be a big rip and replace it all. There's a two-phase process with Cerner. The first thing is to get the lift and shift and get the existing system hardened, which we've done and moving the customers to the cloud, which we are in the process of moving everybody to the cloud. That will give them better performance, better security and new features will then start showing up with the system. And so there's a two-phase shift to the cloud, we are well on our way. The next is replace feature after feature after feature of the older Cerner system with a new Cerner system, new Millennium, which we are not coding in Java, like we usually do. The new Cerner system is being generated, as you know, generative AI generates code. We have an application generator called APEX. And we are not writing code for the new Cerner. We are generating that code in APEX, and it's going extremely well. Again, one of the great things about code generators is they don't make mistakes. Well, either they make the same mistake over and over again or once you fix the mistake, you fix it everywhere. So the code gen -- we are using a code generator, and to write the new features in Cerner and it's coming along very, very nicely. Also on the business side of things, we -- again, we think that Cerner business is going to get stronger and stronger again, Safra made the point. The old Cerner business you'd sell licenses. You sell a big contract and you get a big chunk of revenue in that quarter. Our new business model, as you know is cloud, so we get a big Cerner award and we get that money now over time rather than all upfront. So that's, if you will, a bit of a revenue headwind, but the Cerner business is doing extraordinarily well. Safra Catz : And on the expense side, we still have a ways to go, but I think it will become more obvious to you next quarter the changes we've made, as they play out through the income statement more clearly. And so you'll have a better comparison, Q2 to Q2, which will be a full non-deal quarter for you to look at. But you know us, we are always looking to save as much as we can, and to spend as little while still really transforming Cerner into a modern system in its entirety. Larry Ellison : Let me let me just reinforce what Safra just said. We love to save money. One of the things we did with our data centers is we automated them. We -- what we saved labor costs and we saved -- we have better security and better reliability because we eliminated human error. With Cerner, the rewrite of Cerner, it's not armies of programmers that are going be rewriting this. We are generating the new Millennium software using APEX. And that's also going to save us a lot of human labor and generate higher quality code and higher quality user interfaces and better security all at once. Keith Weiss : Helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : We will take our last question from John DiFucci with Guggenheim. John DiFucci : Thank you. My question is for Safra, I think. Safra, if the organic constant currency cloud growth was in line with what you did last year and what you want to do for this year at 29%, while license, though it was a difficult comp it was a bit weaker, at least than the street was expecting. And I also -- we also realize that cloud revenue for the same amount of business booked will be a lot less than the equivalent license revenue in the quarter. But does this mean we are seeing a move with stronger momentum to the cloud this quarter than we have seen? And I guess just to clarify, given your guidance for the second quarter, you said you're maintaining your longer-term. Safra, I just wanted to clarify. Are you maintaining your constant currency organic cloud guidance for the year? Safra Catz : Yes, okay. Let me start with yes. And as I want to remind you of course, I want to remind you 29% of bigger numbers is more. Okay. So, you know, last year we were smaller, and this year we continue to plan on doing the 29% may be better, all of it is dependent on us getting our data centers filled up and built out as fast as possible. The level of demand we have is stunning. Stunning is the only word I can use, and I don't want to get over overly exuberant simply because we do have to continue to build out our systems, et cetera. And so yes, a very strong momentum to the cloud, and again with the focus we told you. We are bringing our customers to the cloud and that's going to have us focusing on growing that and stronger momentum there. John DiFucci : Okay, great. Very clear. Yes and yes. Got it. Thanks. Ken Bond : All right. Thank you, John, and thank you, Lisa. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Lisa for closing. Operator : And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Oracle Corporation's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Ken Bond, you may begin your conference. Ken Bond : Thank you, Emma. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from our Investor Relations website. On the call today, our Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison, and Chief Executive Officer, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another great quarter. When you look at the top of our financial results table, a few things are very clear. The largest number, cloud services and license support, is now 74% of the revenue, and it's recurring revenue, and it's the one growing by $1 billion this quarter. The smaller numbers, which are not recurring, now account for only 26%. This is exactly what we told you would happen, and it's happening. And as this continues, total revenue growth will accelerate every year. To that point, OCI is now one of the clear drivers of our acceleration. Imagine just three years ago, OCI was rarely, if ever, mentioned as a viable hyperscale alternative. Of course, we knew what we had built and we kept talking about it and we knew it was only a matter of time. And now, more industry analysts are catching on to what customers are choosing. For example, just last week, we were recognized as a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services. Our financial results reflect that customers have figured out that by moving to OCI, they really can get more while paying less. On top of that, we are now the default choice for AI workloads given our unique differentiation and price performance capabilities. Why specifically are they coming to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure? Well, it's a combination of several things. Creating the second generation cloud enabled us to build a much better, more scalable, and more efficient cloud. We understood the limitations of the first generation and engineered very differently. Second, we know what it takes to run at enterprise scale, performance and security better than, I say, anyone else. Our 45-year history as the leading enterprise software company gives us unique knowledge of what exactly is required to run mission critical systems. Third, we recognize that customers need deployment flexibility rather than just offer public cloud services like our competitors, we are the only vendor which also offers dedicated cloud to customer, dedicated region, sovereign clouds, and Alloy, our partner clouds. And then finally, our belief in the importance of multi-cloud offerings will be industry changing as these collaborations roll out. With all this success and exploding demand, we are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out. Now, to the Q2 results. With total revenue at the midpoint of my constant currency guidance and the EPS at the high end of guidance. Now, as a reminder, currency was 1 point less helpful than when we gave guidance three months ago. Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS plus IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4.1 billion, up 25%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $4.8 billion, with IaaS revenue at $1.6 billion, up 50%, and SaaS revenue of $3.2 billion, up 14%. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 11%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database, and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes support, were $4.5 billion, up 9%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $7.1 billion and we're up 19%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $5.2 billion, up 12%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 50%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen 2 infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 55%, with an annualized revenue of $6 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 71%. Database subscription revenues, which includes database license support, were up 4%, highlighted by Exadata database cloud services revenue, which was up 40%, and autonomous database up 26%. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and Gen 2 OCI. Software license revenues were $1.2 billion, down 19% in a tough comparison to last year where it was up 23%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.9 billion, up 4% including Cerner, actually up 6% excluding Cerner. Now shifting to margins, the gross margin for cloud services and license support was 78%. This is because of the mix between support and cloud in which cloud is growing much faster than support. Support and SaaS margins are consistent with last year, while IaaS gross margins improved substantially. While we continue to build data center capacity, gross margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. We monitor these expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. To this point, the gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 10% in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.5 billion, up 7% from last year. The operating margin was 43%, up from 41% last year. As we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also expand the operating margin. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.34 in USD, up 11% in USD, and up 9% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.89 in USD. At quarter-end, we had nearly $8.7 billion in cash and marketable securities and the short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.9 billion, up 1%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17 billion, up 13%. And free cash flow was $10.1 billion, up 20%. Capital expenditures were $6.9 billion over the same period as we continue to seek cash flow benefit from our cloud transformation. Our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, is now over $65 billion, with the portion excluding Cerner up 11% in constant currency. We continue to sign large deals with many in the pipeline. Approximately 48% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.1 billion in Q2 as we continue to build capacity for bookings and our customers' growing needs. Given the enormity of our pipeline and backlog, I expect CapEx will be somewhere around $8 billion this fiscal year, meaning our second half CapEx will be considerably higher as we bring online more capacity. To that point, we now have 66 customer facing cloud regions live, with 45 public cloud regions around the world and another six being built. 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Azure and starting next year, customers will be able to run Oracle Database at Azure on OCI inside Azure. We also have 10 dedicated regions live and 13 more planned, nine national security regions, and two EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And finally, we have seven Alloy cloud regions planned where Oracle partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside the Oracle Cloud. And of course, we also have so many, many, many clouded customer installations. The sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be advantages for us in the marketplace. Finally, as we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $450 million. And in addition, we paid out dividends of $4.1 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now let me turn to my guidance for Q3, which I will review, as always, on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have little effect on total revenue and EPS. However, the actual currency impact may be different. So because of that, all the numbers I give you are the same for constant currency and USD. Total revenues, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 6% to 8%. Total revenues excluding Cerner are expected to grow from 8% to 10%. Total cloud revenue excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 26% to 28%. Non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to grow between 10% and 14% and be between $1.35 and $1.39. My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. Finally, I remain firmly committed to our fiscal \u201826 financial goals for revenue, operating margins, and EPS growth. And with that, let me turn it over to Larry for his comments. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. The demand for Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure and Generative AI is consistently increasing quarter after quarter. Oracle's total remaining performance obligations, or RPO, has now reached $65 billion, slightly more than our annual revenue. In response to this sharply increasing demand, Oracle is in the process of expanding 66 of our existing cloud data centers and building 100 new cloud data centers. We have to build 100 additional cloud data centers because there are billions of dollars more in contracted demand than we currently can supply. Cloud Infrastructure demand is huge and growing at an unprecedented rate. In the next few weeks, we expect to sign a couple more billion dollar Cloud Infrastructure contracts. Gartner recently named Oracle OCI as a leader in cloud platform and infrastructure services. The demand for Cloud Infrastructure services and new Oracle cloud data centers is broad-based, driven not only by Generative AI customers, but also by nation states buying sovereign Oracle cloud data centers, plus large banks, telecommunications companies, and industrial companies, buying dedicated cloud data centers, dedicated Oracle cloud data centers, and perhaps most interestingly, demand from other hyperscalers and other cloud service providers, co-locating and connecting their clouds with Oracle cloud data centers. Customers don't want clouds to be walled gardens. In the next few months, we will turn on 20 new Oracle cloud data centers, co-located with and connected to Microsoft Azure as a part of our joint multi-cloud initiative. These 20 new multi-cloud data centers will house over 2,000 full racks of Exadata database machines designed to meet pent-up demand for the Oracle cloud database. We're able to build new data centers rapidly and operate them inexpensively because all of our data centers are architecturally identical, highly automated, with an identical high-performance RDMA network, autonomous services, and applications. Oracle cloud data centers vary only by scale. Again, several nation states have ordered multiple sovereign data centers to be built within their country so that they can move their government, healthcare, and commercial workloads to the Oracle cloud. These new countries include Japan, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and others. Some of the world's largest banks, telecommunications and industrial companies, have also contracted with us to build Oracle cloud data centers dedicated entirely to them so that they can migrate their workloads to an Oracle cloud data center. These companies include Nomura, Vodafone, Telecom Italia Mobile, Saudi Telecom, a huge Korean conglomerate, and a huge US defense contractor. These are but a few examples that demonstrate the diversity of the growing demand for Oracle's highly differentiated Gen2 cloud infrastructure and data center technology. Back to you, Ken. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Emma, if we could please poll the audience for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Your line is open. Ben Reitzes : Hey, thanks a lot. It's great to be speaking with you this afternoon. Do you mind going through your thoughts on the OCI trajectory from here and how you feel backlog will play out into revenue? And perhaps you can comment also, is the acceleration potential that you guided for due to getting more GPUs and more AI backlog moving into revenue? Thanks a lot. Safra Catz : Larry, you want me to take it or you? Larry Ellison : No, either one, Safra, you tell me. Safra Catz : How about I get started? So, where do we expect OCI to go from here? Frankly, the only limiting factor is our ability to get the data centers handed over and filled up fast enough. This quarter alone, we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars that we would have been able to recognize if our capacity was available. So the reality is, as we roll out and we've got just so many moving parts as you can hear from us, we have a lot of capacity coming online. And as you can see in my CapEx guidance, we expect OCI to just grow astronomically, frankly. It is the ideal infrastructure for so much use. And of course, also as more GPUs become available, and we can put those in, we have just a really unlimited amount of demand. Larry, I don't know if you want to say anything else? Larry Ellison : Yeah, well again, in the next few weeks, I mentioned we're going to sign two additional contracts right around $1 billion each. I mean the backlog is growing astronomically. I think it's the word Safra used and that's accurate. There's no reason why -- OCI grew 50% this quarter. I think OCI is going to get much bigger and actually the growth rate will be above 50%, I believe, as these data centers come online. We think we can build a lot of these data centers very quickly. By the way, again, I emphasize it's not just GenAI demand. There is huge pent-up cloud database demand. There is huge demand overseas for sovereign clouds, where people -- governments haven't been able to move their workloads. A lot of those are government Oracle workloads. They haven't been able to move their workloads to the cloud. I mean, there are literally, I don't know, five, six, seven large companies in Japan that will be building at least two data centers, Oracle data centers each. So again, the demand is extraordinary. We can build the data centers relatively fast. And I expect the OCI growth rate to be over 50% for a few years. Safra Catz : Yes, we're not demand limited in any way right now. Ben Reitzes : Thanks a lot, Safra and Larry. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim. Your line is open. John DiFucci : Thank you. Thanks for the question. Thanks Larry for the -- and Safra, for those comments on the future OCI growth. So since Ben asked about the growth, and maybe I'll take a step back on the other part of all this, and that's the profit side. Per Larry's comments, you're building out a lot of capacity and Safra's comments agree with that, with the CapEx growth. But Clay's also spoken about the time it takes to build out those AI super clusters and I know that's not the only AI workloads you're doing, but that sounds like some pretty exciting stuff. And it takes time before you get revenue. I realize you're also seeing ramp up of those what I'll call core OCI deals like Uber, and you actually get revenue from them over time. But how should we think about cloud gross margins over time in this context with both those things? There's a lot happening here. Safra Catz : Yes, and I'm really glad you asked. I'm really glad you asked because one of the lines that we show you, even though I give you more detail, is I show you a number that is a mix of cloud and support. And obviously, support is extremely profitable because of the structure of the way it works, and because we are at such a large scale. But the reality is that our cloud businesses are also very profitable. Our SaaS cloud business is very profitable, and our IaaS, our OCI business, is improving profitability as it grows. And so the target gross margins for it are much higher than I think you expect because you're probably comparing it to some of the more pure play cloud folks who somehow don't end up making as much money in all of this. As we grow, our gross margin percentage goes up. So yes, we make a lot of investments and we'll be making a lot of investments, but our profitability continues to go up. Because once the day -- the worst moment is at the moment where the data center is full of computers and you don't have any tenants that first day, but that's not actually how we work. Yes, we have the floor space, but we grow in pieces. Unlike some of the others that they have to do a full out build out and put everything there before they have a penny of revenue, that's not how we work. We -- and more and more of our -- so we start small and build up and that allows us to match our spending with the revenues much better. And that's because we have that engineering deployment flexibility that the first generation folks don't have. I don't know, Larry, if you want to add anything to that? Larry Ellison : Yeah I do. I think one thing is very important. We're much more highly automated than the older data centers. So to give you an idea, Oracle Cloud -- to run Oracle Cloud we have to keep track of all of our customers, how much they're using. We have to have a variety of databases and applications that run the cloud. Those databases are all the autonomous database. We have no labor associated with those databases. It's all completely automated. Our installations, when we bring up a new cloud, you plug it in and the process of bringing it up is largely automated. There aren't lots and lots of people in the data center to bring it up, and there certainly aren't lots and lots of people in the data center to run it every day. We focus on autonomous services. Our Linux, our operating system is fully autonomous. There's no labor associated with running it. There's certainly labor associated with building the software, but not running the software, it doesn't cost us more to run 100 data centers than it costs us to run 10 in terms of DBAs or people running Oracle Autonomous Linux. So we have a very different model than our old data centers or our competitors' data centers. We can run these things, we can bring them up relatively quickly and we can run them very inexpensively and efficiently. One last thing about being autonomous, the fact that it's automated, there are far fewer errors and there are far fewer security vulnerabilities because the system is completely self-driving. John DiFucci : If I might, and Safra, go back to something you said, is it fair to assume that OCI gross margins have consistently grown over time, quarter to quarter? Safra Catz : Yes. John DiFucci : Okay, and then, and then, and then\u2026 Larry Ellison : Grown a lot. John DiFucci : Grown a lot, okay. And then finally, the -- what Larry just said about the database, Safra, I've heard you say at times, we're at the beginning of the beginning of the transition of the database to cloud. So I know you have database in cloud today but that migration of the on-prem that's still to come pretty much. Safra Catz : Yeah, it is really still to come. It is -- we're talking about tens of billions of dollars when it comes over. So it's starting to come, but we haven't been in the place to receive it all en masse, and customers have to get comfortable with it. And also, multi-cloud has to really roll out, and that's going to be another piece of it. So customers are going to have so many excellent choices. They can go in the public cloud, they can go in OCI, they can go in their cloud to customer. They can go in OCI at Azure is one possibility. So there's just -- it is the absolute beginning. Because remember, the Oracle database is not a toy. It's a mission critical system. If it just disappeared at companies, the whole planet would come to a standstill. And so this is coming and it's just the beginning. So you see what's going on with OCI, no one believed us this was possible, now here we're at, and then right behind it is going to come the database, and that's going to be something. John DiFucci : And per Larry's comments, and I'll stop talking, but for Larry's comments, the database gross margins, given the autonomous nature of it, we should expect that to be different than the OCI core Infrastructure as a Service gross margin? Safra Catz : Yes, absolutely. Database\u2026 Larry Ellison : I don't want to go into detail, but the autonomous database is, one, autonomous, there's no labor associated with it, but it's also the only database that's fully elastic. In other words, if you're not using it, no one's using it. I mean, there are no cores, there's no cores occupied. It goes back into the pool. So if you as a customer aren't doing something with the database, literally no cores are occupied. It's very different than an Amazon database where you allocate. I always need 64 cores or 64 processors to run my database and that's seven days a week, 24 hours a day. We only charge you for what you use when you're using it. We only consume what you use when you're using it. Otherwise, it goes to other customers. It's totally different. That allows us to have dramatically higher gross margins. John DiFucci : Thank you very much. Sorry for the several part question, but thank you. Safra Catz : Our pleasure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Your line is open. Mark Moerdler : Thank you very much for taking the question. I really appreciate it. I want to change gears a little bit and turn to Cerner, which people don't really focus on that much. Cerner license revenue has been down, likely in preparation for customer shifting to SaaS, but Oracle does not yet have a full multi-tenant scalable Cerner SaaS solution. So what I'd like to ask is couple parts. How should we think about the timing of, one, the availability of -- yep. Larry Ellison : That's not correct. So Cerner has several pieces. Mark Moerdler : Okay. Larry Ellison : And I believe about half the customers will be moved, half of the Millennium customers. You can think that Cerner is just automating hospitals like Epic. And that's a product called Millennium. And about half of those customers will move to OCI by February. Half of all existing customers will be in Oracle OCI. But we've also developed something that began at Cerner. And we have finished now, completely rewritten it. Well, we're in the process. We will finish next calendar year. But it is largely rewritten and available right now, something called our Health and Data Intelligence platform and it was known as Cerner HealtheIntent. And that's for public health. That's for population scale, public health management. Again, it's sold to US states. It's sold to Australian states. It's sold to European countries. It's for managing population health. Remember during COVID when we didn't know, New York thought they were living out of hospital rooms, but they really weren't, but no one knew, because no one kept track of our inventory of hospital rooms. There was no national view. No one knew how many people contracted COVID yesterday. We didn't have that national view. We have that national view. It is fully staffed and it is available right now. So some of the pieces, some of the Cerner pieces are coming online, other Cerner pieces are moving more gradually, but they're all going into OCI. And they're all very quickly moving from a license basis to a subscription basis. Mark Moerdler : So that's very helpful. So that starts to answer the question I was asking was how should we think about the timing of the transition, Millennium you're saying is going to be an OCI. Is that going to be a fully SaaS version? When will the rest of the solutions be fully SaaS? And how should we think about the revenue lift as the license and maintenance moves to the cloud -- to SaaS? Larry Ellison : So it will be fully an OCI and SaaS, but it will not be the new, we are rewriting, we are replacing Millennium a piece at a time, not a big lift and shift, but we are upgrading and modernizing Millennium a piece at a time, and different pieces will be available starting next year. And so, Cerner customers will be getting new features and capabilities as a part of Millennium as Millennium moves to OCI. And again, half the customers will be in OCI by February. So we're making a lot of progress. At the same time, we're adding a lot of new products to Millennium, like the public health products. But we're also adding much of new products for pharmaceutical companies. We're adding additional products for hospitals to keep track of their inventory, for hospitals to manage their workforce, really what we think of is our health division in Oracle has products for the entire healthcare ecosystems. Payers, including governments, including insurance companies, providers, including ambulatory clinics and hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, research companies, and public health departments in national governments and state governments. So we have products for the entire healthcare ecosystem, which is a much larger footprint than Cerner ever had. So we are going after a much larger market than Cerner was. So we expect Cerner to be a growth story. I guess that's what I'm getting at. Mark Moerdler : Right, that's where I'm going with the question. Safra Catz : Yeah, so let me just tell you, I think for the year, for the full fiscal year, Cerner will be sort of negative 1 to 2 points. But that will be it. It'll end this fiscal year. And from then on, it will be a growth story. So it will no longer be a drag on Oracle growth. Okay? Mark Moerdler : Perfect. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. It was very helpful. Safra Catz : Great. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Your line is open. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks for taking my question, Larry and Safra. Many mission critical workloads still run on Oracle database, and you have a sticky [Indiscernible] team. And we expect Oracle will start migrating those database workloads to OCI, which will bring 3x revenue uplift, which you call even the third leg of cloud growth. You also have now OCI inside Azure data center. So my question is, how does this being multi-cloud change your outlook for Oracle database? And what are you hearing from your database customer in terms of their comfort and preparedness to move their Oracle database to the cloud, either OCI or Azure? Safra Catz : Larry, why don't you start with this? Larry Ellison : Safra, can you go first? Safra Catz : No, yes, I do. You go. Larry Ellison : Okay, thanks. Our customers are very happy with the idea. Remember Oracle started as one of the first databases that ran everywhere. We ran on IBM mainframes. We ran on personal computers. We ran on digital equipment, if you remember them, mini computers, [broadly] (ph) and HP mini computers. We ran on every operating system on every computer. Now, in cloud, they're very happy to see that they can not only get the Oracle database at OCI, they can also get the identical capability from Microsoft. Microsoft, we are building data centers for Microsoft inside Azure. And Microsoft, it wasn't us that decided 2000 was the right number of Exadata machines to install in those 20 data centers. That was Microsoft. The demand is enormous. They want the same flex -- our customers want the same flexibility they've always had with Oracle. They want to use Oracle. They want to transition. But if they're using the Microsoft Cloud, they want to run the best and latest and greatest version of Oracle in the Microsoft Cloud. They'd want to do that in other clouds as well. Some of them, it's very important to have it in Japan, for example. It's very important for some of that data remaining in Japan. One of the things the Oracle database does is it runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange. And it does that in a dedicated data center run by Nomura Research, who supplies financial services and Oracle Cloud, Oracle Gen2 Cloud services to the Japanese market. There are a number of other partners in Japan that are going that same direction. So they used to -- in Japan, they used to buy the Oracle database from Nomura or they used to buy it from Fujitsu, or they bought it from Hitachi, or they bought it from NEC. They wanted that Oracle database. It is quite natural for all of those companies to build their own, have their own dedicated regions of OCI and sell to their and support their customers out of those regions. That's the flexibility we allow that's something that nobody else can do. We can build these regions for our partners. We can build these regions for sovereign states. We can build these regions for large companies that want to have -- that don't want their data commingled with anyone else's data. They want a public cloud, they want a full OCI, they want every part of OCI. But they don't want anyone else in their region. They want it to be theirs and theirs alone. We can do that. Nobody else can. Ken Bond : Next question, please. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you, Larry. Operator : Your next question comes from the line\u2026 Larry Ellison : Let me summarize. That means literally any way you want to get Oracle, any way you want to get Oracle, you'll be able to get it. It'll be a little bit back to the future. And we think the impact on demand -- on database demand, we're seeing it already. Let me close with 2,000 Exadata racks. That's a stunning number in terms of how many customers you can put on that. That's tens of thousands of customers you can put on that much hardware. Siti Panigrahi : Thanks, Larry, for the color. Larry Ellison : And that's Microsoft alone, okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Alex Zukin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask around some of the GenAI functionality inside of the applications portfolio, specifically Fusion and NetSuite. Any update or uptick that you're seeing or can share around some of your partnerships around Cohere? Maybe any early feedback from the field that informs incremental value capture, whether or not it's starting to resonate either in the form of increased migration activity, increased market share gains, or increased monetization opportunities around the application portfolio? Larry Ellison : Yeah, well, we're using it every place. Perhaps the most stunning is our new tele -- again, I mentioned it, and then it's Cerner that we're doing a lot of things that Cerner never did in what is now called Oracle Health. One of those things is our new telecommunication module summarizes a consultation between a doctor and a patient and writes the doctor's notes for the doctor automatically. In fact, for the first time we've done it, we now have our large language model generating the summary without a scribe that the doctor can edit in a couple of minutes. So, it's actually succeeded in doing one of the very hardest tasks we assigned it. And of course, we're using it in all in an -- everything from as simple as doing product descriptions or job descriptions, all of those, you've read about all of those, we've actually got those implemented and are delivering those to customers. But even in the most challenging areas, in drug design, we're having success with pharmaceutical companies. But actually writing the doctor's notes without a scribe has shocked a great many people and well, another area in terms of diagnosing cancer from biopsy, just biopsy images, being able to do that very, very quickly where the patient knows weeks sooner than they would otherwise, and then they get the news weeks sooner, from just the immediate AI processing of the biopsy image, they find out weeks sooner whether they have to go on chemotherapy or whether they're cancer-free. And we're doing that with an Israeli partner called Imaging. So, no, we're seeing a huge uptake of this technology, everything from complex healthcare and health science to more mundane tasks that you find throughout an enterprise, but still very important in making your employees in your company more efficient and more competitive. Alex Zukin : Got it. And then from a monetization standpoint, do you -- is this monetizing in a copilot way similar to Microsoft, or how do you envision ultimately seeing some of the incremental value capture inside of the model? Larry Ellison : Well, we think inside of our -- remember we're a little bit different than Microsoft. We have a lot more enterprise applications, for example, in healthcare. We run clinical trials. We run hospitals. We run ambulatory clinics. We run -- we have diagnostic databases for -- image processing databases, conventional blood testing databases, all of those. So our monetization is really at the highest end of the value chain, which is we actually supply the application with our partner that does cancer diagnosis, that does the doctor's notes, that does the doctor's orders, that actually automatically generates the prescriptions, that reminds the patient to take the subscription so you get compliance. Right now, without once again, I can't spend too much time on it. Right now, doctors don't know if patients have refilled their prescriptions. The doctors aren't notified and the patients aren't notified, reminding, we're doing all of that. We're doing a bunch of things with and that's the high end, that's the high value end of AI when you're preventing someone from being re-hospitalized, which has a huge cost in terms of human suffering and money. Alex Zukin : Okay. Thank you very much. Safra Catz : Now we have multiple ways, by the way, to monetize it, not only as part of our application, but also as part of our infrastructure. Because one of the unique capabilities we allow is for customers when they use our product to basically use their private data in some of these models for them to learn, but then to ultimately keep control of their data. And this is applicable in many, many different types of applications, and this is a service we provide in addition. So there's just a lot of\u2026 Larry Ellison : Safra is making a very good point in that we have our own applications in healthcare, but we have partners and other companies that come to us to use our AI to enrich their applications. And we keep their data private and allow them to enrich their applications. That company I mentioned earlier, Imaging, that's not our application that does the cancer diagnosis. That's an Israeli company that's doing that, but they're using our AI to develop their healthcare application. So, we monetize through imaging, enabling them to build their AI application. And we also build a lot of our own. So of course, Safra is right. It's a combination of the two. Safra Catz : Okay. Alex Zukin : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Safra Catz : Thank you. Operator : Your last question today comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much. Larry, it's taken Oracle several years to reach 66 cloud data centers. And you're now talking about plans to build 100 new ones, which frankly seems very ambitious. What is it that you're seeing that maybe we don't see? And then related, perhaps, Safra, if you could speak to the capital requirements and time frame for that, especially in light of CapEx this quarter, that was a bit less than we had expected? Thank you. Larry Ellison : Well, okay, how about Microsoft puts an order -- in an order for 20 cloud data centers? That's what we're saying. When one company, as you say, we have 60, by the way, that's a little bit misplaced. That's not quite right. I mean, we have 66 cloud regions and we sometimes use those synonymously. They're not always -- they don't, data center and regions don't necessarily translate one to one. But the -- when someone comes along and orders 20, then that creates a lot of opportunity for us to build more data centers and get more OCI customers because we're building OCI data centers inside of the Azure cloud. So those are the kinds of things we're seeing. We're building our own public regions based on direct customer demand and then we're building partner regions like the 20 data centers from Microsoft. The combination of the two adds up to 100. Safra Catz : Yeah, and also one of the things is in that number, it doesn't include the many, many clouded customers, which started small, and now companies have decided they want their own region. So they had a clouded customer, which is smaller, and they decide, no, no, no, now I want a dedicated region of my own. I get it. This is working. I've saved millions, tens of millions, sometimes hundreds of millions. Now I want my own. Also really, it is absolutely true, we did not bring up as much capacity as we could have used this past quarter because we had to make some audible calls on the field to decide how to allocate, whether to build something small which was available, which I could have recognized revenue in right in the quarter, or instead to go much bigger and to wait until some larger capacity was going to be available to hand over to me. So as I think I've hinted and we're talking about demand, had we had capacity this quarter in the hundreds of millions of dollars more that was just sitting there waiting to take it, and we had made some deployment choices because we need more and we need it bigger, instead of taking small pieces or smaller pieces, we decided to focus on the bigger parts and try to also treat our customers fairly and work with them to meet their needs. Larry Ellison : Let me give you one example of that, what Safra is describing, is we got enough Nvidia GPUs for Elon Musk's company xAI to bring up the first version, the first available version of their large language model called Grok. They got that up and running. But boy did they want a lot more. Boy did they want a lot more GPUs than we gave them. We gave them quite a few, but they wanted more and we are in the process of getting them more. So, the demand, we got that up pretty quickly. They were able to use it, but they want dramatically more. There's this gold rush towards building the world's greatest large language model. And we are doing our best to give our customers what we can this quarter, and then dramatically increase our ability to give them more and more capacity each succeeding quarter. Brad Zelnick : Thanks very much. Ken Bond : Thank you, Brad. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us on the call today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Emma for closing. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Oracle Corporation Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Bond, you may begin your conference. Ken Bond : Thank you, Krista. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our investor relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from our Investor Relations website. On the call today, our Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and Chief Executive Officer, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will provide some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks, which may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another excellent quarter with third-quarter revenue coming in as expected and EPS $0.02 above the high end of my guidance range. Now, before I get into the results of the quarter I wanted to touch on the strength of our infrastructure cloud business. OCI has emerged as the largest driver of our overall revenue acceleration growing much, much faster than our cloud competitors. Customers have figured out that by moving to OCI they can really get more while paying less, but it's not just the cost that matters to our customers. Beyond the superior price performance of OCI customers are choosing Oracle and Oracle services for multiple reasons. First, we know better than anyone what it takes to run the full stack of technology that goes into mission-critical workloads. I'm talking about running at enterprise scale with comprehensive security and unparalleled support and that's from decades of experience running the world's most important workloads and optimizing clustering technology, which is critical to artificial intelligence, workloads, and database services. Secondly, our AI capabilities are unique as they're built-in to help customers drive business outcomes. This is more than integrating generative AI across our Fusion and Industry Cloud applications and autonomous database, which we have done. It's also about enabling and refining these AI models with the customer's own data to better understand and serve their operations without them losing control of their own data. Third, we provide deployment flexibility for customers based on how they want to run in the cloud. In addition to offering public cloud services, we remain the only vendor which also offers a dedicated and complete cloud of customer, dedicated regions, sovereign clouds, and Alloy, our partner cloud so customers don't have to compromise the services they receive while meeting their deployment needs. And finally, we provide multi-cloud offerings so customers can consume our cloud services in the public cloud of their choice. We offer Oracle database at Azure with Microsoft as well as MySQL HeatWave through multiple clouds and you can expect more multi-cloud services to come. Now to Q3 results, which I'd like to point out I had the actual results on day five and signed off with my auditors days ago. So I'm just bragging a little bit but I couldn't help it, I know a lot of CFOs are pretty jealous. As I mentioned earlier, total revenue came in at the midpoint of my constant-currency guidance and EPS was above the high-end of guidance. As was the case when I gave guidance last quarter, currency had little effects in Q3. But I'll still discuss our results using constant currency growth rates in the few areas that the rates are slightly different. So here we go. Cloud revenue that's SaaS and IaaS excluding Cerner was $4.4 billion, up 26%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $5.1 billion with IaaS revenue of $1.8 billion, up 49%, and SaaS revenue of $3.3 billion, up 14%. This quarter marks the first time our total cloud revenue is more than our total license support revenue. So we have crossed over total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter with $10 billion, up 11% driven again by our Strategic Cloud Applications, Autonomous Database, and OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes product support were $4.6 billion and up 10%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $7.4 billion and were up 18%. Infrastructure revenues which includes license support were $5.4 billion and up 13%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 49%. Excluding Legacy Hosting Services, OCI Gen2 infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 52% with an annualized revenue of $6.7 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 63%. Where if not for some continuing supply constraints, consumption growth would have been even higher. Database subscription revenues, which include database license support were up 5%. And highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 34% and now has annualized revenue of $1.9 billion. Very importantly, has on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and OCI. Software license revenues were $1.3 billion, down 3%. So all in, total revenues for the quarter was $13.3 billion, up 7% including Cerner and up 9% excluding Cerner. Now to margins, the gross margins for Cloud Services and License Support was 77%. This is as before a result of the mix between support and cloud in which cloud is growing much faster than support. Support and SaaS gross margin percentages are consistent with last year while IaaS gross margins improved substantially year-over-year. While we continue to build data center capacity, overall gross margins will go higher as more of our cloud regions fill up. We monitor these expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. And to that point, gross profit dollars of Cloud Services and License Support grew 8% in Q3. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.8 billion, up 12% from last year. Operating margin was 44%, up from 42% last year as we continue to drive more efficiencies in our operating expenses, which continue to trend down as a percentage of revenue. Looking forward, as we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income but we will also expand the operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was very close to my guidance at 18.9%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.41 in USD, up 16% in both USD and constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.85. At quarter-end, we had nearly $9.9 billion in cash and marketable securities. And short term deferred revenue balance was $8.9 billion, up 4%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $18.2 billion, up 18% and free cash flow was $12.3 billion, up 68%. Capital expenditures were $6 billion over the same time period as we continue to see cash-flow benefits from our cloud transformation. Our remaining performance obligation or RPO is now over $8 billion with the portion excluding Cerner up 41% in constant currency. We signed several large deals this quarter and we have many more in the pipeline. Approximately 43% of our total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. And this reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger contracts as they see first-hand how Oracle Cloud Services are benefiting their businesses. And we expect to have some very nice joint announcements with NVIDIA next week. Now while we spent $2.1 billion on CapEx this quarter, the $1.7 billion in the cash-flow statements is slightly lower just due to the timing of payments. So the $2.1 billion is actually what we spent and will pay for. We are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out given the enormity of our backlog and pipeline. I expect the CapEx will be somewhere around $7 billion to $7.5 billion this fiscal year, meaning our Q4 CapEx should be considerably higher. To that point, we now have 68 customer-facing cloud regions live with 47 public cloud regions around the world and another eight being built. 12 of these public-cloud regions interconnect with Azure and more locations with Microsoft are coming online soon. We also have 11 dedicated region slots and 13 more planned. Several national security regions in EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And finally, we already have two Alloy cloud regions live with five more planned where Oracle Partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside Oracle Cloud. And of course, we have also many, many, many clouded customer installations. As I mentioned earlier the sizing, flexibility, and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be incredible advantage for us in the marketplace. And as we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. And this quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $450 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $4.4 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share today. Now, before I dive into Q4 guidance, I'd like to share some thoughts on what I see for the next 12 months or so. As demand for our Cloud Services continues getting stronger, our pipeline is growing even faster and our win rates are going higher as well. As our supply constraints ease revenue growth rates will accelerate higher as our capacity expands and we get into fiscal year '25. I should also say that we continue to expect the FY '24 of which we are now in the fourth quarter, total revenue excluding Cerner will accelerate from last year as it has for the past three years and will likely be significantly higher in FY '25. In addition, Cerner, which is a significant headwind this year, we expect to return to growth next year. And final - and I remain firmly committed to our FY '26 financial goals for revenue, operating margin, and EPS growth. However, some of these goals might prove to be too conservative given our momentum. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q4, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis as always. And if currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have little effect on total revenue and EPS. However, of course, actual currency impact may be different. So, at least right now, all the numbers are the same for constant currency and USD. Total revenues including Cerner are expected to grow from 4% to 6%. Total revenue excluding Cerner are expected to grow 6% to 8%. The total cloud revenue excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 22% to 24% as more capacity comes online in Q4. The EPS growth rate will be affected by the compare as our Q4 tax rate last year was 9.2%, which I believe most of you have already accounted for in your models. And my EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. As always, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary from my guidance as stated last year. So with that, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be down 2% or to flat and be between a $1.62 and $1.66. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. Well, Oracle signed another big Generation 2 cloud infrastructure contract with NVIDIA in Q3. Oracle's Gen2 AI infrastructure business is booming. That's become pretty clear to everybody. But in addition to selling infrastructure for training AI large language models, Oracle is also completely re-engineering its industry-specific applications to take full advantage of generative Artificial Intelligence. The best example of this is in Healthcare where Oracle did not just add a bit of AI around the edges of the existing applications. Instead, we developed completely new applications using our Apex Application Generator and our Autonomous Database. These all new applications use generative AI throughout the application. The best example is in Healthcare where our new Ambulatory Clinic System is being delivered to customers this Q4. This completely new application features a voice interface called the Clinical Digital Assistant. The Clinical Digital Assistant listens to a doctor's consultations with a patient and automatically generates prescriptions, Doctor's orders, doctor's notes, then automatically updates the patient's electronic health records. The Clinical Digital Assistant's voice interface makes our new healthcare systems dramatically easier to use and saves hours of doctors precious time every day which now can be spent with patients rather than typing into a computer. The delivery of our new AI-centric healthcare cloud applications, including the Ambulatory Clinic System, the Clinical Digital Assistant, and the Health Data Intelligence System will enable the rapid modernization of our customers' healthcare systems and transform Oracle Health and Cerner into a high-growth business for years to come. Ken, back to you. Safra Catz : We don't hear you, Ken. Ken Bond : Thank you. Thank you, Larry. Sorry about that. Krista, if you could please poll the audience for questions and if we can proceed from there? Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John DiFucci from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. John DiFucci : Thank you. Safra, the infrastructure as a service growth of 49% implies a herculean increase in new business coming online, new ARR the way we model it anyway something I just thought you wouldn't be able to do this quarter given how much you had to do though we've realized we don't know the timing of when deals come online. But last quarter you said you were going to reallocate resources to focus on some of these very large OCI deals to get them implemented earlier so you start to get revenue earlier. Is that what happened this quarter? Is that what we're seeing or is that still to come? Safra Catz : Honestly, John, that is still to come. So, this is just pretty much our regular way business. That's what you're seeing. We have enormous amounts of demand. I tried to make that clear last quarter, and we have more capacity coming online. But we have tried to - we're trying to focus on much larger chunks of data center capacities and electricity and all of that and that's just - that all to come. This is really our regular way business and our customers just growing and a whole bunch of new customers, by the way. I think there are many, many customers who have come on and that haven't gotten capacity yet. We've got at least 40 new AI bookings that are over $1 billion that hasn't come online yet. Larry Ellison : Okay, let me add that Oracle has been building data centers at a record level and a lot of people I think are aware that we can build fairly small data centers to get started when we want to. But the unique thing about Oracle's data centers, they're all identical except for scale. We did not have custom data center. They all have all the Oracle services. They are all complete. One of the things that's unusual about them, they are all completely automated. They come up on their own and they kind of run their selves. I mean, look, we do have a bunch of people working on these data centers but they are extremely highly automated. Our operating system is Autonomous Linux. Our database is the Oracle Autonomous Database. Our new HeatWave database, Microsoft - MySQL HeatWave, it's highly automated. And therefore, we can build every time we build a data center, it's like the data center we've built before except for one thing, scale. We can go very small. We can get a full cloud data center with all the services in [10 racks]. But this is what I want to point out. We're also building the largest data centers in the world that we know of. We're building an AI data center in the United States where you could park eight Boeing 747s nose-to-tail in that one data center. So, we are building large numbers of data centers, and we were - and some of those data centers are smallish, but some of those data centers are the largest AI data centers in the world. So, we're bringing on enormous amounts of capacity over the next 24 months because the demand is so high, we need to do that to satisfy our existing set of customers. To give you an idea. One more thing, in terms of data centers we're building 20 data centers from Microsoft and Azure. They just ordered three more data centers this quarter. They're adding to that already. And there are other multi-cloud agreements that are being signed. There are multicloud - a number of multicloud agreements in Japan where computer manufacturers in Japan are adopting our cloud and will be reselling our cloud as partners. And we think NRI is already doing that, but there a number of other companies that are going to be doing that. So that's something we're seeing over demand for data centers or people who want to buy Alloy and then resell our cloud services with their proprietary cloud services on top of it. We're seeing that. So some of our largest customers all over the world want their own Oracle region. They don't want to share a public cloud, they want a cloud region dedicated or actually multiple cloud regions dedicated to that bank or that technology company or that telecom company. So they are building their own data centers which are - those are Oracle cloud data centers, they are that - yes, they're all identical. So we're able to automate and run those with not a lot of additional labor costs. It's a huge advantage for us. John DiFucci : Well, thank you, Larry, and Safra. Listen, what you put up this quarter in Infrastructure as a Service, it just looks pretty impressive. But it sounds like there's a lot more to come. Thank you for taking my question. Larry Ellison : John, my last comment will be - would be the growth in RPO is what's to come. And RPO is obviously growing faster than revenue because we can't meet the demand. That's the measure of demand, the $80 billion RPO is quite a - an acceleration of demand. So demand is not slowing down, it's actually increasing quite a bit. John DiFucci : Well, there were lot of questions on that last quarter, and I guess there won't be any on this one. Thank you. Ken Bond : Thank you, John. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Hi, thank you, and congrats from me as well. I wanted to talk a little bit about Cerner. In the announcements, you talked about that most of Cerner now it's - is running out of your OCI. Well, first of all, let a very quick turnaround here, so well done. What's kind of the implications for that both from running efficiency but also innovation on the platform? Thank you. Larry Ellison : Well, two things. One is we save a huge amount of money moving them into our standard data center. Our OCI costs are much lower than the cost of the Cerner dedicated data center in Kansas City. Also, the big thing that we're excited about is OCI is highly secure, it's got a highly secure perimeter and therefore those applications are much less vulnerable to ransomware or other kinds of attacks than if they were in a different kind of data center. So we're very happy that these are now secured. The third thing is now that they're in our cloud, we're able to update those applications on our regular three months cadence. So, we're able to modernize those customers that are in the cloud on a regular basis and start delivering our brand new applications that completely rewritten Cerner application. First for ambulatory clinics and then eventually for acute-care hospitals. But ambulatory clinics system is coming out this quarter and we're able to automatically deliver that system to existing customers. It's not a reimplementation. It is literally an update to what they've already got running on the Oracle Cloud. Even though it's an all-new application, I'm not going to see much technical detail, but it uses the same underlying data schema. So, we literally can bring up the new application without the customer having to go through any implementation process. We can do it just as an update, like when we ship a new version of Fusion to an existing Fusion customer. We can now ship a new version of - an all-new version of the Cerner application to a Cerner customer in OCI. So it allows us to modernize their infrastructure very, very rapidly, deliver the Voice - Clinical Digital Assistant, make the system easier to use, save doctor's time, deliver a lot more value put it in the diagnostic imaging systems that help data intelligence system, deliver all of that automatically on a regular three-months cadence. So, it allows us to modernize the Cerner base very, very quickly while keeping them safe from ransomware. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Ben Reitzes : Yes, thanks. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you this afternoon. Larry and Safra, can you talk a little bit about CapEx? Your guidance implies almost doubling of CapEx in the fourth quarter and then what kind of trajectory is needed for the next fiscal year given this RPO growth? What kind of uptick is needed? And Larry, if you don't mind, what - if you can give some color on GPU availability and how that plays in versus data center requirements in terms of that spending? Thanks so much. Safra Catz : So, for fiscal year '25, looking at about $10 billion in CapEx because it's also involves not only some big centers, but it also involves expansions of existing centers. So we've already got some areas that we will be filling out. So at least preliminarily, we're looking at $10 billion for next year. And then it's not too complicated to figure out the math here when I'm looking at somewhere between $7 billion and $7.5 billion for the full year and you've got all the numbers for one, two, and three at this point. And I would include for Q3 the one we just are announcing. I would add in the amount we haven't paid yet as the CapEx number for this quarter. Okay? And then I guess that would be and then Larry gets the second question. But anyway, so $2.1 billion for this quarter and you've got Q1 and Q2 and I'm going to be somewhere between $7 billion and $7.5 billion for the full year, which is actually a little bit lower than I thought. But we were able to do pretty well. You know-how we spend very carefully. Ben Reitzes : Great, thanks. And Larry, the amount that - how is the GPU availability in terms of hitting your goals and vis-a-vis other bottlenecks that could be out there? Safra Catz : Can I take at least part of this? Ben Reitzes : Oh, yes, sure. Safra Catz : The GPU we are good. We are actually very good in our GPU access and capability. So, building the computers and that it's much more making sure we've got the power on that. Larry Ellison : Yes. Ben Reitzes : Thank you. Larry Ellison : And as Safra says, we have - so, as Safra says, we have a great relationship with NVIDIA. They're a customer of ours as well as us being a customer of theirs and we work very closely together. So, that's going pretty well. Building these let them is the scale of some of these data centers is breathtaking. Again the one we're building in Salt Lake. Again, you can park 8747s nose-to-tail. We can give you a video of this thing under construction, but it's hard, I mean, it's breathtaking. So, there is a tremendous amount of demand, the data centers take longer to build, and we would like that said, we are getting very good at building them quickly and getting the building the power and the communication links in, we're doing faster than we have ever happened in the past. And the thing is once we deliver the hardware, the hardware comes up very, very quickly because the process of bringing up the hardware is now automated. It's very different than it used to be. So, we're able to bring additional capacity online very quickly if we have that the electric power and the communication lines. So, is the long pole in the tent is actually building the structure, connecting the electricity, connecting the communication lines. Ben Reitzes : Thanks, Larry. Appreciate it. Congrats something OCI growth. Larry Ellison : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Derrick Wood : Great, thank you. Larry, just within the last few months you guys have enabled Oracle Database and OCI to be run on top of Azure, which seems like a fairly significant development. Can you talk about what the customer reception has been around this announcement? How you think it could change the arc of new investments on the Oracle Database platform? And what this means for potentially unlocking a stronger adoption cycle for Autonomous Database? Larry Ellison : Well, I think it is the key to unlocking a stronger adoption cycle for a - moving Oracle in general to the cloud in general and specifically the migration to Autonomous Database. Oracle, we expect the multicloud initiatives to continue to expand. We're seeing it expand in Japan, but we expected to expand amongst other hyperscalers to adopt a similar multi-cloud approach where we built and we built OCI regions inside of the coexisting with their existing cloud infrastructure. We think the world - the era of walled gardens is coming to an end where it used to be okay, I'm going to move all my stuff to AWS, trying to move all my stuff to Azure. What customers really want is the ability to use multiple clouds and for those multiple clouds to talk to one another. And I think - I mean in the era of the Internet and now cloud computing, it's really called Cloud Computing. It's not called a bunch of separate clouds. So we expect that multi-cloud to become the norm and Oracle to be available everywhere. And we - and that's what you said, we think that will preserve our franchise and database where we've been the number-one database in the IT ecosystem for a very long-time. We think that's going to preserve that franchise and expand it because the Autonomous Database is a unique piece of technology and there is nothing like it in the world, and maybe the most interesting thing, no one else is working on anything like that. No one else even trying to duplicate the Autonomous Database. So, we think it will be - it will become a very successful product in every cloud. Derrick Wood : Thanks, Larry. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne : Yes, thanks very much for taking the questions and congrats on a incredible bookings this quarter. Larry, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the interest level on Alloy in international markets where there might be a bit of a premium on data sovereignty and maybe how that's impacting the growth opportunity for OCI when we look out towards the balance of calendar '24? Thanks. Larry Ellison : Well, I think Japan is maybe the most interesting market where we had early success with NRI. They run the Tokyo Stock Exchange. No - what NRI has is just is an Oracle - a couple of Oracle Cloud regions which they resell in the financial services community inside of Japan. And one of their applications is a major stock exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange. So, think about how many clouds run stock exchanges, that would be ours. It's got to be highly secure, it can never go down, it's going to have extremely high transaction rates, we can do that. And the success of NRI is caused other - the other computer companies in Japan to become very, very interested and also reselling our cloud with - and we also have the ability that they can add on some of their own technology to our cloud so, our cloud is open so you can plug-in other things to the cloud. So, imagine a big computer company in Japan adopting the Oracle Cloud, reselling Autonomous Database, reselling all of our technologies because all we --we only make one kind of cloud, they're all the same and they have all of the services. But then that company can add their own services to there for their customers. We think all of the cloud companies in Japan are going to adopt OCI. Plus a lot of big companies, the big car companies in Japan. We want around their own, the phone companies in Japan will want their own, the technology companies in Japan will want their own Oracle regions. And because they are sovereign because they are highly secure and because they are highly cost-effective, so we think this allows us to enter a variety of new markets. Pretty much every government is going to want a sovereign cloud and a dedicated region for that government for not only to - so we see a number of countries. It's funny, we talked about winning business with companies. For the first time, we're beginning to win business country - per countries for sovereign cloud where the national government and the state governments are moving to that Oracle OCI region. And of course, it's got to be at least two of them for redundancy and disaster recovery. So, we have a number of countries where we're negotiating sovereign regions with the national government. We see that time and time again, major companies, governments, computer suppliers reselling our Alloy Cloud. The demand for our cloud regions is extraordinarily high. I believe we will end up - well, this is a funny prediction, but okay, we'll end up with more data centers and cloud regions than all the other hyperscalers combined. Safra Catz : Yes. I think that's the story. Larry Ellison : That's what I believe. Safra Catz : So, just to make sure you have all the numbers between Alloy and dedicated regions, we've got 13 lives. We've got 18 under-construction. And we've signed five new ones just this past quarter. So for us, it's - they're just - there's just a list we're going through and trying to get them all because they are such a unique capability and in such high demand. Larry Ellison : Yes. And let me just add one last thing. Microsoft does not compete for this business. AWS does not compete for this business. Google does not compete for this business. We're the only ones in this business. Kirk Materne : Thank you, all. Operator : Our final question today comes from Brad Zelnick from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : Thanks very much for taking my question. Larry, my question actually follows on your answer to Kirk's question because I think it's so important. In talking to one of your GSI partners we heard about a global public sector solution that they referred to as government in a box where Oracle in partnership with likes Starlink, the Tony Blair Project, our building solutions on top of OCI including [Absence Check] and even Cerner. So, literally run the entire country's digital operations. So, hoping you can add even a little bit more color about what you're doing here. How big an opportunity it is because it just seems like it's such a powerful example of the entire Oracle Cloud Stack coming together in a very meaningful way? Larry Ellison : All right. It is really, really - it is very interesting. And we've gone into the National Government and State Government applications in a very, very big way to give you an idea a little glimpse of what we're doing. Yes, because we can't deliver these cloud regions to medium-sized countries. So, for example, Serbia is standardizing on - or these Oracle Cloud regions for their National Government. We're automating their healthcare and people know that we're in the healthcare business. What they might not know is in cooperation with Starlink we're able to deliver an Internet service to - for the entire country. The rural part of the country, by the way, we can deliver the Internet and we have delivered the Internet. Let's say Kenya or Rwanda very inexpensively using Starlink and our sovereign cloud regions to backhaul the Internet traffic. So, you can bring every school in Serbia online the Internet connectivity even if they're rural doesn't matter. Every school, every hospital as is true of Rwanda, that's true of Kenya. We can do it very, very cost-effectively and one of the applications we have for agriculture, we actually do a national map of the country where we can show you each of the farms in the country, what they're growing - this farm is growing coffee, this farm is growing maze, this farm - what's part of the fields are getting enough nitrogen, which part of the fields are getting enough water? What corrective actions you need to take to increase your agricultural output? We're doing that again in concert with Elon Musk and SpaceX to do this kind of mapping to provide this AI-assisted and then these maps are AI-assisted help them plan their agricultural output and predict their agricultural output, predict markets, the logistics of the agricultural output during all of those things as next-generation national application. And it is one of the most exciting things we're doing, of course, we do procurement and accounting and human resources and recruiting for the government, we do all of those applications. But in some of the newer applications, regarding food security. Making sure all the schools are online. Rural growth schools are online. That rural hospitals are online. It's automating those rural hospitals. It's automating their vaccination program, their healthcare program across the board. These next-generation applications are very attractive. I'll tell you one other crazy thing that we do. It's another generative AI application. If you want to join the EU, it took Serbia eight years to harmonize their laws to be able to join the EU. Albania is facing the same thing. But with generative AI, we can read the entire corpus of the Albanian laws and actually harmonize their laws with the EU and probably more like 18-months to two years rather than the eight years it took Serbia. So, there are all sorts of interesting new AI applications out there that people you've probably never heard of before or at least I hadn't heard of before, until this last 12 months. Now that we've worked on and we're now in the process of delivering. Brad Zelnick : Really amazing stuff. Larry, thank you and congrats. And Safra, really great to see the firm reiteration of your fiscal '26 targets. Thanks so much for taking my question. Safra Catz : Thank you. Ken Bond : Thank you, Brad. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Krista for closing. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This does conclude today's conference call.

Today's call is being recorded, and now I would like to turn the conference over to Ken Bond. Please go ahead. Ken Bond : Thank you, Krista. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison, and Chief Executive Officer, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements, in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Clearly, we had an absolutely incredible quarter. As you know, Oracle's Q4 is known for customers purchasing large software license contracts to power their businesses. But because of the pivot to the cloud, this Q4 was powered by the enormous demand for our cloud services. And they showed up in RPO or Remaining Performance Obligations. In Q4, Oracle signed the largest sales contract in our history, led by huge demand for training large language models, as well as record levels of sales for OCI, autonomous, fusion, and net suite. RPO was $98 billion, up $18 billion from Q3, and up 44% year-over-year from $68 billion last year. And we are trading one-time non-recurring license revenue in return for much bigger strategic customer commitments for multi-year cloud revenue, from which we expect to further accelerate our revenue growth rates. This is exactly what we've been targeting, and it bolsters my confidence that our overall revenue, earnings, and cash flow performance, as well as our growth rates, will only get stronger and accelerate. In short, this Q4 marks the full emergence of our high growth cloud businesses. Now, I started talking about this tipping [0.4] (ph) years ago, and you've seen it continue to play out in our results since then. As a reminder, we accelerated our US dollar revenue growth rate from negative one in fiscal year [2020] (ph) to plus eight this past year if you exclude Cerner. In addition, EPS has grown at a 10% compounded annual growth rate over that same period. And both operating cash flow and free cash flow, which of course we report on a trailing 12 month basis, were each declining 10% four years ago. This year, they grew 9% and 39% respectively. Now customer conversations are now absolutely fully focused on our cloud services as the results clearly show. So let me give you just a couple of examples -- a few examples. First, as you saw, OpenAI selected Oracle to run deep learning and AI workloads on Oracle Cloud infrastructure. Like many others, OpenAI chose OCI because it is the world's fastest and most cost effective AI infrastructure. In total, we signed over 30 AI contracts for over $12 billion this quarter, and nearly $17 billion this year. Second, we continue to expand our work helping companies use our cloud applications portfolio to reinvent their businesses. As an example, a very large enterprise tech company signed a contract in Q4 for over $600 million where we will be helping them transform their operations with Fusion to enable them to become more agile, faster growing, and more profitable. May I say in the process, we will replace out many of our competitors product. These cross-pillar cloud deals or suite deals, focus on business process reengineering that incorporate multiple cloud applications that no one else can offer. And I want to point out, by the way that today is day 11 of our new fiscal year and we are once again, announcing our results not only for the quarter but the year and giving guidance, making us faster than any other public company by a launch. We are able to do this because of Fusion applications and that is why companies are choosing Fusion and our wonderful teams are showing them the way. And third, I'm pleased to announce that we've signed another multi-cloud partnership this time with Google. OCI and Google Cloud Network interconnect is available immediately in 10 regions, and we will be live with Oracle database at Google Cloud in September, where customers can get direct access to Oracle Database Services running on OCI, deployed in Google Cloud data centers. So what's driving this? Well, it is all about our comprehensive, highly differentiated and secure cloud offering. Customers have progressed from their initial curiosity about Oracle Cloud into full-blown rollout. We have the most secure, complete and cost-effective set of enterprise applications and infrastructure cloud technologies of any vendor. Not only are our cloud technologies vertically integrated to work together, but we offer flexible deployment models like public cloud, multi-cloud, sovereign clubs, dedicated cloud or any other way our customers ask us to deliver. And we also offer Oracle Alloy, where Oracle partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside the Oracle Cloud. Now I'm now going to dive into the details of Q4 and finish my prepared remarks with how this strength and momentum will impact fiscal year 2025 and beyond. Okay. So let's start. In Q4, the dollar strengthened from the time of my Q4 guidance, so we saw a 1% currency headwind to total revenue and a $0.01 currency headwind to EPS. As usual, I'll be discussing our financials using constant currency growth rate because this is how we manage the business. Total cloud revenue that is SaaS plus IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4.7 billion up 23%, including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 20% at $5.3 billion. And SaaS revenue of $3.3 billion, up 10% and IaaS revenue of $2 billion, up 42% on top of last year's 77% growth. Total cloud services and license support for the quarter was $10.2 billion, up 10%, driven again by our strategic Cloud Applications, Autonomous Database and OCI. Application subscription revenues which includes product support were $4.6 billion and up 6%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of $7.7 billion and were up 16%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support were $5.6 billion up 13%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 42%. Excluding legacy hosting, OCI Gen2 infrastructure cloud services grew 44%, with an annualized revenue of $7.4 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 53% were it not for continuing supply constraints, consumption growth would have been even higher. Database subscriptions, which includes database license support, were up 6% and highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 26% and now have an annualized revenue of $2 billion. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, either to OCI directly or using database at Azure or database at Google Cloud. We expect these cloud database services will be that third leg of revenue growth alongside OCI and strategic [SaaS] (ph). Consistent with our strategic direction and reflecting customer preference for cloud services, software license revenues were down 14% and to $1.8 billion. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $14.3 billion. That's up 4% if you include Cerner, up 5% excluding Cerner. Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 77%. This is a result of the mix between support and cloud, in which cloud is growing much faster than support. The gross margin percentages for software support and SaaS are consistent with last year, while IaaS gross margins improved substantially. Gross margins will go higher as more of our cloud regions fill up. We monitor our expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. To that point, though the gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 8% in Q4. Non-GAAP operating income was $6.7 billion, up 9% from last year. The operating margin was 47%, up from 44% last year, as we continue to drive more efficiencies in our business. Looking forward, as we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also expand the operating margin percentages. The non-GAAP tax rate came out over 1% higher than my guidance at 20.1% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.63 and GAAP EPS was $1.11 in USD. As a reminder, the non-GAAP tax rate last year was 9.2%, and this had an adverse effect on this quarter's EPS growth. Non-GAAP pretax income grew 14% in constant currency. So you can figure out that had we had the same tax rate last year as this year, net income would have grown 14% and EPS would have been up 12% in CD, 11% in USD. For the full fiscal year, total company revenue was $53 billion up 6%. Total cloud services and license support revenue, which is entirely subscription-based and accounts for nearly [3/4] (ph) of total revenue was $39.4 billion, up 11%. Total application subscription revenues grew 9% and infrastructure subscription revenue grew 13%. Total cloud services, excluding Cerner, were up 26% to [$17.2 billion] (ph). SaaS revenue, excluding Cerner was up 13% to $10.4 billion for the year. IaaS and cloud infrastructure revenue was up 50% to $6.8 billion for the year, with consumption revenue up 66% from last year. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $5.56 in USD, up 9% in USD and the full year operating margin percentage was 44%, up from 42% last year. At quarter end, we had nearly $10.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, the short-term deferred revenue balance was $9.3 billion, up 4%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $18.7 billion, up 9% and free cash flow was $11.8 billion, up 39%. Capital expenditures were $6.9 billion. As I mentioned our remaining performance obligations, or RPO is now $98 billion, up 44% in constant currency and the portion excluding Cerner, if you're curious was up 60%. We signed several large deals in this quarter, and we have many more -- many, many more in the pipeline. Approximately 39% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. And this reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger contracts as they see firsthand how Oracle Cloud services are benefiting their businesses. Now while we spent $3.5 billion on CapEx this quarter, the $2.8 billion shown in the cash flow statement is lower simply, as a result of timing of payments. We are working as quickly as we can to get cloud capacity built out given the enormity of our backlog and pipeline. At this moment, we have 76 customer-facing cloud regions live with 47 public cloud regions around the world and another 19 being built. We have 11 database at Azure sites live and more locations with Microsoft coming online soon. We will have 12 Oracle database at Google Cloud sites live this year. We also have 13 dedicated regions live and 15 more planned. We have several national security regions and EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And finally, we already have two alloy cloud regions live with 11 more plant. Of course, we also have many, many, many cloud customer installations as I mentioned earlier, the sizing and flexibility and -- the size and flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be incredibly advantageous for us in the marketplace. This quarter, we purchased 1.25 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $4.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors today declared a dividend of $0.40 per share. Before I discuss my guidance for Q1 and fiscal 2025, I do just want you to have a couple of notes. The first is that in Q4, we decided to exit the advertising business, which had declined to about $300 million in revenue in fiscal year 2024. Also, I will no longer breaking out the Cerner business in my results. And even though it will begin to grow modestly throughout the year in both revenue and operating margin, it's not necessary to break it out anymore and because it is now operating in a growth mode. Now to guidance. Throughout fiscal year 2025, I expect continued strong cloud demand to push Oracle sales and RPO even higher and result in double-digit revenue growth this fiscal year. I also expect that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous quarter as OCI capacity increases to meet demand. We believe our momentum, our current momentum will continue as our pipeline is growing even faster than bookings and our win rates are going higher as well. I expect fiscal year 2025 cloud infrastructure services to grow faster than the 50% we reported this year. CapEx In fiscal year 2025 will probably be double what it is in fiscal year 2024 -- what it was in fiscal year 2024. Okay. Beyond this fiscal year, I remain firmly committed to our fiscal year 2026 financial goals for revenue, operating margins and EPS growth. However, given our strong bookings results, I believe some of these goals might prove to be too conservative given our momentum. We are going to provide you a more fulsome update on all of this at the Financial Analyst Meeting at Oracle Cloud World in Las Vegas in September. Okay. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q1, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. Now if currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a negative 1% effect on my revenue and either $0.01 or $0.02 negative on EPS in Q1. However, as you all know, actual currency impact may be more or less, I just can't get that now. Total revenue for Q1 are expected to grow from 6% to 8% in constant currency and using the currency situation as it is now, they're expected to grow from 5% to 7% in USD. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 21% to 23% in constant currency and 20% to 22% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 11% to 15% and be between $1.33 and $1.37 in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 10% to 14% and be between $1.31 and $1.35, but this time in USD. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. And as always, one-time tax events could cause the actual tax rates to vary from my guidance. Okay. I know that was long. But with that, let me turn it to Larry for his comments. Larry Ellison : Thank you, Safra. I'm going to start by repeating something Safra said. In Q4, Oracle's company-wide RPO increased 44% to $98 billion. In AI alone, we signed contracts with 30 different customers for $12.5 billion in new AI business. These astonishing RPO numbers 44% and $98 billion were driven by massive increases in sales of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI. So who are the companies choosing to use Oracle Cloud Services and Oracle data centers. Well, here are a few names : NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, X AI, Open AI, coherent dozens more. In other words, the world's largest cloud companies and the world's most successful and accomplished AI companies choose to use Oracle cloud services and data centers. So can -- so why are they working with Oracle, because Oracle's Gen 2 cloud infrastructure is different. OCI's area network moves data much faster. And when you charge by the minute, faster also means less expensive. OCI trains large language models several times faster and at a fraction of the cost of other clouds. OCI\u2019s Critical cloud software, the operating system and the database are fully Autonomous. At OCI, human beings do not run the operating system or the database, Autonomous software robots do. No one else has this level of autonomy in the cloud. Eliminating human labor eliminate human error. Almost all cloud security breaches begin with human error, eliminating the possibility of human error is the only way to make certain your cloud data is not stolen. That's it. The most important technology companies in the world are using OCI because it's faster, less expensive and more secure. Easy to say, not easy to do. Back to you, Ken. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Chris, if you could please poll the audience for questions, we'll begin the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow : Perfect, thank you. Congrats from me. These are very impressive numbers. Safra, can you try to help us bridge the strong RPO number and how we need to think about feeding that into revenue? Is that just the capacity function? Or is there anything on the customer side that you need to deliver on the technology side you need to deliver. Just help us to bridge the gap on those. Thank you. Safra Catz : It's all about capacity. It is -- as we bring the capacity online wherever it's going online around the world is when those workloads are coming over. A lot of the engineering work is done in advance so that those customers know how they can operate. They bring smaller workloads, but the bigger workloads, they are just waiting for us to go online and make it available to them. It is really that level. We are scheduling them on our availability. And as I mentioned, our pipeline to take more deals is all about us just getting the capacity up and live and moving forward. Raimo Lenschow : So it's just a mechanical problem in a way. Safra Catz : Yes. Well, it's not a problem. It's just the schedule. As things come online, as the data centers go live or as we deliver the computers, they are just getting -- it's just very straightforward. There's no magic here. These customers have done a lot of the analysis in the engineering in advance and have tested us or competed us against our competitors and have chosen us very -- already understanding how we work, and they're just waiting for us to give them more capacity. Raimo Lenschow : Great. Very impressive. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thank you very much and congrats from me as well. Larry, it's great to see the amazing momentum in OCI, especially given it's a competitive market and the leading names in AI are coming to you, wanting to partner with Oracle. Can you talk about the innovation road map for OCI and your AI services in particular? And why we should expect Oracle to keep on winning not just today, but over the next several years to come in this market? Larry Ellison : Okay. Well, I think in OCI, we've talked for a while about our ability to build very small data centers, one you could put in a shipper, a submarine or a full cloud, a full Oracle cloud, we will soon have in six standard half racks to go into a conventional data center. So virtually any one of our customers could choose to have the full Oracle Cloud in their data center with every service, every service in the cloud. And they could scale that up quite extraordinarily large. So we talk about the fact that we can start very small and that's a huge difference between us and our competitors. So we can actually put it again customer by customer, small countries, we can do. What we haven't talked so much about is we're also building the largest data centers in the world. We talked about -- I think we talked briefly about one last call, where we can park -- it's a 70-megawatt data center where we can park eight 747s nose to tail in the data center, the huge AI training data center. While we're also building a 200-megawatt data center. In fact, this past quarter, we sold about half of that data center for the -- for a period of time. So we're now bringing 200 megawatt data centers online. So we are literally building the smallest, most portable, most affordable cloud data centers, all the way up to 200 megawatt data centers ideal for training very large language models and keeping them up to-date. This AI race is going to go on for a long time. It's not a matter of getting ahead, just simply getting ahead in AI, but you also have to keep your model current. And that's going to take larger and larger data centers. And some of the data centers we have that we're planning are actually even bigger. There -- some are getting very close to our there, say a 1 gigawatt, which is a pretty good-sized city or one enormous AI cloud training data center. No one else can span this range. And in every case, we have unbelievably fast networks that are part of this, the data centers we are building include the power plants and the transmission of the power directly into the data center and liquid cooling. And because these modern data centers are moving from air cooled to liquid cooled, and you have to engineer them from scratch. And that's what we've been doing for some time. And that's what we'll continue to do. And currently, we are leading the pack and being able to deliver that quality and that scale of data center. Brad Zelnick : Amazing, thank you so much Larry. Operator : Next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Larry and Safra, it's impressive to see how fast you ramped OCI as you're now available in 11 data centers. And then now with this Google partners, we'll have Oracle database at Google Cloud. So I have two questions : one is, as you embark on offering this multi-cloud flexibility to customer, when can we see a similar partnership with AWS? And second is, how should we think about these partners is helping your customers migrate their on-prem Oracle workloads to cloud? Safra Catz : I don't know, Larry you wanted \u2013 started with that. Larry Ellison : I guess I can start. Well, we believe in giving customers choice. And customers want choice. Customers are using multiple clouds, not only infrastructure cloud, but they might have sales force applications or Workday applications \u2013 or they use multiple cloud in their business right now. So it's very important, we think that these -- that all the clouds become interconnected. So we're thrilled to have the connection with Microsoft and be building OCI data centers inside of it -- right inside of Azure. So the computers are next to each other to minimize network costs and network latency, which is all good things. We're doing the same thing with Google. We would love to do the same thing with AWS. We think we should be interconnected to everybody. And that's what we're attempting to do in our multi-cloud strategy. I think, that's what customers want. So I'm optimistic that's the way the world will settle out. We'll get rid of these fees for moving data from cloud-to-cloud and all the clouds will be interconnected, and customers can pick their favorite service from their favorite cloud and mix and match whatever they want to use and do it easily and seamlessly. Siti Panigrahi : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Alex Zukin : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dive a bit deeper on just precisely how many deployment models you guys are offering for OCI because it feels as though that is getting particularly differentiated as we start to think of sovereign cloud, GovCloud, more private cloud, given the conservative posture for AI and data privacy. So how do we think about how much of an advantage that is providing in sales cycles? And maybe in that massive $30-plus billion in the second half RPO, but also just comment on the magnitude of that opportunity going forward. Larry Ellison : I'm going to take a swing at this one. We can -- every medium-sized on-premise customer that Oracle has could have a private -- full Oracle cloud where they have no neighbors. They are the only user of that Oracle Cloud, and we can install that in their existing data centers. Nobody else can do that. You have to move to the public cloud. Now we have public cloud, we have a lot of public cloud regions. We love the public cloud. But if you're very conservative and you want to absolutely maximize security and that's important to you. We can put in a cloud, a full Oracle Cloud, and we run it. We pay for the heart -- again, it's an Oracle region. We put in Oracle cloud region and let me just make up a name. Samsung, we could build a cloud region for Samsung. In fact, two cloud regions is for Samsung. We could do two cloud regions making up names, General Motors, Ford, any company. Those are pretty big companies, but much smaller companies as well. So we're the only ones that give you an option to have the full capability of a public cloud run by Oracle, all of our services, every single 1 of our services, you don't pay for the hardware, you just pay for what you use, put that model directly on your premises. And you can use it and no one else is in that cloud. We can do that. No one else can do it. We can put them on ships and on submarines, no one else can do it because we can start very, very small. All Oracle clouds are identical, except for scale. All Oracle clouds have all Oracle services. All Oracle clouds are fully automated because they're identical. They're fully automated. So one of the reasons we took a little bit longer to get our cloud out was because we built something quite different than what our competitors have. And that allows us to go from very small to very large, using the same automation software. I think some of our competitors, they're large data centers, some are quite different than other data centers. They might have different -- some services might be available on some data centers and not in others. They're not -- they did a very different approach to what we did. We had the advantage of seeing what all the other guys did and we took a different road. It took us a bit longer, but we think we're better off in terms of security. We're better off in terms of scalability. By the way, that means the ability to go down in size and up in size. It allows us to get to every corner of the globe, and provide a level of privacy for your data that other cloud providers cannot provide. Safra Catz : Yes. And because as Larry said, because whatever the deployment model is you don't have to compromise. Some of our competitors may offer some level of sovereignty or some level of disconnected, but they don't actually have all the services for us, and the reason we've been so successful is whether it's disconnected or sovereign or whatever it is, the customer always gets everything. All services, not just some services and they get to deploy it any way they want, and they get the security or the regulatory requirements, sovereignty may be very critical. And for most governments, they don't want their data in the public cloud out and about. They want to have its sovereign to their country. And so no compromises, no compromises on the services and no compromises on security. Alex Zukin : It also sounds like you guys have a better price in most cases. So thanks, again to [indiscernible] tough quarter. Safra Catz : Much, because we are so much faster when you use our cloud, it is new. It's modern, but it also is technical advantages and so it runs your workload so much more quickly. And when you pay by the minute, the second, the hour, if your workload ends in [1/10] (ph) time, you pay a 1/10th the price. That's very hard to compete with. Larry Ellison : One last comment -- maybe one last comment. The other thing is our cloud was designed not for hundreds of regions, but for thousands or possibly even tens of thousands of data centers and regions. That's why we had to put in a high degree of automation. There is no way we could run these data centers manually. There are too many of them, and we're building them to do fast. We couldn't hire people fast enough and train people fast enough. And the risk of them making a mistake, an error is the risk -- well, they start exposing our customers' data. So they are highly automated. It's a little bit like I apply to myself, and comparing it to the satellites that Elon Musk puts in the sky. StarLink has -- they're more -- he has more satellites than everyone else in the world combined because, again it is a very different \u2013 it is a satellite system, Starlink, that's designed for a very large number of satellites that are highly automated. And same model lots and lots of them, 100% or nearly 100% automation to run these clouds. Operator : Your next question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne : Yeah. Thanks very much. I'll echo the congrats on the cloud momentum. Larry, Safra, I was wondering if you could just expand a bit on the OpenAI announcement this afternoon. Just what that entails in terms of how you'll be working with them or Microsoft? Are there certain workloads they'll be working on with you directly. Can you just give us whatever additional color you can on that deal, obviously very excited. Thanks. Safra Catz : Well. Go ahead. No, you can. Go ahead. Larry Ellison : Okay. All right. Well, we are building a very, very large data center, very big about half of a huge data center. We're building for them lots of NVIDIA chips, the new NVIDIA chips, the new NVIDIA interconnect, liquid cooled and they are primarily for training. I mean not inference things. It's we're doing masses and masses of training. And I don't know, that's what we're doing and the training goes beyond languages because now these systems are -- even the call -- even though they are called large language models, they really -- part of the proper name is probably neural networks, they're neural networks, and they're trained not just with language, but masses of images as well. For example, Oracle is very involved with taking biopsy slides and using microscopes to read biopsy slides, recording those images and then using AI to diagnose cancer from these biopsies. It is one of the projects we're working on the medical side of our business. And these large language models, strangely enough, are also looking at biopsies. They're not just reading things language. They are also looking at images and interpreting images. So that is actually a bigger and more complicated problem than understanding language. That's what's so exciting about -- again second time I mentioned Elon and Elon company. Tesla is very close to getting full service driving authorized in China. I'm not speaking at it at school. I think the Chinese government is moving along the full self-driving, self-driving in China. In order to train a car to do full self-driving, you trained on vast amounts of images because the car has to look at these images and then decide what it's going to do next. That's what it does. It doesn't speak, it responds to what it sees. That's a very different problem than answering a question posed in any language. So everyone is going to be training their models on imaging. That's a huge amount of additional data. It is a huge amount of additional training, and we are right in the middle of it. Kirk Materne : Thank you. Operator : Your final question today comes from John DiFucci with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. John DiFucci : Thank you for taking my question. My question, I think, is for Safra. Safra, the IaaS revenue growth has been really impressive and it has been for a while here, but perhaps even more so the last couple of quarters, especially is the backlog given its scale. And this may be somewhat of an obvious question for you, but it's based on my conversation with investors. There's two high-profile topics that I want to make sure we understand what the contribution has been today versus next year. And that's Oracle database at Azure and AI in general. We've heard a lot of conversation about the former when we speak to partners and customers in the field. And you've spoken a lot about the latter today. So beyond conversation volume, can you talk a little bit more about what the contribution of these two topics has been to that impressive IaaS revenue growth in this quarter versus what we should expect that contribution to be in fiscal 2025. Safra Catz : Okay. I would tell you that both of them, both whether it's database at Azure or even the AI workloads as they come on board, they are all incremental to anything you saw so far in our revenues, okay? The database at Azure, those centers are just going live now. So even though we are selling quite a bit of ARR there, these are small and growing very, very fast. So the revenue in Q4 of, let's say, Azure was very small. Q1 will be 10 times as much. Q2 will be potentially 30 times as much. So it is extremely incremental to our current run rate. By the way, that is also true to -- we've already -- we have revenue -- AI revenue so far. Yes, we do, and we've been announcing those. These contracts that we are signing -- that we've signed at the end of Q3 and that are signed at the end of Q4 are so much larger in size that they will be incremental to everything you saw this past year, literally incremental added by quite a bit. So it is going to be -- this is a very exciting time, obviously. And everything is incremental to what you've seen so far because it dwarfed it in many ways. John DiFucci : That is really clear, and it really speaks to, I think, what you started talking about a long time ago, especially a lot more publicly, I don't know in the fall of 2022, but thanks. That's really clear. Ken Bond : Thank you, John. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on the Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Krista for closing. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ken Bond, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Ken Bond : Thank you, Sarah, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud Services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and Chief Executive Officer, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and our 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the marketplace of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra. Safra Catz : Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I go to our Q1 numbers, I thought I'd take only a moment to review some of the things that you'll be hearing about over the next couple of days from Oracle. We are at Cloud World in Las Vegas, and Cloud World is where we come together with our customers and partners to share experiences and showcase our latest products and services. Our customers are our best folks people when they share how our technologies transform their enterprises. The innovations from our labs and research centers in combination with feedback from our customers have helped us build superior products and services. You'll hear about new cutting-edge features within OCI, database, analytics, Fusion, NetSuite and our industry applications. We will also be showing new capabilities that we've been working on for a while, including embedded AI agents infusion and those drive productivity and efficiencies for our customers when they're rolled out. And as an Oracle Fusion customer myself, I take great pride once again in my team's ability to have us announce earnings and give guidance nine days after the quarter ended. Many, many of our customers ask us how to replicate our results. And at Cloud World, we will be having a lot of Oracle playbook conversations this week. You've already seen today's announcement of our partnership with Amazon Web Services, which has now joined Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud in making OCI and Oracle available in their respective clouds. Needless to say, we think our multi-cloud strategy will expand the ubiquity and popularity of our differentiated technologies, especially the Oracle Database. Larry will share more details in just a moment. But now to Q1, which was clearly another outstanding quarter, with total revenue at the high end of my guidance and earnings per share of $0.04 above the high end of guidance. Currency was essentially in line with my guidance. And as usual, I'll be discussing our financials using constant currency growth rates as this is how we manage the business. Total cloud revenue, that\u2019s SaaS and IaaS was up 22% at $5.6 billion, with SaaS revenue of $3.5 billion, up 10% and IaaS revenue of $2.2 billion, up 46%, on top of the 64% growth reported last year. As a reminder, we exited the advertising business last quarter, which had the effect of lowering the total cloud applications revenue by 2% this quarter. Total cloud services and license support for the quarter was $10.5 billion, up 11%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database and OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes product support were $4.8 billion and up 7%. Our strategic back-office SaaS applications now have annualized revenues of $8.2 billion and were up 18%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $5.8 billion and up 14%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 46% and up 49% when you are excluding our legacy hosting services. Our infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of $8.6 billion, OCI consumption revenue was up 56% and demand continued to outstrip supply. Cloud database services, which were up 23% and now have annualized revenues of $2.1 billion. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, on OCI directly or through our database at cloud services with Azure, Google and AWS. We expect those cloud database revenues collectively will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside OCI and strategic SaaS. Database subscription revenues, which includes database license support, were up 4%. Software license revenues were up 8% to $870 million, including Java, which saw excellent growth. So all in, total revenue for the quarter were $13.3 billion, up 8% from last year. Shifting to gross profit and operating income. The gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 9% in Q1 as our cloud businesses continue to scale the gross margins of both cloud applications and cloud infrastructure has each been climbing higher. We continue to display operating expense discipline with Q1 operating income growing 14% and the operating margin was 43%. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 18.9% with non-GAAP EPS at US$1.39, up 17% in USD, up 18% in constant currency. The GAAP EPS was US$1.03, up 20% in USD and up 22% in constant currency. Including in my guidance at the beginning of the quarter was the expected completion of an assessment of the useful lives of our server networking equipment, including an increase of the estimated lives from five years to six years effective at the beginning of this fiscal year. This change in accounting estimate reduced Q1 operating expenses by about $197 million. At quarter end, we had nearly $11 billion of cash and marketable securities, a short-term deferred revenue balance was $11.5 billion, up 2%. Operating cash flow for Q1 was $7.4 billion, while free cash flow was $5.1 billion. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $19.1 billion and free cash flow was $11.3 billion. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO is now $99 billion, up 52% in constant currency. Now while we typically see a seasonal decline of RPO in Q1, we signed several large deals this past quarter, resulting in a sequential increase in RPO compared to the decline that we typically see based on our experience over the previous five years. Further, our cloud RPO grew more than 80% and now represents nearly three-fourth of total RPO. And approximately 38% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, which reflects the growing trend of customers wanting the larger and longer contracts as they see firsthand how Oracle Cloud services are benefiting their businesses. We spent $2.3 billion on CapEx this quarter, given the demand that you see in our RPO growth and the additional demand we have and see in our pipeline, I expect the fiscal year 2025 CapEx will be double what it was in fiscal 2024. As always, we remain careful to pace our investments appropriately and in line with booking trends. We now have 85 cloud regions live, another 77 planed with more to follow. We have public cloud regions. We have dedicated cloud customer regions. We have national security regions. We have sovereign regions. We have Oracle alloy regions with our partners, and we have multi-cloud regions with Azure and Google Cloud and now shortly with AWS as well. This sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continue to be significant advantages for us in the marketplace. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and the dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $4.4 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Before I dive into specific Q2 guidance, I'd like to share some overarching thoughts and the benefits that I expect they will bring over the coming years. First, the Oracle database is thriving, and the multi-cloud agreements we now have with Microsoft, Google and AWS make it easier for our customers to run their Oracle databases in the cloud. Second, we are rapidly expanding our OCI capacity to meet the demand that you see in our 52% RPO cloud growth. Third, while much attention is focused on our GPU related businesses, our non-GPU infrastructure business continues to grow much faster than our competitors. And finally, our strategic SaaS app continue to grow while we are starting to see more and more of our industry-based cloud apps come online. All these trends point to revenue growth going higher. We will discuss the implications of these positive trends at our financial analyst meeting on Thursday. For fiscal 2025, we remain very confident and committed to full year total revenue growth growing double digits and full year total cloud infrastructure revenue growing faster than last year. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q2, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have about a 1% positive effect on total revenue and as much as a $0.03 positive effect on EPS, hard to know for sure. However, the actual currency impact may be different. Total revenues are expected to grow from 7% to 9% in constant currency and are expected to grow between 8% and 10% in USD at today's exchange rate. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 23% to 25% in constant currency and 24% to 26% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 6% to 10% and be between $1.42 and $1.46 in constant currency, and non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow $0.08 to $0.12 and be between US$1.45 and $US1.49 in USD. My EPS guidance for Q2 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. And with that, sorry, it was so long. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments. Lawrence Ellison : Thank you, Safra. Today, Oracle has 162 cloud data centers, live and under construction throughout the world. The largest of these data centers is 800 megawatts, and it will contain acres of NVIDIA GP clusters able to train the world's largest AI models. That's what's required to stay competitive in the race to build one, just one of the most powerful artificial neural networks in the world. The stakes are high and the race goes on. Soon Oracle will begin construction of data centers that are more than a gigawatt. Building giant data centers with ultra-high apartments RDMA networks and huge 32,000 node NVIDIA GPU clusters is something that Oracle has proven to be very good at. It's the reason we're doing so well in the AI training business. It's important to remember that we first developed those high-performance RDMA networks to interconnect our Exadata CPU cluster hardware that powers our Exadata database cloud service. The Oracle Database Cloud service running on Exadata and Exascale RDMA clusters, provide an order of magnitude, better performance, better scalability, better reliability and better security than other databases. And it's still the world's only autonomous, fully self-driving database. Our large and loyal customer base understand and appreciate the many technical advantages of using the Oracle database. And those customers wanted us defined a way to make the very latest and best Oracle technology available on other clouds in addition to OCI. We found a way. With today's AWS announcement, our customers will be able to use Oracle's latest Exadata and Exascale RDMA clusters with the latest versions of our database software, from within the Microsoft Azure cloud, from within the Google Cloud and from within the AWS cloud. This will enable customers to use the Oracle database anywhere and everywhere. That has always worked well for our customers and for our database business. We believe our cloud partnerships with AWS and Microsoft and Google will turbocharge the growth of our database business for years to come. Back to you. Ken Bond : Thank you, Larry. Sarah, if you could please poll the audience for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. John DiFucci : Thank you. Larry and Safra, I mean there's a lot of good stuff here, but I'd like to ask a question on margins. You keep putting up strong cloud numbers, especially the OCI numbers that look -- when you give the guidance and you look at what you have to do to hit them, they look really difficult to do to say the least. We also assume that upside to RPO and you've pointed out, Safra, the sequential increase. I think the last time there was a sequential increase was because you bought Cerner and they just added RPO because of that. I assume a big part of that's OCI too. You mentioned it's cloud, three quarters of it. So that indicates there's more to come, right? So given the mix of business continuing to lean into that lower margin OCI, and I know you have -- that's changing over time, but it's still lower margin today, how should we think of overall margins versus profit for the entire company going forward? Safra Catz : Okay. Let me start with this and maybe then Larry can add on. So first of all, I want to remind you that, that -- remember that third leg of the stool I mentioned, which is our database and autonomous database, that is also part of OCI. And that is beginning to really expand. And our multi-cloud agreements, again, will help OCI gross margins. So that you know, gross margins even this quarter as a percentage increased, regardless of the fact that we have a lot more OCI. And so our business is really only now starting to get real scale. And we have built OCI in a way and Larry can really expand on it, where it is extremely automated. The management of it is very automated. And our whole rollout as it grows, we make more money. And as much as percentages are great, and again, our operating margin percentages continue to increase. And OCI includes not only base storage and compute and GPUs, but it also includes a lot of other capabilities, including the database, which have excellent margins, too. And of course, as you mentioned, our SaaS business, again, an excellent and at scale business, even that business benefits from our expansion in OCI. And once again, even its high margins continued to improve this past quarter. Larry, I don't know if you want to... Lawrence Ellison : I'd like to. So let's start with SaaS. As we go to autonomous database, we get tremendous efficiencies. We're moving Fusion and NetSuite to Autonomous database as we speak. We've decided everything needs to move to autonomous for two reasons really. First reason, when you have a completely autonomous database, there is no -- the DBA, the database administrator is a robot. There is no human labor associated with managing the Oracle Autonomous Database. Now okay, that's obviously a cost savings. But more importantly, with no human labor, there's no human error. It's a huge security advantage we have over our competitors. We don't -- there's no mistakes to be made. There's no human labor. It's all automated. And the potential -- when you have everything completely automated, and it's also truly elastic. I'm not going to go into exactly what that means. But it means that you've got a job running that certainly needs 500 microprocessors, you get those 500 for the 3 minutes you need it, and then you return them to the pool. So that's very different than how other databases work, which they may call -- the cloud itself may be elastic in places, but their databases are typically not elastic. Autonomous is. So we use a lot less hardware. It's a lot faster. It's a lot more efficient. It's fully automated, no human labor, much more secure. And the margins for the autonomous database business is much higher or much higher than the traditional Oracle business. And I think those margins are -- I mean, they're stunningly high. Around the same margins as SaaS which are also stunningly hard margin because SaaS runs primarily on that autonomous database. So we use hardware very efficiently. We use labor sparingly because labor is a security risk. When people are actually doing things manually, it's a security risk, and it slows down our ability to expand. Every Oracle data center from the largest to the smallest are identical in features and functions, they only vary by scale. That means we have one suite of automation software that automates all of this. Nobody else does this. No one has that level of automation, that level of autonomy. It allows us to get much better margins in our database business, in our SaaS business and the rest of our cloud business. Our clouds are more automated, so we have very low labor costs. Our networks are much more efficient, the RDMA networks run so much faster. If you run twice as fast, our costs go down by half. And our networks are much faster than the other clouds. So we think our potential as we scale, our potential to deliver much better margins they're currently delivering are very real. John DiFucci : So is it safe for me to assume that then the upside you keep putting up and you hopefully will continue to do, will add profit and that profit will actually increase as a percentage of the margins will also increase over time? Lawrence Ellison : I believe so. And I believe, for example -- I mean I think you'd find different points of view from different engineers as we move Fusion to Autonomous Database. I think the cost savings -- our cost -- our cloud cost savings will be around 50%. That's what I believe. Now it might be 40%, it might be 35%, but there will be huge cost savings from where we are now, and that's across the entire base of Fusion customers. So that's just one example of how we're using faster networks, faster databases, more automation to make our products more secure. And I keep emphasizing the security is really the primary goal. But as a second order effect, we also end up spending a lot less money to run those data centers. John DiFucci : Great. Thank you, Larry. Thank you, Safra. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much and congrats on the great performance. Larry, how do you envision the market transitioning from the AI training phase to the AI inferencing phase? There's some debate out there on whether we have an imbalance or a bubble on the front end of the curve because training is compute intensive and then perhaps it recalibrates differently somehow for the inferencing stage, which might be less intensive? Or do you see the potential for high growth kind of all the way through both of these phases? Lawrence Ellison : Well, a lot of people think that, Mark, I send a kid to college and then I'm done. They're training ever. I got four years of training, and then I can put the kid to work and they'll be doing inferencing. And that's not true. This race goes on forever, to build a better and better neural network. And the cost of that training gets to be astronomical. When I talk about building gigawatt or multi-gigawatt data centers, I mean these AI models, these frontier models are going to -- the entry price for a real frontier model from someone who wants to compete in that area is about $100 billion. Let me repeat, around $100 billion. That's over the next four, five years for anyone who wants to play in that game. That's a lot of money. And it doesn't get easier. So there are not going to be a lot of those. I mean we -- this is not the place the list who can actually build one of these frontier models. But in addition to that, there are going to be a lot of very, very specialized models. I can tell you things that I'm personally involved in, which are using computers to look at biopsies of slides or CAT scans to discover cancer. Also, there are also blood tests for discovering cancer. Those tend to be very specialized models. Those tend not necessarily use the foundational the Groks and the ChatGPTs, the Llamas and the Geminis, they tend to be highly specialized models. Trained on image recognition on certain data, I mean, literally millions of biopsy slides, for example, and not much other training data is helpful. So that goes on, and we'll see more and more applications like that. So I wouldn't -- if your horizon is over the next five years, maybe even the next 10 years, I wouldn't worry about, hey, we've now trained all the models we need and all we need to do is inferencing. I think this is an ongoing battle for technical supremacy that will be fought by a handful of companies and maybe one nation state over the next five years at least, but probably more like 10. So this business is just growing larger and larger and larger. There's no slowdown or shift coming. Mark Murphy : Thank you very much. Lawrence Ellison : Let me say something that's going to sound really bizarre. Well, I probably -- you'd probably say, well, he says bizarre things all the time. So why is he announcing this one? It must be really bizarre. So we're in the middle of designing a data center that's north of the gigawatt that has -- but we found the location and the power place. We look at it, they've already got building permits for three nuclear reactors. These are the small modular nuclear reactors to power the data center. This is how crazy it's getting. This is what's going on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open. Raimo Lenschow : Just a question more on the database side on the agreements that you just announced today or that you have in place and now added with AWS. So now that we have all the hyperscaler agreements in place, how do you think about that migration movements from database workloads that are at the moment running on-premise or on cloud customer to the public cloud? I mean how should we think about that momentum? Thank you. Safra Catz : We think it going to accelerate -- no, you go ahead, Larry. Lawrence Ellison : No, no, no. I think you're right. Well, there's two things. Public cloud is very interesting and it's very important. I mean Oracle became very successful in the database business a long time ago because one of our watch words was portability. We ran on IBM main frames. We ran on Microsoft PCs. We ran on Hewlett Packard machines. And if you remember them, digital equipment machines and all sorts of computers, we ran everywhere. And that was very important so our customers could run the Oracle database in any environment. And it's obviously -- and we had to find a way to actually make the best versions of our database, the Exadata, Exascale versions of our database available in other people's clouds. And what we're able to do is basically get OCI small enough that we could embed an OCI data center within Microsoft Azure or an OCI data center within Google or AWS or wherever we had to put it where it could be fully autonomous, where we could use Exadata and Exascale clusters. We actually were able to do that. It was not technically easy, but we did it. In doing that and miniaturizing our Oracle data centers, I mentioned earlier that all of our data centers are the same except in scale. The biggest one is 800 gigawatts right now, bordering -- getting close to 800 megawatts, excuse me, we're getting close to 1 gigawatt. The smallest are about 150 kilowatts, and we're going to get down to 50 kilowatts. What that means is, we'll have a lot of companies, medium large-sized companies that will decide to have an Oracle private cloud. I mean it's still -- there's no difference between our private cloud and the public cloud. They are identical. They're absolutely identical. And a bunch of people have Oracle -- have a private cloud, a bunch of industrial companies, Vodafone has six Oracle private clouds, for example, to run their workloads. But they're becoming so inexpensive that anyone can decide, okay, I want to move to the cloud. I want all the advantages of the cloud, but I want to make sure that I'm the only one in the cloud. I don't want any neighbors or I want only approved neighbors. I don't want someone with a credit card moving in. I'm just paranoid about security where I've got government regulations I have to adhere to. So we think that obviously, moving with Oracle database available in AWS, Microsoft and Google is incredibly important. And Safra said it right, I mean it will absolutely accelerate database growth in the public cloud. But we expect that private clouds will greatly outnumber public clouds as companies decide they want the Oracle Cloud behind their firewall in their data center with no neighbors. And we -- because we've gotten our data center -- our data centers are so automated and they're scalable, and they're all identical in terms of function, we're organized. So we can -- actually, we have 162 data centers now. I expect we will have 1,000 or 2,000 or more data centers -- Oracle data centers around the world, and a lot of them will be dedicated to individual banks or telecommunications companies or technology companies or what have you or nation states, sovereign clouds, all of this other stuff. So we think -- it's hard for me to predict whether the private clouds or the public cloud which is going to be bigger? I don't know. The good news is we win either way. Raimo Lenschow : Okay. Interesting. Very interesting. Lawrence Ellison : Next question, Shara. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein. Your line is open. Mark Moerdler : Thank you so much and congratulations on the quarter. Very impressive both the quarter and the guide. We've seen a lot of focus on the model training side, but less on applications and inferencing in the rest. You guys have a lot of expertise in the market and in the industry. You already have traditional AI sprinkled throughout all the Oracle products and capabilities. But where do you see the monetizable value of GenAI on the app side? How long do you think it's going to take for GenAI to be a meaningful revenue, not just for Oracle, but software in general, on the app side, not on the training side? Thank you. Lawrence Ellison : Well, let me -- I'm sorry, I'm monopolizing these answers. I apologize. But let me start with health care everything from us helping doctors diagnose different diseases. When someone goes in to get a sonogram, and I've seen the nurses and the technicians and the doctors actually measure the baby skull and measure the baby's spinal cord to see how -- it's utterly ridiculous. The computer should do all of that. And if there's an umbilical wrapped around the fetus the computers should discover all of that, and now it should all be recorded. The doctor could get assistance from a computer doing all of this stuff. Looking at the plaque and coronary arteries, all should be done that way. Already, we've delivered when a doctor visits a -- gets ready to visit a patient, we prepare a summary for the doctor. We use AI to look at the electronic health records, the latest labs that might've been just a few hours ago. And let the doctor know whether there's stability or disease progression or whatever the doctor needs to know prior to the consultation with the patient. That summary is created by AI, human readable summary. Then AI listens to the consultations between the doctor and the patient. This is already delivered. This is already out there. They'll deliver -- they'll listen to the consultation of doctors with the patient. If the doctor orders a prescription, the AI checks to make sure the prescription is accurate and enters the prescription. The AI updates the electronic health records. The AI transcribes and distributes the doctors' orders, all from listening to the conversation. The doctor then gets a draft at the end of the conversation that the doctor can quickly review and approve. And then the prescriptions are filled and the orders are executed and the electronic health records are updated. We're already doing all of that. But I can go on. In health care, we need so many things from reading of X-rays to just the user interface. Our user interface is so different than Epic's. I was at Stanford with my son at one time and it took three people, three different positions to actually be able to find his X-rays. This is how you find the X-rays for Larry Ellison. You say, Oracle, please show me Larry Ellison's latest X-ray. It's a voice interface. You just ask for them. How do you log on? Well, you look at the computer and it recognizes your face. It recognizes your voice, that knows you're the doctor and you're authorized to look at that, all the authorization is done with AI. When are we going to start monetizing it? Well, all of Cerner is the monetization. The fact that we can dramatically expand our health business is because it's based on AI. It is -- AI is just -- I don't know how to describe it. I mean the best way to describe it. It's not something you sell separately. It's the diagnostic system. It's the electronic health record system. It is -- the pharmacy system, this prescription system, the user authentication, the log-in system, it's all AI. And I know people think it's a separate thing that, \"Oh my God.\" And I hear a bunch of applications come say, \"Oh, we've now got AI agents we'll charge for separately. I mean -- it's -- our applications are going to be primarily AI applications, everything. How do you charge separately for everything I really don't -- I find it bewildering when I listen to them talk. I don't understand what they're saying. We wonder -- and I'll stop there. Mark Moerdler : Larry, I think you are the first person to explain it that way. Thank you. It makes a lot of sense. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Derrick Wood : Great. Thanks. And I will echo my Congratulations. Safra, Larry, you guys have had this big inflection in RPO growth over the last few quarters. Could you update us on how you're feeling about supply availability and your ability to stand up data center infrastructure in a time-efficient manner in order to move from contract signing to consumption and convert backlog into revenue? And I guess, are you doing anything different today than, say, a year ago to try and help accelerate these time lines? Safra Catz : Okay. I'm going to start and Larry can finish. So we have enormous demand that is absolutely true. And I will say that demand is still outstripping supply. But I can live with that because we are laying out a lot of supply. As you can see, in the revenues and you're going to -- and you can see that in the guidance and my commitment for this next year, and we'll be talking about beyond on Thursday, Financial Analyst Day. We have made a number of changes, including what Larry mentioned earlier, which is the automation of the setting up and laying down our data centers. However, there are -- because demand is so large, we do have to get in different places. As I told you I don't know, a couple of quarters to grow. We made the decision instead of picking up small pieces to actually wait in some cases, to pick up larger locations. And that is really playing out very, very well for us. But we are really moving and growing in so many places because it's not only public cloud rollouts, but it is also private clouds, which are in immense demand, national security regions, immense demand. And really, we are moving as fast as we can, and automation is the thing that has helped us lay this out. And the fact that it is -- we have an everything everywhere means, nothing is unique. Everything is the same, and that cannot be set by our competitors, and that helps us in our rollout. Lawrence Ellison : I just want to emphasize what Safra just said. Our private clouds are identical to our public clouds, except for the fact they might only have one tenant, and it might be in a building that you own. Besides that, they're identical. We own the hardware. We manage the hardware for you. It just happens to be in a building you own, and you're the only one that can get in. So that's a very different situation than all of our competitors, and it's fully automated. So we're prepared to manage thousands of data centers. By the way, I would compare that to Elon Musk, Starlink, where he's got, I think, close to 7,000 satellites in the sky now, 6,800. How do you manage -- these satellites constantly maneuver. They don't -- they're not geosynchronous satellites. Their low earth orbiting satellites. So they're constantly flying around and changing location. How do you manage 7,000 spacecraft flying around? Well, let me tell you, computers, it's got to be fully automated or it's not going to work. You can't have thousands even hundreds, I would say, data centers you can't have, but you certainly can have thousands of data centers unless they're fully automated. And the only way you could automate something is to make them all the same. You can't automate 25 different things. So that's one thing. The other thing I'll point out, and I think it's interesting about Oracle, that some of the most senior people in our management team are experts in building buildings, building electric power plants and electric transmission systems. Because building these data centers is just that. You can't just build a data center. You also have to account for the energy and the transmission of the energy from where it's generated to the data center. And of course, the most efficient way to do this is actually build the generation -- the power generation plant right next to the data center. So you transmit over the short -- over the shortest distance. And we actually have very senior people who are very -- actually come from the utilities industry, as strange as that sounds, that are expert in doing this and helping us build these gigantic projects. Again, I'll harken to Elon Musk. One of the hardest jobs he had in building Tesla was when he built the Austin plant, he had to build the largest building ever been built by human kind anywhere at any time. And you want to know the largest building ever built? It certainly is not the Pentagon. It's not the NASA building for the space shuttle. Largest building is the Tesla plant. And so you have to be the contractor of that plant. You have to be able to build those things and then fill it with robots that then build your cars. So you got to build the building, get the power, build all the automation systems, which is the hardest part about building the cloud or building automation system, build all the automation systems, so it works efficiently and reliably and cost effectively. That is -- and we have some really interesting people here with a very different experience base than we had even five years ago. Q \u2013 Derrick Wood : Thank you very much. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brad Zelnick : Great. Thanks so much for fitting me in. And I'll just start by saying I can't remember a Q1 ever being this exciting. Larry, we've talked about a lot of the reasons why you win in cloud infrastructure, especially by addressing areas of the market where your competitors can't even reach. But in light of many high-profile cyber incidents lately, can you talk about how being more secure, not just in being so highly automated as you've already discussed, but how is being more secure helping to win some of these very large OCI deals especially in the U.S. and other governments around the world? Thank you. Lawrence Ellison : Well, I couldn't thank you more for the question because I have two things I'm talking about a Cloud World on Tuesday. One is multi-cloud and the other is security. And let me announce right here, we're done with passwords. The idea is utterly ridiculous. They're easily hacked. The more difficult they are to remember, the more likely you are to write them down, the more likely they are to be stolen. Everything done to make passwords better has made them worse. It's a terrible idea. So we're getting rid of passwords entirely. This is the way log on is going to work. I'm going to type in larry.ellisonoracle.com, the computer is going to look at me and say, okay, hi, Larry, we're done. Why would I type in? Safra can recognize me. My kids can recognize me. You're telling me a computer can't recognize me and log me in. This is ridiculous. So we're not -- no more passwords. Those have got to go. There are other things we can do to secure network communications and we have this new technology actually goes live in our cloud this week called Zipper, it's called Zero Trust Packet Routing, that I'll be talking about. And it guarantees the -- while biometric authentication will guarantee that you are who you say you are when you log in. So we'll know, so users -- fraudulent users will find it very difficult to infiltrate our systems with biometric authentication. And by the way, there are keys on the keyboard that will look at your fingerprint. It depends on how -- if you want face recognition plus fingerprints, all voluntary. You don't have to do it if you don't want to. But I certainly -- a whole bunch of people prefer biometric authentication. That's why Google Pay is popular and Apple Pay is popular. So it's from my convenience. I don't want to remember passwords. Look at me and recognize me and log me in. Don't ask me to type in some stupid 17 letter password that someone can steal. There is that. The Zero Trust packet routing actually authenticates you from the user all the way to the data. And we've greatly simplified network security by separating it from network configuration. That's another thing I'm going to talk about. But by the way, let me go back to automation. Automation is more of a security issue than it is an efficiency issue. Automated cars, self-driving cars will kill a lot fewer people every year than human drivers. They don't get drunk. They don't go 135 miles an hour. Automation is a safety issue and a security issue. All -- almost all cyberattacks begin the same way with human error. If there is no Oracle database administrator as there isn't with the autonomous database, the data -- the DBA cannot make a configuration mistake that exposes your data. You can't have a human being involved if you want to make your data secure. Autonomy is a huge portion of it. And the fourth piece of security that I'll talk about is code generation. When you generate a computer program rather than hand write it in Java, hey, we're the owners of Java or I don't know. Maybe this supreme court said, we're not the owners of Java. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what it even means. I'm not a lawyer. But if the computer generates the program rather than a human being writing it, the computer will not generate security vulnerabilities. They will not generate something called state which means your application can't fail over automatically in case your data center loses power or burns down or something like that. Code generation is a huge portion of next-generation security. Zero Trust packet routing is another important one, biometric authentication and automation are the four key attributes to winning the cyber war. It's going to be our defensive robots against their robots, and we have to have better technology on the defensive side than they currently have on the offensive side because they are winning. I mean every year, there are more -- there's more successful cyberattacks. And you know what the FBI says when you're attacked? Pay the ransom, there's something we can do about it. Well, that's not very encouraging. I have an idea. Let's keep the ransom money, but implement next-generation technology that makes it much harder for cyber criminals. And by the way -- and it's not so bad with cyber criminals now compared to what state actors have the ability to do. So we have to harden our computer systems. We have to make them more secure. The good news is there is a whole new generation of AI-based security systems like biometric authentication, like zero-trust packet routing that we can use to stop these attacks, but we have to actually deploy the technology. Brad Zelnick : Amazing, Larry. Look forward to learning more this week in Vegas. Ken Bond : Thank you, Brad. Thank you, Larry. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on our Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Sarah for closing. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
