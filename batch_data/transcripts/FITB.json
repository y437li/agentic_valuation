Operator : Good morning, my name is Sally and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. Mr. Jim Eglseder, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Jim Eglseder : Thank you, Sally. Good morning. Today we'll be talking with you about our first quarter 2014 results. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance in these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. I'm joined on the call by several people; our CEO, Kevin Kabat and CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Frank Forrest, Chief Risk Officer; Treasurer, Jamie Leonard and Jeff Richardson, Director of Capital Planning. During the question and answer period please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. With that I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin? Kevin T. Kabat: Thanks, Jim. We reported first quarter net income to common shareholders of $309 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.36. Significant items during the quarter include a $36 million negative valuation on the Vantiv warrant, litigation reserve charges of $51 million and a few other items that Tayfun will cover. These items reduced EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.07. Additionally we recognized charge-offs of about $60 million on three relatively large credit with the higher charge-offs during the quarter expected.  Our credit outlook for the remainder of the year hasn't change absent the impact of these credits. Each of these situations had unique characteristics that led to charge-offs. We don't believe this is indicative of a change in direction of the broader portfolio. Highlights in the quarter included 3% growth in both average core and transaction deposits, year-over-year core deposits were up 8% and transaction deposits were up 9%. For the quarter, average portfolio loans grew 2% sequentially and period end portfolio loans increased $1.1 billion or 1%. Average commercial loan balances were up 3% sequentially, led by C&I growth of 4% over last quarter. Commercial real estate average balances continued to rebound, driven primarily by construction loans with total commercial real estate balances up 1% sequentially. Excluding mortgage revenues, which continue to decline, fee income results were solid, you know they exhibited some seasonal trends.  I would add that the lower levels of consumer fee income relative to what we expected coming into the quarter exhibited more than the normal seasonal softness, whether it was debit, credit activity, ATM, account household activity in the branches, all were a bit lighter than expected in the first quarter. We still have enough of our footprint in parts of country that were significantly impacted by the severe weather in January and February and we did see activity pickup in March. I don't know that we will ever get that lost activity back, but certainly the March trends continued into April and much more in line with what we've seen historically and supported by solid household growth and other trends resulting from our consumer bank redesign. Highlights in the quarter were corporate banking fees up 11% sequentially and 6% from a year ago. And also investor advisors had a record quarter, was up 4% sequentially led by solid production from our private banking business and higher trust tax fees. Our private banking business, which is a little under half of that total business line in aggregate showed year-over-year growth of 8% and sequential growth of 11%.  We continue to manage costs in a disciplined manner. Quarterly expenses decreased 4% sequentially, driven primarily by a reduction in total employee cost, so that includes the impact of seasonally higher benefits expense. If you exclude the litigation charges in the quarter, non-interest expenses were approximately $900 million, the lowest level on that basis in several years. Overall, this was a strong quarter in terms of core controllable expense management. Capital levels remain very strong; our Tier 1 common ratio was 9.5% on a Basel 1 basis and 9.1% pro forma for U.S. Basel III rules. Our ability to generate capital and our strong capital position under current and future capital rules give us the ability to support the balance sheet growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders in a prudent manner. During the quarter we announced and completed the repurchase of roughly of $100 million of common stock, which completed our 2013 CCAR plans. Also in March we announced our capital plan related to the 2014 CCAR process. That plan included a potential dividend increase during the CCAR period up to $0.13 as well as up to $669 million of share repurchases. We also will be able to utilize any after tax gains from sales of Vantiv shares for additional repurchases. We think our plan is prudent while still returning significant amounts of capital to shareholders, we believe that our stressed results demonstrate our robust capacity withstand stressed conditions and maintain a strong capital position. While there was a bit of noise in the quarter we expect to return to previous charge-off trends although results maybe lumpy from time-to-time. Regulatory and litigation costs in this environment are challenging but we would not expect them to remain at this level and we feel good about our investment in Vantiv. Although as a mark-to-market instrument, our warrant will likely continue to add some volatility to reported results. Core operating results were otherwise generally strong and as Tayfun will discuss, we currently expect second quarter results to return to trend. I will turn it over to him now to discuss the operating results in more detail and give some comments about our outlook. Tayfun? Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you, Kevin and good morning and thank you for joining us. I will start with the financial summary on page four of the presentation. There were a number of moving parts through the quarter which Kevin mentioned in his remarks.  EPS was affected by elevated litigation reserve charges as well as the mark on the Vantiv warrant which have been mostly upward in the past couple of years. We have reported net income to common shareholders of $309 million or $0.36 per diluted share. The negative Vantiv warrant valuation mark of $36 million and seasonal declines in some fee items drove the non-interest income lower compared with last quarter. Expenses were well controlled despite the seasonal increase in benefits expense and reflected the impacts of further efficiencies in our mortgage and retail businesses. Commercial loan and core deposit growth were solid and in line with our expectations. We continue to believe that our underlying trends and our focus on executing our strategic plan, position us very well for the remainder of the year.  Turning to the average balance sheet on page five of the presentation. Average earning assets increased 1% sequentially, driven by higher loan balances and investments. Total average commercial loans grew $1.7 billion or 3% with good production in middle market C&I, commercial real estate and our other specialty lending business including healthcare.  Average balances also benefitted from a 1% uptick in line utilization during the quarter to 30%. On the consumer side held-for-investment loan balances were flat on a linked-quarter basis, with growth in residential mortgage, credit card and auto loan offset by lower home equity balances. Investment securities increased by $2 billion or 11% reflecting our incremental purchases of highly liquid assets. Turning to deposits, average core deposits increased by $2.2 billion or 3% in the first quarter, driven primarily by average balance growth. This was due to growth in checking balances as well as new money market account relationships and longer duration retail CDs.  Taking a look at NII on page six of the presentation; as expected, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $7 million sequentially to $898 million, driven by a $12 million negative impact from two fewer days in the quarter. Otherwise the net addition of about $2.1 billion of investment securities and commercial loan growth drove a sequential increase in net interest income. These benefits offset the negative effects of loan re-pricing, higher deposit balances and debt issuances from the last two quarters. These activities were generally consistent with our plans coming into the quarter and we feel we've made very good progress toward exceeding the CR limit. We will likely continue with similar actions over the course of the year which may affect the NIM somewhat, but they should not affect NII. As we expected in our outlook in January the net interest margin came in relatively stable at 322 basis points, up 1 basis point from the fourth quarter. The benefits of lower cash balances held at the fed, day count and the full quarter impact of the fourth quarter TruPS redemption offset by the effects of loan re-pricing and recent debt issuances. Shifting to fees on page seven of the presentation. First quarter non-interest income was $564 million compared with $703 million last quarter. The most significant impact sequentially was the Vantiv warrant valuation, which experienced a $127 million swing from the fourth quarter primarily due to the 7% decline in Vantiv share price.  Despite this quarter's decline Vantiv's share price has increased 48% since the beginning of 2012 and we have recorded $171 million in positive valuation adjustments on our warrants during that period. Seasonally lower deposit service charges and card and processing revenue as well as lower mortgage banking revenue, each reduced fee income in the quarter. Mortgage originations were $1.7 billion this quarter, compared with $2.6 billion in originations last quarter. The gain on sale revenue declined $19 million from the prior quarter, reflecting lower origination and gain on sale margins which declined 22 basis points sequentially to $242 basis points. MSR valuation adjustments, including hedges were at positive $28 million in the fourth quarter compared with the positive $26 million last quarter.  Other highlights of the quarter included an 11% increase in corporate banking revenue and a 4% increase in investment advisory revenues to a record $102 million driven by seasonal tax preparation fees, growth in personal assets under management and higher market values.  On a year-over-year basis all the main fee categories showed growth other than mortgage. Our operating platform is strong and we've demonstrated great versatility in managing our fee generating businesses, which is a very good indicator of our ability to successfully transition from periods of peak mortgage activity. Non-interest expense show on page eight of the presentation was $950 million this quarter, compared with $989 million in the fourth quarter. Expense reserve included $51 million in litigation reserve charges, a seasonal $24 million increase in FICA and unemployment tax expense and 4 million in severance expense. Adjusting for these items and seasonal increases, expenses declined 5% compared with the fourth quarter. Compensation-related expense declined 7% sequentially marginally due to two key drivers.  We continue to rationalize our mortgage business line in line with lower production levels. Since the second quarter of 2013 we\u2019ve taken out $55 million of mortgage cost including an additional $5 million in the first quarter. In addition to mortgage the changes in the retail banking environment, our investments in and the success of our digital platforms and our strategic decisions on branch design and staffing have enabled us to enhance our services while also reducing branch cost which are down $29 million on our full year run rate basis since the first quarter of 2013 primarily due to lower FTE cost.  We\u2019ve made a lot of progress. We are in a very good competitive position relative to our peers and we believe that there is more opportunity as we continue to evolve our structure. All in PPNR shown page nine of the presentation was $507 million. When adjusted for the items noted on the slide PPNR was $590 million down about 5% from the fourth quarter adjusted PPNR. This decline was primarily driven by the seasonal increase in FICA and unemployment tax expense. Adjusted for this seasonal uptick PPNR was $640 million. The efficiency ratio adjusted on the same basis was 60% for the quarter we still expect our efficiency ratio to decline below 60% during the second half of the year.  Turning to credit results on page 10 and starting with charge-offs. Total net charge-off of $168 million increased $20 million sequentially. Consumer net charge-offs decline $7 million. As Kevin mentioned first quarter commercial charge-offs included three larger credits that added $60 million for the quarter. These credits represent three unique sets of circumstances and I\u2019ll spend a few moments on each. They do not share geographic characteristics and they were not leveraged or syndicated credit. Each contributed about $20 million in losses during the quarter, the remainder of our losses were more typical and range from 0 to $7 million. The first of these credits was a letter of credit that was extended to a public entity a number of years ago. Deterioration in its financial situation led to the outcome. We have no other public entities exposure of this size and nature. And there is no change in our expectations for the rest of this portfolio. The second credit was an exposure to a company where there is currently an investigation on the way regarding potential financial irregularities. We need to wait until our analysis is complete but once again our credit team believes that the nature of the disruption is unique to this transaction.  The third credit was to the company that recently lost key contracts which had a negative impact on its financial performance and subsequently led to default on our loan. Although the higher than anticipated losses this quarter have the effect of increasing our expected charge-offs for the full year we\u2019ve not seen a change in the broader credit trends in our portfolio. As a result our outlook for charge-offs for the remainder of the year has not changed. In terms of our other credit trends commercial early stage delinquencies, HFI asset levels and NPA all declined relative to the fourth quarter. Total delinquencies of $337 million declined $42 million or 11% and included only $10 million of commercial loans.  Looking across the page non-performing assets of $946 million at quarter-end were down $34 million or 4% from the fourth quarter. The improvement was due to a $25 million sequential decline in commercial real estate NPA and a $22 million decline in residential mortgage NPAs partially offset by a $14 million increase in C&I loans. Reserve coverage remains solid at 1.65% of loans and leases. The allowance for loan and lease losses declined $99 million sequentially reflecting the portfolio's overall risk profile and charges to the allowance.  Page 11 of the presentation includes a roll forward of non-performing loans. Commercial inflows in the first quarter were $163 million up $56 million from the fourth quarter largely driven by inflows from the credits I discussed earlier. Consumer inflows for the quarter were $93 million down $72 million sequentially reflecting the fourth quarter change in our home equity non-accrual policy.  Turning to capital on slide 12, capital levels continued to be well above the regulatory requirements with tier one common equity ratio of 9.5% up 12 basis point from last quarter. Changes in capital ratios reflected growth retained earnings beyond the impact of dividend and share repurchase activity.  We completed the repurchases related to our 2013 capital requirement in the first quarter. Repurchases in 2013 and the first quarter of 2014 totaled 73 million shares including those related to after tax gains on the sale of Vantiv shares. Our repurchases have driven significant decline in our fully diluted share count, down over 100 million shares or 10% from their peak while at the same time maintaining common equity capital ratios significantly above regulatory units. The Federal Reserves 2014 CCAR review is complete and we received no objection to our capital plan. We believe our results demonstrate the relative strength of our capital position and our ability to absorb significant stress. Given our capacity for internal capital generation we would expect to continue to prudently return additional capital to shareholders under our 2014 CCAR plan. Now turning to the outlook page on page 13, we've updated parts of the slide to reflect any changes to our full year expectations but in general our first quarter results did not have a significant impact other than on charge-offs as I already mentioned. I would note that as in the past comparisons with 2013 exclude the impact of any gains on Vantiv share sales and changes in warrant value in 2014 and 2013 as indicated in the footnote on the slide. Our NII, NIM and balance sheet expectations are unchanged from our January guidance, so I'll start with net interest income. We expect full year 2014 NII to increase from full year 2013 NII of $3.6 billion in the 2% growth range. The key drivers of the 2014 growth are loan growth and higher investment security balances partially offset by increased funding costs and some additional loans that have come under pressure. We still expect NII to trend up throughout the year. We anticipate a full year NIM in the 315 basis point range plus or minus and again unchanged from the January guidance as we continue to add LCR friendly portfolio investments and see loan spread compression. Turning to loan growth, we still expect mid-single digit growth for the full year average, primarily driven by continued growth in C&I as well as growth in commercial real estate. These increases will be partially offset by declines in residential mortgage balances and continued run off in the home equity portfolio. We expect both commercial and consumer deposits to increase. Moving on to overall fee income and expense expectations for 2014, as a reminder these comparisons exclude $534 million in 2013 fee income related to gains on Vantiv sale and changes in the warrant value. Our 2014 guidance likewise excludes any effects from Vantiv events other than our normal recurring income. Overall, we currently expect a mid to high single digit decline in total fee income in 2014 compared with adjusted fee income in 2013, primarily reflecting a forecast reduction in mortgage banking revenue of about $325 million. The forecasted reduction in mortgage revenue is about $50 million more than we expected in January, primarily reflecting continued softening in originations and the impact of our decision to exit the brokerage channel that we announced in March. Excluding mortgage we expect fees to grow in the mid-single digits range in aggregate versus 2013 with growth in all other fee categories. Looking at the details within fees; we expect to see mid-single digit percentage growth in deposit fees. We brought our expectations a down a bit reflecting a moderation in both consumer and commercial service charges. We continue expect investment advisory revenue growth in the 10% range, corporate banking revenue growth in the mid-teens range and card and processing revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits range. And lastly, as I mentioned, we currently expect mortgage banking revenue to decline about $325 million from 2013. We currently expect originations and gain-on-sale revenues to be fairly consistent throughout the last three quarters of the year. Turning to expenses, we expect full year non-interest expense to be down in the mid-single digits relative to reported 2013 expenses. I'd note that we've been managing our expenses very carefully and given the revised outlook in some of our fee categories we would also expect to revisit expenses [inaudible] on a large base so it does not change on the macro percentage guidance. We will continue to manage expenses carefully and aggressively in line with revenue results in that economic environment. Overall we still expect to achieve positive core operating leverage in 2014 excluding Vantiv. And we expect PPNR growth mostly into this range for the year. And importantly we still expect the efficiency ratio to move below 60% in the second half of the year. As for taxes we expect the full year 2014 effective tax rate to be in 27% to 27.5% range.  Turning to credits, we've adjusted our outlook for full year net charge-offs upward by about $60 million to reflect the elevation in first quarter charge-offs. That translates to about 50 basis points for the year. There was no meaningful change otherwise to our outlook for the last three quarters of the year as we continue to see improvements in overall credit quality metrics including non-performing and criticized assets. We still expect a significant decline in NPAs down about 15% from last year levels and for the NPA ratio to move solidly below 1% during the year.  With respect to loan loss reserves we continue to expect the benefit of improvement in credit reserves to be partially offset by new reserves related to loan growth.  Finally a housekeeping note. The segment reporting that we provide on page 34 of the earnings release reflects a reorganization of our business banking unit which primarily impacted the commercial and branch banking segment this quarter. This change was also applied retrospectively to our segment reporting and is reflected in all periods presented.  In summary the strong fundamental progress in our business was obscured to some extent this quarter. However with strong momentum in our core businesses and our ability to make progress in our strategic initiative of generating core PPNR growth in what remains a challenging environment for banking institutions. We're improving efficiencies while investing in our business and we believe we remain well positioned as we progress through the year. That wraps up my remarks. Sally can you open the line for questions please. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Your line is now open. Jessica Sara Levi-Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Hey, good morning. This is Jessica Ribner for Paul. How are you? Kevin T. Kabat:  Good. How are you? Jessica Sara Levi-Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Good, thanks. Just a couple of questions. The first is how much more room do you think you guys have reserve releases in the coming quarters given that you're at a 165 basis points reserve ratio? Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah, in general we've not provided forward-looking guidance on reserves other than saying that in 2014 our reserves are likely to be lower than in 2013 and we will probably stick to that guidance. We have a very solid ratio at 165 and we feel very comfortable with the credit profile of our balance sheet. And in that respect we would still expect that number to go down. But beyond that in this environment it is difficult to provide a more precise outlook for reserves. Jessica Sara Levi-Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay, thank you. And then just one question on the mortgage banking side, I know you mentioned during the call that you don't expect to see a pickup above last year or even to last year's level but what are you seeing in the spring buying season, is it encouraging for the rest of the year? Kevin T. Kabat: It is too early to tell. We clearly are now entering the high season and coming out of a very cold winter in our footprint in the Midwest. It's early to tell but so far I think originations are moving along as expected. Jessica Sara Levi-Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Thank you very much. Kevin T. Kabat: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Co. LLC: Thanks, good morning. Tayfun I was wondering on the expense side when you guys talk about the outlook you are working on for the last year's reported. So if I look at $950 million of reported expenses with the $51 million litigation and severance and the $24 million seasonal increase I was wondering if you could you level set us on how we should think about the progression after the first quarter, do we start at $875 million and then move from there. Tayfun Tuzun : Well obviously the first quarter excluding the one-time you just mentioned number is below $900 million, including the $24 million in employee related seasonal numbers. Going forward we probably will be up a little bit but the remainder of the year should fairly -- should be stable, so there we shouldn't see quarter-to-quarter changes relatively though compared to the adjusted number, our expenses will probably inch up. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Co. LLC: And could you talk -- so I just wanted ask you to explain through that, so if you got the seasonal $24 million what would the seasonal $24 million be completely replaced by if you are talking about mortgage continuing to be a little bit soft underneath? Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah we will -- there is a little bit seasonality in our marketing expense. You will see that in the second and third quarters of the year and beyond that there are really small changes in different line items nothing big quarter-to-quarter, in mortgage just because, our production goes up in the second and third quarter you will see some uptick in base compensation expense probably just for a couple of quarters on the mortgage side towards the end of the year.  Other than that it's really is sort of across the board, there's nothing meaningful in any one line item. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Co. LLC: Okay, and then on the capital side you talked about just always checking to understand forwards versus the approval is that you got on this year's CCAR so how do we think about, how you are thinking about this year in terms of getting through the new approval and any change in your view about continuing to monetize Vantiv. Kevin T. Kabat: So when you look at our 2013 CCAR plans, what we announced at the beginning of that period and what we executed was very much sub line. So we fully executed our 2013 capital plan. Our expectation is that we will fully execute our 2014 capital plans, as we disclosed in March with $669 million in buybacks and a potential increase in dividend to 13 bps -- $0.13. And those are obviously subject to Board approval and financial conditions. But in general our expectations would be the same as 2013.  With respect to Vantiv we own 25% of the company right now. The company is doing very well but we publicly stated that our long-term strategic goal is not to maintain a large ownership in a publicly traded company and we will execute on that plan. You will likely see sales this year, it's difficult to predict the timing. But what we laid out in our plan last year with respect to our thoughts in Vantiv we will continue to execute this year. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Kevin T. Kabat: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neil. Your line is open. Kevin T. Kabat: Good morning, Scott. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners L.P.:   Good morning, guys. Hey Tayfun I was wondering if you could just speak broadly to commercial pricing dynamics that you are seeing and just as you look at the prospects of additional pressure on the NIM how heavily is it weighted towards pricing issues versus things like continuing to liquidity build and prep of LTI, things of that nature? Tayfun Tuzun : I will make some general comments and I will turn it over to Jamie to comment on his actions with respect to liquidity. In general the market continues to be competitive. And you've seen that from other peer banks as well. We are now maintaining a very tight discipline around pricing and around credits attached to those pricing levels. And we are likely to see more compression in commercial loans.  As you\u2019ve seen some comments about pricing in commercial real estate where we play there is a big difference than the long term commercial mortgage product doesn\u2019t necessarily fit our balance sheet. We are not completing in that segment where lot of the insurance companies and pension funds appear to have increased their focus. In commercial lending C&I per se we are seeing continued price compression although quarter-over-quarter comparisons in our commercial unit is a bit misleading because we had a couple of moving parts in Q4 to our benefit and couple and as you will see so Jamie you want to comment on how you see this spread compression coming from commercial versus everything else that you are doing in the balance sheet. James C. Leonard: Sure Tayfun. Scott's it Jamie. The NIM outlook on 2Q as Tayfun mentioned in his prepared remarks we were -- continue to expect the NIM in 2014 of about 315. I think that is where the second quarter should end up and the moving parts there one to two bps of loan yield compression, a couple of bps declined due to day count, and then the remainder being the impact of the additional portfolio leverage and then the funding cost to go along with it. And again I think we\u2019ve managed the first quarter very effectively. We are pleased with the outcome and being up a bps well continuing to add the portfolio leverage and a lot of that was due to continued discipline in pricings in commercial auto and mortgage. R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners L.P.: Okay. That\u2019s perfect thank you very much for the color. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Kevin T. Kabat: Morning Matt. Unidentified Analyst : Hey yes, it's Dan for Matt. Quick question on the fees with the fee income guidance coming down this quarter in some of that businesses like investment advisory and deposits fees, is that primarily due to a weaker January and February with the weather? Are you seeing activity a bit lower than expected? Tayfun Tuzun :   No, look I mean I think you know we want to make sure that we provide you guys with an updated realistic look. And I clearly the first quarter activity, as Kevin mentioned result in his remark was lower than we expected and whether it was due to weather or something else, at this point we don\u2019t want to speculate but we\u2019ve seen the pick-up in March, we\u2019ve seen very good household built up in March and in to April here which should be of little bit of a better direction in consumer related fees.  In general our IA business which is primarily focused on private wealth management and brokerage is doing very well, despite the fact that we may have lowered the outlook a little bit that\u2019s still is a strong growth business for us.  In corporate banking it's still expected to be up double digits. So those are very strong numbers. We are not changing the tone of our outlook but we felt we had to make some adjustments for what these came in January and February this quarter so far. Kevin T. Kabat:   Said, a little bit differently Dan it's really difficult to tell you whether or not those fees catch up or they simply trend back and we are not going to make the assumption that day we get any kind of catch up from those perspective particularly as it relates to the consumer side of the house is just we don\u2019t think that\u2019s a reasonable expectation. And that\u2019s why to Tayfun's point we've kind of given the guidance that we\u2019ve given. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open. Kevin T. Kabat: Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. My first question is on the efficiency guidance. It\u2019s a bit of a two parter. And Tayfun I appreciate the color you gave on breaking the 60% efficiency ratio in the second half of the year. How much of a decline in your litigation reserve accrual play into that guidance? And additionally could you give us a little bit more color in terms of the opportunity you mentioned to evolve the structure? And what that can imply for your efficiency outlook for 2015? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, first of all I think adjusting for the litigation reserves and Vantiv our numbers already are pretty close to 60%. So from here on we don\u2019t forecast  Be close to 60%. So from here on we don't forecast additional litigation reserves. So my guidance for the efficiency ratio does not include additional litigation reserves and we would not make that forecast. We would not build that into our forecast. But we're confident given the strength in our fee income, our NII increase, 2% year-over-year and the ability to manage the expenses down that we will be able to reach a below 60% efficiency ratio in the second quarter. With those numbers obviously we have some expected efficiency gains on the retail side this year which we would expect to continue into 2015. We're seeing, as we've shared with you in December and again in February, we're tracking consumer behavior very closely. We've a very close eye on what that means for expenses in our branch system. We would expect that behavior to continue to move in our favor. We've seen that in Q1. We're seeing increased usage of ATM and digital use in transaction volumes. If that trend continues and I should say it is likely to continue to from our perspective we should see increased efficiencies in 2015 in addition to what we're seeing this year. Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Kevin T. Kabat: And Erika just one color on that. That's all while still continuing to invest in our top-line, the revenues and our ability to grow the company from that perspective. So we've got a balanced perspective and we're trying to make sure that we do what's best for our shareholders long-term, not just short-term given the environment that we have. Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it, and a follow-up question. There has been much talk during this earning season about leverage loans and shared national credits. Could you give us a sense of let's say over the past four quarters how much leverage lending and shared national credits have contributed to your overall C&I growth and perhaps remind us how those credits performed during the last two credit cycles versus third relative to your the rest of your C&I book? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Let me, thanks for asking the question. It's clearly has been discussed in different platforms. First of all I think relying on third-party information to deduct any type of origination levels for individual banks is extremely difficult because what's being published and what's been used to support some of the research is totally based on splitting book running credits without actually looking at how much credit each book runner is keeping from each transaction.  So for example in 2013 if you look at total lead table book runner credit, that's $5.3 billion and that's been associated with us but when we look at actual our total committed levels it's less than half of that amount and when you look at the outstanding it's close to only 25% of those amounts. So you can't -- it's very difficult to start with the top line relying on third-party published numbers and coming out with loans in that -- that hit our balance sheet. And of that amount just remember the way they define notes, of that amount only a fraction of the $1.3 billion for 2013 is in leveraged loans and that's probably in the mid-teens. So as you sort of peel the onion you will get to a number that is much smaller than what the top line number would indicate. So for the first quarter of 2013 if you were to add up the credits that we were part of as a book runner the gross number would be $2.4 billion. But our committed number total in Q1 was a little less than $700 million and the loans on our books currently is less than half of that, which is $340 million. And it's a smaller amount, a much smaller amount is again in the leverage loans. So one needs to be very careful in terms of interpreting syndicated loans volumes or leverage loan volumes because what they describe as leverage is truly loans that are below investment grade.  Now how do we sort of view syndicated lending within our commercial business? Syndicated lending is an important part of our business. As you know over the last three four years, we've shifting our commercial lending up towards higher end of the corporate volume sector, our investments in healthcare, our investments in the energy sectors and our investments in the mid-corporate sector, they all have moved us up in terms of the size of the borrowers. So when you look at the borrowers, these are companies with $250 million or higher in revenues, their borrowing needs are going to be larger and clearly no one bank can handle the entire borrowing needs of those institutions. So we end up basically participating in syndications. And the other misnomer a little bit is people look at the agents and volumes and they correlate those with leads where banks are participating heavily in either structuring or underwriting the credit, well again very long our strategy in building up and the size of the borrowers, we also have increased the capacity on the capital market side. And what we are seeing is that in half or even in some quarters close to two-thirds of these transactions we are heavily involved in structuring and syndicating these credits. So what's happening today is very much in line with what we expected two-three years ago when we ventured into the upgrades in our commercial lending platform and the upgrade in our capital markets platform and we are seeing the results and these are expected results. Today about 39% of our total commercial loans is in syndicated credit, that's the number that we are very comfortable with.  In terms of the credit profile of our syndicated book when you look at the performance of these, what you will see is charge-offs, NPA ratios, non-accruals have got the remainder of the portfolio, the credit grades in this portfolio are better than the credit grades when you look at the broader commercial portfolio that we own. So again what we're trying to do is we're trying to differentiate what it means to be in syndicated lending, the fact that it's part of our strategy and at 39% of commercial loans we're very comfortable where this portfolio is. Jeff Richardson : Let me just add, this is Jeff. Kind of going back to original question, our leverage portfolio is using the regulatory definitions, it's about $4.8 billion, so less than 10% of our portfolio and why we are also very comfortable. Kevin T. Kabat: Yes, and that's actually in the slides that we\u2026 Jeff Richardson :  Yes, and that has not grown over the last 12 to 15 months. So it has not been really attributable to losses. Kevin T. Kabat: And while we 're at it, let's clarify one more issue. Our life lending has been talked about quite a bit over the last number of quarters. Our exposure to covenant life lending is less than 1% of our portfolio. So and it's page to pay attention to the details and we're providing this disclosure to make sure that the research out there appropriately reflects our exposures. Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That is a very complete answer. Thank you. Thanks. Kevin T. Kabat: You're welcome. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein : Good morning. So in the quarter we saw a significant increase in the loans transferred to non-performing, is that related to the three commercial credits? Kevin T. Kabat: Yes. Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, and then if could just follow up on capital and the CCAR, so 2014 your submission was designed to maintain capital ratios. Do you anticipate a point, be it 2015 you maybe you tell me when we might be able to start managing ratios down to some endpoint target in the eights? Kevin T. Kabat: That's the question we ask frequently. We get to every year prior to our submission of our CCAR package, we have debates here, we have debates with our peers and everything now, it's hard to forecast that, Kevin. In this environment, the regulators are doing a much better job in terms of communicating with us. Every year this process is getting better. We are learning more about how they view capital management and learning more of the processes we would hope that going forward this process will continue to evolve in a positive direction as we've seen over the last two years. Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein : All right. And may be if you could remind us of your capital deployment priorities obviously this year is dividend and share repurchase but as we get into next year and perhaps ramping up capital return how you would view M&A organic growth, share repurchase, what your priorities might be? Kevin T. Kabat: Yeah Kevin again I think the forecast for this year is correct and accurate. I am not sure when or if '15 is significant different as we get better ideas, we get later in the year. We can give you a little bit better color on what we anticipate. But I wouldn't expect a lot of significant change in terms of the immediate priority at least as far at this point. Tayfun Tuzun : I think we've said also that we're not inclined to pilot capital in case may be there is an M&A deal of this nature. We are managing capital in a general range and like any company if an M&A transaction came along then they adjust our capital activity. So anything that we ever did this large we might -- we will probably be issuing shares and if there were small we can manage that through adjusting our share repurchases.  So our priorities are to hold capital in the general range of return and not worry about future M&A. Kevin T. Kabat: And keep in mind too Kevin again we try to be very transparent in terms of strategy for us but we have an awful lot of what I refer to as off sheet capital as well for use in case something attractive to our shareholders came along for us to purpose. Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Your line is open. Kevin T. Kabat: Good morning, Brian. Brian Foran - Autonomous Research : Good morning. I guess a few just clarifications on the guidance because we think about the asset base to apply the ROA too I'm just going to streamline my model for two lines. You have been growing faster on assets at least year-over-year on assets just faster than loans held from investment right now, is that going to continue for the whole year given the liquidity build or is the mid-single digit held for investment a roughly good guide for total assets as well. Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah, I think the way to look at it will be mid-single digit growth on loans, high single digit growth on earning assets and then somewhere in between on total assets would be the right way to model that. Brian Foran - Autonomous Research : And then on the positive advance product, I apologize if missed it earlier but could you just remind us what the impact is and the pace of that impact as we move through the year? Tayfun Tuzun :  Yeah as we know we are in January, we announced that we no longer are accepting new customers in that line item. We will continue to service existing customers until the end of the year and then we will be out of that product completely at the end for this year.  In terms of the earnings related to the early access product, those are in other consumer longer leases category and the vast majority of that line item belongs to that product. In terms of the outlook as to where that will go this year clearly we've taken out growth from earnings related to that product that we'll continue to earn and our teams are currently working diligently for a substitute product. It's too early to tell what that product is going to look like again how to build the earnings capacity of that product into our outlook. Brian Foran - Autonomous Research : If I could sneak in one last you referenced the pace of global banking change on a couple of the past calls you've talked about some pilot markets where you are testing out some new branch formats, and new staffing formats, are there any kind of early learning from that, that can help us think about what the framing of the opportunity for 2015 on the branches might be Kevin T. Kabat: Let me answer the second part of your question first, I think it's a bit early to start building expectations through 2015 but when we look at the pilots, the pilots continue to operate very successfully. And as we've discussed these tests are designed to address the customers' changing behavioral patterns. And we continue to see uptick and their activity through the ATM channel, mobile channel, we continue to see changes in the way our teller lines are being utilized.  We are very excited about how our newly created job definitions are working in addressing the combination of sales activity and the channel activity. So whether it's with respect to the quality of customer service or with respect to the efficiency that's attached to changes we are very encouraged by the signs that we are getting from the test. And we will share with you as the year goes along what our expectations would be with respect to 2015. But we\u2019d like to take a little bit more time to read the tea leaves on this prospect. Brian Foran - Autonomous Research : Appreciate it, thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI. Your line is open. Kevin T. Kabat: Good morning. Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc.: Good morning. Just a question on the other non-interest income line I know it\u2019s felt over the gains sector but if you back out the impacts from Vantiv let's say core number is again $76 million this quarter. If you do it for last quarter we are sort of in the $80 plus million range. If you think about your outlook and folks in our seat trying to model it what's kind of a core or average number you think could you use for other non-interest income? Kevin T. Kabat: That\u2019s line item is a combination of many bits and details, that includes for example our Vantive earnings that includes our rolling income and price holding fees et cetera, it's difficult to say that precisely clear and give you a guidance outlook. But in general I would expect over the next two three quarters, the fourth quarter core numbers probably would approximate what we should expect there. Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc.: Okay. And then just going back to the LTR on top of obviously the impact to net interest margin et cetera, if you think about it from a cost side and then having to calculate it daily potentially how big of an undertaking as that as far as potential cost and impact on just going forward? Kevin T. Kabat: I would say it\u2019s not as much the cost to calculate it every day as much as it is the challenge that our employee will have to dedicate and have been dedicating months of efforts in managing the data, the field and staging all of this information and then the overall IT infrastructure work that has to occur. We can do it all in house with the systems we have. So it\u2019s not a large cost from that perspective. However it\u2019s a lot of manpower to do the LCR calculations and obviously having the ability to forecast and factor in the volatility from the different deposits spaces and mixes that you have is really a challenging thing and why everybody is focused on having a buffer to the minimum components level. But it\u2019s definitely a lot of work but it shouldn\u2019t be a lot of external spend to make that happen. Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc.: Okay thank you very much. Operator :  There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Eglseder, I will turn the call back over to you. Jim Eglseder : Great, thanks for listening today. I did want to make one clarifying point to our response to a question earlier. I think we mentioned that efficiency ratio would go below 60% in 2Q that\u2019s actually two half so that was not intended to be a change from our expectations, just so everyone is clear on that. But otherwise thanks for joining us on the call today, that's all. Operator :  This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Jessica and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Eglseder, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Jim Eglseder - Director, Investor Relations : Thank you, Jessica. Good morning. Today, we will be talking with you about our second quarter 2014 results. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance in these statements. We have identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. I am joined on the call today by several people; our CEO, Kevin Kabat and CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Frank Forrest, Chief Risk and Credit Officer; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin? Kevin Kabat - Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We reported second net income to common shareholders of $416 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.49. Results included a $125 million gain in the sale of Vantiv shares, a $63 million positive valuation on the Vantiv warrant, litigation reserve charges of $61 million and a few other items that Tayfun will cover. In total, these items benefited EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.06. Economic data has improved throughout the quarter and the economy appears to be moving in a positive direction after a weak first quarter. Although housing activity was slower than expected, new job formation should continue to help households increase their spending, while they further improve their balance sheets. We are also at a point in this cycle, where we would expect to see capital expenditures pickup after a lengthy period, where business investment has not been strong. Our overall financials are in line with and reflect the current state of the markets, regulatory environment and economic activity. Given this background, I am pleased with our results and believe that we will continue to grow our company profitably as conditions continue to improve. The strategies that we have executed including our deposit simplification project and diversified investments in corporate banking as well as ongoing activities such as the enhancements to our retail banking approach are together producing very good results in this environment and will be a differentiating factor for Fifth Third now and in the future. Loan growth remains solid despite relatively cautious customer demand. Average portfolio loans grew $1 billion sequentially and $3.8 billion from last year. Growth was driven by C&I, which was up 2% sequentially and 10% compared with last year. The sequential increase in commercial line utilization from 30% to 32% is an encouraging sign indicative of the relative improvement in the economic environment. Commercial real estate balances continue to trend up increasing 2% from last quarter as a result of growth in construction balances. NII was up 1% sequentially and 2% from the prior year as asset growth continues to offset the negative effect of loan re-pricing. I am pleased with our ability to grow net interest income during this prolonged low interest rate environment. We continue to generate solid core deposit growth, which was up 1% compared with last quarter driven by 5% growth in consumer savings and money market balances. Year-over-year core deposits were up 9% driven by 16% growth in commercial core deposit balances. Continued growth in core deposits is a sign of the strength of our retail deposit franchise and the growing scale and scope of our commercial relationships. Operating results were highlighted by card and processing revenue, up 11% sequentially and 12% from a year ago driven by increased transaction volume and card utilization. Additionally, service charges on deposits were up 5% sequentially and corporate banking revenue was up 3% sequentially. Our results this quarter benefited from the sale of a portion of our ownership stake in Vantiv as well as a positive mark on the warrant that we hold. Our combined stake in Vantiv is uniquely valuable with significant remaining capacity. As we have said before strategically, we will continue to reduce our ownership in the best interest of our shareholders. Quarterly expenses were flat sequentially and were down 8% from the prior year. Elevated litigation-related expenses prevented a larger decline this quarter. If you exclude the litigation charges in all periods, non-interest expense was down 1% sequentially and 9% from the prior year. Going forward we will maintain our focus on expense management as you would expect from us, while we continue to invest in our infrastructure and business lines to support long-term sustainable growth. Credit results were stronger during the quarter as expected with net charge-offs of 45 basis points. These charge-off levels are in line with what we would expect at this point in the credit cycle and with our overall credit metrics. Non-performing asset levels were down 12% sequentially and 28% from last year and our non-performing asset ratio declined below 100 basis points for the first time since the third quarter 2007. Capital levels remained very strong. Our Tier 1 common ratio was 9.6% on a Basel I basis and 9.3% pro forma for U.S. Basel III rules. And our Tier 1 capital ratio increased 35 basis points to 10.8%. During the quarter we conducted several actions under our 2014 capital plan including raising our quarterly common dividend by 8% and entering into an agreement to repurchase $150 million of common stock. Additionally, we issued 300 million of perpetual preferred stock during the quarter. Our tangible book value grew 9% year-over-year. Our capital generation and our overall capital position give us the ability to support balance sheet growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders in a prudent manner. Along with very good financial results I want to highlight the positive impact we are having in our communities. We were recently recognized by Gallup Organization for our commitment to employee engagement, diversity and inclusion. Gallup noted the consistent investment we have made in these areas and the benefit it\u2019s had for employees and customers. Our innovative partnerships with NextJob and Stand Up To Cancer have been a success story recognized publicly. We were the first in the industry to partner with NextJob to offer job coaching services to our unemployed mortgage borrowers. We are now running a reemployment marketing campaign which leverages the power of social media to help job seekers reach perspective employers. Our partnership with Stand Up To Cancer led to the introduction of branded credit and debit cards that direct donations to the organization for every qualifying purchase made with those cards. We are the only card issuer to offer these affinity products and we are seeing real benefits from the relationship including better retention and higher cross sell with these customers. In addition, we surpassed the $2 million mark for donations to Stand Up To Cancer since this partnership began last year. Efforts like these make a real difference to our customers and the communities where we live and work and you can expect to see more innovative approaches from us in line with our focus on growing relationships with value added offerings. We have a role in enhancing the lives of our employees and customers and we take that responsibility seriously as we make our business decisions. Overall, I am pleased with our results this quarter. We remain focused on the things we can control to differentiate results lending and deposit generation, business execution and disciplined expense management. With that let me turn it over to Tayfun now to discuss operating results in more detail and give some comments about our outlook. Tayfun? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer : Thanks Kevin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. The financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation notes some highlights from the quarter. We reported net income to common shareholders of $416 million or $0.49 per diluted share. Second quarter earnings included the following items that in total benefited results by approximately $0.06. The $125 million pretax gain on the sale of Vantiv shares and $63 million positive valuation on the Vantiv warrant were partially offset by $61 million in litigation reserve charges and $17 million impairment charge on bank premises and $16 million in negative valuation adjustment under Visa total return swap and a $12 million negative impact to equity method earnings from our interest in Vantiv related to the one-time impact of their acquisition of Mercury Payment Systems during the quarter. Earnings per share adjusted for these items were $0.43 a share, consistent with a similarly adjusted $0.43 in the first quarter. Our operating results were solid reflecting the modest rebound in the economy following the weakness in the first quarter and some pickup in spending activity by businesses and consumers. Housing activity has been weaker than anticipated at the beginning of the year and consumers are maintaining their conservative perspective on new leverage. The environment is challenging, but we remain committed to achieving positive operating leverage and prudently growing leverage. I will start the detailed review with the average balance sheet and Page 5 of the presentation. Average earning assets increased 2% sequentially driven by higher investments and lower balances. In the second quarter, average investment securities increased by $1.3 billion or 6% from the first quarter reflecting $3.3 billion of purchases partially offset by sales of lower yielding assets as we continue to optimize our liquidity position. Notably, since the second quarter of 2013, we have added $6.7 billion to the securities portfolio, increasing our investment portfolio as a percent of total assets from 13.5% a year ago to 17.6% at the end of the second quarter. With respect to our securities portfolio, the absolute level of rates creates an environment that is only marginally attractive beyond the LCR driven activity. For the remainder of 2014, we expect total interest earning assets to grow more in line with average loan growth. Shifting to loans, average portfolio loans increased $1 billion or 1% from the first quarter. Sequential growth was driven by a $1.1 billion increase in commercial loan balances, with 2% growth each in C&I and commercial real estate. C&I balances reflected line utilization of 32%, up from 30% in the first quarter, which was partially offset by run-off and pay-down activities. Higher average CRE balances were driven by growth in commercial construction balances for the sixth consecutive quarter partially offset by lower commercial mortgage balances. New commercial loan production was up 29% from the first quarter. Slightly more than half of the new production was through our large corporate, mid-corporate and structured finance segments. Commensurate with our strong presence in Midwestern states, a little more than 20% of new production represented loans to the manufacturing industry. Average consumer loans were flat on a linked quarter basis as run-off in home equity balances continues to offset modest growth in other consumer loan categories. On the deposit side, average core deposits increased $1.3 billion in the second quarter primarily driven by consumer money market account growth. Importantly, we continue to grow net new accounts and our customers are holding higher average balances. Our current cross-sell ratio in retail is about 5.5 products for consumer checking households, which is up from before our deposit simplification changes and we believe that we can improve this already strong household penetration level going forward. It\u2019s been a full year since we completed the final leg of the conversion of our consumer deposit account offerings to a more simplified platform and it\u2019s clearly having the intended results both in terms of consumer deposit behavior as well as fee income, which I will touch on in a minute. But first taking a look at NII on Page 6 of the presentation, taxable equivalent net interest income increased $7 million sequentially to $905 million driven by interest earning asset growth, including loan growth and a $1.3 billion increase in average investment securities balances as well as an additional day in the second quarter. These benefits offset the negative effects of loan re-pricing and higher interest expense associated with debt issuances over the last two quarters. The net interest margin was 315 basis points, down 7 basis points from the first quarter as expected. The effects of loan re-pricing, debt issuances and day count were partially offset by higher yields on investment securities. Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation, second quarter non-interest income was $736 million compared with $564 million last quarter. Vantiv again provided the most significant sequential impact with a $125 million gain on the sale of shares and a $63 million positive warrant valuation partially offset by a $12 million negative impact to equity method of income from our interest in Vantiv that\u2019s related to certain charges they recognized as a result of the acquisition of Mercury Payment Systems in June. Excluding the Vantiv items in both quarters, the decline in fee income was due to lower mortgage banking net revenue, a $17 million negative valuation adjustment for land upon which we no longer expect to build branches and a $16 million negative valuation adjustment on the Visa total return swap. We have previously described what was going in the retail bank around our distribution network and the impact of changing consumer preferences. As part of our ongoing effort to optimize our retail distribution strategy, we continually evaluate the composition of our branch network and land parcels. In the second quarter, we determined that a number of properties we have originally intended for future banking centers no longer meet our targets. Based on the appraisals we have received we booked $17 million impairment charge in the quarter reduced their carrying value to estimated fair value. Moving on to line item results within fee income starting with mortgage banking revenue. Residential mortgage originations increased to $2 billion with 70% purchase volume as we benefited from the uptick from the spring buying season partially offset by the impact of our decision to exit the broker origination business in March. If we exclude broker originations from the first and second quarter number originations increased 36% in each quarter. Despite higher origination mortgage banking net revenue declined sequentially due entirely to $32 million swing on net servicing asset valuation adjustments which were a negative $26 million this quarter compared with positive $6 million in the first quarter. Other components of mortgage banking revenue were more stable with gains on mortgages sold, up 3% reflecting the higher origination volume. Gain on sale margins declined 4 basis points sequentially to 238 basis points and servicing fees were flat sequentially at $62 million. Investment advisory fees were also strong this quarter. You will see that sequentially as the first quarter is seasonally strong but the business showed 4% growth year-over-year benefiting from a 10% increase in personal assets under management as well as higher market values. Card and processing revenue and service charges on deposits rebounded from a seasonally light first quarter, up $8 million and $6 million respectively but also showed growth compared with last year. 12% growth in card and processing revenue from a year ago reflected progress on our goal to increase the number of cards our customers have and the utilization of those cards as well as higher consumer purchase volume. Year-over-year growth in deposit service charges of 2% was driven by a 7% increase in commercial deposit fees as we are continuing to drive deeper relationships on that side of the business. Our results demonstrate the progress we have made in forming new customer relationships as well as selling new products and services to existing customers. The positive results in our deposit fees show that our fee revenue growth strategies in both consumer and business segments based on innovative value added products and services are achieving the intended outcome. Corporate banking revenue increased 3% sequentially with a pickup in syndication fees and foreign exchange fees. Growth of 1% from a year ago is driven by higher syndication fees and institutional sales revenue given our focus on increasing (lead) left relationships to better position ourselves to earn a greater share of our customers\u2019 non-credit business. In sum, our core fee income performance held strong despite the challenging revenue environment. We have done a good job of driving long-term profitability in our core businesses, while overcoming the impact of businesses that we have exited like the brokerage mortgages. The other side of the equation is our commitment to expense discipline. Non-interest expense shown on Page 8 of the presentation was $954 million this quarter compared with $950 million in the first quarter. Expense results included $61 million in litigation reserve charges higher than the expected as regulatory and litigation costs to remain a headwind which you can see in the recent announcements from other peers. We would expect these charges to decline from these levels although it\u2019s hard to predict when that will happen. Excluding litigation charges adjusted expenses were well controlled and were $892 million which was down $6 million sequentially when normalized for the first quarter litigation charge as well. This sequential decline reflected lower benefits expense from seasonally higher first quarter levels and was partially offset by higher long-term incentives that were paid in the quarter. Our FTE count declined a percent from the first quarter. We did see higher card and processing expense sequentially in line with the higher revenue earned in that business during the quarter. All other lines were good and we remain pleased with our ability to manage our core expense levels. PPNR shown on Page 9 of the presentation was $682 million. When adjusted for the items noted on the slide, PPNR was $593 million, up slightly from the first quarter adjusted PPNR, the result of NII performance and the core expense discipline I just mentioned. The efficiency ratio adjusted on the same basis was approximately 60% for the quarter. Turning to credit results on Page 10, total net charge-offs of $105 million decreased $67 million sequentially, with a $57 million decline in commercial net charge-offs and a $10 million decline in consumer net charge-offs. As we expected, net charge-offs of 45 basis points of average loans and leases returned to trend. Total delinquencies remained low at $337 million. Non-performing assets of $832 million at quarter end were down $114 million from the first quarter bringing the NPA ratio to 92 basis points, its lowest level in seven years. Commercial NPLs of $396 million declined 15% sequentially and reflects overall improved financial results in several large relationships as well as the lower level of inflows. As you know, the snick exam has been a topic of interest given the public discussion during the quarter. Results are generally communicated to banks in the second quarter. While I can\u2019t get further into specifics, the results we received were very much in line with our own internal assessments and we don\u2019t currently expect any material impacts next quarter related to the exam. Wrapping up on credit, the allowance for loan and lease losses declined $25 million sequentially and reserve coverage remains solid at 1.61% of loan and leases. I would reiterate that future changes in our reserves will increasingly reflect loan growth more than the changing credit profile of the overall portfolio. The pace of reserve releases slowed this quarter and I anticipate that trend to continue. Turning to capital on Slide 11, capital levels continue to be strong and well above regulatory requirements. The Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.6%, up 10 basis points from last quarter and the Tier 1 capital ratio increased \u2013 Tier 1 capital ratio increased 35 basis points to 10.8%. During the quarter, we announced an 8% increase in the quarterly common dividend to $0.13 per share as well as common stock repurchases of $150 million. The average diluted share count is down another 1% sequentially and is the lowest we have seen since the end of 2010. We also issued $300 million of preferred Series J, which means the total amount of preferred stock in Tier 1 capital to $1.3 billion or 111 basis points of risk-weighted assets. Just so you have it for your models, the Series J issuance carries a semi-annual dividend, which would normally be about $7 million every quarter starting in September. However, this will be about $5 million in third quarter as a result of the shorter first dividend. Similarly, our Series H issuance carries a semi-annual dividend which would be about $15 million every other quarter paid in June and December. And the Series I issuance carries a $7.5 million quarterly dividend. Therefore, our third quarter preferred dividend should be $12 million and then it should resume its normal alternating pattern of $22.5 million in the fourth quarter, $15 million in the first quarter and so on. Now, turning to the outlook on Page 12, we have updated parts of the slide to reflect any changes to our full year expectations. As in the past, comparisons exclude the impact of any gains on Vantiv share sales and changes in warrant value in 2014 and 2013 as indicated in the footnote on the slide. Our NII, NIM and balance sheet expectations are unchanged. I will start with net interest income. We expect full year 2014 NII to increase from full year 2013 NII of $3.6 billion in the 2% growth range. The key drivers of the 2014 growth are loan growth and higher investment securities balances partially offset by increased funding costs and some additional loan spread comparison. We still expect NII to trend up throughout the year. We anticipate a full year NIM in the 315 basis points range plus or minus again unchanged from prior guidance as we continue to evaluate our LCR position and see continued effects of re-pricing. Our NII guidance includes the impact of the decision we made earlier this year to limit the availability of our deposit advance product to existing customers. We continue to evaluate possible banking solutions that would be appropriate for a potentially wider segment of customers. We are reviewing alternative options to offer products and services to these customers taking into account their needs and preferences. We would also aim for any transition plans to minimize disruption for our customers. It is critical that we get this right utilizing the time we have to do so. We will inform you of our plans as we conclude these reviews. Although the outcome will depend on the final product design and customer usage, the revenues will be considerably lower than our existing deposit advance product, but the outcome will depend on the final product design and customer usage. Turning to loan growth, we still expect mid single-digit growth for the full year primarily driven by growth in C&I and commercial real estate. These increases will be partially offset by declines in residential mortgage balances and continued run-off in the home equity portfolio. We continue to expect a mid single-digit increase in deposits driven by both commercial and consumer. Moving on to overall fee income and expense expectations for 2014. As a reminder, these comparisons exclude $534 million in 2013 fee income related to gains on Vantiv sales and changes in the warrant value. Our 2014 guidance likewise excludes any effect from these Vantiv items. Largely reflecting the current mortgage environment and our exit from the broker channel, we currently expect a low double-digit decline in total fee income in 2014 compared with adjusted fee income in 2013, which includes negative impact from the charges to Vantiv equity method income and bank-owned land we discussed earlier totaling $29 million. We would expect mortgage banking to remain relatively flat versus the second quarter for the remainder of the year. Excluding mortgage, we expect fees to grow in the mid single-digits range in aggregate versus 2013 with growth in all other major fee categories. Within this guidance, based on the timing of some categories, we expect fee income trends to accelerate in the fourth quarter, which also revamped from the TRA payment that we expect to receive from Vantiv. Looking at the details within fees, we would expect to see low single-digit percentage growth in deposit fees although commercial service charges are growing at a mid single-digit pace. We expect investment advisory revenue growth in the mid single-digits range with strong growth in our asset management fees and more moderate growth in brokerage income. And we expect corporate banking revenue growth in the 10% range with the bulk of the growth in the fourth quarter. This is slightly below our previous guidance driven by low volatility in the markets, which is having a negative impact on dividend and foreign exchange volumes. We are increasing our expectations for card and processing revenue growth to be in the high single-digits range. Turning to expenses, we expect full year non-interest expense to be down in the mid single-digits range perhaps about 5% relative to reported 2013 expenses. We currently expect expenses in the third quarter to be up slightly from the $893 million core expenses we reported in the second quarter, excluding any unforeseen one-time items. As always, we remain committed to managing our expenses in line with revenue trends while maintaining appropriate investments in the company to build future revenue streams and risk infrastructure in light of the changing business and regulatory environment. Overall, we still expect to achieve positive core operating leverage in 2014, excluding Vantiv. We expect PPNR to be relatively stable for the year compared with 2013 and we still expect the efficiency ratio to move below 60% in the second half of the year. As for taxes, we expect the full year 2014 effective tax rate to be in the 27% to 27.5% range. Turning to credit, our outlook for full year net charge-offs is relatively unchanged and remains around 50 basis points for the year. We still expect a significant decline in NPAs, down about 15% from last year\u2019s levels further reducing the NPA ratio. With respect to loan loss reserves, we continued to expect the benefit of improvement in credit results to be partially offset by new reserves related to loan growth. All in, we produced another solid quarter. This is a tough competitive environment where the focus is clearly on execution and we will continue to drive towards improving performance where we feel we can do better. That wraps up my remarks. Jessica can you open the line for questions please. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley : And just in terms of the deposit advance products, looking at yields, it looks like they are down about four percentage points this quarter to about 35, has anything changed in terms of your expectation for how quickly that does run off and just to be super clear all that run off is already or is it already included in your current guidance? Thanks. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, the progress on EAX this year is included in our guidance. I would say that the behavior, customer behavior is relatively in the range of our expectations. It is not a whole lot different from where expected when we made the announcement earlier this year. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley : Understood and you guys have not \u2013 do you have an estimate in terms of timing of when you might come up with an alternative product? Tayfun Tuzun : We are working on it Ken. Clearly it\u2019s a pretty complex process. We know obviously that some agencies have provided guidance, others are working on it. There is no full clarity. And I think we have obviously a group of people working on it and we will be working on it for the remainder of the year. And we will share the upgrades with you as soon as we have more clarity. But I think it will take number of months before we can clarify where we are going. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley : Alright. And then last question just in terms of the litigation charges I guess Fifth Third is not one of the banks that normally think about having of \u2013 having high litigation expense, but can you give us anymore color in terms of what\u2019s driving those expenses and whether there is any kind of resolution and insight on that? Thanks. Tayfun Tuzun : I am afraid I am not going to be able to give you more details than what is in our filings and you can go to our latest 10-Q filing and look at the items that we discussed. Its environmental, we are dealing similar issues that other banks are dealing with. And we expect these litigation charges obviously to end. And we don\u2019t necessarily have a clear path to calendar time and will end, but the issues that we are dealing with are not a lot different from the issues that other peer banks are dealing with. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley : Alright. Thank you very much. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets : Hi, this is Jessica Ribner for Paul, how are you? Kevin Kabat : How are you? Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets : Good, thank you. We have one question just on the mortgage banking side of the business, how are you addressing the segment as a whole and what\u2019s going in the market that we are looking probably a sub-trillion market weighted towards purchase, but the purchase market hasn\u2019t come back like we thought, how are you thinking about that going forward? Tayfun Tuzun : Right and we agree with you that our expectations coming to this year with respect to the spring and summer season were higher than what the actuals are coming out at. The volumes are lower. From our perspective the other added element is we decided to exit the brokerage channel in \u2013 during the first quarter that clearly is impacting our volumes. In terms of the remainder of this season and remainder of the year we are not expecting significant changes to our origination volumes. Our origination volumes when you exclude the brokerage channel are up at a very healthy level. Our pipeline when you exclude again the impact of the brokerage channel is actually up at a very healthy level 30 plus percent as well. So we have lowered our expectations given the housing activity that we have seen over the past two, three months. And our guidance for the remainder of the year reflects that sort of more of a flat performance on the top line revenue in that business. Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets : Okay. And then just in terms of July, have you seen any upward trends from the second quarter? Tayfun Tuzun : In terms of just mortgage or overall? Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets : In terms of mortgage. Tayfun Tuzun : Similar trends, once you get it late into the season, these trends don\u2019t necessarily change much month-over-month. So, I would say that what you are seeing out with respect to housing data is probably reflective of what we are seeing. Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Erika Najarian - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Yes, good morning. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning. Erika Najarian - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : My first question is in terms of your progress or if you prefer what inning you are in terms of reaping potential savings from your retail distribution resizing sort of where are you on your progress? And as we think about 2015, we appreciate certainly the guidance for the efficiency ratio in the second half, but if the interest rate environment doesn\u2019t change, is there enough potential savings left in the till to continue to drive the efficiency ratio down further next year? Tayfun Tuzun : I believe that there is more room in our expenses. Clearly, we have been very focused in looking at the revenue trends, in looking at the future of our businesses with and without an increase in the interest rate environment and our efforts so far have produced very good results. Now, in terms of the retail business, the demographic trends and the customer usage trends are changing very rapidly. So, we end up adjusting our expectations continuously as every month data comes in with respect to how heavily customers are using the digital channels. We are up over 30% now in terms of the total deposit transactions that are coming through the ATMs and the mobile app. So \u2013 and also our pilot projects with respect to the design of our branches, with respect to the type of employment that we have in those branches are producing good results as well. So, there it is going to the more room as we continue to invest in technology and as the customers are also likely to exceed our expectations as to how they interact with us. Going back to what that means for efficiency ratio just even sort of beyond 2015, we have always said that where we are as a company 55% efficiency ratio with somehow from the interest rate environment is very achievable. We continue to believe that. And we will do our best to time the movement and the efficiency ratio along with the revenue patterns that we see. But for now, I think the fact that we are guiding to a sub 60% level for the second half of the year is pretty good given the rather subdued economic environment that we are seeing and sort of the challenges that we are facing for example with respect to mortgage revenues. I mean, that\u2019s we are pleased I believe that there is more room and we will do our best to continue to produce those results. Erika Najarian - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you for answering my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Keith Murray from ISI. Your line is now open. Keith Murray - ISI: Thank you. Just touching on litigation expense and I appreciate you can\u2019t give too much specific information, but just curious if the increase is related to new items or changes in existing items based on what you have seen in other settlements etcetera? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, I am afraid I am not going to be able to give you more detail really than what we have in the Q. I mean, we will be updating obviously our 10-Q filing here shortly. If there is any update, we are going to communicate that via Q. Keith Murray - ISI: Okay. And then just back on the deposit advance products, can you just explain the revenue dynamic for \u201814, so let\u2019s assume for augment sake, you don\u2019t have a replacement product in place by the beginning of \u201815? Would there be like a cliff decline in revenue in the first quarter of \u201815 as you phase out at the end of \u201814 just how does that work? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. In my discussion at the beginning of this call, I mentioned that we are working both on what the product or the set of products and services is going to look like as well as how we are going to manage the transition period as we tend to \u2013 as we intend to avoid an abrupt disruption to the delivery to our customers, so more to come on that as we get closer to the end of the year. Keith Murray - ISI: Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Dan (indiscernible) from Matt\u2019s team. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. If you could just comment on the commercial pricing trends that you are seeing and your expectations for that going forward, it seems like utilization was up a little bit this quarter on the commercial side and what do you think that means for C&I growth? Tayfun Tuzun : We typically \u2013 let me answer the second part of your question. We typically don\u2019t have aggressive assumptions on utilization rates, because we don\u2019t really see an abrupt increase in the economic activity. So, our guidance really does not rely much on continuing pickups in utilization rates. In terms of pricing, it continues to be competitive. The segments that we are growing mid corp and large corp are very attractive segments for all banks and we expect that environment to continue. It likely is not going to change much. The other part from our perspective is we are continuously booking commercial loans on better credit profile compared to previous periods. And so from a new yield perspective, what you are seeing in our overall portfolio yield progress is impacted by that improving credit profile of new loans that are coming on the sheet. So, in general, we have no expectations that this pricing environment is going to change much. We don\u2019t really and we have not built in any utilization rate increases into our outlook. Our production continues to be very strong. I looked at our production \u2013 new production patterns going back to the beginning of 2011 and if you take out Q4, because Q4 is always a very high origination volume quarter. This quarter\u2019s production beat 8 of the 11 quarters. So, production patterns continue to be well, just the refi and payoff activity is producing more subdued results from a just portfolio outstanding perspective, but we are pleased with the activity levels. Unidentified Analyst : Alright, thank you. Just lastly, can you just remind us of the pace of the contingent tax liability going forward? Tayfun Tuzun : In terms of dollars, dollar payment? Unidentified Analyst : Dollars and timing. Tayfun Tuzun : The timing is you are talking about Vantiv I am assuming. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Tayfun Tuzun : Okay. So, the timing is going to be Q4 and as we have discussed this is a very long series of contingent cash flows upwards of 15 years. And our \u2013 when you look at Vantiv\u2019s filings based on what they disclosed, the Q4 amount is about $23 million. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you very much. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Foran from Autonomous. Your line is now open. Brian Foran - Autonomous: Hi. So, I guess not to beat a dead horse on this deposit advance, but is it fair to say if I hear you right, it\u2019s in the \u201814 outlook, but it\u2019s also kind of slowly starting to bleed down. And as we look to \u201815, you have to do the review on the replacement products, but you kind of referenced any replacement product maybe fewer customers that will qualify in the ability to repay, maybe there would be a little bit higher underwriting expense going along with it. So, is it right to think it\u2019s annualizing maybe $125 million I think of revenue right now? And maybe as we look to \u201815 for those would kind of have to put something in the model maybe haircut it by half or something? I mean is that clearly that half is my estimate, not yours, but is it right to think that \u201815 has a step down kind of regardless of what the outcome of the review is and it\u2019s just a question of how much that step down is? Tayfun Tuzun : Look, I mean, I think we have not provided guidance with respect to \u201815 on specific percentage terms. The other thing that I want to clarify is we believe that ultimately the solution needs to be evaluated as more of a different nature of products and services rather than just one-for-one product substitution, because the nature of the offer is going to be broader. We are looking at a package of different products and services that this segment is going to need and we are designing our offer relative to that type of demand. What\u2019s difficult is ultimately it is the new offer or bundle of products and services is going to address a most likely a wider segment of customers than the set of customers who are using our existing EAX product. So, part of the change in the revenues and profits tied to this is going to depend on that widening up in customer base. Whether the number is 50%, 60% lower, I don\u2019t have enough information, if I had I would have given you that guidance today. But in terms of there is going to be at the end of 2014, we will update you guys on that progress, but clearly the change in the revenue line item in \u201815 is going to be reflective of a more discreet change on revenue that are coming through that line. Brian Foran - Autonomous: It\u2019s very helpful. On the commercial side, I guess two numbers that I was grappling with, one on the NPL inflows. Clearly, there is kind of a walk back in most credit metric this quarter, which is good news. The NPL inflows have been a little higher kind of as a run rate if I smooth out over the past couple of quarters. So, I wonder if you could just talk broadly about the commercial credit cycle and whether do you think we are bouncing along the trough or whether you think we are starting kind of a process of normalization fully realizing that there were some unusual credits last quarter, let\u2019s call them? And then secondly, I think you mentioned the commercial core deposit growth was up 16% year-over-year, I guess regardless of whether that number is right more broadly as you think about commercial deposits, any ability you had to parse apart, how much of it is core customer growth, new accounts, things like that versus how much of it you feel like might be excess liquidity sitting around because of the low rate cycle? Frank Forrest : This is Frank Forrest. Let me take the first part of your question and I will let Tayfun answer the second part. On the NPL question, we are certainly making very good progress and continuing to move both NPAs and NPLs down. We did have a slight pushup in the second quarter on NPLs. Quite frankly, that came from a very thorough review of our portfolio, specifically our leverage book. So, we had a few credits that we moved into the NPL category as a result of that review. We are very pleased overall however with the review and the quality of the book once we went back and reconfirmed it. But the overall trend and the guidance we have given both on NPAs and NPLs projects that we continue to see opportunity for further decline through the end of this year into next year. We are working that very carefully. We are very pleased with the results today than especially with the decline in NPAs in the second quarter. So, there is still room for improvement. Tayfun Tuzun : On the commercial deposit side, I would say that the increase that we have seen is related to core growth, our existing customers and relationships. It\u2019s difficult to judge how much of that core increase is related to the excess liquidity that they have, but clearly in this LCR environment, our focus is on LCR friendly core commercial deposit growth, but there is clearly a segment of that increase that is related to excess liquidity. Jamie, I don\u2019t know if you have any additional comments on that? Jamie Leonard : Yes. I think the nature of your question is just getting in how are we modeling deposit behavior for what potentially could be a rising rate environment. And one of the things we continue to do is reevaluate what occurred in 2004 which was the last time we entered a Fed tightening cycle. And for us, three significant differences with how we model the deposit behavior going forward versus what we actually experienced back then, one is we currently assume no lag in increasing deposit rates whereas back then you certainly had a lag and how the industry responded to raising rates in order to restore historical deposit spreads. Second, we have a higher level of absolute betas assumed today than we did actually experienced back then. But then finally, to your point we do assume significant run off in certain deposit classes and wholesale DDAs is one of them. So we do model fairly significant run off and yet after all of these conservative and prudent modeling we still are asset sensitive and pretty comfortable with our position. Brian Foran - Autonomous: That is very helpful. Thank you. Kevin Kabat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Kevin Kabat : Good morning Ken. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Tayfun to your comments earlier about expenses understanding that you are anticipating a sub-60 efficiency ratio, is the second quarter where you guys have done really well and relatively well compared to expectations on core expenses, yet we see a reduction in the fee guidance and no further reduction in the expense guidance, so I am just wondering what those moving dynamics are between revenues and expenses in terms of the delta in pre-pre and what are the drivers of incremental expense growth that you wouldn\u2019t be able to adjust against the changes you are making on the fee outlook side? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, just to reiterate the outlook. The outlook is for the entire year and is reflective of sort of the realized changes in mortgage. And in corporate mortgages clearly it\u2019s been affected by a little bit higher amortization in the MSI itself. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, we still believe that we are going to do a good job of non-interest income and different fee categories we had very expectations as we updated payment processing, IA continues to be strong. And corporate banking activity is going to be strong as well. It\u2019s currently being impacted by low volatility in certain sensitive line items. The expenses, there are some seasonal changes from Q2 to Q3. The market specifically picks up in Q3. There are some \u2013 the impact of known amortizations from previous capital investments in IT etcetera. Remember we are continuing to invest in the company. We are not stopping it. But clearly what I would tell you is whether we achieve it in a given quarter, if we do see significant changes to revenue we do actually act and we make sure that our expense line does not necessarily cross the revenue growth line. So what I can tell you is so far we have done a good job in adjusting our expenses based on revenue trends and some of it obviously has been impacted by important decisions exiting brokerage channel was an important event that impacted the mortgage line of revenues. But I can guarantee you that the focus on expenses is very much high on our priority list. We believe that when you see our numbers going forward we will continue to prove that it\u2019s a high priority item. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay and my second question is the automobile loans line has been now flat line for a several quarters and understanding the competition and the spreads that are out there flushed out against the fact that SAAR industry sales are continuing to go up every quarter, can you just talk about originations versus pay downs and where you stand on desire to grow that business? Tayfun Tuzun : So let me give you a couple of data points with respect to production. Last year\u2019s Q2 2013 production was $1.6 billion I think first quarter was $1.3 billion that\u2019s down from $1.4 billion in Q1. We are being very careful in putting to work our shareholders equity in that business line and we are trying to find the best balance as we get into right profitability and the right product profile. The business continues to be very competitive, good pay off performance is really not much different, so with the impact of the outstanding volumes is really more due to changing production patterns. Our first goal is to book profitable loans. We are not going after volume and we will not change that approach. We have done a better job the last six months compared to the previous six months in achieving a better spread in that business and we kept the credit profile, duration profile of that business fairly stable. So, we are pleased. We are not complaining that origination volumes are slightly down, but we will continue to look for opportunities and when it\u2019s time to increase production, we will do so, but it has to be done on a profitable basis. We are not going to just do it to show higher loan growth. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay, got it. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Hi. Your lower guidance for fees and pre-provision net revenue, is that solely due to the reduction in mortgage that we have seen so far year-to-date? Tayfun Tuzun : Largely, yes. I mean, there is some drop in corporate revenues that are more against sensitive item interest rate derivative volume was a little bit less than we expected. Our investment advisory business is doing well, bit below because we are moving that business from a transactional focus to a stable growth in asset management, but in general, Mike, it\u2019s more reflective of what\u2019s happening in mortgage than anything else. Mike Mayo - CLSA: And is the forward guidance indicative of everything you have seen so far year-to-date, whether it\u2019s the investment advisory, the mortgage broker channel, or the MSR write-down or is that also more subdued expectations when you look ahead? Tayfun Tuzun : It\u2019s more reflective of what we have seen. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. So, there is no real change in the forward outlook, except that it starts for a little lower base? Tayfun Tuzun : That\u2019s about right, yes. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. But if a lot of this is due to the mortgage broker channel, why wouldn\u2019t you have known about this guidance after first quarter earnings, I mean, what\u2019s the new information here? Tayfun Tuzun : I think what\u2019s happened was that the change was a bit more abrupt than what we expected. The MSR performance clearly when you compare just when you look at Q1 numbers, our hedge gains were a little bit higher in Q1 moving production away from broker mortgage also impacted the amortization of the asset itself as new originations were a bit lower than we expected. So, it\u2019s a combined effect between what\u2019s happening to the servicing asset as well as the origination volumes. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Sure. But wouldn\u2019t you have known about that amortization change since you knew in advance you were moving product away from the broker channel or was there something that was missed or the rates changed or something changed, right? Tayfun Tuzun : Just remember going back to the earlier part of the discussion, somebody asked what we thought about the housing activity on origination levels, even excluding the broker channel we put on less in our servicing portfolio than we originally anticipated due to the subdued housing activity. So, we thought that the purchase activity would be higher even just based on our retail channels. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. But as it relates to mortgage really the damage has been done as reflected by this quarter\u2019s results? Tayfun Tuzun : We believe that we will have a fairly flat performance in mortgage for the remainder of the year, yes. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. Switching gears, so what were second quarter revenues from the deposit advance product? Tayfun Tuzun : About $30 million. Mike Mayo - CLSA: $30 million, okay. Tayfun Tuzun : That\u2019s a gross number. Mike Mayo - CLSA: And what was the net? Tayfun Tuzun : I don\u2019t have the credit numbers in front of me, Mike, we can\u2026 Mike Mayo - CLSA: Or even ballpark, I mean, I will take is it bigger than a breadbox sort of answer here, just trying to size this. Tayfun Tuzun : It\u2019s just about a breadbox probably. Mike Mayo - CLSA: You can buy lot of breadboxes for $30 million. So, I mean, what sort of loss rates do you have on this product? Tayfun Tuzun : Mike, I don\u2019t have those numbers with me, but it\u2019s a small number, it\u2019s not a very big number. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. So, this is a big nut to swallow here, I mean either you mitigate this or per the prior question, lose $120 million in revenues per year, is that too draconian simply to take $120 million off the top starting day one of 2015? Tayfun Tuzun : I believe that is too draconian, ultimately the outcome will depend on the transition period and also the replacement of this revenue stream. But as we said in our opening lines revenues will be considerably lower, but taking the entire amount out I think\u2026 Mike Mayo - CLSA: And what sort of efficiency ratio does that business line have? Tayfun Tuzun : A very low efficiency ratio. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. So it\u2019s pretty low. As far as your buybacks, shares were reduced by 1%, but you didn\u2019t redeploy the Vantiv gain, so should we assume maybe the pace of buybacks picking up here in the next quarter? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. I mean they should, it\u2019s more of a really calendar issue Mike, it\u2019s we will obviously resume our activities as we get out of blackout period. So it\u2019s not indicative of a change in pattern. And we should \u2013 we should see a pick up here in the activity this quarter. Mike Mayo - CLSA: When does your blackout period end? Jamie Leonard : Look, Mike its Jamie. The more important thing is the current ASR expires at the end of July. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. So it\u2019s difficult to have two ASRs at the same time in the market you can do it but, our blackout there is started with our Board meeting in mid-June and its now is over with this earnings release. Mike Mayo - CLSA: And just a follow up on that, at what price level does it make sense to buyback your stock I mean up to what price or what sort of parameters do you use for that? Tayfun Tuzun : So far we have focused on share buybacks as a systemic return of capital to our shareholders and we have refrained from necessarily acting based on day-to-day, month-to-month stock awards. We always believe that our stock is a good buy. And so far when we look at the IRR in the last two years of aspiring stock the performance has been very good. We will continue that approach. We still believe that our stock is a very good investment. And at this point we are not necessarily being guided by the stock prices today. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Sure. Alright, thank you. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Terry McEvoy from Sterne, Agee. Your line is now open. Terry McEvoy - Sterne, Agee: Hi, thanks. Just one question left on my list. Do you have the Vantiv gain in the second quarter and I am not connecting any dots, but you also had the land valuation adjustment, so you made a decision to look at the value of the land, I am just thinking about the litigation reserve, was that something that could have been taken in future quarters much like the land valuation adjustment or was there something specific in terms of conversations or something that is event driven that was behind that charge? Tayfun Tuzun : Terry these are totally independent events. The litigation reserves are tied to activity that we see during the quarter and what we have in front of us the land valuation that\u2019s we look at every quarter, so none of these are tied together. These are all independent decisions that we have made based on the facts that we know as of today. Terry McEvoy - Sterne, Agee: Great, thank you. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. As we have reached our allotted time, you may now disconnect. Thank you.",

Baird Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets Operator : Good morning. My name is Susan and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Jim Eglseder, you may begin your conference. Jim Eglseder : Good morning. Today, we will be talking with you about our third quarter 2014 results. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We have identified some of those factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. I am joined today by several people; our CEO, Kevin Kabat and CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Frank Forrest, Chief Risk and Credit Officer; and our Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. During the question-and-answer session, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin? Kevin Kabat : Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Today we reported third quarter net income to common shareholders of $328 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.39. Results included the impact of a $53 million negative valuation on the Vantiv warrant which was approximately $0.04. During the quarter, we continue to execute on our strategies that we shared with you in recent months and maintained our focus on disciplined deployment of our capital \u2013 of our shareholders\u2019 capital. In today\u2019s environment, I am even more convinced that our focus on growing businesses that consume less capital capture a wider array of revenues in every relationship and that are closely aligned with our customers\u2019 changing preferences is the right way to build sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders. Our intense focus on expense management was once again evident this quarter and represents another cornerstone of our strategy to achieve our return targets. Expenses were down 7% both sequentially and year-over-year. If we exclude the negative mark on the Vantiv warrant, we ran at an efficiency ratio just under 60% in the third quarter as we continue to find ways to right size our expenses in line with revenue trends. Certainly, there are and will be continued investments in the risk management compliance area as we take a balanced approach to expense management while continuing to invest in our infrastructure and our revenue generating capabilities. Our financials reflects some of the deliberate actions we\u2019ve taken that we believe are the right decisions to make for the long-term and will position us well as the economy and interest rate environment change. Part of this is taking a prudent approach to lending standards and scaling back in areas that we don\u2019t believe have a compelling risk return profile. Loan growth was more muted compared to other quarters especially in C&I as we maintain our cautious approach with respect to the industry\u2019s aggressive pricing and structure from both banks and non-banks that we are seeing in certain segments of commercial lending today. In addition during the quarter, we\u2019ve maintained our disciplined pricing methodology in indirect auto lending in line with our return targets. Average loans were up $250 million sequentially and up 4% compared with last year. Growth from the prior year was driven by 9% growth in C&I and 7% growth in bank card loans. Despite the elevated industry competition, our loan production remains healthy and within our risk parameters. We are managing the company for the long-term and we are committed to maintaining our discipline even in this challenging environment. NII was stable sequentially and up 1% from the prior year despite the continued pressure on margins from tighter credit spreads. Similar to our disciplined lending actions, we maintained our focus on building balance sheet strength as we took advantage of low rates and tight spreads and issued $850 million in fixed rate long-term debt. On the asset side, we reduced the reinvestment of cash flows in the investment portfolio as we are willing to wait for better entry points to grow our earning assets. We continue to generate solid core deposit growth which was up 7% compared with last year. We are confident that the strength of our deposit franchise will be very significant in the coming rate cycle. The investments that we are making in our retail business are increasingly building a comparative advantage for us relative to competition. Strength in our deposit franchise was reflected in the FDIC\u2019s annual market share data in which we grew deposits in each of our 15 affiliates and gained market share in 13 of the 15 affiliates. We also had the third largest increase in total deposits among peers across our footprint. Our deposit market share position is testament to the investments we\u2019ve made since 2012 including our deposit simplification strategy. These offerings were designed with a focus on building full and profitable customer relationships and to align value provided and value received given changes in the profitability of retail products. As of the third quarter, 33% of our consumer deposit transactions were through digital channels, up from 31% in the second quarter. As we continue to build our digital capabilities on the transaction side, we are also investing in growing the revenue generation strength in these channels. Fee income results in the quarter were led by areas that typically exhibit less volatility. Deposit service charges increased 4% sequentially as we continue to see the benefits of our focus on building complete customer relationships that we\u2019ve undertaken over the past couple of years. Additionally, we\u2019ve reported a record quarter for investment advisory fees of $103 million. We believe we have many opportunities in our wealth management business and expect to see continued growth as we execute on our business strategies. The credit environment in general remains positive. Net charge-offs ticked up slightly, but non-performing asset levels continue to trend down and were 21% lower than the prior year and our non-performing asset ratio declined below 90 basis points. Our capital generation and our overall capital position give us the ability to support balance sheet growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders in a prudent manner. Our tangible book value grew 7% year-over-year and the average share count declined 6% driven by $1.1 billion of share repurchases announced in the past 12 months. I am excited about all that we\u2019re working on at Fifth Third. As you saw last month, we announced the launch of our payments in commerce solutions division which combines existing businesses such as treasury management, commercial and consumer card and currency processing solutions with the resources specialized in developing innovative commerce-enabled solutions. Our goal is to provide solutions for complex, high transaction industries and segments, such as those businesses in our retail and healthcare verticals and to provide a deeper, more holistic experience to our customers. We remain focused on the things we can control, leveraging the strength of our core business and positioning Fifth Third for future success. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our operating results for the quarter and give some comments about our outlook for the remainder of the year. Tayfun? Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll start with the financial summary on Page 3 of the presentation and some highlights from the third quarter. We reported net income to common shareholders of $328 million or $0.39 per diluted share, which included the negative valuation adjustment on the warrant we hold in Vantiv of $53 million pretax or $0.04 per share. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were $0.43, in line with our adjusted first and second quarter EPS. Operating results have been stable from quarter-to-quarter this year consistent with what you would expect in the current environment. Return on assets was 1.02% and return on average TCE was 11.1%. Adjusted for the Vantiv warrants, these ratios increased to 1.13%, and 12.3% respectively. Although these are below our long-term targets in the more normal environment, for the most part, we\u2019ve been pleased with our core business trends and our ability to continue to execute on our strategic plans. With that, let\u2019s turn to the average balance sheet in Page 4 of the presentation. Average earning assets increased 1% sequentially reflecting modestly higher investments and loan balances. We continue to expect total non-interest earning assets to grow in line with average loan growth over the next couple of quarters. In the third quarter, average investment securities increased by $886 million or 4% from the second quarter driven by the full quarter impact of our second quarter purchases rather than an increase in investment activity during the quarter. The size and composition of our investment activities so far this year has been related to the anticipated finalization of the LCR rules. As of September 30, our liquidity coverage ratio of 92% would be compliant with the 90% requirement for 2016. However, we intend to improve our LCR buffer prior to the implementation date. The lack of directional certainty and the current global economic environment, despite the widespread anticipation for higher short-term rate sometime next year gives us a pause in deploying additional cash into investment securities over the next few quarters. We have always been opportunistic in managing our investment portfolio and timed our investments well in these challenging times. But at this time, we are exercising good caution in managing our risk exposures appropriately. We are content to wait on the sidelines for the moment. Shifting to loans, similar to our cautious approach within our investment portfolio, we are being prudent on pricing and terms and we continue to originate loans to customers where their relationship profitability meets our return hurdles. We believe that the current market environment and pricing levels leave little room for error in extending loans on the riskier structures. As a result, combined with typically soft third quarter commercial volumes, we saw relatively stable average portfolio loan balances, up $215 million from the second quarter, driven by a $182 million or a 1% increase in consumer loan balances. Modest growth, primarily in residential mortgage and bank card offset run-off in home equity balances. A positive aspect of our lending discipline is that we are seeing a slowdown in yield compression within our loan portfolios especially C&I. Yield on the C&I portfolio was 3.25%, down two basis points from last quarter as new yields approach portfolio yields, while we can\u2019t predict the bottom, the rate of change seems to be slowing down. Residential mortgage originations increased to $2.1 billion with 70% purchase volume. Periodically, when it makes sense, we retained certain conforming loan products with strong coupons and good credit to mitigate the risk to earnings in a static or declining rate environment. As such, following our decision to portfolio an additional $310 million of loans this quarter, our saleable volume declined from about 77% to 64% reducing gain on sale revenue, which I\u2019ll touch on in a moment. Commercial balances increased $68 million with growth in commercial construction and C&I, but run-offs, pay downs and stable line utilization offset third quarter production. About one-fourth of this quarter\u2019s new loan volume was through our middle-market segment and nearly 20% related to commercial real estate. As Kevin mentioned, we are seeing less compelling risk return trade-offs in loan markets and as a result, we continue to be very disciplined about the relationships we are targeting. Our loan growth numbers reflect that and may continue to do so as we are making prudent credit decisions in the current market environment which continues to feel the impact of non-bank competition. On the deposit side, average core deposits increased $319 million in the third quarter primarily driven by growth in money market account balances. As Kevin noted, recent deposit market share data indicated market share gains across our footprints and reflected the benefits of our strategies during the past 18 months. We are very focused on reinforcing our strong retail deposit base as we firmly believe that our retail deposit franchise will be the foundation for profitable balance sheet growth recognizing clearly that loan profitability is as much a function of funding costs as loan pricing. Moving to NII on Page 5 of the presentation, taxable equivalent net interest income increased $3 million sequentially to $908 million, largely driven by the balance sheet changes I already discussed as well as the benefits from an additional day in the third quarter. Overall, the interest income from higher interest earning asset balances was offset by the negative effects of loan re-pricing and higher interest expense associated with opportunistic debt issuances in the past two quarters. We are making the right long-term decisions in mangling our liabilities and taking advantage of opportunities both in building retail deposits as well as in growing our wholesale funding efficiently. As we have been sharing with you for the past couple of years, our interest rate management approach has kept our rate sensitivity in a tight range without taking outsize positions on either side. Once again, the current environment proves that anticipating rate increases in this weak global environment and building positions based on that is risky and we intend to maintain our discipline accordingly. The net interest margin was 310 basis points, down five basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by re-pricing in the loan portfolio, higher funding and deposit costs and a one basis point reduction from the effect of day count. As a side note, with respect to our deposit advance product where earlier this year we made a decision to limit the availability of that product to existing customers. We continue to make progress on designing our next generation banking products and services to address the needs of the other bank population. These products and services are mostly retail cash banking services. As we mentioned in July, we are working with all interested parties to explore the design of an extension plan for the credit product. We believe that the time and effort spent on this is worthwhile to ensure that we arrive at a long-term solution that meets our clients\u2019 needs and our goals in the current regulatory environment. We will provide detail on this and what it means for our 2015 results when we give our annual guidance in January. Shifting to fees on Page 6 of the presentation, third quarter non-interest income was $520 million compared with $736 million last quarter. Excluding the significant items noted on this slide for both quarters largely Vantiv, fee income of $573 million decreased $12 million sequentially. Looking at other drivers within fee income, mortgage banking net revenue declined 21% sequentially, which was below our July expectations. Our decision to retain certain conforming production, specifically arms and shorter term fixed rate originations impacted the sequential results and drove lower gain on sale revenue by approximately $7 million, while at the same time gain on sale margins were down 14 basis points to 224 basis points, which caused a $2 million decrease in sale revenues. In addition, we had a positive $5 million MSR hedge results in the second quarter relative to a $1 million loss this quarter. Corporate banking revenue declined 7% sequentially on lower syndication and business lending fees primarily reflecting the impact of lower loan production in the quarter. As I discussed earlier, this is an area where our prudent decisions have impacted activity and short-term growth, but we believe that we will be able to deploy this capacity at better terms for our shareholders by being disciplined. Markets are fluid and we will be focused on taking advantage of those opportunities when we see them. Long-term success of customer relationships depends on win-win solutions for our customers and for us and we remain committed to our strategies including our focus on cultivating lead left relationships and targeting key industry verticals. Card and processing revenues declined $1 million from a seasonally strong second quarter results and was up $6 million from the third quarter last year as we continue to drive deeper into our existing customer base through greater card utilization and higher consumer purchase volume. We had solid results in our deposit service charges and investment advisory revenue captions, up 4% and 1% respectively from the second quarter. Retail deposit service charges increased 9% sequentially, reflecting the additional day in the quarter as well as higher overdraft occurrences. Within investment advisors, our shift to recurring revenue streams and an increase in market value led to a record quarter of fee income of $103 million, up 6% over last year with increases in personal asset management fees and securities and brokerage fees. We also continue to manage expenses tightly to maintain our status as one of the more efficiency focused banks while still investing in our company. We show non-interest expense on Page 7 of the presentation. Expenses came in at $888 million this quarter, compared with $954 million in the second quarter. This was our lowest level of reported expenses in five years. Adjusted for the items listed on the slide, which include elevated litigation reserve charges in prior quarters, non-interest expense of $882 million was down $10 million sequentially, driven by lower compensation expense reflecting the second quarter payout of long-term incentives as well as another 1% reduction in headcount in the third quarter. This was primarily due to additional reductions in retail staffing, as branch transactions declined another 4% in the quarter and were down 10% from the prior year. In addition, although there were a few million dollars of seasonal benefits in our total expenses, our core performance still help us achieve operating leverage during the quarter including a sub-60% efficiency ratio. PPNR on Page 8 of the presentation was $535 million. When adjusted for the items noted on the slide, PPNR was $594 million, up $1 million from the second quarter adjusted PPNR, primarily the result of our core expense discipline. The efficiency ratio adjusted on the same basis was 59.5% for the quarter. Turning to credit results on Page 9. Total net charge-offs of $115 million increased $14 million sequentially with the increase was evenly between commercial and consumer net charge-offs. Net charge-offs were 50 basis points of average loans. The increase in consumer net charge-offs was spread across the portfolio, while on the commercial side, a $19 million increase in C&I net charge-offs was partially offset by a $12 million decline in commercial real estate net charge-offs. Although there is some variability in the results at these low levels, we do believe there is further room for improvement here, primarily in consumer. Non-performing assets, excluding loans held for sale of $796 million at quarter end were down $36 million from the second quarter bringing the NPA ratio to 88 basis points, its lowest level in seven years. Commercial NPAs and consumer NPAs decreased $25 million and $11 million respectively from the second quarter. Commercial delinquencies and consumer delinquencies over 90 days past due continue to trend lower. Wrapping up on credit, the allowance for loan lease losses declined $44 million sequentially and reserve coverage remains solid at 1.56% of loans and leases. Looking at capital on Slide 10. Capital levels continue to be strong and well above regulatory requirements. The Tier-1 common equity ratio on a Basel-1 basis was 9.6%, up three basis points from last quarter. Pro forma for Basel 3, our common equity Tier-1 ratio was 9.4% and increased 12 basis points from last quarter. At the end of the third quarter, the average diluted share count was down another 1% sequentially and it\u2019s the lowest we have seen since the end of 2010. During the quarter, we announced common stock repurchases of 225 million. That ASR was settled last week and we received an additional 1.9 million shares which makes the total for the entire transaction approximately to 11.2 million shares. Now turning to the outlook on Page 11. We have updated parts of this slide to reflect any changes to our full year expectations, but the remainder of my comments will focus more on our current outlook for the fourth quarter. As in the past, comparisons exclude the impact of any gains on Vantiv share sales and changes in the warrant value in 2014 and 2013 as indicated in the footnote of this slide. I\u2019ll start with net interest income. We expect full year 2014 NII to increase about 1% from full year 2013 NII of$ 3.6 billion. The slight change in our full year outlook reflects the decisions we made in the third quarter to issue debt ahead of our planned schedule and temporarily delay additional investment portfolio leverage. These actions cost us about $12 million. Additionally, our revised guidance reflects a lower level of fourth quarter commercial loan outstanding as we are starting the quarter at a lower level than we had anticipated due to the reasons we\u2019ve already discussed. So for the fourth quarter, we expect NII to be down a few million dollars compared with the third quarter. We anticipate a full year NIM slightly less than 315 basis points, given our expectation for further margin compression in the fourth quarter. We expect NIM to be down about six basis points from the third quarter which includes two basis points due to higher cash balances we expect to carry in the fourth quarter, as well as one basis point from the full quarter impact of our $850 million debt issuance. Otherwise, we generally expect loan growth in the fourth quarter to offset continued re-pricing in the portfolio as we continue to take a disciplined approach. Turning to loan growth, we still expect mid-single-digit growth for the full year, although towards the lower end of that range than we had anticipated coming into the year, as a result of my earlier discussion on the environment. We expect sequential growth in the fourth quarter of 1% driven by growth in C&I and commercial construction loans. We now expect a mid to high-single-digit increase in deposits as we further prioritize the value of deposits on the balance sheet. Moving on to overall fee income and expense expectations for the fourth quarter. We currently expect fee income to increase in the mid to high-single-digits from $573 million excluding the impact of Vantiv warrant reported in the third quarter, otherwise, the increase is expected to be driven by growth in corporate banking revenue in the 15% range due to seasonally stronger business lending and syndication fees relative to the third quarter. In addition, excluding any hedge related variability, we expect flat mortgage-banking revenue in the fourth quarter. And last, fourth quarter fee income should include the $23 million benefit from the annual tax receivable agreement payment that we expect to receive from Vantiv which is an ongoing long-term benefit that we received from them as part of the overall relationship including a direct ownership and warrant position. Turning to expenses. We currently expect fourth quarter expenses to be up in the low to mid-single-digit range due primarily to seasonally higher compensation-related expense based on our expectations for business activity levels during the quarter and continued investments in risk management and compliance including an uptick in fee card related expenses. The sequential increase is also somewhat higher given some of the seasonal benefits in the third quarter as I mentioned earlier. We remain committed to managing our expenses in line with revenue trends, while maintaining appropriate investments in the company to build future revenue streams. We don\u2019t typically highlight expense savings initiatives publicly as they are included in our ongoing numbers. As such, the efficiency ratio is part of the internal benchmarks that are used to evaluate management\u2019s performance. Having said that, we also acknowledge that there is a focus in the industry on improving risk and compliance infrastructure in light of the changing business and regulatory environment and we will increase our investments in that area as well. We don\u2019t necessarily view these as pure carrying costs rather we believe that such investments ultimately will build the competitive advantage for us going forward. Overall, excluding the impact of the warrants, we expect PPNR to be up in the fourth quarter and we still expect to achieve positive core operating leverage in 2014, excluding Vantiv with the efficiency ratio improving about 80 basis points relative to 2013 and the impact of our expenses has been offsetting declines in revenue. As for taxes, we expect the full year 2014 effective tax rate to be about 27%. Turning to credit, our outlook for the full year net charge-off ratio is now in the mid-50 basis points range, given that we are at 57 basis points year-to-date. Fourth quarter net charge-offs are expected to decline by about 10% from the third quarter level. We still expect a significant decline in NPAs compared with 2013, down about 20%, further reducing the NPA ratio. With respect to loan loss reserves, we continue to expect the benefit of improvement in credit results to be partially offset by new reserves related to loan growth. Overall, our outlook is reflective of what we see in the current environment, how we are reacting to that environment and our focus on building long-term shareholder value by maintaining discipline in all areas that we control. The decisions that we are making are less reliant on the anticipation of a better environment, but more on maintaining stability in our results. One housekeeping note, we added a slide in the appendix on Page 15 that provides some more detail around the assumptions that drive our asset sensitivity. I wanted to make sure that you are aware of that and mention a few items. First, our balance sheet is well positioned for rising rates while being mindful of the downside rate risks. Second, our sensitivity assumptions are more conservative than what we experienced in 2004 through 2006 with deposit data of 70% and no lag in raising rates. Finally, we show our asset sensitivity for our current balance sheet as well as our forecasted balance sheet with the measures being fairly comparable. To wrap up my remarks, I just add that the fourth quarter is underway; we look to continue with positive momentum in our results through the year end and beyond. We believe our strategies position the company for success now and in the future and we will continue to appropriately invest to strengthen our competitive edge and optimize shareholder value. With that, let\u2019s open the lines for questions. Susan? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill: Hey, Tayfun and Eglseder, well, something you could expand upon some of the comments you made about maybe a more conservative posture towards kind of the securities portfolio and I guess, or gather maybe seeing a little shorter, can you take a little bit about ramification of that in other words, even though the yields aren\u2019t necessarily attractive, I guess they may be lower, they are shorter you face though, the shortage around the yield curve. So can you talk about sort of the costs versus longer-term earnings pick up dynamic that you had thought about? And then, would that imply that there might be renewed margin pressure, kind of, just kind of beyond the fourth quarter if the tactics on managing the securities portfolio a little different? Tayfun Tuzun : Sure. Good question. Obviously, this environment makes us think five times before we build strategies and tactics. I just have to point out that over the past three years; we\u2019ve dealt very well with the volatility in interest rates. Now when markets were anticipating rate increases, we were cautious, we maintained our rate sensitivity within a very tight range and a lot of that actually has to do with the way we invested in the portfolio. We kept the size very small for that reason. And so the experience that actually we\u2019ve gained throughout the last two three years in this environment is helping us now. In terms of activity in this environment, we are just not adding the leverage to the portfolio. We just don\u2019t believe that the risk return profile of those investments at this point are attractive enough and we are willing to sustain a little bit short-term pain for that because I think in the long-term, being able to invest, although I have to say that we don\u2019t know yet when that environment will realize. But, at 2% 10 year and even the short end of the curve being where it is, I think we will remain on the sidelines which obviously from a NIM perspective actually, it\u2019s not that hurtful, but from an NII perspective, we will have some short-term pain as we actually discussed in this script. I\u2019ll turn it over to Jamie for further comments as he and his team have been watching these markets very closely. Jamie Leonard : Yes, thanks, Tayfun and Scott, as Tayfun was mentioning, we\u2019ve pushed out additional investments while also still achieving a 92% LCR and we\u2019ve done that by taking the pain on the funding side with the debt issuances. We pulled forward the $850 million fixed rate. So we\u2019ve had the NIM compression on the funding side while not able to enjoy all the benefits on the asset side by holding the elevated cash levels looking at we would expect by at least mid-2015 to be able to put that money to work, but that our forecast is based on several quarter delay and additional timing. And then the other part of your question related to just the rate environment and the outlook, really if you go through each of our quarters, the last three quarters, the loan yields have compressed five basis points of NIM impact in the first quarter, four in the second, two in the third, so you are really seeing that dissipating and stabilizing here. So I wouldn\u2019t expect the whole lot more in terms of loan yields compression. But what you will see and what Tayfun mentioned in terms of the fourth quarter, just remaining carryover effect of the funding actions in the fourth from the third quarter will cost us two to three basis points and then holding those cash levels, cost us another two basis points in the fourth. So we are looking at a NIM in the three or four range and then, maybe a little bit of a BIP or two maybe in the first quarter. But really, we\u2019ve really taken the pain from the LCR in terms of the NIM compression and really we\u2019ll just \u2013 NII and NIM expansion beyond this will be reliant upon this market selling off here. Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill: Okay, perfect. I appreciate that. And then maybe, either Jamie or Tayfun just as a follow-on on rates, I guess who knows what\u2019s going to happen with either the short end or they occur more broadly, but if the FED does indeed act next year but the long end of the curve kind of stays low, what\u2019s your attitude kind of qualitatively for that kind of environment, to the, I guess, you get relief on the capital side and then there may be some relief on the short-term and \u2013 but how would you think about that sort of situation? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, I think you are right. Clearly, 30 days ago, the likelihood of us being in this environment was as high as the rest making the play-off, such as time the rest didn\u2019t make the play-off, but here we are in this environment. And at the same time, this morning\u2019s economic data indicated the job, those claims at the lowest levels since April of 2000. So, it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly how this is going to play out in the global context and what the FED will do. But, part of the discussion that we had today, not only with respect to interest rate risk, but with respect to the market and other risks that are being priced, is very related to the environment and we are very cognizant of that. There is a lot of liquidity chasing a lot of unattractive yields and if this market environment continues to be exactly the way it is today, we will maintain our discipline. But at the same time, we are looking at our financials a little bit more broadly than just net interest income and we\u2019ve been able to manage our performance in line with the environment, whether it\u2019s related to your investments in fee income-producing businesses or managing expenses, we will react accordingly. I think, our tactics and strategies are dependent on the background and how that background shapes, but we\u2019ve been able to show that we are nimble and we make the right decisions and we will do so without necessarily stretching for additional risks. Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill: All right, perfect. Thanks a lot. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin. Your line is open. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies: Thanks, good morning. Tayfun, I was wondering if you could just help us just get some true up the pre-pri comments about third to fourth. So, we are talking about off of a base of 590 for the third quarter when you talked about pre-pri still being up in the fourth quarter? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies: Okay, so, and then as you guys think about looking out to next year, just in general terms again talking all your points about how challenging it is, do you believe you\u2019ll still be able to build upon this base of pre-tax pre-provision from here, given the dynamics that we are hearing you guys talk through about some of the revenue challenges but the better expense performance. How do you think that\u2019s all going to have to \u2013 how do you think that as you start to think about next year\u2019s planning, what would be the key drivers there? Tayfun Tuzun : Sure, Ken, as you can imagine, we are working on our 2015 numbers as we speak and events like this week and changes in volatility obviously changes our plans as we move forward. 2014 was not necessarily a breezy year for us either, but in this environment, we\u2019ve done pretty well and as we look forward to 2015, we still believe that along with additional investments in areas that we mentioned during our introduction, we still have room to continue to manage this business efficiently. We are very keen on managing sales force effectiveness in this environment as production fluctuates; we need to make sure that we are getting the highest efficiency from our sales force. We are working on significant efforts to control third-party large vendor expenses. We are looking at outsourcing opportunities. So there is still tools in the clause but, that we have available to us in 2015. And we also clearly are investing in the business to drive revenues, whether it\u2019s in commercial capital markets, in the payments business, in retail, we are not \u2013 I mean, as Kevin mentioned, I mentioned during the introduction, we are spending money to increase revenues in the retail channel through digital channel. So they still will help us to maintain a stable and healthy revenues going forward and we still have tools. But we will share more of this with you in January when we update our 2015 numbers. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies: Okay and then just last clarification, just going back to the pre-pri. So the growth after the third quarter includes the $23 million Vantiv? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, it does. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies: It includes it. Okay, got it. All right, thank you. Tayfun Tuzun : I mean, that\u2019s now \u2013 I mean, I have to say that number is now built into our income because as we\u2019ve discussed with many of you over the past year or so, we are looking at 15 plus years of cash flows coming from the ETRA agreements. It is part of how we plan the spin-off and it\u2019s part of how we retain the value from Vantiv. So, it is very much part of our core earnings. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies: Understood, okay, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Yes, thank you. My first question, we appreciate the guidance on mortgage revenues for next year, but we heard another bank earlier this morning say that just over the past few days they\u2019ve gotten quite a significant bump up in refi and I was wondering given the fluidity of the rate situation, if we could see a better than expected volume, refi volume quarter for you guys? Jamie Leonard : Yes, Erika, it\u2019s Jamie. I\u2019d say the same is true here. Our volume has picked up from about a $20 million a day up to $38 million application day, yesterday. So, yes, refi volumes are picking up, but, we\u2019ll see how long that holds if I were truly prophetic and had put in the interest rate sensitivity slide on Page 15 that had a flat and fall scenario which you would see for us is about 1% NII decline but more than made up for by that mortgage banking revenue and refi. So we think we are well positioned and have a nice diversified balance sheet and business to really battle through this type of environment if it were to stay this way for a while. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, Erika it\u2019s a little difficult to give you a different picture this morning after an inter-day volatility that we saw yesterday between 187 and wherever that today started 220. So as we sort of continue to observe the markets and see wherever this ends, we will clearly update our internal discussions and then if we have a chance, we\u2019ll update that as well. Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Great, and in terms of your comments about scaling back in certain lending products. Could you tell us specifically where in commercial you feel like that the industry risk tolerance above yours and is it the credit structures that give you pause or is it pricing or both? Kevin Kabat : It is both and when you look at our production levels for this quarter, the largest portion of our commercial production came through our middle-market segment. That segment clearly is a little bit more isolated and it\u2019s healthier. We have good existing relationships that drive better outcomes. But broadly, what we are seeing is, both from some larger banks, larger than us, and non-banks, there is a stretch in structures. For example, we have \u2013 I was looking at specific deals. We have certain amortization targets and typically our amortization targets are no less than 50%, no less than 40% for certain structures. We are seeing now lenders extending credits with no amortization. We are seeing multiples of leverage above us and offers. We are seeing on a combined basis with structural elements, leverage elements, significantly lower coupons. And we don\u2019t view that as healthy. There are reasons why I guess banks and non-banks are doing this. But we are seeing that in different industries in different segments and that\u2019s what gave us a pause. So it\u2019s a combination of both rates and risk parameters. In some instances, even with higher rates, we would not compromise from structural elements or covenant requirements. In others though, we are willing to look at risk offers, priced appropriately but even there, we are seeing stretched parameters and Frank, I don\u2019t know if you add additional comments on that. Frank Forrest : No, the only \u2013 you asked about where we are pulling back. We\u2019ve certainly like most banks taken a hard look at our leverage books. We did that proactively at the end of the first quarter prior to the shared national credit exam and as a result of that made some adjustments in our underwriting criteria and also our caps on overall risk appetite that we b believe were prudent. We shared those proactively with our examiners. They agreed with our assessment. So we feel very good that we are positioning that book appropriately given the overall concerns that the regulators had. Back to Tayfun\u2019s point though, however on the leverage book, one of the major concerns that has been expressed has been on the covenant light deals and that\u2019s not an issue with Fifth Third less than 1% of our leverage books is covenant light. So we are sticking with good structure ensuring we are getting paid for the risk and doing credits today with companies that we know very well that we underwrite very carefully and prudently and do good due diligence. So, that\u2019s one area I think we\u2019ve acted prudently to pull back although we are still bullish on doing good business, good leverage business with the right customers. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, the good thing is that, on the leverage side, that portfolio for us has stayed at the same dollar number for the last two years. We\u2019ve been fairly focused on making sure that we are doing the right deal. So, again, we are happy with where we are, where our portfolio is, but we are not willing to fairly stretch to add growth. Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Got it and then like to just sneak one more in here. With your loan to deposit ratio on a core basis over a 100%, do you have targets in terms of where you like to lower that to in potential anticipation of a rising short end and if there is something that you are seeing that would cause deposit betas to be 20 percentage point higher or is that model conservatism? Kevin Kabat : Erika, this is Kevin. Here is what I would tell you. We still believe very strongly in core deposit growth as one of the fundamental pieces of relationship in the business. So our focus there has never veined. We continue to be strong in terms of that as I\u2019ve indicated in my scripting in some of the FDIC data. So we still see very strong growth opportunity from that perspective and we think that will help position us well on a go forward basis in terms of the franchise as well. So, I think the one thing that we as a bank and the industry as a whole are in debate in terms of how conservative the betas are in anticipation of a change in rates and what both companies and individuals do with all the liquidity. At that point, I think our point would be that we are conservatively looking at it and trying not to be in a position where we had surprised if and when that situation occurs. So, that\u2019s really kind of the way we are positioned and why Tayfun detailed that additional page we put in the appendix. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, and as Kevin mentioned, we truly view our retail deposit franchise as the cornerstone of this franchise for balance sheet growth going forward. We spend a lot of time because, whether it\u2019s related to the LCR rules or just the state of the regulatory \u2013 other regulatory rules, retail deposits in any environment \u2013 in any rate environments are going to be extremely important across the board for all of our businesses. So, we are spending quite a bit of time and maintaining that perspective. Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great, thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Two questions for you. The first, in terms of the deposit to advance product it sounds like you are still working on that, but, from a conceptual standpoint, when you do eventually figure out what new products you want to introduce, is there a ramp up period such that you started in 2015, it takes a long time to really get customer adoption or is it a product potentially that gets a very fast ramp that you get more of them that sooner. Jamie Leonard : Yes, Ken, you do have to look at that question in terms of kind of strategically how we are viewing it. We think for the most part, the core banking bundles that we\u2019ve been talking about which really exclude our orientation around what credit offerings we include there. We think we\u2019ll build over time and we think there is a real need and we think there is something from our product offering that makes a lot of sense for us to do that. So we are moving forward with that. Whether or not, as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, it includes a small dollar credit, we are still strategically in discussions about still evaluating and we are watching what both the marketplace needs would be as well as the regulatory environment. So we\u2019ll balance that that could be a much faster adoption rate simply because of what we see as the need in terms of the environment in that customer base. So, we\u2019ll have more for you as Tayfun mentioned as we look at 2015, but we really see those as kind of two pieces. Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Got it, okay. And then the other question I had, just in terms of mortgage banking if I heard right, it sounds like your gain on sale margin was lower because of your decision to retain, I guess more adjustable rate mortgages. Is that decision something that you anticipate to hold steady, because it\u2019s kind of like you expect the revenues for mortgage banking is a constant which implies that no change to what you are doing or is there other drivers there? Jamie Leonard : So, Ken, actually margin was not necessarily, a shrinking margin during the quarter was not necessarily related to the retention decision, but, I mean, as days like yesterday would require, we will take a look at our thoughts on that retention. For now we are still \u2013 and our guidance basically assumes that we will continue that through the end of the year. I think it was a good decision and \u2013 but over the next days and weeks, we are going to re-evaluate it. Again, once we see a level of stability in rates. Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Got it. So the drop in margin was mostly just due to \u2013 I guess industry factors, not your portfolio. Jamie Leonard : Yes, exactly, it was not related to retention. Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Understood, all right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura. Your line is open. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : Thanks, good morning. To-date, there hasn't really been much of an earnings drag from the sale of your interest in Vantiv given that it\u2019s continued to grow its earnings base even as your ownership stake has decreased. Can you talk about how going forward you guys are thinking about the eventual pressure from the lost earnings stream as you continue to sell down your stake, I know that that is still a ways off, but perhaps just conceptually if you could speak to that? Tayfun Tuzun : Sure, with respect to Vantiv, our strategy has not changed; our long stated strategy of reducing our ownership in the company has not changed. We are very well aware obviously, just purely with respect to the earnings stream, but at the same time, we\u2019ve been obviously buying back our shares when we do see Vantiv, that sort of has been mildly accretive so far. So we have to take that into account and our assumption is that unless a better opportunity comes along, we will continue to execute or exit in a similar fashion. But in terms of just to focus on dollar earnings, the reason why we\u2019ve been investing in fee income producing businesses obviously is going to contribute to a capture of that line item. But we are not specifically focusing on that line item as again we\u2019ve been able to reduce our share count. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : Okay, so, the reduction in the share count, and you get the benefit at the time that it\u2019s done, but then going forward as that earnings stream \u2013 as you lose that earnings stream, you have to replace that with some other fee income and so the investments that you\u2019ve been making in other fee income businesses is where you expect you will be able to kind of make up the lost Vantiv earnings stream over time? Is that the right way to think about it? Tayfun Tuzun : That\u2019s correct. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : Okay, and then separately, I had a couple of questions on auto, first can you update us on your outlook for the auto lending environment from where you stand? And then separately, the average FICO scores of the auto loans of the auto loans that you guys have originated over the last decade plus have been north of 750. So, very high credit quality, can you discuss whether you\u2019ve ever considered going a bit further down the credit spectrum particularly since \u2013 this is an area where I guess you\u2019d be able to limit any losses by repossessing and selling the collateral at auctions along as vehicle prices are okay? Can you just maybe share what the thought process has been there? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, clearly, some banks are viewing the sub-prime auto sector as an attractive sector. We have not viewed it at the same way. We\u2019ve maintained our discipline in a very long period of time we will continue to maintain that discipline. As you said, our FICO scores, our advance rates has remained very stable. We are not interested in the sub-prime auto business, because we don\u2019t view our indirect lending business as a collateral based capture of higher than anticipated collateral. It\u2019s a credit decision that we made and so therefore, we\u2019ve stepped back from chasing yields through credit and we are not participating there and we also obviously are conservative in terms of using our existing capacity. We are originating $400 million to $450 million a month, whereas our capacity there is significantly north of that. But again, as the broad picture that we described earlier, whether it\u2019s in auto lending and C&I lending, and the way we manage investments, it\u2019s part of our risk management strategy and hitting the right risk return trade-offs for our shareholders that we will not compromise there. Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR. Your line is open. Paul Miller \u2013 FBR: Most of my questions have already been asked and answered, but I do have one follow-up. On slide nine, on the credit slide, there obviously was a modest uptick in 30 to 89 past due that you \u2013 it looks like you attribute to seasonality. Can you just expand a little bit on what causes that? Jamie Leonard :  Our 30 and 90 are still very low relative to expectation standards. So we feel very comfortable with where we are. We do experience some seasonality in the quarter, but we are very comfortable with the level of past dues that of 30 and 90 margin. No concerns going forward. Tayfun Tuzun :  Paul, I mean, in terms of credit, obviously, we\u2019ve not spent a lot of time because we think that the trend is positive when you look at non-accruals going down, non-performing assets going down, 90 days past due going down quarter-over-quarter. Non-performing loans hitting 68 basis points, these are all good trends. Paul Miller \u2013 FBR: No, I understand the trends are good. I just saw \u2013 I was wondering what the seasonality was, I\u2019m not too familiar with third quarter to second quarter seasonality. But that cleared it up. Thank you very much. Tayfun Tuzun :  You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Elliott. Your line is open. Jeffrey Elliott \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Hello guys. You touched on the increased regulatory scrutiny on the leveraged loan market. Clearly there has been quite a few headlines in the press around that over the last few weeks. Are you detecting any further changes there? Do you think your competitors are getting the same messages maybe you picked up on earlier and how does that affect the competitive dynamic as you go into the fourth quarter? Jamie Leonard :  Some have gotten the message it appears, some have not, so, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s been uniformly received, but we should not diminish the role of non-bank competitors in this space who are clearly not subject to same type of regulations. Jeffrey Elliott \u2013 Robert W. Baird: Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale of Janney Capital Markets. Your line is open. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets : Thank you. I just had a few questions. If I heard you correctly, Tayfun, you said that middle-market loan originations comprised about one-fourth of your total commercial loan production. So firstly, I just wanted to check if that\u2019s right. And, then related to that, what I was curious about is, what that share has been in the past, say, 12 months ago. And should we attribute, if the shares increase, say if it is in fact a quarter of your commercial production, is that increased share a function of the launch of your middle-market advisory business in April of this year tying that in with more lending? So if you could just talk about that that be helpful? Tayfun Tuzun :  So, Sameer, the middle-market lending percentage, when I look at sort of the last four, five quarters, it\u2019s been high, but this quarter it ticked up. But just to clarify one issue, we have a mid-corporate group and then we have a middle-market group. So, the middle-market group is the more traditional C&I bread and butter business that\u2019s what you have for a long period of time. What you are referring to in terms of the efforts that we\u2019ve discussed earlier in the year is the mid-corporate space that\u2019s a separate space. That sort of has been growing as well, but just on a quarter-to-quarter change, the increase in true middle-market has been a bit more pronounced and what we are seeing in the rest. Kevin Kabat :  We also are seeing the benefit of some of the additional verticals that we\u2019ve put in place. Our energy vertical is picking up and gaining momentum as we had expected when we put that in place. So it\u2019s starting to mature across its development as we had hoped when we put the strategy together. So I think that\u2019s contributing and we are seeing some nice pick up also in some of the equipment leasing activity which has been not something that we\u2019ve seen historically strong as we are seeing now. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets : Okay, thank you for that. And then, Kevin, you talked about the payments and commerce solutions, I guess, business that you\u2019ve launched and I was wondering what you could lay out for us in terms of specific targets or what your growth aspirations are I mean, clearly, when you look at the results, currently card and processing revenue is not that big a line item relative to some of the others in your non-interest income line and then if you look at the size of the card portfolio, it\u2019s also relatively small. So how big do you anticipate that business is getting? It seems like you and maybe many of your peers are increasingly focused on cards as \u2013 and credit card products as a way of offering another product putting that in the hands of their customers. So, can you share with us how much you expect both of those businesses kind of the fee income part and the loan portfolio to grow over the next, say, two or three years? Kevin Kabat :  Yes, I think the way that we are viewing is a little bit differently than what you stated. I don \u2013 well, we do believe card is an opportunity for us, comes on a very small piece of the whole. Predominantly, that whole payment to commerce division is really predominated with our treasury management business, that\u2019s large. And if you look at our treasury management performance over the last three four years, RTM growth in total has been significantly higher than the industry, largely because some of the product offerings that we\u2019ve done, the enabling of technology to enhance a solutioning for our customers. I talked to you about our RevLink product which was specifically designed around our healthcare vertical. Those are the types of strategies that we think, we have more room to kind of explore our CPS solution with our retail vertical we think is an opportunity for us to really help accelerate the growth from that standpoint. So, while we haven\u2019t shared yet kind of specifics byproduct offering or by area as a whole, we do expect to continue to grow our entire payment and commerce solutions area at a multiple of what the industry is not performing yet. But we expect that momentum to continue. Again, it\u2019s through these innovative areas of solutioning that apply our knowledge of what their needs are along with technology to get them better insight into what they are doing. So that\u2019s really kind of the approach is, not really \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t define it as a card-based overly based solutioning that we are looking at in that space. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets : And is there a reason for not wanting to be more traditional credit card-oriented in that space? Kevin Kabat : No. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets : It seems like that is another product offering that that you could add and emphasize more. So is there a specific reason to not want to emphasize as much? Kevin Kabat : No, we agree with you. We think that the card offering within our customers and utilization within their wallet is an important opportunity for us, but it isn\u2019t something from our standpoint that we look to really drive the growth out of the payment space. So we will contribute, but may not be the key driver of growth in that area for us. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets : Okay, and then just my last question really more one out of curiosity, because I know you started up a UK office recently to service a UK client that have operations in the US and I was curious from a timing standpoint, why now, there is some talk of weakness in Europe, the UK. Was there anything driving that in terms of timing specifically or you just felt that this is something that just made sense? Kevin Kabat : Yes, there is nothing from the timing we\u2019ve been in Brussels for 22 years. So we moved that office really to London which is quite frankly a much heavier concentration of the clients that we serve from that standpoint. So it made a lot of sense to us and that really wasn\u2019t driven by timing, it\u2019s more driven by where our customer aggregation and business relationships are today. Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets : I see, okay. Thank you very much. Operator : There are no further questions in the queue. And with that, we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Jake and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Jim Eglseder, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Jim Eglseder : Thanks Jake and good morning. Today, we will be talking with you about our full year and fourth quarter 2014 results. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We have identified some of those factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. I am joined on the call today by several people; our CEO, Kevin Kabat and CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Frank Forrest, Chief Risk Officer; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. During the question-and-answer session, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin? Kevin Kabat : Thanks Jim. Good morning everyone. In 2014, we continued to execute on our strategic plans. We posted solid results in spite of the challenging environment. Return on assets was 1.1% and return on tangible common equity was 12.2%. Net interest income increased 1% and we generated strong fee income in our core businesses. With 8% growth in card and processing revenue, 7% growth in corporate banking fee revenue and 4% growth in investment advisory fees. Additionally, we maintained our expense discipline with expenses down 6%, while making continued investments in our business. We grew average loans 2% compared with 2013 including 9% growth in C&I and 7% growth in bank card. We made significant progress rebuilding our commercial construction book and nearly doubled our outstanding balances over year end 2013. In addition, we grew average core deposits 8% including 10% growth in savings and money market balances and 6% growth in demand deposit balances. We placed a strong emphasis on building full and profitable customer relationships and we are focused on aligning value provided and value received given changes in the profitability of retail products. We believe the strength of our deposit franchise will be very significant in the coming rate cycle and the investments that we are making in our retail business are increasingly building a competitive advantage for us. Our strong earnings contributed to the solid returns we provided our shareholders as we executed on our capital plans. We repurchased outstanding shares worth $654 million, which decreased our share count by 4% and we increased our common dividend 9% all while maintaining strong levels of capital. In total, we returned more than $1 billion in capital to shareholders while growing our tangible book value by 11% in our Tier 1 common ratio by 20 basis points. Overall, I believe that 2014 was a successful year for us and I believe we are positioned well for the current environment. Now, turning to the results of the quarter. Today, we reported fourth quarter net income to common shareholders of $362 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.43. Results included the impact of $56 million positive valuation on the Vantiv warrant, $25 million in charges associated with the transfer of certain loans to held per sale and $19 million charge related to the valuation of our Visa total return swap, which in total essentially washed. We have discussed our efforts to reduce our risk exposures and during the quarter we moved $720 million of TDRs to held for sale as we look to take advantage of market conditions for these types of assets. Ultimately, we expect this transaction to improve our overall credit profile reducing servicing costs and enable us to use more of our capital efficiently. Fourth quarter fee income results were highlighted by 20% sequential growth in corporate banking fee revenue driven by higher syndication volumes and business lending fees due to increased volatility in the fourth quarter. Results were also supported by strong card and processing fees and investment advisory revenue. We maintained a balanced approach to expense discipline that's characterized by an intense focus on managing expenses while continuing to invest in our infrastructure and our revenue generating capabilities. Expenses year-over-year were down 7% and is expected increased 3% sequentially from relatively low levels in the third quarter. As we discussed last quarter, our financials reflects some of the deliberate actions we have taken that we believe are the right decisions to make for the long-term and will position us well as the economy and interest rate environment change. Part of this is taking a prudent approach to lending standards and maintaining a risk return profile. This had an impact on loan growth in the quarter. We continue to see aggressive pricing and structure from both banks and non-banks and have chosen to not chase details that do not offer the appropriate return for the risk we are taking. We are managing the company for the long-term. And we are committed to maintaining our discipline even in this challenging environment. Average portfolio loans were up 4% compared with fourth quarter of 2013 with modest sequential growth. Growth from 2013 was driven by 6% growth in C&I and 6% growth in bank card loans. We continued to generate solid core deposit growth up 8% compared with last year and highlighted by 13% growth in consumer savings and money market balances. Commercial deposits increased 10% compared with last year with checking account balances up 13% and demand deposit balances up 10%. We continued to make good progress in credit excluding net charge offs taken in conjunction with the transfer of TDR loans, our net charge off ratio was 45 basis points of loans. Non-performing asset levels continued to trend down and our non-performing asset ratio ended the year at 82 basis points. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we have made over the past several years continuing our efforts to reposition the company in this currently challenging environment. We are well along the path because of the work we have done to address the changing capital and liquidity requirements and heightened regulatory expectations and to adapt to the low interest, low rate environment. We do recognize that 2015 is top of mind and that we are facing some near term headwinds like others in the industry we will continue to manage through the low interest rate environment and its impact on loan yields on the investment portfolio as well as increasing costs related to compliance and risk management. We will also be impacted by the changes we announced to our deposit advance product. We will work through all of that this year while continuing to reposition the company in order to achieve our longer term objectives. We remain focused on the things we can control. We are making strategic decisions to achieve the right business mix one which produces less volatile and more sustainable earnings growth. And we continued to pursue opportunities that add unique value for our customers while providing a solid return for investors. The benefits of our strategies will prove more enduring through the continued enhancements we are making to our risk culture and our focus on appropriately balancing risk and reward. We believe these strategies will enable us to achieve our long-term targets in a normalized environment, which would include higher rates and to that end we have not changed our objectives and we continue to work toward a return on average assets in the 1.3% to 1.5% range and an efficiency ratio in the mid-50s. We think those are reasonable targets. We have prudent strategies in place with a talented work force all aligned towards those objectives. Our dedicated employees set Fifth Third apart as they work with our customers to provide solutions to their financial needs and I thank them for their many contributions. While we have got a lot of work ahead of us, we have a solid foundation from which to grow. We will continue our transition in 2015 and we will provide updates throughout the year about our progress. With that, I will turn it over to Tayfun, who will discuss our fourth quarter operating results and our outlook. Tayfun? Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks Kevin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. In 2014, despite the many environmental challenges that Kevin mentioned we continued to execute on our strategic priorities and took deliberate actions to position our company well to meet those specific challenges. In a year with continued pressure on margins, we grew net interest income 1% and further strengthened the balance sheet with respect to our liquidity, interest rate and credit risk exposures. Growth in fee income including corporate banking, card and processing, investment advisory and deposit fees proved the benefit of our diverse business model as we continued to transition from the mortgage refinance boom. Full year expenses were down 6% even after a 4% increase in technology related expenses as we continued to invest in our business. Our strong results supported our capital returns as we distributed $1.1 billion to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2014 resulting in a total payout ratio of 76%. Looking in detail at the fourth quarter, I will start with the financials summary on Page 3 of the presentation. We reported net income to common shareholders of $362 million or $0.43 per diluted share. There were several items that affected earnings in the quarter and I will note their impact to various line items throughout my comments. In the fourth quarter, we transferred approximately $720 million of primarily accruing firstly lien residential mortgages that were classified as troubled debt restructuring to held for sale. The vast majority about 97% of these loans were originated in 2008 or prior and approximately 50% of the balance was located in Michigan and Florida. We expect to execute a sale of these loans early this year. In connection with the loan transfer, we recognized incremental net charge offs of about $87 million or 38 basis points in other related expenses. However, this was partially offset by a $64 million reduction in the allowance per loan loses. As a result, the pretax net income impact of the transition including expenses of $2 million totaled $25 million or $0.02 per share. This transaction represents another step in our strategic direction to reduce potential sources of earnings volatility in our business. With that, let's move on to the average balance sheet in Page 4 of the presentation. In the fourth quarter, average investment securities decreased by $216 million or 1% sequentially reflecting our low appetite to deploy additional cash into investment securities given the current rate environment. Consequently, we did not reinvest all of our cash flows in the investment portfolio this quarter. As a result, when combined with our strong deposit growth, our cash balances at the Fed reached over $7 billion at the end of the quarter. Shifting to loans, we continued to be prudent on pricing and terms. As a result, we saw relatively stable average portfolio loan balances up $242 million from the third quarter driven by growth in commercial construction and residential mortgage balances. Otherwise, payoffs and paydowns offset solid fourth quarter C&I production. Competition continues to be fierce and as we have stated before pricing does not leave much room for error. We have and will continue to make deliberate decisions not to add or renew loans at terms or pricing that would produce sub-optimal risk return profiles as we deploy our capital. We have seen very strong deposit growth throughout the year end and as we expected that continued in the fourth quarter. Average core deposits increased $3.2 billion from the third quarter driven by growth in money market and demand deposit accounts. Our LCR ratio at year end exceeded 110% a very significant achievement accomplished in 2014. Moving to NII on Page 5 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $20 million sequentially to $888 million in line with the expectations we shared with you in December. $6 million reduction due to credit spread compression, $9 million due to following impact of fixed rate debt issuance and $4 million related to the delay in the deployment of our portfolio investments throughout the decline. The net interest margin was 296 basis points down 14 basis points from the third quarter with 8 basis points of compression related to our elevated cash balances. Debt issuances and loan repricing were responsible for the balance of the decline. The quarterly decline in our loan yield was the smallest of the year. Shifting to fees on Page 6 of presentation, fourth quarter non-interest income was $653 million compared with $520 million in the third quarter. Results included a $56 million positive valuation adjustment on the Vantiv warrant and a $19 million charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap. These impacts were negative $53 million and negative $3 million respectively in the third quarter. Excluding these items in both quarters, fee income of $616 million increased $40 million or 7% sequentially driven by solid corporate banking results and the payment under our tax receivable agreement with Vantiv. Corporate banking fees increased $20 million or 20% sequentially on higher syndication and business lending fees. On a full year basis, corporate banking fees increased 7% as we continued to grow the contributions from our capital market solutions and other non-credit products and services. Card and processing revenue increased 2% from the third quarter and was up 7% from the fourth quarter of 2013 as we continue to benefit from greater card utilization and higher consumer purchase volume. For the full year, card and processing revenue was $295 million up 8% from 2013 and the highest level we reported since 2011 when the Durbin amendment was implemented. Mortgage banking net revenue was flat sequentially, which was consistent with our October expectations. Originations declined seasonally and were $1.7 billion compared with $1.9 billion in the third quarter. The increases in gain on sale revenue were mostly offset by declines in servicing fees. Gain on sale margins were up 60 basis points to 284 basis points. Deposit service charges declined 2% from the third quarter and were flat relative to the fourth quarter of 2013. Commercial deposit service charges and retail deposit service charges each declined 2% sequentially. On the consumer side, we saw a decrease in overdraft occurrences during the quarter. Total investment advisory revenue declined 2% sequentially, but for the full year revenue of $407 million was a record. The decline was in more volatile revenue items. We have been successful in growing assets under management, which are up 8% from 2013 and we continued to focus on shifting fee structures to an asset base recurring model away from transactional pricing. Excluding mortgage, the year-over-year increase in our total adjusted non-interest income was 3.3% in 2014, which is a very good accomplishment in this environment. We show non-interest expense on Page 7 of the presentation. Expenses came in at $918 million this quarter compared with $888 million in the third quarter matching our expectations. Non-interest expense included higher compensation related expense including $4 million higher medical claims as well as $6 million in severance expense. PPNR on Page 8 of the presentation was $618 million when adjusted for the items noted on this slide, PPNR was $580 million down $13 million from third quarter adjusted PPNR primarily due to higher expenses partially offset by the Vantiv TRA payment. The efficiency ratio adjusted on the same basis was 61% for the quarter. Turning to credit results on Page 9. Total net charge offs of $190 million increased $75 million sequentially. Fourth quarter net charge offs included $87 million related to the transfer of the residential mortgage loans classified as TDRs to held for sale. Excluding this impact, net charge offs were $104 million a sequential decline of $11 million or 10% and were 45 basis points of average loans. Non-performing assets excluding loans held for sale were $748 million at quarter end and down $48 million from the third quarter bringing the NPL ratio to 64 and the NPA ratio to 83 basis points, its lowest level in seven years. Commercial NPAs and consumer NPAs decreased $26 million and $22 million respectively from the third quarter. Residential mortgage NPAs decreased $40 million primarily reflecting the transfer of TDRs to held for sale. As an update in light of the decline in the price of crude oil in the energy portfolio our balances are fairly modest just over $2 billion. We have relationships with about $170 customers focused on the middle market and large corporate borrowers only 2% are criticized with no delinquencies. In our reserve base lending portfolio, we only lend against proven reserves. The vast majority of our producer clients that are leveraged to oil have reasonable levels of hedging in place through 2015 and many are hedged through 2016 and in certain cases into 2017. Overall, the quality of the firms we have relationships with is very good. We currently have no exposure to shale activity in our outstandings. We continue to monitor developments, but we do feel good about our positions. Wrapping upon credit, the allowance for loan lease losses declined $92 million sequentially including a $64 million release related to the TDR transfer. Our reserve release excluding the TDR related impact was $28 million relative to $44 million last quarter and so our provision excluding the TDR sale was $76 million compared to $71 million last quarter. Reserve coverage remains solid at 1.47% of loans and leases and 227% of NPLs. We are pleased with the level of credit metrics as we start 2015. Looking at capital on Slide 10. Capital levels continued to be strong and well above regulatory requirements. Tier 1 common equity ratio on Basel I basis was 9.6% up 1 basis points from last quarter. Pro forma for Basel III rules, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.4% and increased 1 basis point from last quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, the average diluted share count was down another 1% sequentially and is the lowest we have seen since the third quarter of 2010. During the quarter, we announced common stock repurchases of $180 million. That ASR was sold earlier this month and the total for the entire transaction was approximately 9.1 million shares. Relative to CCAR, we submitted our capital plan in early January and we will provide you more details in our plan in March. Now, turning to our outlook for the year. Before we discuss the broad guidelines of our financial performance expectations for 2015, we would like to provide you with our underlying assumptions on the most relevant economic drivers in our business. This year, the ability to confidently forecast the level of economic growth and the path of the rate environment are more challenging as the past three weeks have clearly shown. Nevertheless, we need to use a base forecast which we know will be subject to frequent changes. Our base economic outlook is based on most recent consensus market expectations for domestic economic activity. Current consensus expectations indicate that the U.S. economy will achieve year-over-year growth of 2.5% to 3% in 2015 with low inflation. On average, we should expect our industry to achieve overall loan growth approximating GDP growth. In commercial lending, we expect our growth to exceed 3% supported partially by our recent strategic investments. We also expect continuing declines in consumer loans, HELOCs and autos as a result of both continued weakness in loan demand and competitive pricing pressures that will likely maintain our cautious approach. With the LCR related investments largely behind us, our portfolio investments will be opportunistic in this environment. We expect to increase the size of the portfolio, but the timing will be dependent on rates and other balance sheet dynamics. We don't have any significant derivative contracts that are expiring this year. Under the expectation of a relatively healthy economy, we assume the Fed will start raising the Fed funds rate during the second half of the year. Our rate outlook for the first half of the year is flat. Reflecting our detailed public discussions and disclosures on our asset sensitivity and based upon the combination of our loan growth outlook and interest rate assumptions and including the $100 million reduction related to our deposit advance product that we communicated before, we expect a 1% to 2% decline in NII on a year-over-year basis, but a growing run rate after the midyear point. On January 1 of this year, the repricing of our deposit advance product took effect and the NII impact was immediate. Although our year-over-year comparisons will have the impact of this reduction, the underlying trend of our core NII progress should be positive throughout the year. Excluding this impact, we would expect our NII to grow this year. With respect to NIM, including the impact of the $100 million decline in our deposit advance related interest income, which is on an annual basis equivalent to about 8 basis points, we expect continued contraction during the first half of the year, but based on the rate assumptions our NIM should recover by year end to Q4 2014 levels. If rates stay flat, we would expect continued contraction during the second half of the year and end 2015 roughly 5 to 7 basis points below Q4 2014 levels excluding the impact of the deposit advance products. For the first quarter, we expect the impact of the deposit advance product to be $20 million to $25 million. In addition, day count has $12 million negative impact. Otherwise, we generally expect the benefit from loan growth to be offset by continued repricing in the portfolio. We expect NIM to be lower during the quarter due to elevated cash balances and ongoing pricing pressures. We expect our credit performance to continue to improve, but we would like to remind you that we expect ALLL releases in 2015 to be significantly below the 2014 levels and loan growth will result in higher levels of provisioning. We are very encouraged by the overall good quality of new loans that we are putting on our balance sheet so our fundamental credit performance should improve. We expect our non-interest income excluding Vantiv related gains of $155 million in 2014 to continue to grow at a healthy rate. We currently expect an increase in the mid-single digits percent range with the main drivers being fee income related to commercial banking and investment advisory. Mortgage revenue will be a function of the rate environment which at this time is difficult to forecast for the full year. Together with our NII expectations, we would expect our full year total revenues to exceed our 2014 core revenues. For the first quarter fee income, most fee revenue lines including deposit fees, card and processing revenue and corporate fees tend to be seasonally low and we expect corporate banking fees to be additionally impacted by the current market environment. Additionally, we will not have the benefit of the Vantiv TRA payment in the first quarter. On the expense side, as always, we will maintain our focus on managing our company efficiently. We will however continue to invest in our businesses to grow revenues and build and maintain an infrastructure that will be a competitive advantage for us. As you have heard from other banks, risk and compliance infrastructures are being reevaluated and redesigned and we are doing the same. Our headcount in these areas will increase. We will continue to drive efficiencies like what you saw in 2014 where we reduced our headcount by almost 1100, but as a result of these hires, we expect to add to our total headcount in 2015. Customer demand is driving technology investments both to create new efficiencies as well as to adapt to the changing environment. Some of these are permanent changes to our expense base, some of them are temporary. For 2015 full year under the revenue assumptions that I outlined, we expect to achieve a full year efficiency ratio in the low 60s. The year-over-year increase in compliance related expenses is expected to be in the $25 million range, predominantly headcount related. In addition, we expect roughly $15 million in expenses during the second half of the year related to the EMV technology in our credit card business. The impact of the reduction in revenue related to the deposit advance product and the compliance in EMV related expenses are equivalent to roughly 2% in terms of our proficiency ratio. There will be quarterly fluctuations due to seasonal nature of some items as always and in the near term we may experience higher expenses. For the first quarter, we will see higher expenses primarily due to seasonally higher FICA and unemployment expense much like what we saw last year and continued investments in risk management and compliance. In addition, marketing expenses will have a seasonal pickup. We are still of the firm opinion that we can operate this company in the mid-50s efficiency ratio when revenues normalize. For the full year, we are assuming an effective tax rate in the 26% range. We also would just like to remind you that the revenue expectations that we shared with you today do not include potential, but currently unforecasted items such as Vantiv warrant marks or gains or losses on share sales. In summary, we are entering the New Year with a strategic focus to manage our company efficiently and with a long-term focus on growth and achieving optimal returns for our shareholders. We believe that our strategies will drive less volatile, more sustainable long-term earnings growth and returns and we look forward to providing updates as we go along this year. With that, let's open the line for discussions. Jake? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning, Erika. Kevin Kabat : Good morning. Erika Najarian : My first question is on the commercial loan growth outlook. You mentioned that you expected to exceed the 3% GDP growth that is being forecasted currently. If I look at the average C&I growth this quarter, it was up 6% year-year. I mean obviously exceeds 3% could mean a lot of things, but are we supposed to take away from this that C&I loan growth could be flat or decelerating? And if so, in an improving GDP backdrop why is that the case for Fifth Third? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. I don't think Erika we are backing away from growth in commercial lending. We totally expect commercial lending to grow this year to the 3% plus level. In 2014, we clearly had some headwinds with respect to payoffs related to competitive offers from either capital markets or other competitors. Our expectation fully is that we would get to similar levels of growth and our production numbers would indicate that we should be able to achieve that. And also given sort of the volatility that we are seeing in capital markets, we will just have to wait and see what the payoff and paydown experience is and as the economy improves, I suspect that our clients will be utilizing more of their borrowing capacity. So at this point, we are optimistic about C&I growth. We are not backing away from it and we will achieve sort of the 3% plus whether that is at 4%, 5% or 6% will clearly depend a little bit on the economic activity. Erika Najarian : Got it. My follow-up question, you were tracking a 61% efficiency ratio on an adjusted basis this quarter and you are guiding towards low 60% with a 50 basis point increase in the front-end for the second half of the year. And I guess is the main message that Fifth Third is unlikely to move toward the mid-50s until we are more mature into the rate cycle or is there something further to do with the expense base after you have invested in the compliance and technology related matters that you mentioned? Tayfun Tuzun : So clearly on a year-over-year basis, the impact of the $100 million reduction in NII related to our deposit advance product has a big impact... Erika Najarian : Got it. Tayfun Tuzun : \u2026on revenues. And then we have the additional $40 million of expenses that I mentioned. What is happening today is, I don't think that our new guidance changes our perspectives on where we think our long-term efficiency ratio will be. I think our industry is going through a change in the way we manage risk and compliance. And this is sort of a new prototype that banks large and small are adopting. Whereas in the past risk and compliance management had more of a centralized structure, that structure today is being redesigned to incorporate those functions into the front lines and as well at the same time boost the centralized risk and compliance management units. So by definition, that deployment requires headcount. New processes are being designed to accommodate the structure and there is always a cost involved when such an undertaking is taking place. This development applies not just to us, but to all banks in our peer group and eventually we think there will be technology applications to these processes, but we are not there yet. So therefore what is happening today is that these efforts, headcount efforts are heavy and have a negative impact on our efficiency ratio without necessarily creating new revenue streams. But we do believe that ultimately these efforts will have other positive externalities that will impact our efficiency once they are in place. Our customers will for example experience better service, which should impact customer retention and we should experience lower operating losses. So that will move through our efficiency ratio in time. But right now, we are in the investment phase without necessarily realizing these benefits and on top of that we are also operating in a difficult revenue environment. So as the process matures, we will get the efficiencies back and as we apply more technology, those will be even more pronounced. And so I guess question is why can't you do this all by taking expenses out elsewhere to pay for these investments and we are. The final net cost of these investments actually is lower than what the growth expenses are because we are partially paying for them with savings elsewhere. But we can't stop all the investments and we still need to look for revenue growth opportunities in our businesses. And so the other pieces for example, the investment in EMV this year will have ultimately very beneficial impact on fraud losses which will once again work through the efficiency ratio. But those benefits are going to be realized after the technology is in place. And so therefore in 2015 from a calendar year perspective, we have this phenomenon of the blip in our efficiency ratio. Again, but by no means our operating leverage picture in 2015 revises our perspective on how we can run this company. It is just a combination of the nature of these investments and the operating environment that we are in. So it is a long answer, but we clearly are very focused in terms of managing our company efficiently. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Tayfun Tuzun : Sure. Operator : And your next question comes from Matt Burnell. Your line is open, from Wells Fargo Securities. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning, Matt. Matt Burnell : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to broaden the question on commercial loan growth outside of C&I since you have already answered that question. But I guess \u2013 and I know it is a small number relative to total loans, but commercial construction was up fairly visibly, has been up fairly visibly over the last couple of quarters. Can you give us a little more color as to what your expectations are for growth in that portfolio and are there specific locations or projects that are driving that and are there ancillary profit opportunities outside of lending revenue that you are generating from those loans? Tayfun Tuzun : Sure. So we about doubled our commercial construction in 2014 and when we look at the underlying production trends, about 75% to 80% of that production is in our footprint and about 75% to 80% of the underlying type of project is either industrial or multifamily and there is some office buildings attached to that as well. Clearly due to the short nature of that lending, the natural growth in that portfolio will ultimately slow down from what we are experiencing today because the churn itself will limit the net growth. At this point due to that nature, we are not necessarily seeing a significant fee pickup, but we are broadening our customer base and would potentially obviously seek to grow non-credit revenues. But at this stage, it is not a very meaningful number. A portion of the construction loans we think we can capture, but I have to tell you that competition from insurance companies and other very long-term oriented investors is very tough and we are not necessarily competing as they turn from construction to perm. Matt Burnell : Thank you. And then just as a follow-up back on commercial lending, it is clear that you are not seeing the returns on those types of lending exposures that you would like to see. Where are you seeing the most aggressive competition coming from? Is it smaller regional banks or is it bigger banks? And given your comments about trying to diversify your revenue source, given your strong capital ratios, are there opportunities that you have seen out in the marketplace to potentially add commercial fee revenue via inorganic growth? Kevin Kabat : Matt, this is Kevin. I would just tell you that competitively we have as the year has progressed seen it continue to ratchet up not only in terms of pricing but in structure. And I would say hard to categorize out of one segment although we would tell you that we see it equally in terms of the largest institutions that are being very aggressive in terms of some of the particularly structure of the deals. So it has just continued. It is not surprising to us from that standpoint. I guess the biggest surprise is the speed at which it has accelerated and that is really kind of the discipline that we put against our orientation from that perspective. So we saw okay production, we saw a lot more aggressive paydown as we got progressively into the year. And I think that will continue and that is really kind of what we are looking at. Relative to other fee income, I think Tayfun has talked about our expansion in terms of capital markets and some of the offerings that we now have the capabilities of producing. We think there is still opportunities there. I don't know if there are others, Tayfun, that come into -- Tayfun Tuzun : The one particular new \u2013 one new vertical that we launched in the second half of the year is retail vertical and we did that deliberately because we have very strong treasury management products to compete in that area. And that was, we expect the fee income component in corporate lending via these vertical plays to actually continue to increase. Because I don't think at least in the near term our expectation is that the price and structure competition will probably still be with us so we are very keen on making sure that we supplement relationship profitability via non-credit products. Matt Burnell : Thank you very much. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Kevin Kabat : Good morning, Matt. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Was just trying to do some rough calculations on all the guidance to back into what the absolute expense outlook is and figured I would just ask instead of trying to pull the moving pieces together. But just as we think about total cost for 2015, obviously X things like litigation that might pop up, what is the outlook on the expenses? Tayfun Tuzun : Well, the outlook on the expenses I think our guidance, the format of our guidance is as I went through earlier. What we expect is we expect higher headcounts and therefore in addition to sort of normal merit increases we do expect our employment related expense items to increase. We do expect higher IT expenses because we continue to invest in our retail business and our commercial business. We have to maintain the level of investments to grow earnings. We are investing quite a bit of money in our digital revenue generation capabilities in retail. We are continuing to invest in the capital markets business so those items will continue to go up. Marketing is likely to be higher and we are coming off of a lower year in 2014 for that. So in general, Matt, I think our expense guidance you will need to work that through the revenue guidance and the efficiency ratio, the low 60s efficiency ratio that we provided you with. And on a run rate basis, our new hire increases will probably be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first, but in general we will see higher employment related expenses. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. I mean it seems like ex some of the IT infrastructure spend, there is more expense creep than we have seen. Is it that you have run out of areas that you can cut to offset some of the inflation, or is it that we are close enough to rates increasing and revenue picking up that you don't want to cut more into the core or into the core? Tayfun Tuzun : I wouldn't characterize it as we have run out of areas to save. I would characterize it as we are not necessarily reducing our investments in our businesses this year as we are very keen on reaching the revenue growth targets. I think our revenues are growing year-over-year, which is important to note and we are keen on making sure that we put some of our savings for example in retail, back to retail because we continue to view that line of business as very important not only in 2015, but beyond 2015. Kevin Kabat : And the other thing I would add, Matt, as you know and have followed us for a while, you know that we are mindful of making sure that our revenue capabilities continue to track relative to the environment and the anticipation of the environment. So as Tayfun just mentioned, we are developing a new vertical in our commercial space that we are hiring. We are also investing in our investment advisory space that has gotten us a good return and so we will continue to do that as well as we go forward. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then just quickly on the securities book, you talked about it likely growing from here dependent on rates. But as we think about that $22 billion of securities, how big should that be if rates were \u2013 you can pick the level, 2.25 or 2.5 on the 10 year \u2013 how depressed is that level right now just given what has happened to rates in the last three, four months? Jamie Leonard : Hey, Matt, it is Jamie. I think the way to look at the security book is really in the context of the LCR. We were at 92% last quarter, we are at 112% this quarter. So the size of the security book what I would like to see is exiting the year 100% or more so having an acceptable buffer there. Sitting on $7 billion of cash at the end of the year, there weren't a lot of opportunities and we still don't see a lot of opportunities in this rate environment, but we will continue to be opportunistic. But I think you can expect to see some of that cash deployed over the course of 2015 into LCR friendly HQLA. Matt O\u2019Connor: And nothing on the magnitude, I mean the cash has gone up by call it $5 billion and change the last two quarters. Is that a core build or is that just because rates are so low? Jamie Leonard : I think the build-up in cash is in some part driven by seasonality, but in a large part driven by a lot of the strong deposit growth Tayfun referenced with regard to our retail banking franchise. Tayfun Tuzun : I think the broader message on the balance sheet, Matt, is that we truly are on a day to day basis, we are monitoring this. We are monitoring the asset side of the business, the liability side of the business. Clearly deposit growth has exceeded our expectations in 2014, which was great, but we are very keen on making sure that from a margin perspective knowing that we will continue to experience credit spread contraction that we manage the liability side of the costs as efficiently as we can. So you will see us spending quite a bit of time and focus on the liability side this year. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Okay. And your next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zerbe : Good morning. First question, just in terms of the transaction deposits, can you address what drove the big increase there? I mean is there a philosophy shift that is actually driving your desire to grow deposits much more aggressively? Tayfun Tuzun : Well, we've always \u2013 I think last year in many instances, we've discussed our perspective on the value of deposits, and we continue to maintain that perspective. We like deposits; we believe that our deposit franchise will be the anchor to our profitability in our balance sheet. And in the fourth quarter, we have experienced a bit of a higher growth in commercial deposits, and every line in our commercial deposit book has grown. And I think that is more reflective of sort of the corporate cash positions with respect to our clients more than just a deliberate action that we took in our commercial deposits. But in general, we have not changed our view of deposits. Ken Zerbe : But have you increased your pricing of those commercial deposits to help draw more deposits in at all? Tayfun Tuzun : No, there were no increases in our commercial deposit pricing. Ken Zerbe : Got you. Understood. And then second question, in terms of the gain on sale margins obviously much higher this quarter. Was that just a blip given what happened with interest rates or should we expect those to come back down again next quarter? Tayfun Tuzun : We will see. The reason why we did not want to give mortgage guidance is because of the volatility of the current environment. Clearly, we are experiencing a pickup early this quarter in app volumes and rate locks. We would expect to see that this quarter and we will see how that impacts gain on sale of margins. It is a little early to be able to give you color on that yet. Ken Zerbe : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning, Ryan. Ryan Nash : Good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask one clarification on the NIM outlook. Is the flat year-over-year guidance with higher rates, is that inclusive or exclusive of the deposit advance product? Jamie Leonard : Ryan, it is Jamie. What Tayfun had mentioned was for the first quarter we would expect NIM to be down driven by the early advanced product and that is about 8 bps and then day count benefit of 3 bps bringing you into that outlook for the first quarter of down 5 bps or so off of fourth quarter levels. And then from there it would be dependent upon the rate environment to go \u2013 to grow from there. Tayfun Tuzun : Our outlook in terms of the picture that I gave you was comparing Q4 of 2014 to Q4 of 2015. So -- Ryan Nash : And is that inclusive of deposit advance \u2013 of early access? Jamie Leonard : Yes. Ryan Nash : Okay, got it. Just shifting gears to credit, you talked about a few puts and takes that you are expecting credit will improve, but loan growth will drive higher provisions. Do you think in 2015 we will see the inflection point where charge-offs will actually start to meet provisions or do you think you will actually have to start to build some reserves in 2015? Tayfun Tuzun : We would expect the dollar charge-offs to continue to decline and ultimately we believe that during the year there may come a point where we may hit that inflection point. It is a bit early to tell that yet. We obviously have the right level of reserves today at 1.47% coverage. New loans that are coming on the sheet are of good quality, which should improve the profile and then we will see how loan growth proceeds. There may come a point in 2015 where that crossover takes place, but at this point I can't tell you when and I can't tell you by how much. Ryan Nash : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Okay. And your next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, guys. A question on capital. Your Tier 1 common ratio has kind of hung in here at a good 9.4 level, other peers have tended to grow a little bit more. So you are now in line if not a little bit below where some others are and I'm just wondering if there is any change in your philosophy around the type of magnitude of ask when you think about CCAR going forward? I know you are not going to be able to tell us the amount you ask for. But just philosophically do you still feel as good about the type of ask you guys have generically done in the past about returning overall majority of your annual earnings? Tayfun Tuzun : So Ken, I think the last two years we have worked on CCAR with the same goal to maintain our capital ratio going into the period and coming out of the period. And that actually enabled us to achieve more aggressive capital return dollars compared to our peers. Our philosophy there has not changed. We still maintain our view that a stable capital ratio going into the CCAR period and coming out of the CCAR period is the best outcome given the absolute level and given the relative level of capital to our peers. That has not changed and hopefully we will get to share the results with you in March. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And then just one more clarification on the outlook in terms of just your outlook for the fee side and understanding what you said before on not being quite clear on how mortgage can come through. When you are talking about your expected full year outlook for fee growth, can you just make sure we are all based on the right starting point for it? And then is it basically then going to be those other core areas you think you can grow with the swing factor being mortgage? Tayfun Tuzun : So as I mentioned earlier in the call, excluding mortgage in 2014, the year-over-year increase in our total adjusted for Vantiv non-interest income was 3.3%. We believe that again excluding mortgage, we can achieve that number and even better during the year and that is what our outlook is based on. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Thanks a lot. Tayfun Tuzun : Okay. Operator : And your next question comes from Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Either Tayfun or maybe Jamie, just on the margin, I just want to make sure I am understanding the dynamics correctly. So it sounds like qualitatively the big pressure point for the immediate term is just the deposit advance product, but otherwise based on the trajectory you have got, it sounds like the core margin after the first quarter would kind of have to be flat to get you back to the fourth quarter 2014 level by the end of 2015. So what as you see it are sort of on a core basis are the main dynamics that would allow the core margin to just kind of stabilize rather than kind of remain under pressure in light of the rate environment? Jamie Leonard : This is Jamie and as Tayfun had mentioned, we are sensitive on the short end of the curve so clearly Fed tightening in the back half of the year would be beneficial. Secondarily, commercial loan growth north of the 3% GDP levels certainly will help. But in the meantime we think we can run the company and our balance sheet is positioned to deliver stable NIM in the first half of 2015, but for the impact of the early advanced product. So we have some opportunity on the liability side just given how strong our deposit growth has been. We can maybe earn another bp or two there, but for the most part, the loan yield compression you saw during 2014 continued to be less and less and so we have got a little bit, maybe a bp or two of headwind there, but that is certainly manageable. Tayfun Tuzun : Clearly NIM guidance this year is very challenging. What we have seen here so far alone in the last three weeks is 30 plus basis point drop in the 10 year, not that necessarily the 10-year drives our NIM. But we recognize the challenges associated with NIM guidance because it also depends as I mentioned on the timing of our ability to deploy more leverage into our investment portfolio, we will be patient during the year. No question about it, which may fluctuate our NIM from time to time, but we will maintain that cautious approach that we have maintained throughout 2014. When we do see opportunities we will go after them. And also it is difficult to necessarily give you good guidance for credit spreads. As you know, credit spreads contraction has actually overwhelmed some of the base rate changes throughout 2014 and we felt that in our commercial book. What encourages us a little bit is that our fixed-rate portfolios are truly showing signs of stability as we expected and we would hope to achieve that in 2015, but again, as much guidance as we are giving you today on NIM, we recognize the importance of the $100 million reduction in interest income related to deposit products and we are cognizant of the volatility of this environment. Scott Siefers : Okay. I appreciate that color. That is helpful. So thank you and then just as a second question, so as I am sort of weighing all the guidance together but as you look at things and maybe there is a little pressure on expenses this year but all in, would you expect to grow the revenue base more than the expense base? In other words, are you expecting positive operating leverage this year or is this going to be kind of more kind of a year that reflects some investments and then the revenue side comes sort of next year with the benefit of high rates? How are you thinking about that dynamic? Tayfun Tuzun : We will not have positive operating leverage this year. We will grow revenues, but our expenses will exceed that. It is extremely difficult to overcome the year-over-year decline in our revenues of $100 million associated with the deposit advance product. Scott Siefers : Okay, all right. Thank you guys very much. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR. Your line is open. Thomas LeTrent : Good morning, guys. This is actually Thomas LeTrent on behalf of Paul. Most of the questions have already been asked and answered, but I just want to clarify on the 1Q 2015 guidance on expenses, I certainly appreciate the guidance that seasonality will drive them higher. But I'm trying to figure out what base to start from. You had $33 million of credit cost in OpEx in the quarter. Obviously that is higher than let's call it $10 million the last few quarters. If I think about it like that, does that mean that expenses could be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter or how should I go about that? Tayfun Tuzun : Not necessarily. Clearly the big mover is going to be in the seasonal pickup in FICA and some of the unemployment workers comp lines and then there will be a pickup in marketing. So I wouldn't necessarily keep the line items flat. There will be decreases in some but overall clearly seasonally we do experience quite a bit of pickup in expenses in Q1. Thomas LeTrent : Okay. And then just one follow-up question on credit. I think you've got $900 million left in the consumer portfolio, I think in TDR and another $800 million in commercial. Are there any sort of near-term plans to move those to held for sale like you did with the portfolio this quarter or can you talk about that a little bit? Tayfun Tuzun : No. At this time we don't have any plans. The remaining mortgage TDRs include a good amount of government guaranteed mortgages and then we have about $400 million in home equity loans and about $100 million and autos and credit cards. At this time we have no plans. Thomas LeTrent : Okay. That is all. Thank you very much. Operator : And your next question comes from Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hey, just a clarification. So would you have positive operating leverage in 2015 excluding the $100 million decline? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. I think we would be much closer to that. I gave you the impact of the $100 million plus the $25 million related to infrastructure plus the $15 million related to EMV, which adds up to about 2%, Mike. So those are the movers of the operating leverage. But again, I cannot emphasize it enough, those numbers do include $100 million reduction and that is the difficulty that we are facing this year. Mike Mayo : But on a core basis you still expect efficiency to improve excluding the noise? Tayfun Tuzun : We are looking for all opportunities to improve efficiency on a core basis. Mike Mayo : Okay. Separate. So my main question really gets to the lack of loan growth this quarter. So is that good news or bad news? I guess the bad news is compared to peer, you have less loan growth but the good news could be we saw risk, we are pulling back. Do you get credit with that pull back with regulators? And you mentioned insurance companies and I think other long-term investors, so who are these other participants banking or non-banking, that are disrupting competition for you? Tayfun Tuzun : So in terms of loan growth, this game is longer than one or two quarters and I think we are obviously preserving some capacity in order to participate better. Our production numbers are actually pretty decent. It is just the payoffs have limited net loan growth. Pension fund is another participant and commercial mortgage. My comment related to insurance companies was more in the commercial mortgage space. On the commercial side throughout 2014, we have seen competition from non-banks. We have seen competition from banks. Clearly some banks are showing better loan growth than we do and one potentially could say that they were happier with the risk return offers than we were and they took away some business from us. But again, we view this as more long-term. The regulators really are not necessarily commenting on loan growth one way or another because our dialogue with the regulators throughout the year actually has been positive. Frank, I don't know if you want to add to that color? Frank Forrest : The only thing I would add, Mike, is that all regulators look at new deals that have been put on in the last 12 months, so they are all looking, that is where they are focused. What is the quality of the new deals that have been on the books in the last 12 months? All I can tell you is we are very comfortable with what we put on the books the last 12 months and we are comfortable within our own shoes and we are going to manage our books accordingly based on our comfort level. We are not going to be driven by the market. Banks that have done that before end up following themselves in a spiral downward. We have all seen it before. We have all been through it and we are not going to go through it again here. Mike Mayo : Well, you have seen a lot of cycles on that last point, just my last follow-up. When have you seen a pull back like this in the past? I mean a lot of times the industry keeps making the loans until you actually see a lot higher losses. So you're not really seeing a lot higher losses right now yet you are pulling back. What prior period would you say this is comparable to? Frank Forrest : I'm not sure I can. I mean if you go back five to six years through the downturn, most everybody followed each other in the wrong direction. I would say that where we are better and I would think that a lot of banks are better and have learned is really in being much more proactive in managing risk much more anticipatory, using many more tools to assess the portfolios today. We stress test today every which way you can possibly imagine from a borrower to the portfolios and different segments of the portfolio. Maybe that is part of that came out of CCAR three or four years ago, but I would say the portfolio analytics that we do today are far different than they were before. And so we are much more comfortable with our forward view. Mike Mayo : Frank, one last time, you have been doing this for what like two, three decades, can you reach back further in time to find a comparable period when you literally backed away from loans as much as you are doing when you haven't seen much higher loan losses? Frank Forrest : Come on, Mike. I'm not that old. I'm not sure I can to be honest. You can think through the different cycles. We have gone through some long good cycles on the real estate side, but fundamentally you know if you go back 15 or 20 or 25 years maybe beyond your life span, banks have historically gotten in trouble with commercial real estate, that is one place. Banks have gotten in trouble with leveraged lending. The story tends to change but the outcome at the end of the day doesn't. So I am not sure I can take you down memory lane and tell you a good example of where somebody has done something differently. All I can say is that, I think the world changed four to five, six years ago with what occurred and I can't speak for other institutions all I can speak for at Fifth Third is that we are very comfortable with our perspective on credit today and we do not want to put the company in a position to return to past practices. Tayfun Tuzun : Mike, we also have to keep in mind that these decisions are not made purely on a credit basis because when you go back those decades, you will see different credit spread environments and different levels of capital that banks have been holding at the time. So when you look at the returns, that calculation includes more than just credit. So when we say that we are backing away from credit, we are not necessarily saying that we are seeing significantly negative credit trends, it's just a combination of spreads, of credit and where our capital levels require a different perspective on what we are putting on our books today. Mike Mayo : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello. I've got a question on the litigation side. You have had quite a few quarters over the last two years where you took fairly chunky litigation charges and this quarter you have got a recovery. So are you starting to see light at the end of the tunnel there that some of the issues that you had to build reserves for are finally getting closer to conclusion? Tayfun Tuzun : The litigation tunnel is a long one. This quarter the number was a recovery, but a small number. And I don't think necessarily that these processes are fast moving processes. So I wouldn't characterize it as we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I think it will take a while for us to work through all of these items. Geoffrey Elliott : And then just another quick expense one. The $33 million credit related expense within non-interest expenses, can you give any color on what that related to? It seems pretty large compared with what you normally see there? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. It is not necessarily one or two items. It is a combination. For example, derivative marks go there. I wouldn't necessarily characterize them as a total that reflects one or two trends. That number will be volatile quarter-over-quarter, so I wouldn't interpret the $33 million number as a run rate number. Geoffrey Elliott : Great. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi. A couple of questions. Firstly, energy loan growth, your oil and gas loans that you talked about which is just over $2 billion, how much did they grow in 2014 and how much of that is shared national credits? Frank Forrest : Hi. This is Frank. That book grew about $450 million in 2014. Our portfolio is really a mixture of both middle market and large corporate, so I don't have a specific percentage, but most of our companies would be anywhere in that sector. Vivek Juneja : Okay. So what you are saying is you don't have a breakout of how much is shared national credits? Frank Forrest : I mean again, our companies are predominantly \u2013 they are in the U.S., they are predominantly in the Southwest, they are a combination of middle market, mid-cap and large corporates. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Tayfun, a question for you. Just to clarify the NIM guidance short-term rate, you talked about the fact that NIM would be down 5 to 7 basis points by fourth quarter 2015 if rates stayed flat. Just want to clarify, are you referring to short-term rates staying flat meaning no Fed hikes, or are you referring to long-term rates staying where they are currently which is around 180 both? I'm just try to get a sense of -- Tayfun Tuzun : Both. Vivek, it is both. Vivek Juneja : Okay. So if the Fed did raise rates, but the long end still stayed down, what would NIM look like then? Tayfun Tuzun : That would impact mainly our investment portfolio yields and the timing of our deployments into the investment portfolio. We still obviously would benefit. We have a positive exposure to the short end and the benefit would be less than a complete yield curve move. Vivek Juneja : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning, Marty. Marty Mosby : Good morning. Now that we are trying to shift towards investing, what I wanted to at least have a chance kind of to understand better, or what are the opportunities that you are investing in and how does that fit with your competitive advantages, or how you are looking at being able to compete in the marketplace? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. So let me talk about a couple of specific items. In retail, as I have mentioned over the last few months, we have redesigned our employment in our branch system based upon the demographic trends and transaction trends that we are seeing from retail customers. Customers are reaching us through digital channels. We need to reach them through digital channels to be able to grow revenues as we are seeing less and less of them walking through the doors. We are investing in our ability to reach our customers through digital channels. That is one area and that is what we believe needs to happen as we continue to strengthen our retail franchise. The other area that we have been talking about clearly is on the corporate side as we are focusing on total relationship profitability, we need to make sure that we capture and use all the different pieces of relationship revenues and costs appropriately in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the way we price our products and services. That is another area. The third area that we are investing is in our payments business. We have as you know combined the retail and commercial pieces of the payment spectrum under one umbrella. We are making investments there because we do believe that going forward we have advantages given our history in that business. And then in investment advisory, which is another important business for us, we are adding talent to ensure a continued progress on revenue. So those are the areas that we are investing aside from the compliance and risk related infrastructure investments that we have in place. Marty Mosby : And then the second question I had was as you look at the advanced deposit situation and that rolling off, we had talked about trying to come up with some alternatives kind of the address what you are still doing there or not doing there and also what are those customers going to turn to now that they have been cut off from the product that you were providing them at the end of the year? Tayfun Tuzun : So on January 1, we reduced our price on the product by 70% and we also made some changes to the design of the product that will impact usage and the frequency of usage of the product. That is what sort of when we give the guidance of a $100 million reduction in revenues associated with the product, those changes would reflect that. What we don't know today is when the regulators will provide their guidance proposals and ultimately will issue their guidance. We don't know the timing of that and the way we formulated that for the year is depending on the time of when that guidance comes out, there are three outcomes. Either we are totally out of the business because the guidance does not enable us to offer any product. Our current product fits the guidance. In that case, we will continue to offer the product and potentially offer it to new clients, or within the guidance, we needed to make adjustments to our product design. What we don't know today is whether that is going to happen in March, June, September or in 2015 at all. We still seek to address the needs of those customers because we do believe that with the appropriate product designed appropriately, it is better to keep those clients in our fold. But again, the regulators will decide on how they see this industry working and we will react accordingly. Marty Mosby : And given the drastic reduction in pricing, is there any chance you might get incremental business from other customers wanting to take advantage of it? Tayfun Tuzun : Too early to tell, but just remember that we are not offering the product to people who were not signed on to the product at the beginning of 2014. We have not expanded the population. Marty Mosby : Got you. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from Sameer Gokhale from Janney Capital Markets. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning, Sameer. Sameer Gokhale : Great, thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Just a few questions. Firstly, I wanted to touch on your auto loan portfolio which hasn't grown very much. I know you had talked about trying to maintain your underwriting standards and I think the expectation for 2015 is for that portfolio to maybe shrink by 3% or so. And I was curious about how you think about running that business because it seems like it is more of a flow business and dealers clearly want to work with banks and other lenders that have loans more readily available for their customers at the point of sale. So as you think about maintaining your underwriting standards and maybe that loan portfolio shrinking a little bit, how do you balance that with the fact that you still need to maintain a presence in that business and maintain those relationships with the dealers. If you can talk about that, that would be a little helpful. Tayfun Tuzun : We have been in that business for a long time. I mean it goes back 30, 40 years. We have very good deep relationships with dealers and we have maintained those relationships through cycles. There is good business coming from the dealers that we are booking on our balance sheet and we will continue to do so. They expect what type of business that we will put on and they know what type of business that we will not put on. That hasn't hurt us. It is more or less a commodity business supported by maintaining those strong relationships. So as long as we are satisfied with the amount of loans that we get under the current profitability guidelines, we should be able to get that flow. And given the long-term relationships, if you do want to get more competitive, you can get more paper out of them because again they know that we are not in today, out tomorrow. They know that there is a longer cycle, so I don't think we are necessarily either damaging those relationships or impacting flows in a discernible manner. Sameer Gokhale : Okay. And then just sticking with the auto loans for now, if you were to look at vintages and if you look at the auto loans originated over the last 12 months, or so this has been more of an issue I think or concern for subprime auto which your portfolio seems to be prime. But to the extent that you can talk about LTVs for say the last 12 months and loan terms because we are hearing about terms as long as 84 months. Has that needle moved at all in your portfolio with your vintage for last year relative to prior years or have you maintained that at a pretty consistent level? Frank Forrest : In terms of term on the auto book over the last several years we have run 68 months, 68 months, this past year 69 months so no appreciable movement there. In terms of LTV, we have been running and continue to run in the 91%, 92% level. And in terms of FICA, we are 751 in 2014 and that is a very consistent trend. And to your point, reflective upon our focus on prime, super prime customers and overall strong credit profile within the auto book. Sameer Gokhale : Okay. And then just switching gears, if you could just touch on again the LCR, I think you said you were at 112% and what I was just trying to grapple with a little bit was where you are relative to what the requirements are through the beginning of 2016. You seem to be well ahead of that. And I think you had referred to maintaining some sort of cushion, but as I think about your LCR and then some of the commentary around maybe the securities portfolio growing, it seems like it doesn't need to grow a lot because you already have more than met the LCR requirement. So in light of that, should we expect any negative impact on the NIM going forward from the addition of maybe more high quality liquid assets? If you could just help clarify that a little bit because I think I just got a little confused with some of that discussion. Jamie Leonard : Sure. The good news is the growth in deposits and the elevated cash position really strengthens the balance sheet and gives us flexibility. So our 112% LCR includes the benefit of $7 billion of cash held at the Fed at year end. So if we were to deploy $7 billion of cash take it to an extreme and put it all in C&I loan growth, then your LCR would drop right back down to that 92% level where we were at, at the end of September. So my point in answering the question on securities deployment is some of that cash will be put to work in the course of 2015 as a modified approach bank. When we reach January of 2016, we will need to exceed a 90% LCR and we would like to have a buffer obviously beyond the 19%. There is some balance between holding $7 billion in cash and having 112% LCR and deploying that cash to both loan growth and further support HQLA additions where we will manage the LCR between 95 and 105 over the course of the next year or so. Sameer Gokhale : But just to think about it -- Operator : I am sorry, we have reached the end of our allotted time. I'm sorry for the interruption. You may go ahead with closing remarks. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you for joining us. Sameer, if you have any questions, I'm sorry we cut you off there. But if you have any questions, please call us and we will clarify your questions. Again, thank you for joining us and we look forward to sharing with you our progress throughout the year. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Cheryl, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Jim Eglseder, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. James P. Eglseder - Manager- Investor Relations : Thanks Cheryl, and good morning. Today, we'll be talking with you about our first quarter 2015 results. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial conditions, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. I'm joined on the call today by several people : our CEO, Kevin Kabat; and CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Frank Forrest, Chief Risk Officer; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin? Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jim. Morning, everyone. Today, we reported first quarter net income to common shareholders of $367 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.44. Results included the impact of a $70 million positive valuation on the Vantiv warrant, a $37 million gain on the sale of TDRs and a $17 million charge related to the valuation of our Visa total return swap, which in total benefited earnings by about $0.07. We produced solid returns with a 1.12% return on assets and a 10.3% return on equity. The environment continues to challenge banks. Combination of uneven economic growth, uncertainty around the Fed's monetary policies and the global impact of central bank actions continue to test the banks' business models. These are not new challenges, and we've discussed with you our strategies and tactics that are designed to preserve shareholder value and to grow our earnings with this background in mind. We are very focused on investing in our businesses, our infrastructure and our talent, while we make sure that we have appropriate returns on the capital that we deploy, given the risk exposures that we manage. We're building profitable relationships with our clients and earnings returns on the capital that we dedicate to those relationships. Regardless of the environment, that's what our focus is and that's where we excel. This quarter, we continued to execute our plan and the results are encouraging. Our loan growth showed momentum in the second half of the quarter, with end-of-period C&I loans up $1.3 billion or 3% sequentially. I'm encouraged by the trends that we saw in February and March, and I'm optimistic that our momentum will persist in the coming quarters. Within fee income, mortgage banking performed well, given the lower level of rates during the quarter, which drove higher refinancing activity and better margins. Mortgage originations were up 6%, and gain on sale revenue was up 25% from the fourth quarter. Highlights from the quarter also included record fee income in our investment advisory business of $108 million, up 7% from the last quarter and 6% from the prior year. This business continues to show solid and consistent growth, as we expected to see from the talent development and relationship management strategies we planned for that business several years ago. We also continued to generate strong deposit growth, with average core deposits up 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Expenses were up 1% compared with last quarter and down 3% from the prior year. Current quarter expenses included seasonally higher FICA and unemployment costs but were otherwise well maintained. Even as we continue to invest in our businesses and our infrastructure, we maintain our focus on our expenses. We've discussed our efforts to reduce our risk exposures. And during the quarter, we sold $568 million of residential mortgage TDRs from the pool we moved to held-for-sale last quarter. This transaction allowed us to take advantage of the market's appetite for these types of assets. Virtually every credit metric improved this quarter. Our net charge-off ratio was 41 basis points, the lowest we've seen in eight years, and include commercial net charge-offs of just 29 basis points of loans. Non-performing assets were down 27% from a year ago, and our NPA ratio ended the quarter at 76 basis points. We have put forth a great amount of effort to make progress on our credit results to showing up in significant, sustained improvement over the past several years. I'm very pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2015 CCAR plan. Capital management has been a strong and consistent part of our story, and our 2015 CCAR plan demonstrates the strength of our capital levels and our ability to generate organic capital, giving us the capacity to support shareholder returns. As we've discussed the past few quarters, we continue to work to reposition Fifth Third. We're maintaining our prudent approach to lending, with a focus on appropriate risk-adjusted returns. We've talked about the investments we are marking to strengthen our risk and compliance infrastructure, and we expect to ultimately benefit from them. We continue to make strategic decisions to achieve the right business mix, one which produces less volatile and more sustainable earnings growth. And ultimately, we are managing the company for the long term. And we're committed to maintaining our discipline, even in challenging environments. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter operating results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'll start with the financial summary on page three of the presentation. We reported net income to common shareholders of $367 million or $0.44 per diluted share. There were several items that affected earnings in the quarter, as Kevin mentioned. The largest was the Vantiv warrant valuation mark. That was a positive $70 million this quarter. As you know, in the fourth quarter, we transferred approximately $720 million of residential mortgage TDRs to held-for-sale. In the first quarter of 2015, we sold the majority of those loans for a pre-tax gain of $37 million. A partial offset was the charge related to the Visa total return swap. That was $17 million. The net impact of these three items was a benefit of $0.07 per share. With that, let's move to the average balance sheet and page four of the presentation. In the first quarter, average investment securities increased by $733 million or 3% sequentially, reflecting purchases of additional securities during the quarter. On an end-of-period basis, we added $4 billion of securities. Shifting to loans, we continue to be prudent on pricing and terms. Competition continues to be fierce, as we have stated before, but our loan activity picked up, especially during the second half of the quarter. And our C&I balances were up 3% on an end-of-period basis. It is a good sign that we are seeing growth within our risk appetite and credit and return profile targets. Our average portfolio balances decreased $533 million from the fourth quarter, driven by declines in residential mortgage, due to the transfer of TDRs to held-for-sale last quarter. This reduced average balances by approximately $694 million in the quarter. Commercial mortgage balances were down 3%, as we continued to see refinancing activity out of our legacy book, which offset growth in commercial construction. Competition from term investors, such as life insurance companies, continues to be difficult to match. We saw very strong deposit growth throughout 2014 and, as we expected, that continued in the first quarter. Average core deposits increased $1.8 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by growth in interest checking, money market and demand deposit accounts. Moving to NII on page five of the presentation. In line with our expectations and guidance in January, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $36 million sequentially to $852 million, primarily driven by a $21 million negative impact of the previously announced changes to our deposit advance product that were effective January 1. NII was also impacted by $13 million due to fewer days in the first quarter. The net interest margin was 286 basis points, down 10 basis points from the fourth quarter, with a seven basis point decline from the changes to our deposit advance products, three basis points of compression related to loan re-pricing and a two basis points decline related to our elevated cash balances. These were partially offset by a three basis point benefit from day count. Shifting to fees on page six of the presentation. First quarter non-interest income was $660 million compared with $653 million in the fourth quarter. Results included the $70 million positive mark on the Vantiv warrant and the $17 million charge on the Visa total return swap that I mentioned earlier. These impacts were positive $56 million and negative $19 million respectively in the fourth quarter. The first quarter also included a $37 million gain on the sale of TDRs. Excluding these items in both quarters, fee income of $570 million decreased $46 million or 7% sequentially, driven by the $23 million TRA payment that we recognized from Vantiv in the fourth quarter and a decrease in corporate banking results, partially offset by an increase in mortgage banking net revenue. Corporate banking fees decreased $28 million sequentially and $12 million from last year. The sequential and year-over-year comparisons were affected by a decline in syndication fees of $21 million and $11 million respectively, driven by decreased activity in the market during the quarter. Card and processing revenue decreased 6% compared to a seasonally strong fourth quarter and was up 5% from the first quarter of 2014, as we continue to benefit from greater card utilization and higher consumer purchase volume. Mortgage banking net revenue was up 40% sequentially due to higher gain on sale margins and an increase in originations to $1.8 billion compared with $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Gain on sale margins were up 48 basis points to 327 basis points. Net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include amortization and valuation adjustments, were negative $17 million this quarter versus negative $34 million last quarter. Deposit service charges declined 5% from the fourth quarter, reflecting first quarter seasonality, and increased 2% relative to the first quarter of 2014. The sequential decline was driven by a 9% decrease on the consumer side due to seasonally lower overdraft occurrences during the quarter. Total investment advisory revenue increased to a record high of $108 million, an increase of 7% sequentially, due to seasonally higher tax-related private client services revenue in the first quarter and strong securities and brokerage revenue. We've been successful in growing assets under management, which were up 5% from 2014, and we continue to focus on shifting fee structures to an asset-based recurring model away from transactional pricing. We show non-interest expense on page seven of the presentation. Expenses came in at $923 million this quarter compared with $918 million in the fourth quarter and included a seasonal increase in FICA and unemployment tax expense, recorded in employee benefits, partially offset by lower credit-related costs. Turning to credit results on page eight. Total net charge-offs of $91 million or 41 basis points as a percentage of average loans decreased $100 million sequentially. Excluding the impact of the TDR-related charge-offs in the fourth quarter, net charge-offs were down $13 million or 13% sequentially, reflecting improvement in commercial loan charge-offs. Non-performing assets excluding loans held for sale were $691 million at quarter end and down $53 million from the fourth quarter, bringing the NPL ratio to 57 basis points and NPA ratio to 76 basis points, its lowest level in seven years. Commercial NPAs decreased $40 million sequentially, primarily due to a $30 million decline in C&I and a $9 million decline in commercial mortgage. Consumer NPAs decreased $13 million from the fourth quarter driven by a decline in residential mortgage NPAs. As you recall, last quarter, we moved $720 million of residential mortgage TDRs to held-for-sale with the intent to sell in the first quarter. We successfully executed the sale, and that generated gains of about $37 million in the quarter. So all in, the net mark we took on the loans sold was 8%, and we feel very good about that result. Relative to our energy portfolio, the quality of the firms we have relationships with remains very good. The portfolio is $1.8 billion and is down $200 million since the end of the fourth quarter. Our team, which includes a petroleum engineer, has been in the business for more than 20 years. So they've seen a cycle or two. We continue to be comfortable with our portfolio, as the vast majority are investment-grade credits, with appropriate collateral, liquidity, cash flow and reserve coverage. We did see some potential weaknesses in the portfolio during the quarter, as you would expect in a declining oil price environment, and have downgraded credits where appropriate. And we would expect to remain proactive, given the current environment. Wrapping up on credit. The allowance for loan and lease losses declined $22 million compared to a $28 million decline last quarter, excluding the impact of the TDR-related actions, driven by continued credit improvements. Provision as a percentage of net charge-offs increased to 76% from 73% last quarter, excluding the impact of TDR-related actions. Reserve coverage remained solid at 1.42% of loans and leases and 247% of NPLs. We are pleased with the level of our credit metrics as we continue into 2015. Looking at capital on slide nine. Capital levels continue to be strong and well above regulatory requirements. The common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.6%. Starting on January 1, we are now on a Basel III basis, and our capital ratios for the current quarter are subject to Basel III transition provisions. At the end of the fourth quarter, the average diluted share count was down another 1% sequentially. During the quarter, we announced common stock repurchases of $180 million. That ASR settlement is expected to occur on or before April 23 and reduce the first quarter share count by 8.5 million shares. Relative to CCAR, the Federal Reserve's 2015 review is complete, and we received a non-objection to our capital plan. We believe our results demonstrate the relative strength of both of our capital position and our internal capital generation capacity. Turning to the outlook and a few comments on the second quarter. In our outlook, our goal is and has been to maintain a realistic perspective on the economy and the overall market conditions. I think you are seeing some of the items that we discussed in January call emerge in peer group calls this quarter. Beginning with NII. There is no change to our full-year NII expectations, even though our current outlook includes no interest rate hike until the fourth quarter compared with two expected moves back in early January. We have and will continue to actively manage our balance sheet to adopt a changing macroeconomic and Fed policy expectations. As a reminder, excluding the impact of the $100 million reduction in deposit advance-related decline, we expect our NII to grow year-over-year. For the second quarter, we expect NII to be higher than the first, based on average earning asset growth and day count. For NIM, we currently expect relative stability for the remainder of the year from first quarter levels. We do expect that NIM will be slightly lower during the second quarter than the first, due to continued loan re-pricing and the impact of day count. We expect higher fee income in the second quarter from a seasonally low first quarter, driven by card and processing revenue, deposit fees and corporate banking fees. Mortgage banking revenue continues to be a function of the rate environment. We had a good first quarter and experienced the wider gain on sale margin, but we are not forecasting second quarter margins to remain at those levels. When you also include the continued amortization of our servicing portfolio, due to our exit from the brokered origination channel, we currently expect mortgage banking net revenue to be below the first quarter but approximately in line with last year's second quarter. Along those lines, our guidance on operating leverage for the year is not changing either. We will continue to invest in our businesses and infrastructure. Those investments will increase our employee expenses as well as our technology spend. Expenses will increase during the next two quarters, relative to the first quarter, but we will see more stability, maybe a slight drop towards the end of the year. Again, the guidance we provided in January with respect to our efficiency ratio and revenue growth remains roughly intact. We expect our quarterly adjusted efficiency ratio to gradually decline over the next two quarters, with a more pronounced decline toward the end of the year. Turning to credit. We still expect ALLL releases to be significantly below last year's levels, and loan growth will result in higher levels of provisioning. We are very encouraged by the overall good quality of new loans that we are putting on our balance sheet, so our fundamental credit performance should continue to improve. We also would like to remind you that the revenue expectations that we shared with you today do not include potential but currently unforecasted items such as Vantiv warrant marks or gains on share sales. With that, let's open the line for questions. Cheryl? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Autonomous Research. On the net interest margin outlook, I wondered if you could give us a sense of, first, what that would like if we don't have any rate rises this year. And then second, you still, assuming we do have the rate rises, sticking to the five to seven basis points decline, excluding deposits advance, given that we had three basis points of decline in the first quarter? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I'll make a brief comment and then I'll turn it over to Jamie. As I said, at this point, we only have one rate increase assumption, which is at the end of the year in the fourth quarter. So relative to our January call, that is a change. In January, we had two raises, but now we're down to one and which is now at the end of the year. And in general, we expect our NIM to be stable from the first quarter levels, and I'll let Jamie go through the detail on that. James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. And I think if you're more focused on near-term NIM guidance, as Tayfun said, stable NIM, but for day count and the continued impact of loan re-pricing in the second quarter driving it down a couple of basis points. And obviously, there'll be other moving parts that should largely offset one another. One would be our continued holding elevated cash levels, but those cash levels should be down in the second quarter below the first quarter levels on average basis. And we continue to obviously do well growing our deposit book, and that's created some opportunity to continue to execute on liability management opportunities. And you saw some of that come through in the first quarter numbers with our core deposit cost down two basis points, and going forward that continues to be an opportunity for us. But as Tayfun said, net-net, down a little bit in the second quarter and stable in the back half of the year. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And relative to your question on the impact of EAX, just realize that the first quarter NIM reset for that. So that's why going forward, you're not going to feel that impact for the rest of the year. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning, guys. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : I was hoping you could speak in a bit more detail on the loan growth outlook. Obviously, this quarter's numbers were a little noisy, given the TDR move from last quarter. And then you had made the kind of more optimistic comments about February and March. So, one, if you can just provide some additional commentary on overall trends; and then, two, where you're seeing the most and least strength. I think, Tayfun, you had mentioned the commercial categories as looking good end of period. So just would be curious to hear your color there. Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Scott. I'll start it and I'll throw it to Tayfun. We have been encouraged, particularly as the quarter went on in terms of the type of activity that we're seeing. It's broad based, mostly in our specialty areas, but we feel good about where we're seeing it as broadly as it was. That's why we're encouraged as we look out into the rest of the year. So fairly positive from our perspective. Tayfun, you want to add some color? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We ended the quarter at encouraging levels, and you know that I don't tend to be that encouraging if I don't see the numbers. But the activity is at a healthy level. We see it on a widespread basis. Mid-corp continues to be doing well. Our middle market is picking up, and we're seeing good activity in verticals, as Kevin mentioned. The one weakness that we are still seeing is in commercial mortgage, not construction. Construction still is at healthy levels. Commercial mortgage is tough because we're seeing fairly stiff competition for assets. We're seeing loosening credit structure and very aggressive pricing environment. So along those lines, we're choosing not to necessarily participate there. But what's encouraging is that we are seeing the right type of clients with good support across the board from different revenue line items, so it's been a good quarter for us. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. That's sound great. I appreciate the color. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Ken. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. First question is just in terms of the energy portfolio. Do you quantify or can you quantify the reserve build associated with that this quarter? And where do you stand in reassessing the borrowing base of your clients? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We don't. We don't typically provide detailed guidance on reserves for specific portions. And in terms of general commentary about the energy portfolio, Frank? Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : Yeah. Ken, when you look at our diversified portfolio in the energy sector, upstream represents 50% of our energy-related exposure. Two-thirds of upstream commitments are under what I would determine as traditional secured reserve base structures. 70% went into value. We do have two borrowing base redeterminations annually. The balance of that upstream portfolio is predominantly investment grade. So we will and expect to see some stress on the loan to value of that book as prices stay down. But we still have adequate coverage today. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just another quick question. If you look at your overall loan growth, so ex out the move to held-for-sale, loan growth is a little bit weaker than peers, broadly speaking. Any reason why that might be the case? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : When we look at peer and loan growth, we're actually seeing better-than-peer performance. So again, this is about momentum. This is about the trends that we are seeing in the quarter. As we discussed in January, we clearly entered the year at a weaker point, so January balances were impacted by that. So I wouldn't necessarily rely on average balance comparisons between Q4 and Q1 but look more into trends that are apparent when you look at end-of-period numbers. Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : One other comment I would make. I think we're being prudent in our hold positions. We are seeing some fairly aggressive hold positions by peers, which is one of the things I think you will see as far as end-to-end point on loan growth. But overall, as we've said, we are seeing very good flow. We are attracting I think very good clients. We're very focused on client selection, but we are also being prudent in how much we're willing to hold on any particular exposure to ensure that we're diversifying the risk in our portfolio. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And Ken, I just want to go back to the energy piece and make one comment, which I think frequently gets missed. Despite the fact that we've been in the energy business for two, three years, you have to realize that we brought in a complete team in 2012. And that team has been underwriting loans for 20 years and it's a compact team. So I just want to make sure that we reflect the relative experience of our team with respect to our energy business. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. That helps. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR Capital. Your line is open. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Thank you very much. On the mortgage banking side, can you talk a little bit about the mix between refis \u2013 I didn't see it \u2013 and purchase and how you're seeing the purchase market shaping up? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's a bit early. It's still April. And we also want to be cautious in terms of the purchase market given our experience last year. In general, the market was expecting better activity going into the season, and then we did not see that overall as a sector. So we're a bit cautious in terms of projecting balances on the purchase side. In general, we would expect an uptick, but we have to realize that the low rate environment is providing momentum to the refi activity. And that's what we saw in Q1. In April, we'll probably see some of that still happening on the refi side, which could sort of tilt the balance a little bit more in favor of refi. But going into May and June, we would expect the purchase activity to pick up a little bit. So I think, Paul, it's a bit early. We'll probably be able to give you a little bit better update in July when we sort of observe the activity. But right now, we're at about a 40% purchase volume as of... Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: 40%. And then real quick, I know it's a small number but it's bucking the trend here a little bit. You wrote up your MSR. Can you add some color behind that? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We can. I'll turn it over to Jamie with details. But you have to realize that we've done actually \u2013 if you go back two, three years, we've had very consistent performance on the MSR side because we truly manage our mortgage exposures in combination with what we're doing on the production side as well as what we're doing with the servicing side. Jamie? James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. And the one maybe anomaly this quarter was we did take advantage of the opportunity, when we saw the sell-off in rates in mid-February that we took our hedge coverage ratio from the low 80% levels and then locked in those gains. And so we're hedged almost at 100% at the end of the quarter. And that really was where we captured some extra value during the quarter. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. So it's mainly just some small hedging gains; not really writing up the MSR. James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : Right. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Correct. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Hey, guys, thank you very much. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Ken. Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Tayfun, I was wondering if you could just elaborate on your comments about the expense trajectory across the year. Can you walk through where you are in that compliance spending increase that you had alluded to last quarter? And then can you also help us understand why the trajectory would go up for the next few and then drop off in the fourth? Is there something happening underneath the surface that you're expecting? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Ken, thanks for the question. The trajectory really has some seasonal factors, but let me answer the first part of your question. I think we are going to see throughout the year increases in our infrastructure investments in risk management and compliance. You're seeing very similar trends with our peer group banks. We're moving to this new methodology, and we're making sure that our infrastructure supports the new risk management and compliance structure. So you will see increases throughout the year. With respect to the rest of the expense trends, I think there is some seasonality in our marketing expense that you will see in Q2 and Q3. Clearly, we are making sure that we support revenue growth, and marketing spend is part of that. Typically, toward the end of the year, that spend goes down. From Q1 to Q2, you will see some increase in incentive compensation to increase in line with higher levels of business activity. Some of it in Q2 is related to higher, long-term incentive expense, which really is related to retirement-eligible employees. And we are still reducing head count in some areas. But again, redeployment of that head count into risk management infrastructure, we'll probably see higher head count going into second, third and fourth quarters. And technology investments are also going up. As we have said, regardless of the environment, we will continue to invest in our businesses. That's across the board. That's in our retail business, that's in our commercial business and that line item will see increases. But in general, we do believe that we are still maintaining focus on managing expenses in other areas. And ultimately, we will get to a level where some of these new processes and tasks will be replaced with technology. When we get to that level, you will see better efficiencies, even from sort of the existing risk management and compliance infrastructure. Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. And then to wrap that into your operating leverage comment, then, can you just remind us again your determination to deliver positive operating leverage on the full year? That's a year-over-year basis. And can you just remind us, is it against like the all the adjusted results like on page 11 of the supplement? How should we just be making sure that we're looking like-on-like? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Just one correction. Despite the fact that I think Q1 will be the high water mark for the efficiency ratio, I do want to remind you that our guidance is actually not \u2013 we're not guiding to a positive operating leverage. We said in January and we reiterated again today that we would expect revenues to increase. But given the $100 million decrease in EAX, our deposit advance-related revenues, we will see negative operating leverage this year. So I just wanted to... Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Right. No change to that then. Okay. Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian, Bank of America. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Erika. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. I just wanted to ask a clarification on the NII outlook. You mentioned that you took out one rate increase but didn't change your NII guidance from January. And I'm wondering if that was made up for in terms of a more robust outlook for loan growth for the balance of the year? Or is it coming from balance sheet growth from continued strong deposit inflows? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's a combination of all. And I think what we try to do is when we manage our NII, we try to manage it depending upon the market conditions that are current and that we expect to happen. And with that, we will make tactical changes in the way we manage our balance sheet. Jamie? James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Yeah. Just to reiterate what Tayfun said, I think it's both. It's the earning asset side, you saw the investment portfolio growth in the quarter. We're pretty opportunistic, able to pull forward some of our anticipated growth there. And so the portfolio's 19% of our total assets, so on average or a little bit underweighted to peers. But again, we are opportunistic. And then the strong deposit growth with household acquisition, new customer acquisition, really has given us some flexibility to go after the deposit pricing. And you're starting to see that show up in the numbers. So I think we've been responsive to the environment, and we're pretty pleased with the results. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. And my second question is on corporate banking. I appreciate the seasonality in the first quarter and the guidance for higher level in second quarter. But the first quarter number was down 11% year-over-year. And I'm wondering how we should think about the full-year progression in corporate banking and sort of the factors that are underlying that progression versus what you saw in 2014. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think our full-year expectations in corporate banking, we're still looking to growing corporate banking fee revenues. Clearly, first quarter was challenging because from a loan syndication perspective, the level of activity was significantly below what we expected. Now having said that, we're not necessarily saying that we're going to go back to the level of activity that we experienced last year. We are expecting some pickup, and you should see some revenue pickup there related to an uptick from Q1 levels. And we are growing in other areas. We clearly have a very healthy derivative business in foreign exchange and interest rates, and we're seeing some activity there. And I think in interest rates, for example, I think we hit the low levels and I think last year. This year, we should perform better in business lending fees. We should see an uptick there this year. That will support growth year-over-year. So in general, despite weakness in the syndication activity, other lines should pick up the flag and we should see growth on a year-over-year basis. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell, Wells Fargo Security (sic) [Securities]. Your line is open. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Jamie, maybe a question for you. You mentioned the pull forward of some of your securities activity that you're planning on for all of 2015 into the first quarter. Also noted that the duration of the securities portfolio was down to about 4.3 years from five years at the end of last year. Can you give us a little bit of color as to sort of where you stand in terms of what you've got to do for the remainder of the year in terms of the securities portfolio and what growth you anticipate from here in the portfolio? James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : Sure. And, yes, the 4.3 years, also, yield was up in the first quarter. And so we're pretty pleased with the outcomes there. We do expect the yield to be down a little bit in the second quarter due to day count as the rest of the purchases, the full quarter impact there. But what we're seeing on the investment opportunity side really is dictated to a large extent by the LCR. So finishing the first quarter at 108% on the LCR with about $2.5 billion or so of excess cash to where our targeted cash levels are really means that as we look ahead and how much cash we need to deploy and still stay above 100% LCR, which is our goal, 10% above the 90% regulatory minimums means that we'll need to put $1 billion to $2 billion to work to maintain an LCR above those levels. So that's how we're thinking of the rest of the year is really use the portfolio to ensure that LCR's above 100% and then just attack opportunities as they're presented by the market. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, Jamie. And Kevin, maybe a question for you. I appreciate this is a sensitive topic, but I'm just curious if you have any comments about the potential for the SIFI designation to get lifted from $50 billion. Seems that raising that to $100 billion wouldn't necessarily be a material benefit for you. But if it's raised materially above that, what are the benefits to Fifth Third from such change? Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Matt. What I would say is that I think a lot of dialogue is going on today, and I think there's a lot of folks really kind of reflecting on some of the rules and what gets used as kind of the metric for evaluating. If you use strictly a straight-line asset number, yeah, then some people will fall above and some people will fall below. If you use that in combination with some of the things that have been talked about relative to complexity in the industry, it potentially changes the field quite substantially. How that will come out, I can't predict and I wouldn't even know how to handicap that from our perspective. Clearly, though, if the line moves, I mean I think the two most obvious impacts to us would be some of the work necessarily involved in the CCAR process could potentially change. Not that we would walk away from the benefits of the tools that we now incorporate into our capital planning process, but we could see some expense savings there in terms of being more productive and less voluminous in terms of our justifications for our CCAR levels. And then the second area would be in the living will kind of area. Those would be the two most obvious impacts to folks that fall above or below that line. Changing that again changes the amount of work, the amount of time and the amount of effort that we as an organization would have to put into that. So I think that kind of frames for you what's at stake here. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for the color. Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. And just a quick reminder. Please limit your questions to one primary question and one follow-up question. Our next questioner is from the line of Bill Carcache, Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Could you talk about how we should be thinking about the timing and magnitude of Vantiv share sales throughout the rest of 2015, particularly given the nice rally that the stock has had and the fact that it's now near all-time highs post-IPO? And I guess in general, is it reasonable to expect that those share sales could be completed by the end of this year, or are they more likely to extend into next year? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We typically don't give guidance in terms of the timing and the size of our disposition. But in general, we have stated before that we will not be a long-term owner of the company. We are very pleased with the company's operations and the value that we were able to build and achieve. And our goal is to make the optimal decision for our shareholders. And we had one sale last year and we'll see how this year goes. But we are monitoring, clearly, all of the same metrics that you are there. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. In the past, you guys have talked about some of the initiatives that had been in place to replace what would eventually be that last Vantiv income stream. Maybe could you give us an update on those initiatives? And then perhaps also speak to the possibility of hanging onto Vantiv a bit longer, given the nice, I guess, equity method income contribution that you get from that business, the potential to which there might be some incentive in hanging on to it, perhaps a bit longer. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Ultimately, I think if we were to liquidate our shares and convert it to share buybacks, that's an accretive outcome. So with respect to the revenue piece, and so economically, our shareholders will be compensated for a potential exit from the company, regardless of the decrease in the revenues. Now as you know and as we have discussed with you, we have combined our payments businesses, the consumer and commercial side under one roof. And we are making investments and introducing new products to the market to be able to support revenue lines that we get from our commercial and consumer clients. And in general, our goal is clearly, just if you only focus on the revenue line to continually grow other fee-generating businesses and grow the sort of earnings per share contribution there. So there are clearly different sensitivities that we are mindful of and we are looking at as we build our strategic decisions around Vantiv. Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And the only thing I would add, Bill, is, you've heard us talk about the development and the organization around our payments and commerce space. We're quite pleased with the continued progress and focus there. We think that's a good long-term strategy for us as we're building products and orientations around selling into value in a space that we have some real significant expertise. So again, we're encouraged. We think we're on the right track from that standpoint. And over the long-term will benefit shareholders, so... Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. That's very helpful. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Matt. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you guys talk about how you're feeling on the indirect auto lending business? I know you had pulled back a little bit as things had gotten very competitive and the balances are kind of flat to down. Any change in the competitive landscape there or how you're thinking about it? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Not really. I think our views have been fairly stable in that business over the last two, three years. We're still very mindful about returns. We're focusing on maintaining the credit profile that is commensurate with the returns. Jamie, any commentary about what you're seeing? James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. The yield, Matt, in the first quarter on new production continued pretty much on pace with what we saw in the fourth quarter at a 304. The FICAs were again 750, a little better. The credit profile continues to be great. It's 52% used, 48% new for the quarter, 69-month average term with obviously durations much shorter than that. And the LTVs, 90%, 91%. So it's... Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Stability is the name of the game there, and we clearly are very focused on what the market is doing. But in general, there is really no change in the way we approach that business. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And where do you think you differ the most versus the overall industry? I mean obviously, the industry is growing. Some peers are growing outsize, but which, whether it's the yield or the term or FICO, like where do you think you differ versus the overall market? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think it's a combination of all. Our advance rates tend to be lower compared to what we're seeing from others. We are not competing on the seven-year products. The term is an important piece for us. And clearly the \u2013 just FICO scores in general, we are not moving down the credit profile. And some of our competitors have subprime businesses and we don't. So they're experiencing better growth in those segments, which fits their credit appetite and it doesn't ours. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo, CLSA. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Mike. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. Two short follow-up questions and my main question. What is the carrying value of Vantiv versus the market value? James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : We don't disclose the carrying value yet, Mike, because they haven't released their earnings yet. But you're in that unrealized gain position between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We own 22.8% of the company, and we carry that at about a $400 million number right now. So that's what our numbers show. And then you have obviously the warrants, which are mark to market, and then you have the TRA that is not showing up on our books. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Is the full drop from the deposit advance product in the first quarter? I guess it hurt $21 million this quarter, and you said it will eventually hurt by $25 million. So do we have $4 million more to go per quarter? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I think the commentary that we made last January was relative to the full year in 2014. And as we have not expanded the marketing of that product to new clients, the usage on a quarter-to-quarter comparison will continue to drop and, therefore, will be coming off of that $25 million number. So for now, the $21 million number is fully baked in. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Right. No, I just mean, in other words, the fourth quarter to first quarter drop, it was $21 million. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Correct. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : So we shouldn't expect any more big quarter-to-quarter drops? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You should not. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : It's done. And that's why you feel better about efficiency getting better this year. It's is one of the factors? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's correct. Yeah. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. And now my... Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : If you think about it, Mike, from the time that we talked about it last year when you're not selling the product and you're not opening new accounts, you do have account closings during the course of the year. And that probably accounts for most of the attrition and the difference of those two numbers. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. And now my main question for Kevin. I guess the question is, will the real Kevin Kabat please stand up? I mean I'm looking at your CEO letter here, and it seems pretty cautious. You're talking about competition, technology, regulation, the new age in banking and all these headwinds. And you started off today's call talking about record fees and investment advisory accelerating commercial loan growth, deposit growth. And so I can't tell if you're cautious or optimistic between the CEO letter and the way you started off today's call. What message are you trying to convey? Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The way that I would kind of put that, Mike, just so that you had a perspective is, look, a lot of what you talked about in terms of the annual letter is a description of the environment that we're in. And the fact of the matter is that the environment's challenging for banks for a lot of those reasons that I talked about. That notwithstanding, there are things that we've been able to continue to do strategically, competitively that continues to differentiate Fifth Third going forward. So if you're getting confused of the way that we attack in an environment that's challenging, that would be the clarity I would try to draw you to. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : All right. Thanks for that color. Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari, Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Good morning. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Just back to loan growth, I wanted to ask a little bit about outlook. I appreciate the color you gave around the C&I trends and also what you're seeing on commercial real estate being somewhat sluggish. In terms of your overall outlook for loan growth, is it likely here that it stays in the 4% range of kind of where it's been or where it is now? Or could we see strengthening in that growth rate as we move through 2015 consistent with your recent bullishness? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think what we said in January was that you should expect the banking sector to grow at GDP plus. We clearly have some investments in our retail businesses and in other areas that should help us to get over that GDP number. And our bullishness is based on the trends that we are seeing. Those trends, if they continue, we should see outstripping that 3% number for the year. And we will update you as we go along. But for now, we are seeing good activity, and we are optimistic that, that will continue. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. And then separately, on the expense side, just wanted to get your thoughts on the efficiency ratio from a long-term perspective with and without higher rates. Again, thanks for the color you gave on the near-term likelihood around operating leverage or not. But just how do you think about the trend and the efficiency ratio not just through 2015 but into 2016 with or without rates? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think clearly, this year, the interruption in our success in driving our efficiency ratio down was interrupted because of EAX change. And that $100 million is a big number to overcome. And you will see throughout 2015 growth in revenues, which is going to help to drive down the efficiency ratio. Our longer-term outlook is, the sort of mid-50s type of target was always based on a more normalized rate environment. And some of the statistics that we publish with respect to where our rate sensitivity is would support that outlook. But regardless, I think we will be able to grow our revenues to gain efficiencies. And that clearly does not even include the expense management focus that we have in place. As I said, our risk management and compliance expenses are going up this year. But eventually \u2013 and it always happens \u2013 that we take a look at the processes and find technology solutions to achieve the same results. And all those combined should support further improvement in our efficiency ratio. And if the rate environment helps us a little bit more, we can achieve that faster. John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale, Janney Montgomery Scott. (sic) [Scott]. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Sameer. Sameer Shripad Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just a few questions. I wanted to follow up on the question about deposit advance, the product and your guidance. And specifically, what I wanted to ask you was whether your outlook incorporates like a recent proposal from the CFPB, which seems to have some more onerous requirements for these type of short-term product. And also wanted to get a sense for whether this somehow affects any alternative products you might be offering to that customer base. And again, whether you've baked that all into your guidance because it sounds like you have. You don't really expect much of an incremental impact beyond the Q1 impact, but I just want to clarify that? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I mean we've seen, obviously, the same language that you've seen from the regulators, and we are evaluating currently our product offering accordingly. We're not making an adjustment in terms of our outlook and our expectations. We will be further analyzing the guidance, further analyzing our business and the interests of our clients. And if there is a change in that, we will update you. But for now, I don't have really any updates on that for you. Sameer Shripad Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. And then the other question I had was in terms of your commercial loans and commercial loan growth, I think you gave some commentary saying that the growth was somewhat broad based, at least that's what we're hearing from other banks as well. The question I had was, it looks like your utilization rates were flat sequentially. And I was curious what happened to loan commitments, if those increased or stayed flat. And I'm trying to just again kind of think about that in the context of broad-based loan growth and like maybe a pickup in commercial loans because certainly, it doesn't seem like utilization rates have increased. That would be perhaps more of an indication that there is broad-based demand. So how should we think about that? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Utilization rates have stayed flat quarter-over-quarter, and they have been flat since the middle of next year. I think there was one uptick last year from Q1 to Q2, maybe. Our commitments are up a little bit. And it's difficult to necessarily interpret the demand side of this because clearly, there are some sectors that are benefiting. And I think we're going to see, for example, the healthcare side will remain healthy. Our verticals on retail, for example, I think the consumer expenditure side with the expectation of the gas price decrease should look healthier for the remainder of the year. And one challenging part is clearly the export sector, but we will just have to see what the global macro environment does for that. So in general, there is no underlying expectation of an increase in utilization rates in our outlook. Sameer Shripad Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. And then just, my last question was I think you have decided to exclude AOCI from your common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. I mean that's something we were expecting most banks to do anyway because it seems like that would limit volatility in that ratio. But aside from the effect of volatility, is there any other reason we should think of as far as your decision to exclude AOCI, or is it really just to limit the volatility potentially there? James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. It's simply to limit the volatility in managing your capital base. Sameer Shripad Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. Okay. That's all I had. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Sameer. James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of David Eads, UBS. Your line is open. David Eads - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the call. Just kind of following up on C&I loan outlook. I think a couple quarters when you guys had a little bit slower growth there, you pointed to basically originations being healthy but a little bit of a pickup in paydowns. And I'm curious what kind of dynamic you're seeing there, whether it's an increase in origination or kind of a slowing in paydown activity. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Oh, I mean I think paydowns are slowing down. We've seen the high water mark last year. Well, it's too early to say what happens the rest of this year. But so far, early in the year here, we've seen a drop in paydown activity. David Eads - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then just kind of going to the strong investment advisory revenues, I know you guys talked about a little bit of a seasonal uptick there. When I look at recent years, there really hasn't been that much of a 2Q decline there. So I mean, I guess was there anything uniquely seasonal this year, or should we kind of think of this as a pretty good run rate going forward? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I mean I think last year, we were flat. Some of it clearly has to do with where the market is, and we'll see what happens in Q2. But in general, it's probably better to do year-over-year growth comparisons. And for this year, we expect to grow our revenue line there. Quarter-to-quarter, we're a little bit hostage to what happens to the market. But we're seeing good asset inflows, which will support growth for the year. David Eads - UBS Securities LLC : Sure. That's great. Well thanks so much. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Angel, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank Earnings Release Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Jim Eglseder, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Jim Eglseder : Thanks Angel, and good morning. Today, we\u2019ll be talking with you about our second quarter 2015 results. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial conditions, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties and there are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We\u2019ve identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. I\u2019m joined on the call today by several people : our CEO, Kevin Kabat; and CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Frank Forrest, Chief Risk Officer; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Also here today is our President and COO Greg Carmichael. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin? Kevin Kabat : Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everybody. And thanks for joining us. As you all know, I announced my retirement as CEO that will be effective later this year. And before we get into the highlights of this quarter\u2019s results, I want to take a moment to reflect on my 33 years in the banking industry, especially the last roughly 10 leading Fifth Third. I\u2019m proud of the hard work and dedication of the very talented individuals I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with over the years. Together we\u2019ve navigated some of the most challenging times the industry has ever faced. In early 2007 when I was named CEO, we were just starting to see cracks in the foundation that ultimately turned out to be the worst crisis the industry has seen since the Great Depression. Our decisive and early actions to build a significantly better company, that is, today positioned to operate in all environments with strong momentum going forward. Today we have very solid capital levels that support some of the highest total payout ratios of our peers. We\u2019ve made changes to how we approach our commercial business and more recently our retail business in response to the changing conditions and preferences of our customers. We\u2019ve positioned the company well in order to effectively endure the current low-rate environment but also maintain the flexibility to accelerate growth once the economy regains full growth and rates start to rise. Let me introduce you to Greg Carmichael, who\u2019ll take over from me as COO in November. Greg\u2019s been our Chief Operating Officer since 2006 and President and COO since 2012. He\u2019s a very capable leader. And I\u2019m confident that under his watch, the company will continue to thrive and grow. Greg? Greg Carmichael : Thanks Kevin. I\u2019m excited to have the opportunity to build upon Kevin\u2019s accomplishments that have firmly changed our company over the last 10 years. I\u2019m also appreciative of the board\u2019s confidence in me and our team to continue to build value for our shareholders. I look forward to meeting you in the upcoming months and share with you my plans to continue our progress and move our franchise forward in this fast-changing environment. Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Kevin so he could cover the highlights for the quarter. Kevin? Kevin Kabat : Thanks Greg. Obviously, there is a great deal of respect that we have for each other. And I\u2019m confident the transition will go smoothly. I continue to be optimistic about our future. So, with that, let\u2019s talk about the quarter. Today, we reported second quarter net income to common shareholders of $292 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.36 including $0.07 of items that Tayfun will go over shortly. We\u2019re very pleased with our core business trends although the environment continues to challenge banks. We\u2019re very focused on our businesses and continue to demonstrate our willingness to take decisive action when necessary as you saw with our branch announcement in June. Ultimately we\u2019re building a franchise that meets the needs of our customers by enabling them to conduct business in the manner they wish while also building a company that is well positioned to compete effectively today and be well positioned with the appropriate strategies in place to succeed in the future. For the second quarter, excellent balance sheet trends continued with loan growth led by C&I which was up 3% both sequentially and year-over-year. Strong deposit growth continued with core deposits of $2.3 billion from the first quarter driven primarily by demand deposits with those balances up 5% sequentially and up 13% over last year. Fee income was led by very good results in corporate banking which were up $50 million sequentially on strength and capital markets and higher syndication fees, which were up from soft market activity levels in the first quarter. Mortgage banking was up $31 million from the last quarter as originations were up 39% to $2.5 billion. Expenses were up compared with last year as expected, second quarter expenses were highly - were higher largely due to long-term incentive payouts that occurred in the quarter and several other puts and takes that Tayfun will discuss. We remain very focused on our current operating results as we continue to invest in our company with a long-term strategic view. Credit metrics continued to be excellent. And our net charge-off ratio was 37 basis points in the quarter, the lowest level I\u2019ve seen in our tenure as CEO. Non-performing assets were down 25% from the year ago. And our NPA ratio ended the quarter at 67 basis points down 12% sequentially. We\u2019ve seen significant and sustained improvement in our credit results over the past several years and we feel very good about the people and the infrastructure that we have in place right now. This quarter marks another in a long line that includes actions undertaken in order to proactively adapt to the changing marketplace. We\u2019ve maintained our sites and our prudent approach to lending, the focus on appropriate risk adjusted returns. We\u2019ve actively managed the retail franchise over the last several - over the last few years and we\u2019ve been very proactive in adapting to the changing demographics and our customers\u2019 usage of new technologies. We\u2019ve talked about the investments we\u2019re making to strengthen our risk and compliance infrastructure. And we expect to see a competitive benefit from them. Ultimately we\u2019re managing the company for the long-term, that\u2019s our focus. And we do expect it to be beneficial to shareholders through time. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter operating results and our outlook for the second half of the year. Tayfun? Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks, Kevin. Good morning and thanks for joining us. I will start with the financial summary on page 3 of the presentation. We reported net income to common shareholders of $292 million or $0.36 per diluted share. There were several items that affected earnings in the quarter, as Kevin mentioned. The largest was the $97 million non-cash impairment charge related to the changes in our branch network that we announced in June. We also had a positive Vantiv warrant valuation mark of $14 million this quarter. These two items had a net negative impact of $0.07 per share. I will comment on the branch announcement at the end of the discussion of our operating trends and metrics. With that, let\u2019s move to the average balance sheet and page 4 of the presentation. The stronger loan activity we had in the second half of first quarter carried throughout the second quarter. Average portfolio loan balances increased $1.7 billion from the first quarter driven by increases in C&I, commercial construction and residential mortgage balances. Specifically, our C&I balances were up 3% on an average basis. Loan growth metrics reflect the results of our team\u2019s focus on growing our existing relationships as well as selecting new clients that meet our return profile within our risk tolerance levels. Although our payouts were higher than the first quarter, our loan production this quarter was very strong across all industries except energy. In total, our second quarter production was the highest in the last five quarters. The average credit rating for this quarter\u2019s production pool was the highest of the last five quarters as well. There is no let down in competition but we are confident that our client retention and selection efforts are supportive of loan growth. New production coupons are lower, to a certain extent in line with better credit quality. At the same time, our payoff coupons were also lower than the first quarter indicative of events-related rather than refi-related balance. Line utilization was flat. Average commercial mortgage balances were down 1% as we continue to see refinancing activity of our legacy book. Commercial construction lending remained strong. Growth in multifamily and industrial commercial construction remained strong with 75% of production coming from within our footprint. Our new commitments, net of prepayment activity should support second half loan growth in this portfolio. In the second quarter, average investment securities increased by $4.2 billion or 18% sequentially reflecting the full quarter impact of our first quarter purchases and $2 billion of additional securities during the second quarter. On an end-of-period basis, we added $1.5 billion of securities. We saw very strong deposit growth throughout 2014. And as we expected, that continued in the first half of 2015. Average core deposits increased $2.3 billion from the first quarter driven by growth in demand deposit and money market accounts. Moving to NII on page 5 of the presentation, taxable equivalent net interest income increased $40 million sequentially to $892 million, primarily driven by the faster than anticipated deployment of cash into earning asset growth and lower deposit costs. NII has also positively impacted by $7 million due to an extra day in the quarter. The net interest margin was 290 basis points, up 4 basis points from the first quarter driven by a 6-basis point benefit due to the faster than anticipated deployment of cash that I mentioned, 3 basis points due to better funding rates including the continued rationalization of deposit rates, partially offset by 4 basis points of loan yield compression and 1-basis point decrease primarily due to day-count. Shifting to fees on page 6 of the presentation. Second quarter non-interest income was $556 million compared with $630 million in the first quarter. Results included the $97 million impairment charge related to the changes in the branch network and the $14 million positive mark on the Vantiv warrant that I mentioned earlier. First quarter results included a $70 million positive mark on the Vantiv warrant, a $37 million gain on the sale of the residential TDRs and a $30 million-impairment associated with aircraft leases. Quarterly results also included charges on the Visa total return swap of $2 million in the current quarter and $17 million last quarter. Excluding these items in both quarters, fee income of $641 million increased $71 million or 12% sequentially with broad-based increases in almost all categories led by increases in corporate banking revenue and mortgage banking net revenue. Adjusted fee income was 42% of revenue in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of the $30 million aircraft lease residual impairment in the first quarter, corporate banking fees increased $20 million sequentially due to improvement in institutional sales revenue and higher syndication fees. Syndication activity was better this quarter than last and we had a strong quarter in corporate bond fees. Total risk management fees which include our interest rates, foreign exchange and derivative businesses were stable. Card and processing revenue increased 8% sequentially and 1% from the second quarter of 2014 as we continue to benefit from an increase in the number of actively used cards. Mortgage banking net revenue of $117 million was up 36% sequentially. Originations increased to $2.5 billion from $1.8 billion in the first quarter. Gain on sale margins were down 39 basis points to 288 basis points. We had a good quarter in mortgage servicing revenues. Net servicing asset valuation adjustments which include amortization and valuation adjustments were positive $18 million this quarter versus negative $17 million last quarter. Deposit service charges increased 3% from the first quarter and were flat relative to the second quarter of 2014. Total investment advisory revenue of $105 million decreased 3% sequentially due to higher tax related private client service revenue in the first quarter partially offset by an increase in securities and brokerage fees and increased 3% from the second quarter last year. Within investment advisory revenue, personal asset management fees were up 5% while brokerage fees were up 8% from the second quarter of 2014. We show non-interest expense on page 7 of the presentation. Expenses were higher in the quarter in-line with our expectations and came in at $947 million compared with $923 million in the first quarter. The sequential increase was impacted by higher revenue base incentive compensation and long-term incentives in the second quarter as well as an increase of $2 million in severance. Overall, our first half comp related expenses were 2.3% higher than the comp related expenses for the first half of 2014. Included in our expense total, is also a $6-million sequential quarter change in the provision expense related to unfunded commitments in-line with the broader directional move in provision. The sequential comparison also exaggerates the expense growth as the first quarter benefited from a settlement of a tax liability related to prior years. These were partially offset by a decrease in FICA and unemployment tax expense recorded in quarterly benefits which are seasonally high in the first quarter. I will spend more time on expenses in our outlook section. Turning to credit results on page 8. Total net charge-offs of $86 million or 37 basis points as a percentage of average loans decreased $5 million sequentially. Non-performing assets excluding loans held for sale were $626 million at quarter end, down $65 million from the first quarter bringing the NPL ratio to 51 basis points and the NPA ratio to 67 basis points. Commercial NPAs decreased $45 million sequentially primarily due to a $23 million decline in C&I and $20 million decline in commercial mortgage. Consumer NPAs decreased $20 million from the first quarter driven by $12 million decline in residential mortgage and $5 million decline in home equity NPAs. Our energy portfolio declined to $1.7 billion and the quality of the firms we have relationships with remains very good. The portfolio was reduced by $155 million from the first quarter, of which approximately 50% relates to reserve based lending. Utilization in the portfolio declined 3% as companies continue to access capital markets to bolster their balance sheets. There were some negative ratings migration but not material in the context of the overall portfolio. We continue to be comfortable with our portfolio from a loss given the full perspective, with appropriate collateral, liquidity, cash flow and reserve coverage levels. In our RBL portfolio, we are a senior secured lender with in many cases significant levels of subordinated risks ahead of the bank\u2019s position. Of this $66 million in NPA in-flows only $11 million related to the energy portfolio. Also, SNC results were communicated to banks in the second quarter and while I won\u2019t get further into specifics or material impacts from the exam are included in our results in the second quarter. Wrapping up on credit, the allowance for loan and lease losses declined $7 million compared with $22 million decline last quarter. Provision coverage of net charge-offs increased to 92% from 76% last quarter and reserve coverage decreased to 1.39% of loans and leases. Virtually, all of our credit metrics continue to improve as we move into the second half of 2015. Looking at capital on slide 9. Capital levels continue to be strong and well above regulatory requirements. The common equity tier-1 ratio was 9.4%. At the end of the second quarter, the average diluted share count was down another 1% sequentially. During the quarter, we announced common stock repurchases of $155 million. The ASR settlement is expected to occur on or before July 28 and reduced the second quarter share count by 6.7 million shares. Now, a few comments about our announced retail branch actions and our perspectives on the current environment before we move to our outlook section. As we\u2019ve been discussing with you for the last couple of years, our retail franchise has performed very well in this challenging environment, and we\u2019ve been very proactive in adapting to the changing demographics, and our customers\u2019 usage of new technologies. After executing a successful deposit simplification strategy in 2012 and 2013, we have been optimizing our branch FTE count by both reducing service employees as well as reinvesting in sales associates. These changes not only enabled us to optimize our expenses but also help improve our customer service levels and align our service channels with our customers\u2019 preferences. Up until this quarter, our branch count has been fairly stable. But given these changes a deeper review of our branch network was conducted during the second quarter which led to the planned reduction of our branch count by 105. We use the scorecard with over 50 variables in accessing our network, including production volumes and trends, transaction volumes and trends and overlaps among others. We will be executing this strategy over the next 12 months. We\u2019ve taken $97 million impairment charge related to the owned branches and land which is $12 million higher than our June announcement. The incremental impairment charge we booked was due to the addition of a handful of additional locations and the receipt of actual appraisals. Our annualized expense benefit is also greater given the higher number of branches than originally announced. We will identify the expense impact related to the lease branches for you as they flow through our numbers over the next six months based on the closing date of those branches. We expect to fully execute this strategy by mid-2016 and thus expect the reduction to impact our expense totals on a run-rate basis during the second half of the next year. Between now and then, we will continue to update you as to the progress of the project. But at this time, I\u2019m not ready to share more details with you regarding geographies and timing as I know you\u2019ll understand, I would like to preserve our ability to execute the plan as efficiently as possible. On a fully annualized basis, we expect to lower our expenses by $65 million once the entire action is executed which is $5 million better than originally announced. Our management team is keenly focused on capturing a significant portion of these expense savings in our bottom line, but we are also anticipating a portion of the savings to be reinvested in the business to continue to build our digital channel platforms not only for retail but for our entire company. These investments are designed to provide further opportunities to improve our cost efficiencies and improve our customer service as well as support revenue growth. We will be sharing our reinvestment plans with you as we finalize our strategic studies. I want to reemphasize our management team\u2019s focus on expense management especially as the expense carry of the risk and compliance structures in our sector continues to ramp up. The types of strategic actions that we are currently evaluating are long-term oriented actions, very clearly focused on building our company to achieve our revenue growth and operational excellence objectives in recognition of the evolution and technology, demographic changes and required infrastructure designs in the current regulatory environments. Turning to the outlook and a few comments on the third quarter. Thus far we\u2019ve maintained and communicated a realistic perspective on the economy and the overall market conditions and shared our outlook with you on that basis. This perspective enabled us to react appropriately to market driven opportunities to support our asset growth and earnings. Our updated outlook is not materially different than what we provided in January and again in April. We continue to feel comfortable with our full-year NII expectations. As a reminder, we have one rate increase assumption in the fourth quarter as we have discussed in April. We have and will continue to actively manage our balance sheet to adapt to changing macroeconomic and Fed policy expectations. We don\u2019t have any underlying assumptions related to swap activity built into our NII outlook and we have fairly modest levels of swaps relative to peers. We do still expect our NII to grow year-over-year excluding the deposit advance impact. And for the third quarter we expect NII to be slightly higher than the second driven primarily by loan growth and day-count. At this time, we also expect NII to growth in Q4 over the third quarter levels. As we discussed in April, we expect our NIM to be stable during the year from the first quarter levels. We\u2019ve outperformed our NIM expectations this quarter so we don\u2019t expect our NIM to widen further from here in the third quarter. And our overall NIM during the second half should be stable with our first half NIM which is 2.88%. Third quarter corporate banking fees tend to be seasonally low with a stronger fourth quarter, which should elevate the second half totals in corporate fees over the first half totals. Our current expectation is that mortgage banking production net revenue will be somewhat below the second quarter levels but above last year\u2019s third quarter. The servicing revenues will be a function of the rate environment. Excluding the mortgage servicing revenues we expect a strong second half in total fee income but following seasonal trends with a stable third quarter and a strong fourth quarter. Overall, fee trends look positive for the second half. On the expense side, as we discussed, we are continuing to invest in our businesses and infrastructure. And those investments will further increase our employee expenses primarily in our risk and compliance functions. In addition, our investments in cyber security and fraud areas will build a safer environment for us as well as for our customers. For the second half, I expect that our total compensation expenses will be relatively flat including employee benefits and incentive comp for business activity. In addition, during this phase, third party expenses tend to be more elevated. Some of these expenses are clearly not permanent. You have seen these types of increases from other banks depending upon where they are in the cycle. We expect higher payment processing expenses as a good portion of those are directly tied to payment activity. In addition, as we discussed with you earlier in the year, we will see an up-tick in EMV related expenditures which will reduce risks going forward. Technology investments will continue to increase. We expect our IT expenses during the second half to be about 10% higher than the first half. As I discussed earlier, we are making long-term strategic decisions and investing in our franchise. We also want to make sure that we allocate the priorities smartly between IT projects that are targeted for risk and compliance infrastructure and those that are targeted for direct business related purposes such as digital technology. We believe that we cannot approach these investments in a sequential manner and therefore investing on these two-paths simultaneously. Simply stated, we cannot afford to delay our technology investments in our businesses as the environment is changing fast. Overall, our core expenses will increase next quarter relative to the second quarter. The predominant driver will be marketing as we expect a seasonal up-tick in the third quarter related to our planned campaign, excluding any one-time items in the second half such as the lease termination expenses related to the branch optimization announcement or other one-time expenses. Our total expenses during the next two quarters should be approximately 2.5% higher than our first half expenses. As we discussed, our expense adjustments related to the branch strategy shows we are very focused on long-term expense drivers and will take decisive strategic actions to maximize the performance of our company both in terms of revenues and expenses. Turning to credit, we still expect minimal benefit from ALLL releases due to loan growth and the associated higher levels of provisioning. Our fundamental credit performance should remain at historically low levels given the current environment. We also would like to remind you that the revenue expectations that we shared with you total do not include potential and currently un-forecasted items such as Vantiv warrant marks or gains on share sales. With that, let\u2019s open the line for questions. Angel? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. Kevin Kabat : Good morning. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning. Erika Najarian : I just wanted to make sure I understood the message on expenses. I know you\u2019re not going to give us the 2016 outlook, but as we think about what\u2019s a reasonable expectation for next year, should we take that second half run rate that\u2019s up 2.5% more than the first half? I understand that you mentioned that there are some seasonally high expenses in there, but it sounded like you were communicating a strong message on your need to re-invest in technology. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, I mean, when you think about our strategies here Erika, we are clearly continuing to save and optimize our expenses. On the retail side for example we\u2019ve been doing that for a while. And the announcement clearly adds another layer on top of that $65 million run rate expenses. But at the same time we are clearly going to continue our investments in building the risk and compliance infrastructure and also reinvesting back in the business especially on the digital side. Having said that, at this point we\u2019re not giving guidance for 2016 and we would like to spend a little bit more time in evaluating our strategies going forward with respect to cost efficiencies. As we said, these $65 million will, not in its entirety will fall to the bottom line. But a significant portion of that should fall. And we will detail that for you going forward. Greg, do you want to comment your thoughts on that? Greg Carmichael : Once again, thanks Tayfun. And Erika, as you look at our businesses and the changing needs of our customers as they move to wanting to bank anywhere anytime. Our ability to invest from a technology perspective on opportunities to improve revenue, improve the customer experience and obviously drive efficiencies. We\u2019re going to stay focused on that. And we\u2019ll also continue to look at our investments that we have today in our infrastructure in better ways of reengineering our infrastructure to serve our customers going forward. Erika Najarian : And, Greg, just as a follow-up to that. Because I noticed in the press release that there was some language from you about looking for further opportunities to improve operational efficiency. And I know that clearly it\u2019s too early to ask what those are, but should we expect, when you take over in November, a deeper dive into the expense base in Fifth Third. And that we may hear about perhaps more efficiencies at some point next year? Greg Carmichael : Fifth Third has always been focused on prudent expense management. We\u2019re going to continue that going forward. And technology is a great opportunity for us especially with some of the recent advancements. Mobile check deposit, we have over 15% of our deposits now coming through remote deposit capture. That drives efficiencies in our bank operations. We\u2019ll continue to look for ways to accelerate that pace of play around those investments where it makes good sense for our customer and our shareholders. Erika Najarian : Got it. And, Kevin, good luck with your retirement. Kevin Kabat : Thanks Erika, appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Kevin Kabat : Good morning, Scott. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning. Scott Siefers : Tayfun, first of all, Kevin and Greg, congratulations to both of you. Kevin Kabat : Thanks Scott. Scott Siefers : Tayfun, I was hoping you could expand upon some of the comments about loan growth you made in your early prepared remarks, where I think you just noted kind of the client retention and selection efforts you guys have made would suggest loan growth. Just given that the dynamic, in other words the acceleration, has changed over what has been the last three quarters or so I was just hoping you could expand a little on those comments. In other words, despite the competitive dynamic what is it that kind of makes you feel better about growing the loan book more robustly? Tayfun Tuzun : Sure. So Scott, I think what\u2019s very encouraging is when I look at the last sort of two quarters of trends, despite the fact that pay-offs remained at healthy levels, our production numbers are coming in strongly above those to drive net loan growth. When we go back to the second half of last year, I think as a company, we have done a very good job in understanding the impact of the competitive dynamics in the market and have been able to between sort of the sales groups, the credit group as well as my finance group to organize ourselves in a much more efficient manner to respond to the market and to respond to our clients. And I think that\u2019s really driving the healthy increase in production levels. And when you look at the credit profile of these new loans coming on balance sheet, as I mentioned, the credit profile this quarter of this new production was the highest in five quarters. So, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re not stretching or sacrificing on credit as we increase the number of our relationships. And also, we\u2019ve been obviously focused in deepening the existing relationships and that\u2019s working well as well. And this is also, I have to say that during the last three or four quarters, we\u2019ve added great talent both in originations as well as on the credit side. I think that\u2019s working very well for us. And we\u2019ve identified the right areas whether it\u2019s our specialization in healthcare, our continued focused on mid-core, our new retail vertical. I think this is really a broad-based support for loan growth that we are seeing today. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then maybe if you could spend a quick second just touching on overall earning asset growth beyond just the loan portfolio, I guess you\u2019re maybe call it roughly two quarters into being a little more comfortable investing in the securities portfolio - in other words that mix from cash to securities and you still get a pretty robust deposit growth. So how do you see I guess the securities portfolio in particular playing out in terms of growth as we look ahead? Jamie Leonard : Yes, Scott, it\u2019s Jamie. As we said on our first quarter call, we would expect during the course of 2015 to add another $1 billion to $2 billion of leverage during the course of the year. During the quarter, we made the decision to accelerate that additional leverage as you saw in our results. So, our portfolio as we exit the second quarter is where we would like it to be. And we\u2019re pretty pleased with the execution and continue to be mindful of the rate risk. So going forward, you can expect our portfolio to be fairly stable and to grow in-line with earning asset growth. Scott Siefers : Okay, all right, perfect. Thanks a lot, guys. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe : Hi, guy, thank you. Just a couple of quick questions. The first, in terms of the branch restructuring, I know obviously you took the charge now, but I may have missed the prepared comments. Did you say you were going to take additional charges during the next couple quarters but just tell us as you take them or? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, the second piece Ken, we - actually it was in our 8-K that we filed in June. There are some leased branches and the expense impact on those will flow through our numbers as we close those branches and reflect the impact of those leases on a going forward basis. That number had to be disclosed between $6 million and $10 million. Ken Zerbe : Got it, okay. And then second question, in terms of the loan growth, obviously a lot of growth coming from the construction portfolio. How much, some of the banks that have also reported have talked about like high volatility CRE. Can you just talk a little bit about the construction piece? Like is any of that high volatility? Does it have a higher risk weighting? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of the types of construction that you are putting on. Thanks. Frank Forrest : Hi, this is Frank, good morning. Good question. As Tayfun mentioned though, when you look at our loan growth, it\u2019s not heavily concentrated in construction activity. It\u2019s across all sectors. And again the risk profile is very strong. The construction activity we\u2019re seeing is quite frankly a non-speculative office building, apartment buildings, some retail it\u2019s a national builders that we\u2019ve had a long-time relationship with. And again, I\u2019ll emphasize, we\u2019re taking nominal risk in managing that book as we go forward. We\u2019ve learned as other institutions have our lessons. This book is small relative to I believe our peers. And we\u2019re being very prudent in client selection. So, it\u2019s - we\u2019re happy to see the growth. But again, they\u2019re the client we feel very good about it. These are again loans that I think I have a very solid risk profile. And we\u2019ll continue to manage it prudently as we go forward. Ken Zerbe : All right. Thank you. Frank Forrest : Thank you. Kevin Kabat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Can you talk about what is going on in the consumer auto lending space? I know it\u2019s an area that you pulled back a little bit several quarters ago given tight pricing there. But obviously there is good loan sales and or auto sales and the average price of autos has gone up. So overall the industry seems to be doing pretty well, but talk about the lending environment and your approach right now, please. Tayfun Tuzun : Matt, our color there is no different than the same message that we\u2019ve been giving over the last two years. Now, yes, car sales are at healthy levels. But when we look at the pricing and profitability of that business within the credit profile that we are comfortable with, we are comfortable with the origination levels that we have. And they\u2019ve been very stable. And a number of our competitors obviously are operating at credit profiles below ours. The immediate profit metrics look reasonable but it just doesn\u2019t fit our risk profile and risk tolerance levels. So, I don\u2019t really have any new news for you in that area. I think the next few quarters, the numbers will look very similar to what you\u2019ve seen from us over the last two, three quarters. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then maybe just stepping back bigger picture for consumer lending overall, most of the categories have been relatively stable for you guys. Are there pockets of opportunity to balance sheet growth or still mostly focused on the commercial side in terms of on balance sheet growth? Tayfun Tuzun : Unfortunately - the development of our balance sheet is really an extension of what we\u2019re seeing in the broad economy. Home equities continued their soft decline. At one point that\u2019s going to turn and clearly, in our branch network we\u2019re very focused in making sure that when that happens in our footprint that we are ready to experience that growth. Credit cards, I think that still continues to be a good business for us to support ongoing growth. That business as you know is a very branch focused direct retail portfolio for us and has great credit profile and we\u2019re happy to grow that portfolio. And we will grow that portfolio. We\u2019ve added some management talent over the past couple of quarters there. And as we focus on the MV project and the credit card business at the same time, we are focusing on business growth opportunities. So, you will see continued growth in credit cards. And then we also will obviously maintain our mortgage presence and as we see opportunities there, we will support that. So, at this point the trends are going to look fairly similar but as the consumer continues to improve and it\u2019s how balance sheet helps, we\u2019re here to observe obviously more growth in that area. But right now C&I will dominate loan growth. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning. Tayfun, just a summary question on the outlook, if I heard you right about expecting growth in NII, a better back half for fees, and then this expense guidance, am I correct in assuming that the PPNR outlook would be better than the 578 adjusted-number that you posted for the second quarter? Tayfun Tuzun : Ken, I\u2019ll leave my outlook structure as I laid out without sort of adding more to that. I mean, clearly the fundamental drivers continue to be healthy. And it\u2019s no different than what we thought was going to happen in January, what we thought was going to happen in April. We just maintain a very similar perspective. We are confident in the health of, the fundamental driver that being earning asset growth which now going forward for this year will really reflect loan growth rather than securities growth. NIM is at good levels, the momentum there is helpful. We believe that the second half should show good sort of fee income level. So, I will just leave it there and we gave you a little bit more detailed expense guidance. Beyond that I would be careful in not projecting Q2\u2019s PPNR levels for the rest of the year. We clearly have outperformed in the second quarter. But things look good. And as we move into the third quarter, we are confident in the fundamental drivers. But I just want to point out that in Q2 we outperformed significantly. Ken Usdin : Understood. And then secondly, just on your outlook for credit where clearly there were some adjustments made inside, sounds like a little bit for the energy side. Underlying that and whatever you may have adjusted for the SNC specifically, I was just wondering if you could further tease out what was core credit performance, what might have been SNC related. And then you\u2019re just kind of underlying outlook for any further charge-off improvement and reserve release. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, I mean, first of all, I did not make any statements related to the energy being part of the underlying credit trends. So I\u2019m going to turn that over to Frank and then I\u2019ll come back with comments on provision. Frank Forrest : Thanks. As we\u2019ve said before, the synergy book is relatively small in context of both commercial and the Bancorp as a whole. It\u2019s less than 2% of our Bancorp loans, its $1.67 billion, so it\u2019s a small book. We have the highly experienced team of lenders, who\u2019ve been with us over 20 years on average. It\u2019s predominantly a mid-to-large corporate focus that\u2019s consistent with our other Fifth Third National Alliance. Now we exercise what we believe is conservative underwriting. It\u2019s a diversified book as Tayfun has talked about. Upstream represents 50% of all energy related exposures and that tends to be a well-structured book. It\u2019s under a traditional secured reserve base borrowing base. The balance of that book is predominantly to investment rate credit. So, when you look - as we went through this Shared National Credit exam, effectively for us it was a wash. The numbers that Tayfun said are in our second quarter results, there were no material adverse changes as a result of the exam across the broad portfolio or in the energy sector. So, the sector itself we talked about the fact that we had a slight migration on non-performing assets. But the non-performing assets in the energy book are less than 1%. And we don\u2019t expect any material change there. We don\u2019t expect any material changes in the outlook for the second quarter as a result of our energy book. So, we feel good about the book as a whole, again it\u2019s small, well managed and performing to date, we\u2019ve seen some risk rating migration as have others. But again, it\u2019s just not a material number in terms of Bancorp. Tayfun Tuzun : And on the provision, Ken, I think we signaled at the end of last year very clearly that we would expect this year to cross the threshold at some point. Our coverage level provision to charge-off coverage level moved up now above 90% this quarter. So, our outlook basically is for that trend to continue into full coverage. But that\u2019s just a natural progress with respect to our existing credit profile, our loan growth statistics. And I think despite the fact that we feel very confident that just as a natural progression at this point that we\u2019re expecting. Ken Usdin : Understood, thanks. Sorry for that misstatement on the energy comment earlier. Tayfun Tuzun : No problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi, what was the tipping point for this branch reduction, 105 branches over the next 12 months? I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t make sense - it just seems, why now? Tayfun Tuzun : Look Mike, I think we discussed with you as well as with the broader investor community that we have been aggressively taking actions in our branch network to adapt to new technologies. We\u2019ve been observing what\u2019s been happening in the underlying demographics and usage patterns. And this is just basically an accumulation of those trends over the last number of quarters. And we had, we analyzed this second quarter of last year. And this quarter was a good time to take another look. Because as you know, technology is moving very fast, there are opportunities. And we hadn\u2019t made significant changes in our branch network over the past number of years. So, this was the right time to do it. We felt comfortable with what was available to us. And we have a better look into the future as to how our customers are utilizing our branches to them than we did before. Mike Mayo : And then just one other question, Fifth Third has had two CEOs for the last 25 years. Kevin, you\u2019ve been there for a while. And I guess, Greg, you take over late this year. So can you give us some color as to why the CEO-change? I think it was a little bit of a surprise. Clearly it wasn\u2019t due to an earnings shortfall or anything. But what was the motivation behind the CEO change? What was the Board\u2019s thinking? And Greg, how might, how is your style perhaps a little bit different than Kevin\u2019s? Kevin Kabat : Hi Mike, let me start, give you my perspective. We try to be as transparent as possible relative to orientation. But as you know, when I was working with the board relative to looking at kind of CEO transition and particularly in terms of looking at about a decade of timeframe it\u2019s not the, as I told, the board it\u2019s not the years, it\u2019s the miles. And so, from my perspective, given that the bank is in really good shape, whether you look at the balance sheet as you just mentioned our earnings. And then as you also look at in terms of the succession and the talent that we have internally from that perspective, it really to me ties together very well for a very normal, very thoughtful transition for a Fortune 500 company. And I think I\u2019m really comfortable, I think the board was really comfortable in our approach. And in the perspective that we put together as you said, long-serving CEOs and our expectation is that Greg will do that same as we go forward from that standpoint. And the other thing I would mention is, Greg has been, as I highlighted, Greg\u2019s been Chief Operating Officer since \u201806, he\u2019s been President and Chief Operating Officer since \u201812, so he has a long history. He understands the culture he understands both the challenges and the opportunities. And he\u2019ll get a chance in the coming months to really kind of layout his thoughts and his perspective in terms of where Fifth Third will be going from that standpoint. And I think you\u2019ll be pleased with what he brings to the table from that standpoint. So, I don\u2019t know Greg, if you wanted to add anything. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Kevin. First-off, Kevin and I have a great relationship. As Kevin mentioned, I\u2019ve been the COO since 2006 and President since 2012, it\u2019s been a great partnership. And this has been a very thoughtful transition. We\u2019ve worked hard to get this right. We\u2019ll work hard to continue to get it right going forward. Leadership style, Mike, what I can tell you about myself and what you could expect from me is a couple of things. One is, I believe in clarity, making sure organization has crystal clarity as to our mission of objectives, we\u2019re trying to accomplish as an organization. Being very transparent about where we stand, what need to get accomplished. Being very, very proactive and decisive on moving forward and making sure we hold the organization accountable for our overall mission of objective to serve our customers. So that\u2019s my style, I\u2019ll continue that going forward in the organization. I look forward to once again focus on how we can leverage my background on my experience prior to Fifth Third. And when I first came into Fifth Third in the technology, we\u2019re living a technology evolution. And all was changing. And my experience in that sector and the pace of playing that sector will continue to be an opportunity for us to get it right. So I\u2019m looking forward to the opportunity. Tayfun Tuzun : I think Mike, the bottom line is we would hope, the board, myself, Greg, the leadership team here would hope that the streak and you all see that we\u2019re going to continue the momentum that we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019re going to continue the effective approach to rapidly changing and challenging environment. And I think you can expect the whole as accountable to that standard now and in the future with Greg, so. Greg Carmichael : And the only thing I would add Mike is we got great leadership in this organization with the moves we recently made. Made and we look at the market, and the talent we have in our markets, we\u2019ve got great people running our markets, we\u2019ve got great leaders running our lines of businesses. And I\u2019m very proud of the performance of this organization. As Tayfun said, as Kevin just said, we\u2019re in a very solid position right now with a lot of upside opportunities going forward. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Kevin Kabat : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio from KBW. Your line is open. Chris Mutascio : Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Kevin Kabat : Good morning, Chris. Chris Mutascio : Tayfun, I just had a quick question for you if you can help me out. On slide 14 you go through your interest rate risk management and how you\u2019re positioned today. And I looked at a couple of things of those. And for example, the investment securities portfolio duration is now what, 4.9 years. I looked back last presentation and it was 4.3 years. That makes sense because you\u2019re I guess with the investment securities purchases. The short-term wholesale funding is now 3.5% to 4% of total funding it was only 1.5% at last quarter. And securities, hasn\u2019t moved a great deal because most of the building of the portfolio was first quarter but securities as a percent of assets is now over 20%, it was just over 19% last quarter. So it would seem to me looking at some of those characteristics your asset sensitivity would have been reduced a fair amount. But when I compare some of the numbers on this quarter\u2019s the estimated sensitivities and those tables when I compare them this quarter to last year, there really isn\u2019t a lot of movement. Somewhat downward, but so can you kind of reconcile the buildup of the securities portfolio, the duration extension and yet not really deteriorating much of your asset sensitivity going forward? Jamie Leonard : Yes, it\u2019s Jamie. The biggest portion of the answer to your question is, if you look back another presentation prior and you look at year-end, we\u2019re actually the duration of the portfolio was 5 years. Chris Mutascio : Okay. Jamie Leonard : So, what happened is, rate rallied in the first quarter which drove the portfolio duration to shorten and then rates have sold off in the second quarter. So, we\u2019ve not really changed the mix or composition of the portfolio. It\u2019s merely a function of the rates that are impacting the disclosed duration. But then when you look, what we\u2019ve added in the portfolio both in the first quarter growth and then the second quarter activity, you really see that driving the change in the EVE where we did decline from a minus 3.8% down to minus 4.6%. But in terms of the disclosed asset sensitivity, you can see the biggest drivers of your rate risk are the beta, the pricing lags and then the DDA disintermediation and we\u2019ve not changed those assumptions. The only change that occurred to our interest rate risk update was we did an annual deposit live attrition study. And that resulted in a small increase in average deposit life of 0.2 years. And that\u2019s driven by the continued success from our deposit simplification program and our ability to service our customers. And we\u2019re seeing less attrition in our deposit base. So really there were no large changes in our rate risk assumptions. Tayfun Tuzun : Chris, I mean, your question is precisely the reason why we have this slide in our presentation because we wanted to make sure that we were very transparent in terms of the numbers, in terms of the assumptions that support those numbers. We keep seeing references to historical data ranges from our peers. And we were hoping for this discussion to be based more on factual data which we are intending to do. Your reference to the short-term wholesale funding it\u2019s [indiscernible] it\u2019s not sort of a meaningful change in terms of the overall trends which clearly will rely on core funding. Chris Mutascio : I appreciate it and I do, the disclosure is fantastic relative to what I see from others, so I do appreciate that. Kevin Kabat : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Kevin Kabat : Hi, John. John Pancari : Hi, just one question really on the credit side. On the Shared National Credit book on slide 16, I know you indicate that the size of the book is $25 billion, so that\u2019s about 27% of loans now. What was the size of the book about a year ago? What are the businesses that are really driving that growth? Is there any specific one that is really driving the growth of that book? And then also what is the, do you have the average yield of that portfolio by chance just to get an idea of where these types of loans are coming in at? Frank Forrest : Hi, this is Frank, let me take it. To begin with, we\u2019re looking on the yield question for you. The books up from about 39% to 44% over the past year as it relates to the Shared National Credit exam. Again, we have a large corporate book and that\u2019s predominantly what this is, mid-Corp and large corporate, very high risk rated overall book, the overall risk profile is strong. And as I\u2019ve said before, when you think about the SNC exam, and you think about this portfolio, we underwrite everyone into our own account. So it doesn\u2019t matter whether we participate in the syndication, we lead the syndication or we do a standalone one-off to a corporate. We structured, we underwrite to our own account, to our own risk appetite into our own standards which we believe are high. So, relative to whether it\u2019s 39% or 44%, I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s that meaningful because again we underwrite to our own account and this is a portfolio that\u2019s performed very well. And our portfolio performed very well in the most recent SNC exam. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, the SNC portfolio John, as Frank mentioned, with respect to all the variables, credit variables is actually a better portfolio than our overall commercial portfolio. So, I will get you, but I don\u2019t have the yield specific to the SNC portfolio but in one of our presentations we can share that with you. John Pancari : Okay, all right. And then my second thing is on that same topic actually, but how much of that portfolio are you lead on? And then lastly, I know you indicated you didn\u2019t have any issues in the SNC exam from it, is there, the risk of any lingering impact like next quarter for any of the stuff that you were not agent on or not lead agent on? Kevin Kabat : I\u2019ll answer the first part then I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank. The agent portion of that portfolio is about 6% to 7%, so it\u2019s a small percentage of that total. Frank? Frank Forrest : Again, the only piece of that that could be lingering as we talked about likely be in the energy sector. But the energy book for us is 2% of the SNC book, I mean it\u2019s small. So, it\u2019s a small piece of the overall pie. And again, we\u2019ve booked all of the results from the SNC exam, all the ratings, adjustments, were all in the second quarter. So, we don\u2019t expect any material changes going forward from that exam. John Pancari : Okay, great. All right, thank you. Frank Forrest : Thank you. Kevin Kabat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Eads from UBS. Your line is open. David Eads : Hello, maybe just one for me. Can you guys talk a little bit about what you are seeing when it comes to deposit pricing? It seems like some people are starting to get a little bit more aggressive there and I\u2019m just curious if you are seeing much in your footprint. Kevin Kabat : Yes. Well, we\u2019ve discussed over the past couple of earnings calls is we felt there were some opportunities to rationalize deposit pricing especially in light of the LCR. So, our focus has been on reducing deposit rates especially in those buckets that are less LCR friendly. And you see that in our results this quarter on the NIM as Tayfun talked about the benefit from over-funding actions was roughly 3 basis points. And that should stabilize us as we head into what potentially is a rising rate environment at the end of this year. So, I think we\u2019ve accomplished what we wanted to accomplish and you can expect that to be fairly stable going forward until the Fed begins to take action. David Eads : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR. Your line is open. Kevin Kabat : Hi, Paul. Thomas LeTrent : Hi, good morning, is actually Thomas LeTrent on behalf of Paul. Most have been asked and answered, but a quick question on prepayment speeds. We have heard from a few regional peers that prepayment speeds in some of their portfolios were a little elevated in second quarter. Did you guys see any elevated TDRs on any of your books or in resi or term CRE specifically? Kevin Kabat : Are you referring broadly for the entire loan book or? Thomas LeTrent : Yes, broadly the whole portfolio, were there any books that saw high prepayment speeds? Tayfun Tuzun : The resi stuff clearly, the second quarter was impacted by all the refi activity that took place in the first quarter which then shows up in our MSR amortization lines. The investment portfolio really was nothing beyond our expectations, just reflective of the market trends. As I mentioned, the commercial book showed little bit elevated pay-off levels but when we sort of looked at the details of those pay-offs, they appear to be more event related rather than refi related. There was some activity in the commercial construction book. There was some prepayment ahead of the project finalization dates. This quarter more than last quarters, nothing sort of outside a reasonable range. So that\u2019s my color on prepay activity. Thomas LeTrent : Okay. And one quick question on expenses. I believe you mentioned something about lease termination expenses. That\u2019s an additional line, that is it additional expense that was not included in this quarter\u2019s impairment charge, correct? That could come over the next 6 to 12 months? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, exactly. Yes, that specifically related to those branches that we are going to consolidate where we have a lease rather than owning the property. And that\u2019s going to flow through our expenses over the next couple of quarters. Thomas LeTrent : And you did not size that correctly? Tayfun Tuzun : Well, we sized it in our 8-K, we said it\u2019s going to be between $6 million to $10 million. But I did not include that, I exclusively stated that my expense guidance of 2.5% does not include that number. Thomas LeTrent : Okay, perfect. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open. Kevin Kabat : Hi Marty. Marty Mosby : Hi, thanks. Tayfun, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the growth that you\u2019ve done in the securities portfolio and your choice to almost 100% utilize available-for-sale versus held to maturity. I think this quarter you actually had some negative impact on your tangible book value as OCI came in a little bit. I was just curious what your strategy or tactic is there? Jamie Leonard : Yes, this is Jamie. The strategy on the available for sale is really just to maintain flexibility as we manage interest rate risk and see opportunities in the market. I know a lot of our peers have used HTM but given that our asset size were below $250 billion, we did elect AOCI opt-out, so that use of the AFS and the resulting marks don\u2019t impact our capital ratios. Yes, there will be an impact on some of the screens that you all use on tangible book. But we\u2019d also hope you just would fair-value the HTM portfolios from peers as well when screening across that metric. Marty Mosby : And would you consider. Yes, go ahead, I\u2019m sorry. Tayfun Tuzun : The flexibility of managing an AFS book outweighs the benefits of not marking a healthy maturity book, so that\u2019s been our long subscribe philosophy here. Marty Mosby : And what I was trying to add to that was given the excess capital that you have, would you think about having that flexibility so when rates start to move up you can utilize that excess capital in a short-term loss that gets recaptured very quickly, but yet improves your earnings pretty rapidly because you can continue to kind of churn the portfolio up as rates move higher? Have you kind of thought about that? Tayfun Tuzun : I mean, that clearly is a reasonable statement. We\u2019ll see how the environment moves. But that type of flexibility is what we value. Marty Mosby : And then just lastly, if you looked at the mortgage kind of detail back in the appendix, it looks like maybe with the gain you had in the servicing side you actually, looks like you held more mortgage originations versus securitizing. I didn\u2019t know if you were kind of substituting origination for servicing income and creating some longer-term impact with having more in the portfolio versus securitizing this particular quarter? Kevin Kabat : Yes, a couple of comments on that one. One on MSR, we\u2019ve been actually, when you look at our MSR management over the last three, four years, we have a very comprehensive approach to how we manage our MSR position with respect to production trends, interest rate environment and also the up and down trends in our servicing book, so the decision when and how much to portfolio or what portion of our mortgage production to portfolio really depends on environmental factors. We did have in the first couple of quarters a little bit more elevated balance sheet positions in mortgage production but that does not necessarily indicate what we will do going forward. That\u2019s really a quarter-to-quarter determination in terms of where we see pricing in the market, what our portfolio characteristics look like. Right now we\u2019re just holding the arm portion of our originations, we\u2019re not holding on to, on the conforming side, we\u2019re not holding on to longer-term fixed rate mortgages. We\u2019ve always portfolio, the jumbo production because that just is more of a relationship business. But in general, the mortgage servicing asset risk management is a very comprehensive approach. And whether what we balance sheet from production is a little bit separate than that. Marty Mosby : Understood. It just seems like there was an incremental leg up this particular quarter. So I was just curious about that. Thanks. Kevin Kabat : Quarter yes, you are correct. Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello there, good morning. Kevin Kabat : Good morning. Geoffrey Elliott : I\u2019ve got a question on Vantiv. Can you give an update on your thinking about the stake there given that it\u2019s now been over a year since you last sold some shares and the Vantiv share price has clearly moved up quite a lot over that time period? Kevin Kabat : Our long-stated strategic approach to our Vantiv ownership is that over the long-term we will not remain a majority or a large owner of Vantiv. And that decision really we look at it on a quarterly basis, we look at where we are, we look at where the stock price. It\u2019s a barely complex ownership structure as we have the warrant position as well as the CRA as well as the direct ownership. So, at this time, our position has not changed, we still intend to reduce our ownership. But we want to make sure that we execute that in the best interest of our shareholders. And we will continue to monitor that situation. Geoffrey Elliott : And would that selling another slug of shares here, would that mean you have to deconsolidate the lost fee stream? Is that part of the thinking behind not selling over the last year or so? Tayfun Tuzun : No, I mean, we own currently nearly 23% of the company directly. So, we are not close to having that concern. And there is really no bright line as we have board memberships as we have the warrant position and a significant operating partnership with the company. So, that\u2019s not the reason why we currently are still holding 23% of the shares. Geoffrey Elliott : Great, thank you very much. Tayfun Tuzun : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Sameer Gokhale : Hi, good morning. Kevin Kabat : Good morning. Sameer Gokhale : Firstly, Greg, I\u2019d like to congratulate you on your new appointment and, Kevin, I was surprised by the announcement that you were retiring because 59 is now the new 49, but best of luck to you on that as well. Kevin Kabat : Thank you. Sameer Gokhale : We covered quite a few of the questions I was going to ask, but just a couple of them just to flesh them out a little further. The first one was really for Greg. In your role as COO one would assume that perhaps you were more internally focused into the operations of the company. But now as the CEO I think the expectation would be that you might need to be more outwardly focused. So as you\u2019ve taken on or will be fully officially taking on this responsibility later this year, what would you say are your top three priorities looking outwardly, mobile banking clearly is one of the things that have been focused on, but are there any other two or three things that at this point you have communicated to the Board or are ready to share with us? Greg Carmichael : First off, thanks for the question. And I have been focused on the organization obviously as Chief Operating Officer and President, spent a lot of time in the market, a lot of time with our businesses. So, one of the first things I want to do is make sure I touch base with all key constituents, our stakeholders out there, shareholders, key customers, employees and maintain their focus on our market. In addition to that, we\u2019re going to continue to look for ways to take advantage of some of the dynamic changes that occur in our industries such as our investments and technologies accelerate our pace of change with respect to how we serve our customers and efficiencies. And also continue to look at our businesses making sure we\u2019re aligned and we\u2019re in the right businesses to get the right focus on those businesses, we have the right parties in place, we have enough resources decked against those opportunities. You can expect I\u2019ll continue to focus on that and make sure that we\u2019re aligned to capitalize on the market opportunities. Kevin Kabat : Sameer, I\u2019m also trying to get him to pay attention to retirees because I\u2019ll still be a significant shareholder and more aligned with you than ever, so. Greg Carmichael : I told him, my plate is full. Sameer Gokhale : Terrific. Well, and then the other question I had was actually in terms of your appetite for M&A, I mean this ties into some of maybe your strategic actions you might look at over the next two years or three years. As you look at the portfolio of businesses you have today and the loan types, and one of the things I want to hone on is, or zone in on, is commercial and industrial loans. It\u2019s a pretty broad-based asset category, many subcategories in there. Are there any specific areas that maybe you have earmarked as being of interest from an A standpoint and things you might want to acquire? Greg Carmichael : Yes. First off, we don\u2019t typically comment on M&A activity Sameer, but I will state this. Anytime there was an opportunity to create value for our shareholders over a long-term horizon, we\u2019re going to look at that very closely. And we\u2019re not going to do a deal, just to do a deal, in order to do something as positive in a short term that doesn\u2019t create long-term shareholder value. So, I think as we look at those opportunities in our business or a geography, we\u2019ll always be mindful of, does it create value for our shareholders and net-net, our ability to be able to execute. And we\u2019ll execute those opportunities at the end of the day when the time is right and when those opportunities emerge. Kevin Kabat : And Sameer, we\u2019ve been very successful inorganically actually starting and growing sub-businesses inside the commercial corporate banking area. So that success gives us confidence that if we were to venture into a new area that we could actually do it with the right talent. And in this environment it almost is better to do that as the regulatory environment is very difficult for a non-bank to operate inside a bank. So, our success so far gives us confidence that we can do it internally if there are opportunities outside, we don\u2019t mind looking at them but we\u2019ll have to evaluate them as they come along. Sameer Gokhale : Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Kevin Kabat : Thank you, Sameer. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Matt Burnell : Great, thanks for taking my question. First of all maybe Greg, a question for you, just following-up on the immediately prior question. We\u2019ve been hearing for some time that increasing regulation has been a bigger challenge for smaller - much smaller banks than Fifth Third. I guess I\u2019m curious within the context of your comments about you would be willing to consider longer-term accretive acquisitions, are you seeing a greater flow of those type of opportunities over the last 6 to 12 months than you saw maybe 2 to 3 years ago or has that stream been pretty steady? Greg Carmichael : No Matt, we really haven\u2019t seen anything of significance or opportunities that we think that fit inside our wheelhouse. So not so significant and Tayfun, do you want to add anything to that? Tayfun Tuzun : No, Matt, I think as you know today when you look at M&A opportunities, you don\u2019t only look at the next 10 years of that optimization but you look at the past 10 years. And the really attractive opportunities are few and far between and so, nothing really to report on that that commencement. Matt Burnell : Fair enough. And, Tayfun, maybe just a follow-up for you, and I appreciate this might be a little bit sensitive. But in terms of the branch reductions, in terms of the full-time equivalent employees, those are down about over - on a year-over-year basis about the same rate as the banking centers. And given all the investment that you\u2019re making in technology should there be an outsized reduction potentially in staffing levels within the branches given all the investment that you are clearly making in terms of delivering digital products to your customers? A number of other banks have been talking about that as an intermediate to longer-term benefit. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, so, by definition this branch action will clearly impact the overall employment levels in our retail business. But it\u2019s been now, I think it\u2019s a good sort of two and half years since we have reduced our FTE counts in our branches. And that continued even into this quarter. I suspect that as we sort of continue to grow technology inside of our branches and reconfigure, redesign our existing branches that trend will continue. But on the other hand, I have to tell you that revenue growth continues to be of utmost importance in our retail business. And we have been and we will continue to add sales oriented associates. So, there are two trends that are going against each other but the 105 reduction itself will clearly take out a portion of our retail employee base. Matt Burnell : Great, thank you. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you very much for joining us this morning. Operator : There are no further questions. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Eglseder, you may begin your conference. James P. Eglseder - Manager- Investor Relations : Thanks, Sean, and good morning. Today we'll be talking with you about our third quarter 2015 results. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third, pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties, and we encourage you to review them. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. I'm joined on the call today by several people, our President, Greg Carmichael; and CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Frank Forrest, Chief Risk Officer; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. During the question-and-answer period please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. With that I'll turn the call over to Greg. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Thanks, Jim, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. On November 1 I will officially start my tenure as the Chief Executive Officer of our company. Today we thank Kevin Kabat for his 33 years of service to this institution, the last nine years as CEO. We are grateful for his leadership during a difficult period in our company's history. His contributions will continue to build value for our shareholders. I am looking forward to building upon Kevin's accomplishments and leading our company to become a top through-the-cycle performer in our industry. In September I had the opportunity to meet some of you. And I look forward to having frequent dialogue in the coming quarters to share my team's priorities. We have a number of new faces who joined our senior leadership team over the last 60 days. Lars Anderson, Heather Koenig, and Tim Spence are great additions to an already strong team and have hit the ground running. By all accounts we have had a very active quarter. During the last 30 days we've resolved three significant regulatory and compliance items. Importantly, these items were already reserved for. We are pleased to have solved these matters as we continue to focus on improving our operations, efficiency, and customer experience, which in turn will generate better returns for our shareholders. Driving better efficiency through technology and improving our ability to serve has been a priority for Fifth Third. Over the last few years we've done just that, focused on improving customer service and driving operational improvements. These changes over the past couple of years have resulted in approximately $60 million of annual savings. In June we announced plans to sell or consolidate 105 branches across our footprint, and we expect to generate another $65 million in annual savings once complete. We are well on our way to executing our branch plans with the two announcements regarding the sale of our branches in St. Louis and Pittsburgh. As disclosed we will maintain our commercial activity in both markets. The first phase of our remaining retail branch consolidations is underway. And we are on track to have this project completed by the middle of 2016 as originally planned. So now a few comments about the quarter. We reported third quarter net income to common shareholders of $366 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.45, including $0.06 of volumes that Tayfun will go over shortly. The operating environment continues to be challenging, but our focused strategies have resulted in continued loan and net interest income growth. The structure and composition of our balance sheet continues to produce current period earnings with balanced exposures to alternative rate environments. Our strategic partnership and ownership stake in Vantiv continues to produce substantial earnings. As you can see we recognized $130 million on the Vantiv warrant in the quarter, bringing our earnings year-to-date on the mark to $214 million. We have benefited greatly from this relationship. And our ownership stake leaves us with significant future revenue potential. Our core business performance is strong. For the third quarter positive balance sheet trends continued with average loan growth led by C&I, which was up 1% sequentially and 4% from a year ago. Core deposits were up $5.6 billion from a year ago, but down $1.8 billion sequentially, the majority of which was due to intentionally reducing deposits that are unfavorable from an LCR perspective. The income results continue to show momentum, highlighted by corporate banking revenue that was up 4% from the prior year on continued strength in capital markets. And mortgage banking that was up 16% from a year ago. We continue to closely manage our expenses with a sharp focus on extracting efficiencies from our day-to-day operations. Our non-interest expense in the third quarter was flat with the prior period. We will remain focused on cost containment, while continuing to invest in our company for the long term. Continuous fundamental improvement is the key here. Our expense management philosophy supports our goal of continuing to invest in the growth of our business. Credit results reflect the impact of a legacy commercial credit that Tayfun will discuss in further detail. But it is important to note that this is not the type of credit we would underwrite today, nor is it reflective of our credit risk appetite going forward. Student loan portfolios are being assessed more conservatively in the market, and we reflected the valuation of the underlying loans in this commercial credit exposure. Excluding this legacy credit our net-charge-off ratio would have been 37 basis points, consistent with the previous quarter. Non-performing assets were down 24% from a year ago. And our NPA ratio continues to decline, ending the quarter at 65 basis points. As we discussed all year we are at a threshold in our provisioning, as we are starting to cover our quarterly charge-offs. In addition our provision this quarter reflects the acknowledgement of the stresses that are building in the domestic and global economic environment. The third quarter set us up well for a strong finish in 2015. I mentioned before that driving better efficiencies through technology and improving our ability to serve has been a priority. Both customer and regulatory expectations continue to change. And I am focused on technology investments as a core part of our strategic agenda to drive revenue growth, improve how we operate, enhance the customer experience, and achieve regulatory excellence. We are very focused on taking this company forward with an increased pace of play and establishing ourselves as a top through-the-cycle performer in our sector. With that I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter operating results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. As Greg said this quarter was an active quarter for us. In addition to the legal settlement and other business activities, with Greg's transition and the approaching year end, our teams are heavily engaged in our strategic and financial plan reviews. And we look forward to sharing our perspectives with you in January. All business leaders and support functions are working with a clear direction to focus on growth, supported with efficient operations and client service excellence. Our established risk appetite and risk return targets are positioned for long-term shareholder value creation. Speaking of shareholder value, the $130 million improvement in our Vantiv warrant position this quarter is a great example of shareholder value creation as a result of focused strategic decisioning. We will continue to execute our frequently stated objective to manage our financial stakes in Vantiv in the optimal way for our shareholders, as we have demonstrated since the IPO. Our direct ownership, the warrant, and tax receivable agreement in aggregate are of significant strategic value. Let's start with the financial summary on page 3 of the presentation. We reported net income to common shareholders of $366 million or $0.45 per diluted share. There were several items that affected earnings in the quarter as Greg mentioned. The improvement in the value of our warrant position more than made up for the negative impact of a few one-time items this quarter. As I mentioned the positive warrant valuation was $130 million. We also had a $9 million charge associated with executive retirement and severance, and an $8 million charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap. There were also charges to provision expense of $35 million related to the restructuring of a 2007 student loan backed commercial credit in the quarter. The net impact was a benefit of $0.06 per share. The third quarter charge-offs were higher due to the restructuring of a large 2007 vintage student loan backed commercial credit. In connection with the restructuring we recognized net charge-offs of $102 million, $80 million of which had been specifically provided for in prior quarters. This is a legacy credit dating back to the financial crisis. In late 2013 we had restructured a note and determined that we had appropriate cash flow and collateral coverage. And the note had performed well since then on a cash flow basis. And as evidenced by the existing reserves of $80 million, we've been diligently focused on maintaining appropriate coverage. However this credit is backed by private student loans. And as you know during the quarter volatility in the student loan markets caused significant stress on the valuation of underlying student loans. The reserve on this loan is based on the value of the underlying collateral. Based on updated valuations and cash flow projections associated with the collateral, we determined that another restructuring was needed, which triggered the $102 million charge-off under TDR accounting guidance. The remaining note balance after charge-offs is $205 million. The collateral coverage is 107% of remaining performing underlying student loans, which have an outstanding principle balance of $225 million and an average attached FICO score of 756 with 75 months' seasoning. In addition to the collateral coverage we added $13 million to our specific reserves for this note, which resulted in a net release of $67 million in specific reserves. We have no student loan exposure in our loan portfolio other than this indirect commercial exposure. I'll cover the remaining asset quality details later in the presentation, so let's move to the average balance sheet and page 4 of the presentation. The strong loan production activity in the first half of the year carried throughout the third quarter and generated average portfolio loan balances that were $1.2 billion higher than the second quarter. Loan growth metrics continue to reflect the results of our consistent efforts to select new clients that meet our return targets within our risk appetite. Our C&I balances were up 1% on an average basis with particular strength in middle market, mid-corp, and healthcare. Average commercial mortgage balances were down 2%. Commercial construction lending remains strong with balances up 16% sequentially, mainly in multifamily and industrial commercial construction. Commercial production was seasonally lower compared to the second quarter, but was 14% higher year-over-year. The largest contribution came from the middle market portfolio. Payoffs and pay downs were flat sequentially and down 5% from last year. Year-to-date most of the payoffs in our commercial portfolio resulted from clients' M&A activity and the permanent financing of commercial construction lines. Utilization rates were flat compared to the second quarter. We have seen some stabilization in new production coupons, but it's too early to call an end to the credit spread contraction. In the third quarter average investment securities increased by $900 million or 3% sequentially, partially reflecting the impact of securities purchased during the second quarter. Average core deposits decreased $1.8 billion from the second quarter, driven by lower interest rate checking account balances. The decrease largely \u2013 the decrease was largely due to targeted pricing changes in LCR punitive commercial accounts. The early compliance that we have achieved with the final LCR targets is enabling us now to position our deposit composition in a more efficient manner to establish a very comfortable operating liquidity position. Our LCR ratio was at 107% at the end of the quarter. Moving to NII on page five of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased $14 million sequentially to $906 million, primarily driven by loan growth, partially offset by higher interest expense associated with the $1.1 billion of holding company and $1.3 billion of bank level debt we issued this quarter. These issuances are partially replacing upcoming maturities in 2016. Our funding actions ahead of the maturities once again display our focus on long-term shareholder value creation instead of current quarter earnings focus. The net interest margin was 289 basis points, down one basis point from the second quarter, driven by the impact of those debt issuances, day count, and loan yield compression, partially offset by the benefit of the slightly lower short-term cash position during the quarter. Shifting to fees on page six of the presentation. Third quarter non-interest income was $713 million, compared with $556 million in the second quarter. Results included the $130 million positive mark on the Vantiv warrant that I mentioned earlier. As a reminder second quarter results included a $97 million impairment charge related to the changes in the branch network and a $14 million positive mark on the Vantiv warrant. Quarterly results also included charges on the Visa total return swap of $8 million in the current quarter and $2 million last quarter. Excluding these items in both quarters fee income of $591 million decreased $50 million or 8% (sic) [$46 million or 7%] (14:39) sequentially, led by mainly MSR related decreases in mortgage banking and seasonal decreases in corporate banking revenue. Corporate banking fees decreased $9 million sequentially as expected due to seasonally lower institutional sales and business lending fees. These seasonal declines were partially offset by higher interest rate derivative fees that benefited from higher rate and currency volatility, lease remarketing fees, and syndications revenue. Mortgage banking net revenue of $71 million was down $46 million sequentially, primarily due to lower net hedging gains this quarter. Originations were $2.3 billion in the third quarter with 58% purchase volume. 80% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels, and 20% from the correspondent channel. Gain on sale margins were up 10 basis points sequentially. Net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include amortization and valuation adjustments, were negative $29 million this quarter, versus positive $18 million last quarter. Deposit service charges increased 4% from the second quarter and were flat relative to the third quarter of 2014. Total investment advisory revenue of $103 million decreased 2% sequentially, primarily due to the market decline during the quarter. We show non-interest expense on page seven of the presentation. Expenses were $943 million, compared with $947 million in the second quarter. The sequential comparison reflected $9 million in higher compensation expense primarily associated with executive retirements and severance, partially offset by reversal of litigation reserves. Turning to credit results on page eight. Excluding the student loan backed commercial credit, net charge-offs were $86 million or 37 basis points in the third quarter, flat with net charge-offs in the prior quarter. Total net charge-offs were $188 million or 80 basis points as a percentage of average loans, including the restructured commercial credit charge-off of $102 million, $80 million of which had been specifically reserved for in prior quarters. Non-performing assets excluding loans held for sale declined $20 million from the previous quarter to $606 million, bringing the NPL ratio to 49 basis points and the NPA ratio to 65 basis points. A year ago commercial NPAs were at 90 basis points. The sequential decline of $6 million was primarily due to a $10 million decline in C&I. NPAs in the C&I bucket was 43 basis points, down from 45 basis points last quarter and 68 basis points in the third quarter of 2014. Consumer NPAs decreased $14 million from the second quarter, driven by a $10 million decline in residential mortgage and a $3 million decline in home equity NPAs. Our criticized asset levels this quarter remained flat with last quarter's levels. Our energy portfolio declined by $45 million to $1.6 billion from the second quarter. And the composition remained stable with approximately 50% related to reserve-based lending, where we are senior secured lender within many cases significant levels of subordinated risk ahead of the bank's position. As expected, we have seen negative ratings migration in the portfolio, but especially in the reserve-based portfolio strong collateral coverage levels should limit the future migrations. Our team will have continued updates to the analysis this quarter. But overall expectations have not changed. And we don't anticipate any material impact from a loss given default perspective. We have no NPLs in this portfolio. Wrapping up on credit, due to the net $67 million specific reserve release related to the student loan backed commercial credit, the allowance for loan and lease losses declined $33 million, compared with a $7 million decline last quarter. The change in the allowance includes a $35 million addition to our overall reserves. We have been publicly discussing our expectations that there would likely be a quarter in which the provision would equal if not exceed charge-offs on a quarterly basis. This credit cycle is diverting from the average length of expansion cycles with every passing quarter. In light of further slowdown in global manufacturing activity, volatility in capital markets, and the projected prolonged downturn in the energy sector, addition to the ALLL was warranted. The resulting reserve coverage remains at 1.35% of loans and leases and 275% of NPLs. Looking at capital on slide nine. Capital levels continue to be strong and well above regulatory requirements. The common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.4%. At the end of the third quarter, end of period common shares outstanding were down approximately $15 million. During the quarter we announced two common stock repurchases of $150 million each. The first started on July 29 and settled on August 31 and reduced third quarter share count by 7.4 million shares. The second ASR is expected to settle on or before December 4 and reduce the third quarter share count by 6.5 million shares. Turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. In terms of core business activity our expectations remain the same as the last few quarters. We see good loan activity in our commercial business. We should see that trend continue into the fourth quarter supported by diverse origination activity. Our annual guidance in January called for growth in commercial lending to exceed 3%, supported by our strategic investments. Based on where we are today and our expectation for the fourth quarter, full year commercial loan growth should be approximately 4% for the full year. On the consumer side we expect to see similar trends in the fourth quarter compared to previous periods. We are currently selling all of our conforming mortgage production other than the ARMs. We are not seeing meaningful changes in market conditions and loan demand across the categories that will have an impact on recent growth trends. Our NII outlook remains roughly the same as our last guidance. Excluding the impact of the deposit advance product, we actually have grown NII this year so far compared to last year's first three quarters. We are maintaining the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year for full year 2015 NII growth compared to last year, excluding the roughly $100 million negative impact of the deposit advance product. We do expect a slight downtick in our fourth quarter NIM and NII resulting from the removal of the December Fed move assumption, as well as the full quarter impact of our two debt issuances from the third quarter. In July our NIM guidance was 2.88% for the second half of the year. And we will be within a basis point or 2 [basis points] of that guidance, despite the removal of the rate increase assumption and the carrying costs associated with prefunding a portion of our 2016 debt maturities. Fourth quarter corporate banking fees tend to be seasonally stronger with higher business lending and syndication fees relative to the third quarter. As expected mortgage banking production net revenue should be seasonably below third quarter levels but in line with fourth quarter of last year. The ongoing annual income from the tax receivable agreement payment we expect to receive from Vantiv is approximately $30 million. Our core non-interest expense guidance in July was a 2.5% increase in total core expenses during the second half of the year over the first half totals. Good news is that we expect to come slightly inside that guidance. The seasonal uptick in expenses during the fourth quarter will include higher EMV-related expenditures, which we discussed earlier in the year, as well as higher performance-related compensation and the continuing uptick in base comp related to the buildup in compliance and risk infrastructure. As we also discussed before, we expect our technology expenses during the fourth quarter to be about 10% higher than the third quarter. These costs are designed to support our long-term strategic actions and investments in our franchise, including IT projects that are targeted for risk and compliance infrastructure and those that are targeted for direct business-related purposes, such as digital technology. We are spending a significant amount of time on expense management in all of our core businesses and staff functions. As the Fed's anticipated rate actions continue to be pushed back, we are ratcheting up our focus on improving operating leverage in our businesses. Greg's direction to the entire organization is to operate under the assumption that we will extract efficiencies from our processes year in and year out. We expect to continue to invest in our businesses to build shareholder value. And the savings from our existing processes will provide part of the funding for the new investments. The upward slope in our risk and compliance infrastructure-related expenses is not permanent. The combination of the renewed commitment to tighter expense management in our existing platforms in this environment, and the end to the upward slope in risk and compliance expenses in 2016 will be important to achieve our goal to outperform through the cycle. Turning to credit. As expected we have probably seen the end of reserve releases. And going forward provision will be impacted by loan growth and the impact of broader economic trends on the portfolio. Net charge-offs are expected to be more in line with our core losses last quarter and the levels we have seen in the first two quarters of this year. We also would like to remind you that the revenue expectations that we shared with you today do not include potential, but currently unforecasted items, such as Vantiv warrant marks and gains on share sales. In summary we continue to be focused on making the right decisions for the long term, strategically positioning us to be a trusted partner to our client, and building a strong balance sheet with prudent liquidity, interest rate, and credit risk exposures for through-the-cycle performance. With that let's open the line for questions. Sean? Operator : Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Erika. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Good morning. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. My first question is for you, Greg. On an adjusted basis over the past two quarters the core efficiency ratio of this company has been around 62%. Given that the revenue backdrop may be challenging for longer, and Tayfun's remarks about a renewed focus on expense management, can you improve that 62% over the next 12 months without really any help from the revenue environment? In other words is there savings that you can extract from today's cost base that could be above and beyond what's required to invest back into the company? Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Erika, we've been focused, as we announced earlier in my comments on expense management, as we announced the reduction of 105 branches and some of the talent re-engineering that we've accomplished. We'll continue to stay focused on our core efficiencies, making sure every investment dollar we put forth, we get return on that investment. But it's a very difficult environment right now with low interest rates, high regulatory cost. We'll give more guidance in January for 2016 on efficiencies. But right now I would tell you job one is to make sure we're taking care of our customer. And wherever possible we're extracting efficiencies on our current core operating environment. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And my second follow-up \u2013 sorry. My follow-up to Tayfun is on the LCR, given that you're at 107%. Are the wholesale changes on the balance sheet behind you with regards to either the repricing of non-operational deposits on the liability side? And should we think about the size of the securities portfolio relative to loan and deposit growth from here? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Yes, Erika. I think the broader increase in the size of the investment portfolio is behind us. From now on we probably will see investment portfolio growth more in line with the rest of the balance sheet growth. In terms of larger moves on the deposit side I think we've taken care of most of the large deposits that tend to be LCR punitive. But we will always be focused to manage the deposit side efficiently in light of this continued low rate environment. And as I mentioned in my script, our early move on the LCR last year is giving us room to be able to do those efficiency moves on the rest of the deposit base. Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First of all in terms of the rate sensitivity, Tayfun, it looks like that has not materially changed quarter over quarter. And how would you think about that going forward, assuming we get a very minimal level of rate increase in the first half of 2016? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Matt, as I mentioned we removed our rate increase assumption from our outlook for this year. And it looks like next year right now, there are a couple of moves in the forward curve. In terms of our rate sensitivity we've always said that we are not taking the extreme rate sensitivity position and expectation for aggressive rate moves. And we want to be balanced, because we see the risks balanced going forward. Even if the Fed starts moving rates, I think it's going to be less steep and [audio skip] (30:13) than people thought a year ago or so. So therefore we're not anticipating significant changes to our asset sensitivity from here. We will be mindful obviously if and when rates start to rise to extract most of that benefit and let it fall to our balance sheet. But we've been very transparent in terms of the assumptions that we are using in our outlook. Jamie, any comment? James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : No. I think that \u2013 good summary. Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you for that. And then in terms of my follow-up, based on what appears to be a less bullish outlook for rates certainly this year and it seems into 2016, how are you thinking about deposit pricing? Several other banks this earnings reporting season have discussed their view that there could be relatively high degrees of competition for core deposits as rates rise. But that seems to imply a relatively stair-step increase in rates, which my sense is the market is not in line with. So how are you thinking about potential deposit pricing competition in a lower for longer rate environment? James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. This is Jamie. One thing you can see from our activities this year and even from the deposit changes this quarter is we've been very focused on trimming deposit costs for what would appear to be a lower for longer environment. You've seen that in our core deposit levels down \u2013 rate costs down a bp or so each quarter this year. And frankly with our LCR at a pretty strong position at 107%, it gives us a little bit of flexibility to wait and see how competition responds. But the reason why we have pretty high betas in our interest-rate risk modeling is we believe your comments are on point, which is there could very well be higher price competition on retail deposits, should the Fed decide to raise rates for those banks that are below or barely compliant with the LCR. So we model a 70% beta for every rate move linearly. However as Tayfun said, we would hope that given our strong balance sheet position, we'd be able to take advantage of maybe the first couple moves and operate at a beta lower than that. But again we'll have to wait and see how the competition plays out for those retail deposits. Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Morning, Scott. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Scott. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Morning, guys. Hey, just want to get my arms around the credit outlook. So the net charge-off outlook, that seems very stable. All the NPA indicators basically seem fine. But sort of the written commentary and then, Tayfun, your comments, maybe a little more cautious. And then the ongoing reserve build this quarter, when you net away all the noise from the student loan backed issue was perhaps more than I would've thought. So, Tayfun, maybe if you could just sort of expand on your comments on credit broadly? And then I think the crux is if you could maybe discuss the need to add to reserves at a level consistent with this quarter's level going forward? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So I look at \u2013 we actually in the analysis that leads to the ultimate reserve levels, we look at the broad macro indicators. This expansion now is approaching I think the 76th month of from the start date, and it's now the fourth longest expansion since the Second World War. And the next one up is the 1980-1981 expansion. And we have to respect where we are. I look \u2013 we look at all the credit spreads indicators. And you just have to respect what the market is telling us. It doesn't \u2013 the spread expansion doesn't necessary mean that a recession is right around the corner. But sometimes it can sort of potentially feed the sort of next moves in the credit cycle. We're just basically cognizant of where we are in this expansion cycle. And want to make sure that our reserve levels appropriately reflect that positioning. Beyond that you've seen all of our credit metrics. Our guidance is for core charge-off performance to resemble more the first half rather than the actual levels this quarter. I think we're just basically reflecting what we see in the broader macro sense. In terms of provision levels going forward we're not necessarily forecasting provision into the next quarter. We had a $35 million add this quarter. But all we're saying is it should \u2013 obviously this is all based on the analytics that supports our reserve levels. But it should more resemble the actual credit performance. And we're obviously going to look at how the balance sheet is moving forward as well. Frank, I don't know if you have any other comments on that? Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : No, I think you covered it well, Tayfun. Again the thing \u2013 one thing to keep in mind is when you look at the size of our energy book and you look at the size of our commercial real estate book, they're relatively small compared to our peers. They're stable. They're performing very well. And we feel very good about the outlook. So I have nothing else to add. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Okay. That sounds great. Thanks a lot for the color. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Thanks, guys. Just to follow up a little bit more on credit. So can you just talk through the \u2013 were the NPA inflows, $194 million, how much of that was related if at all to the student loan? And then \u2013 or was it related to the other pieces that you're kind of walking through, some of the other just global commodity/stuff? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Now $102 million of that number was related to that single student loan backed commercial line. So a big majority of that is based on that. In terms of the rest I mean you'll see quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in that number, but nothing beyond that that would indicate any sort of broader issues. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And just to follow up on the commodities/energy side, can you just help us out, because it's obviously a concern? Any color on your reserve against your energy and commodities portfolio? And even specifically do you have exposure to some of the bigger names that have been mentioned in the press, like Glencore and others, where you guys have shown up on the loan docs at all? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Just a broader comment on the reserve level, then I'll turn it over to Frank. We don't comment on specific reserves. But all I can say is, given the description of our energy exposure and given how we feel that I discussed during the script, we feel we are appropriately reserved for that exposure. And I'll turn it over to Frank for the rest of the commentary. Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : Yeah. On the \u2013 again, on the energy book if you think about it, we had $1.6 billion in outstandings in our energy book. It's less than 3% of our total commercial loans, 2% of our total portfolio, so it's relatively small. The place where we've seen the most stress has been in the oilfield services sector, and that sector is $330 million of outstandings or only 20% of the total. We will continue to see some stress, as Tayfun talked about. But we have no loans in the energy sector that are in NPL. And losses have been minimal over the last four quarters to six quarters, so that book continues to be well managed. It's well managed predominantly by our vertical with people that have a deep experience in the industry. We're highly focused on client selection. It continues to decline versus going up. And we believe it's \u2013 again it's being effectively managed today relative to the risk. And the size and scale of it is again I think fairly small. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC : All right. And my just last one is just on the size of the student loan credit is just $300-ish million is quite, quite large. And I'm just wondering how do we understand granularity? I know it's not a credit that you would underwrite today. But how much of kind of other really huge outsize credits do you have in the rest of the portfolio? And how you get comfortable with that type of concentration? Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : The thing to remember is this credit was underwritten at a different time, in 2007. It's an outsized exposure relative to our risk appetite today. We would \u2013 the loan originated at a larger size than the $307 million. It was approximately $0.5 billion when it was originated. The original purpose was to securitize it, to move it. The markets were unstable at the time, and the securitization did not take place. Subsequent to that in the last 18 months we have added a number of elements into our overall risk management of the book to ensure that we are managing overall large credit exposure in a very prudent way. Our appetite has clearly changed and developed. Subsequent to that we have guideline limits in place now tied to PD, tied to industries that we hold very strict. And we have a very small bucket and appetite for any exceptions to that. The same goes with concentration risk across the company, whether it be commercial real estate or energy or leveraged finance. We have built in significant safeguards in place to ensure that that's the case. We have a handful of loans above $300 million. They are investment grade. Those would be the exceptions. Our appetite is more in the sweet spot of middle mark in the mid-cap lending, which is more in the $100 million to $250 million range for the majority of what we do and we hold. And we are also intently focused on originating to distribute. And so we built our syndication capabilities to be able to distribute more into the market, rather than holding it on our balance sheet. So the company has a completely different perspective and view in today's environment relative to appetite. And we've built many controls in place that we think were appropriate and prudent for good portfolio management relative to this exception again that was made eight years ago. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Hi there. Thank you for taking the question. Coming back to some of those lender lists you've been showing up on again, names like Glencore and Trafigura. I know you can't comment on the individual exposures, but could you give us a bit more background on what you're doing, showing up on that sort of lender list? What your value add is in participating in those deals to big commodities firms that are based outside of the U.S.? Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : Hey, this is Frank again. Our exposure \u2013 overall exposure and commitments in the commodity sector is roughly $600 million. And we really have three to five key relationships that we've had longstanding relationships with, that we know the management teams exceptionally well. Very small number overall that we are very comfortable with. And we have a strategy with them that's consistent with our overall strategy in how we would go to market with different clients. We don't have a broad appetite for this sector. And we don't have a broad appetite as we go forward to do things outside of our normal footprint. But again we do have a very small number of select relationships, none of which we will talk about individually, that we are very comfortable with the management teams, with our strategy, and with our relationship. I'll also add that when you look at that book, it is a very short-term book in terms of maturity. Most of it self-liquidates within 12 months. So it's liquid in that regard. And we feel comfortable with our exposure at this point. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And some of these relationships go back 7 years, 8 years, 10 years. They're very long term. And these are not relationships that were added in the latest part of the commodity cycle. So that was not the purpose. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Thanks. And then shifting tack a little bit, the 10-Q in August talked about some (43:22) risk around the CRA rating dropping to needs to improve. I wondered if you could explain what happened there? And why you think that's a risk? Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : Well, first off our CRA rating is very important to us. And it is certainly our intent to serve all of our customers fairly and to represent credit availability in all the markets that we do business. Our publicly stated goal has been to achieve regulatory excellence in all facets of our business, and that certainly includes full compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. I really can't speculate on the question that you have at hand. All I can tell you is that we expect to be fully compliant institution as we go forward. And we've developed strategies in place to ensure that that will be the case as we advance forward. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Okay. Thank you very much. Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, John. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Hey, John. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Morning. Back on credit; sorry. On the \u2013 I wanted to ask a little bit around the Shared National Credit book. I know it stands at 27%-ish of your total loans. And I know you've grown that at a pretty solid pace over the past year. Can you update us on the credit standing of that book? And what the average size of the credits in that portfolio? And how many of them are above that $300 million number that you just put out there? Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : So, yeah. We can be clear about it. We actually have 47% of our total commercial book would be Shared National Credits. That's not really that unusual when you think about it from a regional bank perspective. We underwrite all those credits to our own account. We don't buy a credit blindly. We underwrite every credit as if we were the lead on that credit. That portfolio has performed very well. It is predominantly an investment grade credit. We have approximately 2% of that broad portfolio that is criticized. 2%. So it has performed much better than the broader portfolio that we have in the company. It's a very diversified credit overall. I don't have the specific average number that we have. But again as it relates to large exposures, I said before we have a very small number of exposure that would exceed $250 million to $300 million, very small handful of exposures. And those are to investment grade companies that have a very high PD. Companies that we've been very selective in doing business with, where we have a high degree of confidence in the management team, who have a long track record of success operating through the cycle. So the bottom line with this SNC credit is that we get a lot of questions around it, and I understand why. But it's a portfolio that is high grade, well managed, underwritten to our own book, and it has continued to have exceptionally strong asset quality. And we do not see any differences in that book as we go forward. It's a small book relative to leverage, and it's a small book to relative to energy. It's a very diversified book of high-grade credits predominantly in our footprint within the U.S. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Okay. And just a follow-up to that. So there's not much of that portfolio that is outside of your footprint or outside of the U.S.? Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : No. 99% of that portfolio is in the continental U.S. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Okay. All right. And then separately wanted to ask around the Vantiv stake. Can you just give us your updated thoughts around that stake? Do you still intend to sell it down and possibly fund buybacks with the proceeds? I mean if you can give us just your updated thoughts there? Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Yeah. This is Greg. Vantiv continues to be a very valuable partner of ours. And we know that business extremely well. We know that management team extremely well. And as we've said consistently we expect to continue to reduce our position in a manner that is in the best interest of our shareholders. So timing is important. We want to be able to return much of that value to our shareholders as possible. You can expect us to continue along that strategy as we move forward. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Okay. All right. Can I \u2013 if I could just ask one more? On the IT spend, sorry if I misheard this, but did you say that the tech expenses would be up 10% in fourth quarter versus third quarter, Tayfun? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's what we are expecting right now. That's correct. And I think that's in line with the guidance that we gave back in January. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Right. Okay. And the abatement of that level of spend would occur sometime during 2016? Or how do we think about that? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Let's talk about that in January when we give you the full-year guidance for 2016. John Pancari - Evercore ISI : Okay. All right. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Sameer. Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. Good morning. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning. Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : I just wanted to go back. Maybe I didn't \u2013 I missed this in your commentary, but on the loan related to the private student loan portfolio. Effectively where were those private \u2013 the underlying private student loans marked on a market-value basis? Could you give me a sense for that? I must have missed it in your comments. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We did not provide where they were marked, Sameer. All we said was that we had an $80 million reserve against this pool at the end of June. And then the charge-offs basically came in at $102 million. And that included the impact of the spread widening during the quarter. But beyond that we did not provide any more details on the market valuations. But right now we feel pretty good at where we are with 107% collateral coverage. Should the additional $13 million of reserves against the pool of loans that \u2013 with attached FICO score of 750 plus and the 75 months' seasoning. Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And there again it's not on our books in the form of \u2013 this is a commercial line. So it's still in the commercial book. Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Yeah. Okay. And then I just wanted to switch gears to the auto loan business. I think you had a settlement with the CFPB and had agreed to some changes in your pricing structure. It seems like a few other lenders have also agreed to similar changes, but perhaps not all of them. So I was wondering to what extent do you think that those changes to your pricing caps could have an impact going forward on auto loan origination volumes if any? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Obviously it's tough to comment on the outlook for what other lenders may or may not choose to do. But in terms of the impact of the current structure, we're working with our dealers right now. And clearly our strong preference is to ensure the ongoing business relationships that we have and to be good partners. And at this point we're not necessarily anticipating significant changes of the business that we do with our dealers. And as we look forward into 2016 after going through the dialogue that we have in place with our dealers, we'll give you a better perspective. Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then just my last question was, Greg, you talked about this also. And, Tayfun, you had discussed this at a recent conference. But you talked about replacing your head count heavy design with technology. And I think you said we'd get more guidance of course in January as far as expenses goes specifically. But is it fair to say that it's going to maybe take some time for you to identify specific areas where you expect to realize those technology benefits? So it's not really a \u2013 by 2016 you'll have all of this mapped out. That might be \u2013 take 2 years or 3 years before you identify and target specific areas where you want to become better with technology. Or are we looking at early 2016, we get a full-fledged plan as far as what you envision over the next 2 years or 3 years? I'm just trying to get a better sense of that. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Yeah, Sameer, this is Greg. First off we're in the midst right now of really solidifying our 2016, 2017 strategic plan. Now a lot of those technology initiatives once again focused on either driving revenue, extracting efficiencies, regulatory compliance are in our sights right now. And what we're really doing is just finalizing a plan. And I think in January we'll be able to give you more guidance of what we expect to see from an expense perspective and where those investments are going to take place. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Sameer, the comment that we made during the script if you missed that part, is we believe that the upward slope in the risk in compliance-related expenses will stop in 2016. Clearly some of these technology applications would be expected to replace some of the human heavy processes. And that will come in after \u2013 obviously after that. So but we will discuss this with all of you guys in a little bit more detail in the upcoming quarters. Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. That's great. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR & Company. Your line is open. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Yeah. Thank you very much. I was just wondering, because a couple banks have mentioned on their calls that they might have to back off on capital management on the CCAR, because I guess in the CCAR exam, a lot of people are assuming rates are going up. And now where a lot of people like yourself are pulling those forecasts out. Does that impact at all future capital management? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. I mean we've seen the same comments. But in terms of the way we have our capital management actions planned, we're comfortable with the CCAR plan that was approved last year. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: And then as a follow-up you mentioned \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong. You mentioned that you might have to \u2013 that you might want to \u2013 you're going to try to increase operating leverage if rates don't go up over the next year. If I got these comments incorrect, please correct me. But so are you going to try to have a more efficient expense plan if rates continue to stay where they are? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I did not make any comments about our expectations for operating leverage over the next year. All I said was that the directive to the organization is very clear. We will extract efficiencies in our existing businesses and in recognition of the rate environment. It's very important for us to make sure that we create an efficient-to-deliver infrastructure. That's really the comment that I made. Now we've talked about the $65 million for example of reduction related to the closing of the branches, which will start in the second half of next year. We're clearly looking for more opportunities not necessarily in that area, but in all the parts of the company. And then going into the New Year we will share with you some of our strategic investment plans, and how they may impact at our expense base. But the comment that I made was that we clearly look to extract efficiencies from the rest of our expense base to be able to make some of those investments. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Okay. Hey, guys, thank you very much. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Hey, Matt. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Question for Greg. Obviously a lot of talk on expense management. But maybe just more broadly speaking with you officially taking over in a couple of weeks and some new people on the team, should we think about any kind of broader strategic outlook \u2013 sorry, strategic update as we think about the next few months? Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: First off I feel really good about the businesses we're in and the strategies that we put forth over the last couple years. I've been the President since 2013, I've been instrumental in those strategies. So I think strategically the direction that we're taking and that we have taken is the right direction. Obviously we're looking for opportunities to increase the pace of play, accelerate some of those investment opportunities for returns. So I think strategically we're in the right path. The talent that we brought in recently, I couldn't be more pleased with the additions to our management team. And I think going into 2016 we're very well positioned. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then just separately a little bit more of a detailed question. The commercial construction loan growth versus a year ago is very strong, almost doubling, obviously off of a very small number. But can you just remind us what that is, what kind of loans that is? And what's driving it up so much? Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : Hey, this is Frank. It's predominantly multi-family and industrial. They are strong credit names, predominantly high-grade. I can stress we're doing no speculative lending in that book. So these are credits that we feel very good about. We are not a long-term lender. We are predominantly a construction lender. The majority of the long-term financing is being taken care of by other financial institutions. Client selection for us is imperative. We're dealing with large regional and national developers that we know very well. Again as you said the overall size of our exposure in our book is still very small relative to where the company has been before. But we're comfortable in that space. So high grade, it's predominantly multifamily and industrial. It's in good growth markets. And again we're very focused on client selection and very strong, sound, prudent underwriting, non-speculative. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Matt, just by the mechanics as you mentioned that the base was very small where it started from, which tends to elevate the percentage increases. And by nature of the shorter duration of those exposures, you will see a leveling off the growth rate. It just \u2013 it's very difficult to continue to grow that portfolio once it reaches a certain level of maturity. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And there has been some talk about obviously frothiness in the broader multifamily lending area. So I guess how do you think about that? And maybe it's just you were so underexposed that you're catching up a little bit. But how do you think about maybe that segment being a little overheated right now? Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : Well it is becoming more frothy as you say, but we are not catching up. We're being very prudent and selective in who we want to do business with. And again it's credit tenants in these projects are \u2013 they're developers that have strong balance sheets. Client selection in commercial real estate is the first imperative. And beyond that it's ensuring that we're not making exceptions in our underwriting practices. And it's making sure that we're doing things that fit our risk appetite. And doing speculative lending is not in our risk appetite now or going forward, and we're not doing that. So we're being very prudent in what we do and what we put on, very selective. And we're very cognizant on how much exposure we have in the individual market, especially those that are showing more growth. So overall again we feel very, very good that we're \u2013 what we're doing is exactly consistent with what our appetite is, multifamily, industrial, high grade, strong client selection, non-speculative. Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Last week one of your Ohio neighbors, KeyCorp, reported results and just knocked the cover off the ball with their C&I loan growth. And when we asked why that was, they talked about hiring lenders, they talked about just having a really deep product expertise that kind of gave them an advantage over the other Ohio-based companies. Do you guys feel that that's a fair statement? That that's a fair advantage that they have? Or because I'm trying to just understand why they're growing so strongly in C&I specifically versus you guys, which are clearly seeing slower growth. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. We'll not make any comments about our friendly neighbors here in Ohio. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Well maybe... Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So I think we feel very good about the talent that we have and the product menu that we have to offer to our clients. We're happy with what we have. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Is there any way that you could do something, whether it's new initiatives or hiring more talent or something that might actually help narrow the gap? Or just \u2013 let's just call it improve your own C&I loan growth from here? Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Ken, this is Greg. We've been very focused on talent in every single one of our markets. We have been growing our talent base in our markets. But once again we're really focused on the quality of our relationships, the right type of relationships, and being good through the cycle. So we're very comfortable with our performance right now and at the pace we're on. And we feel really great about the relationships we're bringing to the bank and the profitability of those relationships. Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Eads from UBS. Your line is open. David Eads - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Morning. David Eads - UBS Securities LLC : You guys talked earlier about the impact of some widening credit spread from the credit perspective. And I'm just curious, there's (1:01:31) obviously seen high yield spreads go out quite a bit. And I'm curious if you guys have seen any indications of that impacting the more \u2013 on the lending side, whether it comes to risk appetite or competition or pricing? Just any signs of that risk aversion filtering into the bank lending arena. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Some stabilization in production spreads is visible, but it's difficult to necessarily comment about whether it's going to last or not, because we've seen from quarter to quarter those types of moves, which did not last very long. But the difficulty is with respect to being able to project portfolio yields. Clearly portfolio yields are a function both of production spreads as well as payoffs and pay-downs. So at this point we are choosing not to forecast. But we are somewhat optimistic that we may see the impact of that spread widening in capital markets in loan markets, but it takes a while for that to happen. David Eads - UBS Securities LLC : All right. That's helpful. And then I know it's kind of early days, but have you seen anything surprising from the EMV switchover that would suggest there are opportunities or risks from either the revenue or expense side? Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: No. This is Greg. As of right now our implementation's gone fairly smooth, obviously focusing on the customers with the highest usage. We're in full stride of getting those cards rolled out. As of right now it's to plan. So we're not seeing anything that's surprising to us. David Eads - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy from Stephens. Your line is open. Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Morning. Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.: Within the release you highlight the global economic slowdown as one reason behind the higher provision. And then on the call I think you specifically called out the manufacturing sector. Could you just talk about what you're seeing within your manufacturing customers? How they're adapting to market volatility? It seems like it's a pretty big part of the C&I portfolio at over 20%. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It is, Terry. We're not seeing necessarily an impact of the slowdown yet in our manufacturing base. All we're doing is we're just recognizing that globally, manufacturing is slowing down. Consumer tends to be stronger. But we're seeing slowdowns. And just recognizing again where we are in the expansion cycle. Recognizing that the global slowdown may impact U.S. manufacturing activity. But this is nothing specific relative to our specific clients or borrowers. It's more a recognition of the global macro environment. Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.: And then as a follow-up the middle market was mentioned a couple times on the call as being a source of growth in terms of loan growth in Q3. Could you just talk about the pipelines heading into year-end here? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Fourth quarter tends to be a strong quarter in terms of pipelines. We've seen good production in Q3. And we are looking into Q4 with similar levels of activity. Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to try and get a little more color on the global commodities exposure. Tayfun, you mentioned those have been long-term relationships. Can you give a little more color on where \u2013 given that these are global commodities players with a lot of business outside the U.S., what exactly is their relationship? And what's the strategic fit for you? And are there other global companies like that outside the U.S. that you're \u2013 that you have sizable exposures to? Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : This is Frank. We have a very small international book overall. And again as we've said before, we have a small number of commodity clients that we value. We've had a longstanding relationship with that have ties back into the U.S., back into our company. But our overall international exposure is very small. It's a very small piece of our company. And our overall commodity exposure, as we indicated before, is very small as well. We're managing the book appropriately. And we're comfortable with the relationships that we have in place. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And given the volatility that we've seen, Frank, and Greg, and Tayfun, especially around Glencore and stuff in the markets, is there any plans to dial that back down? Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : We do not have an appetite to increase our exposure broadly in that sector. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And Frank mentioned it's a pretty short duration portfolio. Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer : Yeah. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Vivek, this is not our long-term commitment that we're talking about. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. Right. No, that's why I heard you say that and I thought, okay, does that mean that once these mature you sort of walk away from that and dial that back down. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We're clearly cognizant of the global environment, and we will make those decisions appropriately. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Correct. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. One small one for you, Tayfun, litigation reserve reversal. Could you give any color on how much that was? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Just about $5 million. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open. Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. Want to change the questioning a little bit, Greg. I wanted to ask you as you now assume your new role, one of the biggest challenges for the industry and in particular for Fifth Third is growing revenues. What opportunities are you going to be focused on? Where do you think you can really make some difference in a sense on the revenue side? Financial engineering can only take you so far. Eventually you got to create some revenue growth. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: I think obviously our commercial business is a source of opportunity for us, as is our wealth business, which is growing nicely traditionally over the years. But in addition to that we've launched a payments division. And you look at our currency processing solutions, and our technology play in that sector supporting our retail and our healthcare sector. So I think payments is a source of opportunity for us. And we're looking hard at that technology stack, how it can be more additive in that respect through some potential M&A opportunities. We'll also continue to expand our footprint where appropriate in mid-corporate. And also our talent on the middle market side of the house, there's opportunities there I think that continue to grow. So it's really once again continuing to focus on quality relationships in our commercial business, partnerships, and extracting value in our payments business and being additive to our technology stack. And then obviously wealth management I think is a key integral part of our One Bank strategy. So I think those are the three areas where we can see some uplift in revenue. And if you look at our strategies, they're really focused in those key areas from a revenue perspective. Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : And then Fifth Third has traditionally done really well with acquisitions back in the day when you had your premium stock price and a lot of excess capital. What do you think and how does that play strategically into the growth of Fifth Third over the next five years to seven years? Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Marty, that's tough to say. But I would tell you this. Any time there's an opportunity to create long-term shareholder value, we're going to take a look at that opportunity, and that's important. But there's really no change to our core strategy around M&A. If it's bank M&A, we really want to be more relevant in our core markets today, where we can better serve our customers and extract more efficiency. So if we do a bank M&A opportunity, it's really going to be in our current markets. But we're also looking at opportunities as I mentioned earlier that'd be additive to our payments business. And that technology stack there once again is supporting our commercial business in retail and healthcare. We think there's some opportunities there from an M&A perspective. Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. And then, Tayfun, I wanted to challenge you a little bit on your 70% deposit beta. In the initial phase we're assuming 40%, and you go the first 100 basis points. Once you get to post that it moves up to your 70% kind of number that you're estimating for all moves. Is the difference in our analysis just the gamma? Or what we also showed in our analysis is that Firth Third has been pre-disposed to have higher deposit beta. So is there something in your culture or your regions or your customers that just makes you have a higher deposit beta relative to the peers? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Let me give you my side, and then Jamie will comment on it as well. Marty, the difficulty is that it's extremely difficult to look back and compare what happened pre-crisis with rate moves, because we are operating under a significantly different liquidity structure and market structure. Our cautiousness is due to the unknowns. We want to make sure that we discuss with you what the outcomes may be. I don't think we \u2013 there is anything specific to Fifth Third that would drive these betas higher compared to our peers. It's just the fact that under the current liquidity rules, which have never been in place before, it's difficult to extract our future experience based upon past experience. James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. And we do use a 70% beta on every move, so it's not a gamma issue. But as Tayfun said we'll work very hard to potentially outperform that. And frankly our concern on the \u2013 and why we use a 70% beta is the combination of the LCR impact on retail deposits and frankly on banks that aren't LCR-compliant, whereas we already are. So if anything you may say we should be able to outperform better than a 70% beta. But you also have technology is definitely at a different state in the banking industry today than it was 10 years ago in the last Fed tightening cycle. In the last tightening cycle we were right on the peer average of a 50% beta. And now we just started conservatively modeling a 70% beta as Tayfun said, due to the unknowns. If we're able to operate at a 70% beta, a 25 basis point move in the Fed funds rate is about a $70 million NII benefit annually. And if we're able to execute at a 30% beta, the number's about $120 million. So we just want to size up the impacts and just make sure that everyone understands the importance of the underlying assumptions that go into both your deposit betas and then ultimately your asset sensitivity. Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : It'll be interesting when we ever do get that first 25 basis point, when the comments, we're going to stop and wait and see what everybody else is doing. If everybody's looking at everybody else, nobody's moving, which just in my mind kind of pre-disposes to a little bit better beta early on versus later on in the cycle. So it will be interestingly for \u2013 get that first move, see what happens. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You're right. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Absolutely. Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Hey, Mike. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi, Greg. Hey. I just want to confirm, you said you're closing 105 branches, and you'll be done by mid-2016? Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Correct. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : So you start as CEO in 12 days. So in your first 8 months, you'll be closing 8% of the branches? Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: That'd be correct. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : And so is it fair to characterize your approach as bricks to clicks? I'm using that term from the Internet era. But bricks to clicks, I mean you're reducing the bricks with the branch closures. And on the click side you said you're increasing technology investment. It sounds like more than just a 10% boost in the fourth quarter. So would you subscribe to that? Or characterize it differently? Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Well what I would tell you is first off we live in a technology era. And you're seeing that with respect to our user preferences and how they want to bank, anytime, anywhere. You look at our mobile deposit applications, right now 50% of all of our deposits are coming through remote Web, 38% through our digital channels. Mike, we've been very mindful of the impact that has on our branches and branch traffic and so forth. So we're really measuring for a couple things. One is how do we touch and sell to our customers differently going forward? And also how do we drive back office efficiencies and improvement? And then what does that mean to our distribution channels, i.e., our branches? What do they look like? And how many do we need? So we looked at over 50 variables. And we assessed the \u2013 and we came down to the 105 branches that we wanted to reduce. We think we're at the right level right now. But as we continue to move forward in this environment, as we continue to roll out additional technologies, as users continue to change and preferences changes, there will be more opportunities in the future. I can't quantify that at this point. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Can you describe the end game? In January I guess you'll give us your plans for 2016. But 3 years, 5 years, 10 years out, are you looking to be the low-cost producer? Are you looking to be the digital king? I mean what's the end game? Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: I think at the end of the game we want to be very efficient in how we serve our channels. And I think retail and a lot of the stress on the retail revenue side of the house drives you really to focusing on efficiencies and how you serve that channel. That's a benefit for the customer and the bank. So it's really after efficiency, better service. At the end of the day net-net, that's the model we want to be in. And we absolutely are focused on efficiencies here, Mike. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : And lastly you said increased pace of play I think a couple times. What metric would that be? What metric would best represent increased pace of play? Will that be the efficiency? Will that be ROE? Will that be some other \u2013 customer happiness with their experience? Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: I think it's all of the above. It's hard to quantify. What I can tell you is when we look at our strategies in 2016, 2017, what we're rolling out, we're focused on how do we roll that out faster? How do we drive those efficiency quicker? And how do we serve the customer better? So we're really looking at how we sharpen our pencil on the execution side of the house and get a better return quicker on our investments. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Mike, it's also the increase in the average hours work for Greg's team is also another metric that we're switching. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: We're asking a lot of them. Yes. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : All right. Thank you. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Nomura. Your line is open. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director: Bill. William Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Hi. My questions have been asked and answered. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : All right. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time, which brings us to the end of today's presentation. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jim Eglseder, you may begin your conference. Jim Eglseder : Thanks, Juana and good morning. Today, we will be talking with you about our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performances and these statements. We have identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. I am joined on the call by several people today. Our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and our Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. With that, I will turn the call over to Greg. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Jim and thank all of you for joining us this morning. For 2015, we reported full year net income available to common shareholders of $1.6 billion. Our full year earnings growth of 60% reflected significant returns from the sale of a portion of our Vantiv ownership and thoughtful management of our balance sheet given the uncertain pace of interest rate increases. 2015 was an important year of accomplishments and results were highlighted by return on assets of 1.22% and return on common equity of 11.3%. Despite the $94 million impact of the deposit advance product, our net interest income was relatively flat. We invest in our businesses and the talent across the organization strengthens our balance sheet and further enhanced our risk and compliance infrastructure. Full year net interest income declined only 1% as growth otherwise offset the lost revenue from the reduction in income related to the deposit advance product. Year-over-year core fee income growth was 3%. As we grow fee income, we will seek to add capital efficient and growth-oriented products and services in order to deepen client relationships. Our intention is to reduce our dependency on more volatile spread income or complementing an already rich menu of products that we offer our clients. Along those lines, you may have seen our recent announcement regarding the hiring of a long-tenured insurance executive who have successfully grown and run and integrated bank-owned insurance program. We are excited about this business and we will explore other areas of opportunity for expansion of products and services we offer today. As we are maintaining our focus on revenue growth, we are keeping operating leverage on the top of our priority list. While expenses were up this year, we are confident in our ability to return to positive operating leverage once the increases in our risk and compliance areas begin to flatten, which we believe will happen later this year. As we said on many occasions, we will continue to invest in our businesses while we look to partially fund those investments through savings in our core operations and investments in our future capabilities. Tayfun will cover some additional details of our investments so you can get a better idea of the impact and trajectory we are looking at. We are committed to achieving positive operating leverage and we believe we have the right plans in place to make that happen. For 2015, average core deposits were up 6% for the year, while average loan balances were up 2%, resulting in a core deposit-to-loan ratio of 106%. Balance sheet strength is a core focus for me and my team as our goal is to be a top performer across the business cycle with lower volatility of earnings. We continue to reposition the loan portfolio for consistent performance through the cycle as we focus on higher quality relationships. This is the path we have been pursuing for the last several years as you can see in the average PDs of our commercial book that we have discussed in our some of our presentations over the last year. More recently, we have taken actions to reduce exposure to certain sectors in order to reduce the sources of some of our early earnings volatility. Tayfun will discuss some of our efforts in this commentary. Looking beyond some of the discreet items in 2015, underlying credit performance and metrics continued to improve as NPAs and delinquencies remains at levels that we have not seen since before the crisis. Our intention is to operate a business model with better credit performance predictability. With our focus on operating metrics, we also made significant progress on our strategic plans throughout the year. We announced plans to rationalize parts of our branch network, which will save $60 million annually. We closed or sold 41 branches last year and we have two transactions that are scheduled to close near the end of the first quarter that included additional 34 branches. In total, we are about two-thirds of the way through the project and we expect the remaining 32 branches to be closed by June 30. Also during the year, we concluded three significant legal settlements and reduced the size of our Vantiv position. I know I have covered many of these items before, but I think it\u2019s important for us to highlight the pattern of active, disciplined decision-making we have demonstrated as we continue to reposition the company for future success. Vantiv continue to be a source of significant returns for our shareholders and the year was capped by a number of transactions related to our ownership. We have taken important steps towards reducing our direct ownership stake in Vantiv in the best interest of our stakeholders, while reducing a significant amount of volatility associated with our warrant position. During the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 8 million shares, sold or settled two-thirds of the warrant and sold a portion of future TRA payments, which unlock nearly $0.5 billion of value. Vantiv continues to perform well and we are happy to participate in their success. To maximize returns to our shareholders, we executed in a well-planned manner on all three pieces of our financial interest namely : the TRA, warrants and direct ownership. We still hold a significant ownership stake in the company, which we believe will result in healthy returns for our shareholders. For the third consecutive year, we returned more than 75% of our earnings back to shareholders. We expect that would rank us near the top of our peers. In 2015, we returned 42% of earnings via share buybacks, which reduced our share count by 39 million shares. Dividends represent 30% of earnings and combined, we achieved a core payout ratio of 72%. In addition to our core payout ratio, the Vantiv proceeds were used to repurchase an additional 9.25 million shares of our common stock. In aggregate, we have returned 78% of our earnings back to shareholders. So, now a few comments about the fourth quarter. We reported net income to common shareholders of $634 million in earnings per diluted share of $0.79, including $0.38 of volumes that Tayfun will go over in more detail. The largest impact on the quarter was the monetization of a portion of our ownership in Vantiv that I just mentioned. Core fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations. We view the Fed December rate move as a positive first step towards a normalized environment, but there is uncertainty around the extent and timing of the future rate decisions. Our loan growth was impacted by larger than normal pay-downs and payoffs. However, we are starting the year with a strong origination activity and our outlook for 2016 remains in line with the nominal GDP outlook. Fourth quarter reflects the efforts to position ourselves for growth. We are refocusing our resources on businesses with higher growth return potential that will enable us to achieve our objective of outperformance through the cycle. In addition to that, we are making investments in infrastructure designed to improve our service delivery and efficiency. Our fee business has produced stable results despite lower levels of capital markets activity. We are pleased with the low level charge-offs of 34 basis points. We are closely managing our expenses with a sharp focus on extracting efficiencies from our day-to-day operations. Our non-interest expense in the fourth quarter was up 2% driven by risk management technology investments and a substantial contribution to our charitable foundation. Current results reflect the ongoing benign environment. We are cognizant of global volatilities that are creating anxiety in the markets, but we believe that our exposures are conservatively underwritten and we have limited aggregate exposures in the more volatile sectors. We view 2016 as an important transition year as we position our company to achieve operating leverage in a sustainable manner regardless of the rate environment. In 2015, we have taken important steps in that direction and we will continue our efforts in 2016. We are working on long-term revenue growth as well as expense efficiencies to achieve our goal. We have taken actions to reduce run rate expenses in order to partially fund strategic investments and we expect expenses related to our risk and compliance infrastructure to peak in 2016. We will continue to reallocate resources to improve profitability with reduced volatility. We are committed to achieving the industry leading level of operational results that you have historically seen from us. Our 18,000 employees are our most important asset and I am extremely proud of what they accomplished in 2015. They did a great job of taking care of our customers and driving shareholder value. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication in 2015 and I look forward to their contributions to our success in 2016. Thank you. With that, I will turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter operating results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let\u2019s start with the financial summary on Page 3 of the presentation. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $634 million or $0.79 per diluted share. There were a number of items that affected earnings in the quarter as Greg mentioned. These items can be found on Page 2 of our release and the net impact was a benefit of $0.38 per share. We have been patient and deliberate in our actions related to our Vantiv ownership and we have delivered significant value to our shareholders. The benefits of the transactions are sufficiently self evident. With that, let\u2019s move to the average balance sheet on Page 4 of the presentation. Average portfolio balances were $221 million higher than the third quarter and the period end balances were down about $1 billion as payoffs and pay downs, especially in December impacted our net growth. The payoffs were higher than expected, especially in commercial real estate, which reached almost $1 billion this quarter as construction projects refinanced into permanent financing. During the quarter, we maintained our strategy of keeping a shorter duration in our commercial real estate portfolio. Some of these payoffs were slated for the first quarter and as such, it was a timing issue as they exited the portfolio earlier than expected. In addition, we have actively reduced exposures in certain segments of the portfolio such as commodity trading, in line with our goal to reduce volatility, especially in the current environment. I would like to point out that although the market sensitivity to the economic environment increased over the last few weeks, we discussed our rather cautious perspective on the economic environment with you in October and indicated that our actions reflected our views on the overall economic conditions and the age of the current credit cycle. As some of the production also shifted from the fourth quarter into the first, we are starting the year with a healthy amount of activity. New production coupons have remained stable, but the credit spread widening seen in the high yield market has not yet reached bank loan credit spreads. Consumer loans were flat with last quarter and continue to display similar trends to recent quarters. Average investment securities increased by $700 million in the fourth quarter or 2% sequentially. Average core deposits increased $1 billion from the third quarter, driven by higher demand deposit and money market account balances. Our LCR ratio was 115% at the end of the quarter. Moving to NII on Page 5 of the presentation, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $2 million sequentially to $904 million, primarily driven by the full quarter impact of the $2.4 billion of wholesale debt issuances in the third quarter and our auto loan securitization completed in November. The net interest margin was 285 basis points, down 4 basis points from the third quarter, driven by the impact of those debt issuances, slower prepayments reducing net discount accretion on the investment portfolio and an increased short-term cash position during the quarter. Our margin for the second half of the year was 2.87%. The results related to NII and NIM were very much in line with our expectations and guidance. Shifting to fees on Page 6 of the presentation, fourth quarter non-interest income was $1.1 billion compared with $713 million in the third quarter. Results included a net $490 million of pretax Vantiv items we have already discussed. We show fee income, adjusted for primarily Vantiv related items on Slide 6 of $623 million, an increase of $32 million or 5% sequentially. This growth included the annual payment under our tax receivable agreement with Vantiv, which was $31 million this quarter. Corporate banking fees of $104 million were flat sequentially. The volatility towards the end of the year clearly impacted our client activity in capital markets. It is no surprise that the gap was more pronounced in loan syndications as the slowdown in those markets has been widely publicized. Mortgage banking net revenue of $74 million was up $3 million sequentially. Originations were $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, with 49% purchase volume. 80% of the origination came from the retail and direct channels and 20% from the correspondent channel. Gain on sale margins were up 6 basis points sequentially. Net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include amortization and valuation adjustments, were negative $16 million this quarter versus negative $29 million last quarter. Deposit service charges decreased 1% from the third quarter and increased 1% relative to the fourth quarter of 2014. Deposit service charges this quarter were impacted by a 3% reduction in consumer service charges, primarily due to a roll out in the fourth quarter of a more simplified checking product line up. Total investment advisory revenue of $102 million decreased 1% sequentially, primarily due to lower retail brokerage revenues, partially offset by personal asset management and specialty services revenue growth. We show non-interest expense on Page 7 of the presentation. Expenses were $963 million compared with $943 million in the third quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to a $10 million contribution to Fifth Third Foundation, technology expenses and higher net occupancy expense, which was partially impacted by the real estate decisions in one of the consumer markets that we are exiting this year. Our total employee expenses were up approximately $65 million in 2015. That number included the impact of inflationary adjustments, severance, as well as the change in the composition of our total employee base. Although our year-over-year headcount is down, the reduction is mainly in our retail branch network and the adds are in risk and compliance. By nature of those job functions, the average compensation related to our new employees is higher than those that left the bank. During the year, we added 373 people in our risk and compliance functions for an incremental compensation cost of approximately $21 million and that number will continue to grow in 2016. I will share those details with you shortly. As expected, our technology expenses increased this quarter, although somewhat less than we anticipated. Project calendars typically impact our technology expenditures, but in general, the direction is in line with our expectations and guidance. Card and processing expenses were also up, primarily on costs associated with our EMV project. We are spending a lot of time on controllable expenses with all of our business lines and will continue to enforce a tight level of control on our operations. Turning to credit results on Page 8, net charge-offs were $80 million or 34 basis points in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, in the third quarter, excluding the student loan backed commercial credit, net charge-offs were $86 million or 37 basis points. As expected, we returned to more normalized charge-off levels this quarter. Non-performing assets, excluding loans held for sale, increased $41 million from the previous quarter to $647 million, bringing the NPL ratio to 55 basis points and the NPA ratio to 70 basis points. Within commercial, NPAs increased $49 million from the third quarter, primarily due to an $89 million increase in C&I partially offset by a $38 million decline in commercial real estate NPAs. Consumer NPAs decreased $8 million from the third quarter to 62 basis points, primarily driven by a $5 million decline in Residential Mortgage and a $5 million decline in home equity NPAs. Our consumer loan portfolio has continued to show steady improvement throughout the year reflective of the high credit quality standards that we are maintaining in our underwriting. The allowance for loan and lease losses increased $11 million. The resulting reserve coverage is at 1.37% of loans and leases compared with 1.35% last quarter and 252% of NPLs. As we discussed last quarter, we are cognizant of where we are in the credit cycle. The global concerns associated with a diverse set of factors reaching from geopolitical to fundamental economic performance are well-known. Although we are a predominantly domestic bank, it is difficult to take comfort purely around the health of the U.S. economy relative to the rest of the world. In this environment and in light of the absolute low levels of our credit metrics, we need to point out that these levels maybe subject to potential volatility from time to time. As an added element of credit discussion, given the global economic weakness and volatility, certain segments in commercial lending are appropriately getting more attention and we would like to review our portfolio more closely with you with respect to these industries on Slide 9. In isolation and in aggregate, our exposures in these three sectors are small both relative to our total capital as well as relative to our total loans. Our energy portfolio outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.7 billion relatively small at 2% of the portfolio. Of this amount, just under half are in senior secured reserve based loans. Outstandings in the energy portfolio increased $107 million from the third quarter with growth in the midstream sector. At current forward strip oil prices, we continued to remain appropriately secured preserving our previous statements about our loss given default exposures on the RBL secured portfolio. So far, we had no exposures to any of the E&P companies that have filed for bankruptcy. The outstanding balances of roughly $300 million in oilfield services have a higher propensity for loss given default. In the fourth quarter, $22 million of the increase in NPLs came from the oilfield services sector within the energy portfolio. We are monitoring our energy portfolio very closely, including stress testing in the portfolio for lower oil price scenarios. Should low oil prices persist through 2017, we will see continued reserve build and increased credit costs over that same period. We discussed our commodity trading exposure with you last quarter and during that conversation, we indicated our intent to effectively exit a large majority of our relationships. We are now reporting to you that our outstandings have declined to approximately $300 million, down by 34% since the second quarter. Furthermore, the credit distribution of the remaining outstandings is indicative of the quality of the portfolio as we will continue to wind it down. To repeat what we said before, this is a short-term portfolio and we will execute the planned exits with no expected losses. Our proactive efforts here demonstrate our willingness to act decisively. In commercial real estate, while our growth in the last two years has been strong, it should be viewed in the context of a low starting point after being less active for a few years. Fifth Third\u2019s portfolio is one of the smallest percentages of total loans among our peers. Our current expectations for credit performance are based upon disciplined client selection, underwriting with an established conservative policies, guidelines and concentration limits that include product and geographic concentrations. Disciplined client selection relies on targeting-proven experienced developers, investors and sponsors with strong balance sheets, diversified sources of cash flow and access to capital with demonstrated resilience through the cycle. Furthermore, our underwriting standards emphasize conservative cash flows and we focus on upfront cash equity contributions relative to cost versus loan to values that can be inflated by historically low cap rates. For each market, we conduct our own dilution analysis and focus on markets with multiple demand drivers and lower volatility. Specific to multifamily, we are sensitive not only to market demand and household generation, but also affordability as in some markets rents are rising faster than wages as the housing market returns. This has caused us to back off in certain markets. In short, we feel very comfortable with our commercial real estate exposure albeit a small percentage of loans. Looking at capital on Slide 10, capital levels continue to be strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 9.8% from 9.4%, a very strong quarterly move, especially given the impact of buybacks associated with Vantiv gains. In addition to the level of income, the reduction in the size of the warrant position, which reduced our risk-weighted assets contributed to the increase in the ratio. At the end of the fourth quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately $10 million. During the quarter, we announced the common stock repurchase of $215 million from Vantiv proceeds, which settled on the January 14 and reduced the fourth quarter share count by 9.25 million shares. As Greg mentioned, our payout ratio was very healthy at above 75% this year. In light of our discussions about the ongoing investments in our risk and compliance infrastructure as well as other strategic investments, we have provided more details on the nature of some of these investments as well as our financial expectations. These details are provided on Slide 11 and 12. We are going through a period of higher investments and added expenses related to the enhancements in our risk and compliance infrastructure. These expenses are mostly related to headcount in compliance in other areas in risk management, including operational risk. But in addition to higher compensation expense, we are also investing in technology. As you can see on Slide 11, the incremental expenses have had a significant impact on our run-rate in 2015 and will impact the run-rate in 2016 as well. While we added 373 employees in risk and compliance, we reduced the total employee count in other areas by 464 in 2015 resulting in a net decrease of 91. As we have shared with you in the past, we expect the rate of increase in our compensation expense in risk and compliance to peak this year. As such, we don\u2019t expect to see a repeat of this picture in 2017. We also don\u2019t expect to see a similar increase in technology expenses associated with our risk and compliance infrastructure beyond 2016. On Slide 12, we wanted to give you a perspective on the nature of some of these investments in our retail and consumer businesses and also provide you with our expectations on the level and timing of the financial returns. As you know, we have already taken significant steps by focusing on optimizing branch staffing through both job family redesign and headcount reductions, while at the same time reengineering our branch operating model and network. By reinvesting a portion of these savings in the business, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to accelerate our digital capabilities to reap the benefits of increased customer satisfaction, revenue growth and continued operational efficiency. Specifically, the investment in our integrated customer experience and branch digitization infrastructure is a critical component of our consumer bank strategy. Our omni-channel approach, one that truly integrates all of our customer\u2019s touch points across our physical, virtual and digital channels reflects the changes in customer demographics as well as the broader shift in customer behavior. These investments will enable our customers to connect with the banks seamlessly from activities that range from how they obtain advice, to open accounts, to complete simple transactions. In addition to improved revenue prospects of all products, we expect significant cost savings, especially when combined with our investments in branch digitization and back office automation. Although we are in the middle of executing our branch optimization strategy, our investments here could potentially provide other opportunities, which will depend on our future success in execution and the timing and extent of our change in our customer\u2019s behavior. The financial returns associated with these investments are very attractive and not based on aggressive assumptions about the overall economic conditions. As such, we are not delaying the timing even in the current low growth environment. The payback periods are short and are meaningfully contributive to income going forward. The financial returns are expected to be even higher as a result of improved customer service quality. We believe that our shareholders will be rewarded well with these investments. In combination, we will incur higher expenses in both risk and compliance and strategic investments in 2016, which will elevate the expense growth this year. As our outlook for the year will show you, we are funding a portion of these investments with savings in our operations. For example, we expect our total compensation expenses this year to increase by roughly the same amount as the increase in the risk and compliance related compensation, which means that we are expecting no additional increase in total compensation in other areas, excluding one-time expenses, despite merit increases and other inflationary factors. The positive year-over-year impact on revenues associated with our strategic investments beyond 2016 and the beneficial impact of flattening expenses combined for a positive \u2013 for a very positive impact on operating leverage in earnings. Turning to the outlook, our basic economic outlook is based on recent consensus market expectations of 2% to 3% real U.S. GDP growth with low inflation. On average, we should expect our industry to achieve overall loan growth approximating GDP growth. In commercial lending, we expect our loan growth to exceed 3%, supported partially by our strategic investments. We expect to see a decline in consumer loan portfolio, including the impact of the loan sales associated with our exit from St. Louis and Pittsburgh markets in the first half of this year, which is approximately $270 million. Outside the asset sales, the largest impact will come from our auto loan portfolio where we expect no improvement in market conditions to increase the shareholder returns. With the LCR-related investments largely behind us, our portfolio investments will be opportunistic in this environment. We expect to increase the size of the portfolio, but the timing will be dependent on rates and other balance sheet dynamics. In our outlook, we have two rate increases in 2016, one in June and one in September. In that scenario, based upon our outlook for loan growth, we expect a roughly 2% to 3% increase in NII on a year-over-year basis. NIM should also expand 3 basis points to 4 basis points from the fourth quarter 2015 level as the benefit of future rate hikes is partially offset by loan yield compression and potential funding actions. If there are no further rate increases in 2016 and including the impact of the dividend reduction on the Fed stockholdings, we would expect a slightly higher NII and a stable NIM compared with full year 2015 levels, given a more conservative outlook on loan growth based on the economic environment that would lead to Feds in action. While recognizing the challenges in the current environment, especially in the oil and gas sector, at this point in our base case outlook, we still expect our credit performance to remain relatively stable. We expect our provision to exceed charge-offs in 2016. We currently expect our non-interest income to increase between 4% and 5%, excluding the impact of 2015 Vantiv-related gains. Moving to expenses, as we just discussed 2016 is an important transition year in our company. It is a year in which we will start executing a number of strategic investments, which will lead to accelerated revenue growth, expense savings as well as operational excellence company wide with a reasonably short payback period. As we also just discussed, we expect to see the slope of our risk and compliance related expenses to flatten this year. When combined with our run rate earnings growth, this picture bodes very well for our outlook beyond 2016, with an improved earnings project trajectory. More importantly, we are going through this transition as we continue to grow our revenues and achieve solid return on our shareholders\u2019 capital in 2016. Except for the increases in compensation related to risk and compliance that I just covered, excluding any one-time items we expect to keep our total compensation expenses flat this year including ongoing inflationary adjustments, merit increases and performance-based compensation. We expect roughly a $60 million increase in our technology expenses. As we just discussed, these investments have either very attractive return profile and/or are related to improvements in our infrastructure. Our year-over-year total expense growth is expected to be approximately 4.5% to 5% over our reported expenses in 2015, including an estimate for the impact of the proposed change in the FDIC assessment fee and the estimated one-time impact of an early retirement offer that is currently available to eligible employees, which will reduce our run rate expenses going forward. The growth is exaggerated partly due to an increase in the amortization of our low-income housing investments in 2016 and other one-time benefits that we experienced in 2015. Together, these two items make-up approximately 2% of the increase in total expenses. In addition, as we just shared with you that we expect an increase approximately $75 million in total expenses related to our risk and compliance infrastructure, which is another 2% of our total expense base in 2015. Our intent is to show that we are funding all other expense growth including non-risk related strategic investments, with savings elsewhere as these two items add up in dollar terms to a large portion of our entire year-over-year increase. For the first quarter, we expect net interest margin to be up 2 basis points to 3 basis points as the impact of the rate increase and day count is offset by the loan yield compression and the Fed dividend cut. Within NII, the reduction of the Fed dividend rate, loan yield compression and one less day in the quarter were slightly more than offset the benefit of the December rate increase and will result in a decline of about $5 million. Total fee income should be similar to last year\u2019s first quarter as most fee revenue lines, including deposit fees, card and processing revenue and corporate banking fees tend to be seasonably low. And we will not have the benefit of the Vantiv TRA payment in the first quarter. We will see higher expenses in the quarter, primarily due to seasonally higher FICA and unemployment expense, much like we saw last year, continued investment in risk management and compliance and the impact from the early retirement offer. We currently expect net charge-offs to be approximately in line with the first quarter 2015 levels. We also would like to remind you that the revenue expectations that we shared with you today do not include potential but currently un-forecasted items such as Vantiv warrant marks or gains or losses on share sales. Our goal is to solidify our earnings growth trajectory and improve shareholder returns and we have a plan to achieve that. With that, I will turn it over to Greg for closing comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks Tayfun. In closing, 2016 is an important transition year for our company. We are investing in our businesses and infrastructure to improve the returns to our shareholders beyond the near-term and to grow our company profitably through this cycle with lower volatility. We will continue to manage and grow our exposures prudently, especially in recognition of the current volatility. And we look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year. With that, Juana, please open the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Foran with Autonomous. Your line is open. Brian Foran : Hi, good morning. Greg Carmichael : Good morning. Brian Foran : Maybe on the credit, appreciate the comments on the 1Q \u201816 charge-off expectations in the broader message that things are stable, so I don\u2019t want to miss the forest for the trees, but zeroing in just on C&I and some of the deterioration in NPAs there, that you and others have seen, I mean I guess in your experience, what are the best leading indicators you watch for commercial credit and what are they telling you right now, both overall and maybe specifically, if you exclude energy, is everything else stable, improving or getting worse, are there any the industries that are starting to pop-up on your watch list beyond energy? Frank Forrest : Hi, this is Frank. Good question. Our \u2013 first off, our non-performing assets were up 5 basis points to 70 basis points. That\u2019s still at a low point for us over the past 7 years to 8 years and it compares very favorably to our peers. We are down 12 basis points year-over-year or $97 million overall. The increases that we saw were a couple of energy credits that are quite frankly are just making their way through the restructuring process, which is to be expected. And then it was really just spread over a number of smaller middle market credits on a couple of leveraged credits, so there was nothing there that jumped out as far as sectors. We do look at high yield spreads, there is clearly a correlation between high yield spreads and future loan losses on the commercial sector and we follow that and they are going up both on the energy side and outside of the energy side. So, we will continue to monitor and watch that over time. But our performance overall, the core of our middle market book, the mid cap book and the large cap book is still performing very, very well outside of energy, to answer your question, with no really discernible trends either in geography or products that are cause for concern at this time. So, our intent is up like everybody else. We are looking at a lot of leading indicators. We are managing credit very closely. But at this point, we still feel good overall about our portfolio for the year. As you recall, we had one outlier in the third quarter, which was a large student loan that was made back in 2007 that we restructured and rode off. But if you exclude that one large problem loan, our charge-offs for the year for the entire company were very tightly ranged between 34 basis points and 41 basis points, so very predicable. And at this point, we have only $22 million in NPAs and the energy sector that could change, but at this point, it\u2019s 1.3% of the energy book. So, I hope that\u2019s responsive to your question. Brian Foran : That\u2019s very responsive. It\u2019s a little depressing that you first got service back to the front of the conference calls, but I appreciate the help and that\u2019s all I had. Frank Forrest : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with BofA Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Greg Carmichael : Good morning. Erika Najarian : Could you remind us in terms of how the Fed treats some of the outsized gains from Vantiv relative to your ability to buyback stock? We understand that beyond your \u2013 the core PPNR you generate, you are allowed to use some of the gains to buyback stock. I am wondering if I am calculating gains of $490 million related to Vantiv this quarter, how much of that is free for buybacks according to your 2015 approved plan? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. This is Tayfun, Erika. So, we have \u2013 as we have done over the past, I think 3 years, we have asked and obtained approval to convert after-tax net gains on share sales into buybacks. So, the portion of the gains from direct after-tax gains, are eligible for buybacks and that\u2019s indicative of the size of the buyback that we executed this year. The warrant gains whether they are through sales of the warrants or whether they are through mark-to-market or not, they are not part of it, because they are just a mark-to-market. And then the TRA transaction which generated $49 million in gains also is not part of our CCAR application. We clearly will be reviewing our perspectives on these types of transactions in the upcoming CCAR process and we will update you as to our thoughts when we are ready to do that for you. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just a second follow-up question I think. We really appreciate the fact that 2016 is a transition year for expenses and thank you for the detail on expenses. I am wondering as we look beyond the transition year, Greg, what do you think is natural range in terms of the efficiency ratio for this company as you think about the puts and takes in terms of the benefits of these investments? And I guess a range is appreciated given that everybody has different assumptions for the rate outlook? Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Erika. First off, when you look at these investments, as Tayfun mentioned, they are very short-term returns. So, we are very committed to these investments and executing well against these investments both from an efficiency perspective and from a revenue opportunity. That\u2019s why we are making those investments. At the end of the day, when you look at our long-term view and efficiency ratio in the mid-50, sub-60 is extremely important to us and we are never going to lose sight of that to get back to that level. We believe these investments being made now and early executed well will allow us to move in that direction sooner than later. Erika Najarian : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR. Your line is open. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, Paul. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning, Paul. Greg Carmichael : Okay. Well, let\u2019s move to the next one and then we will take Paul\u2019s question later when he comes back. Operator : Okay. Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Greg Carmichael : Hey, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Circling back on the expense outlook, can you give us some of the pieces in terms of the FDIC cost increase that you expect I know it\u2019s hitting everyone and then also the early retirement hit? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Let me make a comment on the early retirement and then I will turn it over to Jamie for the FDIC comment. The early retirement, we are just still in the process. We don\u2019t know exactly what the exact numbers are, Matt. So, we will give you an update at the end of the quarter on that as we still need to go through the process. Jamie Leonard : Yes. Matt, on the FDIC, the way we have embedded it in the outlook is that this would be a quarterly run-rate item, not a one-time charge. And for us, the gross impact annually is about $50 million. But then within the proposed rules, you would get a rebate or a credit against that. So, the net impact to us is about $25 million a year. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then what I am trying to get at is as we think about the kind of exit expense base coming out of the 2016 into 2017 and the early retirement hit, we obviously would back out. I don\u2019t know about the amortization and tax benefits going up, but I am just trying to get a sense of ballpark, how many of the things that you provided for 2016 may drop off as we get to 2017, including the ramp up in some of the risk compliance technology, I don\u2019t know if those just flatten out or they actually go down? Tayfun Tuzun : Let me take it and then I will turn it over to Greg for broader comments on the directions. In terms of the individual items, we shared with you the risk and compliance-related increase. As we discussed, we expect that increase to flatten and it is clearly our goal to closely look at all of our expense adds there, look at all the processes and look for opportunities to reengineer some of these processes and include some technological solutions which we believe are possible. It\u2019s typical to yet estimate what that impact would be. In terms of the low income housing piece, I can tell you that our estimated year-over-year increase in that line item is about $30 million from \u201815 into \u201816. So, that we will update you and we will see if the activity level and the economics in that portfolio would continue in that direction. It\u2019s difficult to estimate that at this point. So, as we are exiting 2016, as we look ahead assuming the two rate increases that we built into our forecast on the revenue side assuming that we hit the non-interest income growth that we shared with you, we would be exiting this year at a lower efficiency ratio compared to the first half of the year. I mean, we will be moving towards low 60s, there is no question based on this outlook. Greg Carmichael : The only thing I would add, Matt, is when you look at these investments, especially around risk and compliance and associated investments in technology and supporting those initiatives, we also expect to continue to see improvement in our operational losses. For our losses, legal reserves and so forth would naturally be an outcome we expect to get and are going to work hard to make sure we realize those benefits also as we go into 2017. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thanks for all the color. Greg Carmichael : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Matt Burnell : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe a question for you, Tayfun, in terms of the demand for loans, I know you mentioned that you are expecting loan growth in 2016 will be roughly the same rate as real GDP. That\u2019s a little bit lower than you would normally expect. So, I guess I am curious where you are seeing lower levels of demand and I presume that the market challenges have only been a couple of weeks, so that has really not weighed on borrower sentiment, but how long would that have to continue before borrowers might get more, might get even more cautious in terms of borrowing? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. I am going to give you a brief response and will turn it over to Lars Anderson to give his perspectives on loan growth, especially on the commercial side. Overall, as you know, our total loan portfolio has done pretty well especially with strength in commercial. On the consumer side with deliberate actions on auto loan portfolio, we have clearly experienced the lower growth rate in the past year or two and we are projecting that into 2016 as we are not seeing changes in economic conditions. But in return, we are spending \u2013 our retail and consumer loan teams are spending quite a bit of time in moving the direction in home equity loans and credit cards up. And we are confident that some of these strategic and tactical moves will improve growth rates in those two portfolios. Now, we have always been cautious in terms of guiding the market for loan growth, as we do believe that in general our sector over a long period of time should match GDP growth. But clearly, in interim periods, we will have strategic actions to go over that. And so with that I am going to turn it over to Lars because I think he has good feedback and color on those actions what we are thinking about the commercial loan portfolio. Lars Anderson : Yes. Thank you, Tayfun. And frankly as recently as just the last few days I have had interaction with a number of clients in the marketplace. So I think this is pretty contemporary feedback. We are seeing a growing sense of caution from our client base. And frankly, that is really across almost all of our businesses, maybe an exception could be in the healthcare sector where they continue to have a level of confidence is some of the uncertainty was taken out in the end of last year there. And frankly, we are benefiting from that as we have invested in that and we continue to see nice growth there. Our goal is going to be obviously to outperform the nominal GDP as we look at 2016 through executing our business model that I think is very well received. And that business model is really one centered on having industry expertise with some of the best bankers in the marketplace, with very well thought through developed business lines. Now those business lines like I mentioned in healthcare, in retail and a number of other verticals have clearly outperformed. But we haven\u2019t stopped there, we are continuing to look for other opportunities to move market share. We have added our gaming and leisure. We are looking at our telecom media, telecommunications group, our food and ag group, a number of other opportunities there, where we are able to attract some very high quality talent, both on the line and in credit, in order for us to I think outperform the marketplace. I would also remind you that we have very attractive geographic markets throughout our footprint. If you look at the performance of just core commercial kind of middle market businesses in North Carolina, in Chicago, in Florida and other markets on a common quarter basis, we are up over 6% over the past year. We are going to continue to execute in those markets. We have a very well received value proposition in the marketplace. We are very focused on blocking and tackling and developing deeper relationships. One last thing I would add onto that, this is not just about credit and loans, this is about relationships and relationship returns and building them for the long haul, not just for the next quarter, but for years to come and we are seeing that play out even as we speak. So I have a lot of confidence as we look at \u201916, however it us against an uncertain economic backdrop. Matt Burnell : Thanks for that color, that\u2019s very helpful. And just finally for me, you did see quite a large percentage decline in the commodity portfolio balance, I realize it\u2019s only about $300 million now, but given the relatively short-term nature of that portfolio, you have mentioned in the past, when do you expect that will go down to zero? Greg Carmichael : Matt, this is Greg. First off, it probably won\u2019t go to zero. We got a few key clients that are U.S. centric that we have a strong relationship with, ancillary business that we are going to continue to manage and do business with. So but you are going to expect, it will be down significantly from the \u2013 even the 300 mark on a relatively short period of time, but it will never go to zero right now. Matt Burnell : Alright. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from David Eads with UBS. Your line is open. Greg Carmichael : Good morning David. David Eads : Hi, good morning. Maybe if you guys could dig in under the service a little bit on the outlook for fee revenues, the 4% to 5% growth is pretty encouraging, but curious, kind of where \u2013 I would expect kind of maybe stronger growth in capital markets and cards, parts of that businesses and then kind of curious where you are shaking out on the mortgage and service charge side of things? Greg Carmichael : So, just to clarify the 4% to 5% growth is based on the 2015 base adjusting for roughly $700 million in Vantiv-related gains, which includes the warrant mark to market throughout the year. So you are looking at basically about a $2.3 billion base in 2015, so the growth is off of that number. David Eads : Sure, exactly. Greg Carmichael : So what we are looking at is growth in capital markets, which I think Lars will provide some color on with all of our investments in added talent, we are expecting good amount of growth. I think we are expecting growth in our payments business, our payments processing should continue to give us added revenues based on our outlook. Mortgage, excluding the unpredictable MSR performance and at this point, based upon our interest rate outlook, we have to realize the tenures under 2% right now which may change some of these expectations. But under more normalized credit outlook, we would be about at the same place we were in 2015. We are expecting growth in our private banking and investment advisory business. We have done very well, that\u2019s been based on fairly stable sources of income. But the larger growth is expected to come from capital markets and I will turn it over to Lars for comments on that. Lars Anderson : Yes. So that\u2019s frankly I think one of the most exciting opportunities that we have got on a go forward basis. Now, clearly as you know capital markets is largely influenced by the overall activity in the overall macroeconomic environment and how that leaches into the U.S. markets. Something to keep in mind today, our capital markets business is certainly heavily centered around the debt capital markets, risk management and what I am talking about that, it\u2019s interest rate risk management, commodities and FX and with the uncertainties in the market, that obviously impacted the fourth quarter. But in a more normalized environment, we have got some really talented bankers with some deep relationships. We are very well positioned. And I would tell you, in our capital markets pipeline, we are actually are setup with clients for some nice activity once there is more certainty with our clients as we move into 2016. In addition to that, we are trying to diversify our capital markets platform, build out our M&A advisory platform. And I think that we have some very nice opportunities throughout \u201816 and \u201817 on a go forward basis. And lastly, again going back to the blocking and tackling, I think we have done a really nice job of building out a really high quality wealth management family practice kind of business as a company. But where we have an opportunity is to further integrate that across our platform, to open up our commercial and corporate bank and really deepen these relationships. And I see some revenue opportunity as well a strengthening long-term relationships consistent with our long-term strategy and that\u2019s not just in our wealth management IA business that includes our treasury management products where we have a number of specific actions and initiatives that we have underway for 2016 to drive those results. David Eads : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up, just kind of curious how you think about the Vantiv stake from here, you obviously given \u2013 presumably you guys would have some desire to increase buybacks at current valuations and would you consider moving faster on Vantiv to kind of give some more dry powder there? Greg Carmichael : Dave, we will continue looking at that opportunity. As we have demonstrated over the past, we have been very prudent on how and the timing of when we execute those opportunities, as you saw us execute in the fourth quarter very succinctly. So, there are opportunities there. We are evaluating it. And once again, we will continue to look at that through the eyes of what\u2019s best for our shareholders. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. I just want to remind you that when we sold our shares, the stock price was at $52. They are down to $42, despite the fact that our share price has moved down, theirs been as well. So it\u2019s always a relative perspective on just particularly the relationship between the two stock prices. Greg Carmichael : But put to that end, we have communicated that our intention is to continue to sell down our position at Vantiv and we are going to do that in a very thoughtful methodical manner. David Eads : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari. Your line is open with Evercore. Greg Carmichael : Hey, John. John Pancari : Good morning. I just want to go back to the non-performers and sorry if I missed anything on that front. The increase in the commercial NPAs, again, how much of that was energy? Frank Forrest : It was about 25% of the ultimate increase in the NPAs, almost everything else was spread out amongst middle market loans. John Pancari : Okay. And what is the total energy non-performers as of now? Frank Forrest : 22 million. John Pancari : Okay. And also on energy, do you have the percentage of the portfolio that\u2019s criticized? And then separately, do you have the percentage of the portfolio that\u2019s investment grade? Frank Forrest : The percentage of the portfolio, I will give it to you in two numbers. The percentage of the portfolio that will be classified, which I think is the more meaningful number, which is the definition of a problem loan from our regulatory teams is 22%. Our criticized assets on top of that would be a total of 36%. The criticize includes loans that have potential credit weaknesses that are not well defined and they are considered a problem loan. So, 22% of our books is the way we look at it is problematic in some form of another. It doesn\u2019t mean we are going to lose money. But by definition, the problematic 70% is not. I don\u2019t have the exact percentage of what\u2019s investment grade in our portfolio. However, when you look at the distribution of the energy books, as Tayfun said it\u2019s $1.7 billion in outstandings, it\u2019s 2% of total loans, 44% of it is reserve-based and 18% is oilfield services. Those two categories make up 97% of our criticized assets. So, that\u2019s where the focus is. You take the other 36% is basically an upstream and midstream, which didn\u2019t perform very, very well and there is a fairly high percentage of those that are investment grade, but I don\u2019t have the exact percentage of those. Greg Carmichael : And Frank, one additional thing I would add is 100% of those NPLs are in the oilfield services. They are not in midstream. They are not in our reserve-based lending portfolio. Frank Forrest : Yes, they are. Again, we feel very good as a senior secured lender with the exposure we have in the reserve-based portfolio. And that is the bulk actually is criticized assets. When you look at where there is potential loss, it would be on the oilfield services, it\u2019s only a $300 million portfolio at the end of the day. There is about 25% of that, that\u2019s distressed at this point in time, which is a very small number relative to the size of our book and the size of our capital. John Pancari : Okay. And then if you could remind me the updated size of the shared national credit portfolio as of December 31? Frank Forrest : It\u2019s 46% of our total commercials. John Pancari : 46% of total commercial loans? Frank Forrest : Yes. John Pancari : Okay. What\u2019s the dollar amount? Frank Forrest : Hold on, we will get it for you. John Pancari : Okay. And then I guess also, what was the change in that portfolio linked quarter? Frank Forrest : Yes. I see. On a linked quarter basis, that was down about $800 million. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. It\u2019s just under $26 billion. Greg Carmichael : Yes. And I would also note that the number of age-ended SNC credits increased on a linked quarter basis also. Frank Forrest : The other point on the \u2013 this comes up I think each quarter, I think the other point that percentage is a fairly high percentage. However, that portfolio has a better asset quality composition than our overall portfolio. It\u2019s predominantly investment grade, near investment grade has performed very, very well overall for us for a long period of time. We underwrite every loan for an account. We don\u2019t buy blind from anybody. We have senior bankers, most of which have come from the major money setter banks in the last two to three years both in credit and on the line and we underwrite every one of those credits that\u2019s on an account and therefore it\u2019s performing very, very well. John Pancari : Okay. And then lastly again apologies if I missed this and if I did, you can just give me a short answer. But can you just give us your updated comments around the manufacturing environment in your markets I know you had flagged some developing concerns in that area? Frank Forrest : Well, I will start with the second part of your question. And frankly, I do not see developing concerns at this point. In fact, the manufacturing sector continues to be very strong. The credit metrics of that profile continue to look like what we have seen over the past couple of years. They are generating high profits on a relative basis, historic basis, generating excess liquidity. I think that did lead to some of the decline in the utilization rates that we saw at the end of the quarter. I would tell you that in the southern part of our franchise, the Georgia\u2019s, Florida\u2019s and even into Florida to some extent, those markets look good as well as Michigan we began to see some recovery as well as North Carolina. John Pancari : Okay, great. Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open. Greg Carmichael : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. Okay, just with the expense guidance, but before we go there, what are your reserves for the energy loans? Frank Forrest : Hi, Mike, 4.75% currently and we continue to evaluate this on a quarterly basis. Mike Mayo : Okay. And you said, if oil stays low, you will have to increase those reserves, I guess what\u2019s the dollar amount if that\u2019s $1.7 billion times the 4.75%? Frank Forrest : Yes. Mike Mayo : So, how much might those reserves have to go up if oil stays at 30 or you are fine at 30 you are just talking lower? Frank Forrest : Yes. The reserves that we have in place today are based on the current condition of the portfolio. If it goes down to $25 for a sustained period of time, then those reserves will go up. I can\u2019t tell you at this point what number that will go up, because they are not correlated directly. But certainly, they would go up if we have a continued sustained decrease in oil, but that\u2019s based on where we are today, which is what we have to use for GAAP accounting. Mike Mayo : Okay. So, you are at least good today at $30. Frank Forrest : Yes, we are. Mike Mayo : Okay, good. Just how they feel better about the expense guidance? And maybe I want to make sure I have the numbers correct. So, 4.5% to 5% expense growth for 2016. So that would be about $180 million? Frank Forrest : Yes, I mean, you are in the ballpark. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then of that, you have $75 million for risk and compliance, $60 million for technologies, that\u2019s up to $135 million, FDIC, another $25 million, now we are up to $160 million, so most of it is for those factors? Greg Carmichael : And Mike that\u2019s $75 million, this is Greg, included the technology associated with the risk and compliance investments. Tayfun Tuzun : So, there is some overlap there. Greg Carmichael : Some overlap there. Tayfun Tuzun : But when you add up those numbers, those are very big numbers that you can see in most of that growth guidance, Mike. So, I mean, I guess what we are telling you is that we clearly are looking for efficiencies elsewhere in order to be able to fund some of these investments. Mike Mayo : Okay. So, $75 million for risk, compliance and technology? Tayfun Tuzun : $75 million includes the technology portion of risk and compliance. On top of that, we have additional non-risk and compliance strategic investments. So, $75 million is just -- the total \u2013 the $75 million is the increase related to total expenses in risk and compliance, compensation plus technology. Mike Mayo : And the non-risk strategic investment expense delta is what again? Tayfun Tuzun : We expect our IT expenses to go up by 25%, which is roughly $60 million, so the difference would be everything else that we do. Mike Mayo : Okay. So, if we still get to most of that, so non-risk strategic investments are $60 million, tech for risk and compliance, $75 million and FDIC assessment, net $25 million? Greg Carmichael : No, I just want to clarify this. Total expenses related to risk and compliance, which includes compensation and IT, is about $75 million. Total increase in IT is roughly, let\u2019s say, $60 million, $65 million. Of that, there is a portion of those already in risk and compliance, which is roughly I think if I am not mistaken, $20 million type. So, there is another $40 million in IT in addition to the $20 million that goes to risk, which adds up to the $60 million type increase in IT expenses in the year. Mike Mayo : Okay, so $75 million plus $40 million plus $25 million? Greg Carmichael : And then the $25 million is the FDIC related. And then also there is some expected numbers around the early retirement that we have included in our guidance. So, when you add them all up and that\u2019s why we are optimistic about the beyond 2016 growth because some of \u2013 a number of those will not show up as a year-over-year increase once we get to the end of 2016. Mike Mayo : Okay. So, then your revenue guidance, I guess you are guiding for negative operating leverage here just I guess 4% to 5% higher core fees, but only slightly higher NII if rates don\u2019t go up, so...? Greg Carmichael : We are not guiding to operating leverage if rates don\u2019t go up. Mike Mayo : So I guess \u2013 I have just moved the lens back a little bit, so Greg you are new CEO and you have a chance to put your imprint on the organization and you are coming in there and you are spending a lot of money and this isn\u2019t unique just to Fifth Third, I mean you have other banks that absorb these higher expenses and still at least try to get positive operating leverage, I know maybe you see a great opportunity for 2 or 3 years out and you say, hey it\u2019s worth having this negative operating leverage upfront to have even better positive operating leverage down the road, but how do you reconcile the idea that other banks have similar expenses, but aren\u2019t guiding for this degree of negative operating leverage if rates don\u2019t go up with the idea of hey you are a new CEO, you see some unique opportunities down the road, it\u2019s worth it? Greg Carmichael : Mike, I would really as we said before this is a transition. We do see those unique opportunities and we know how to implement technology. Every investment we are making in technology and when you just heard the numbers, we are really focused on either driving efficiencies that we are going to get paid for in short order, a whole branch digitalization or new mortgage loan platform, mobile enhancements fraud detection, those type of things we are going to get paid for in 2017. In addition to that, the focus on driving revenue, revenue in the near-term that will materialize as we go through into 2016 and into 2017, a very meaningful to the health of our business. And then on the compliance side of the house, we have to make those investments and that really gets focused on the quality of everything we do and we should see the benefit of that as I mentioned earlier, we expect to lower legal reserves, lower operational losses that we absolutely are expecting a little model wind to 2017 as we move into those years. But they are extremely important investments. We are going to make those investments, it is transformational and we will get paid well for those. And as we move into 2017, you will see those outcomes. Tayfun Tuzun : And Mike, I also want to remind you I have mentioned this during my script, about $30 million of that expense increase is related to the increased amortization in our low income housing investments, so you need to add that as well. Mike Mayo : That\u2019s helpful. Last follow-up, so for looking to 2017 for like the really nice payback, what metric can you hold out there saying, hey this is really what we are looking for either in 2017, by the end of 2017? Greg Carmichael : So look, I mean I think again if the world plays out the way we laid it out, we would expect to exit 2016 in the low-60s type efficiency ratio. So assuming that we are correct, that we can actually hit the peaks in a number of these large expense items throughout 2017, we have a good chance to take the efficiency ratio down even further from that. Mike Mayo : Alright. Thank you. Greg Carmichael : Thank you, Mike. Operator : The final question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Hey guys. Just one quick one on the NIM outlook, you mentioned you get a couple of \u2013 you get more help from the initial fee hike than from the offsetting factors and I am just wondering the offsetting factors, what are you just continuing to see from either book rollover or spread compression and at what point do you just expect that to kind of normalize out where if we got future hikes, we would see the incremental benefits for the NIM? Thanks. Jamie Leonard : Ken, it\u2019s Jamie. I would tell you as Tayfun laid out in his prepared remarks, we would certainly have assets into the balance sheet that is benefited by the rate hike in December as well as the future moves we are forecasting. There are a couple of macro factors as well as several idiosyncratic factors that create headwinds for us in that environment. The macro factors is you touched on, the pricing pressures in this low rate environment with new productions coming in on the sheet, less than on yields on the pay-down and payoffs and then you have the impact of the Fed stock dividend reduction. And I think those factors are impacting everybody. For Fifth Third specifically, as Lars touched on, you have C&I loan yield compression from this remixing as we are focused on disciplined growth and a better credit profile of client and that compression should dissipate in the back half of \u201916. And then you have for us also early access, continued attrition as we are not enrolling new customers. And then as Tayfun touched on, our outlook and the auto book production declined. We did about $5 billion this year. We expect that number to be around $3 billion in 2016. And then finally on the funding side, what we baked into our NII outlook is to have a pretty dynamic year on the funding side and with about $2.5 billion in maturities with 3-year issuances that are currently around 1% interest rate, our outlook assumes that we go out a little bit longer term and better position the company from a funding profile for 2017 and beyond. So all of those items are baked into that NII outlook and with all that said we still expect NII to grow 2% to 3% in 2016. Ken Usdin : Got it. Alright. Thanks for that. Greg Carmichael : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Scott, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2016 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Sameer Gokhale, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Sameer Shripad Gokhale - Head of Investor Relations : Thank you, Scott. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the first quarter of 2016. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I'm joined on the call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and our Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up to questions. As a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We'll do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg. Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Sameer, and thanks all of you for joining us this morning. Today, we reported first quarter net income to common shareholders of $312 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.40. We had some non-core items that added $0.03 to earnings per share in the quarter. Our Q1 results were solid, especially considering the market volatility we experienced during the quarter. Fee income levels, including capital market fees, were stronger despite market disruptions. As you know, we have been building out our capital markets capabilities for the last few years. We're seeing our investments pay off. During the quarter, we closed on the largest M&A deal in the history of our company. Net interest income was also stronger than expected. We benefited from low deposit betas following the December rate hike and expect to continue to manage deposit rates tightly. Given the outlook for rate, we should continue to benefit from our steady and cautious strategy with respect to rate risk management. We remain focused on executing our defined strategies. We closed on the sale of the branches in St. Louis, which resulted in an $8 million pre-tax gain. In addition, we expect to close on the sale of the Pittsburgh branches. We continue to rationalize our branch network and are on track to deliver $60 million in annual expense savings related to these reductions. We're introducing new products and services. Our new Express Banking product, for example, received high accolades throughout directly from the CFPB. Since we launched this product in November of 2015, we have opened more than 65,000 new customer accounts. Our ongoing investments in digital technology continue to accelerate our growth rate in mobile banking. In 2015, our growth of mobile users exceeded the industry average and even accelerated, while the rest of our industry experienced a slowdown. In the first quarter, over 70% (sic) [17%] of our deposit transactions were executed via mobile devices, compared with 12% in the first quarter of 2012 (sic) [2015]. In addition, we doubled the number of checking accounts that were opened online from a year ago. During the quarter, we implemented an early retirement program. This program resulted in a $14 million one-time expense that will generate $9 million in annual cost savings. We'll continue to look for more efficient ways to operate our company. Achieving operating leverage is our top priority and we're making progress toward that goal. Our expenses, net of one-timers, were up 2% sequentially, partly reflecting the seasonal increase in FICA and unemployment insurance. While we are investing in our company, we are very focused on controlling expenses across all of our operations. We now believe that our expense growth in 2016 will be lower than we had originally expected. Tayfun will provide more details and an update on our outlook in his comments. As we shared with you in January, we are pursuing with several strategic initiatives to improve revenue growth, generate cost efficiencies and improve service quality. We remain on track and intend to share our progress with you as the year continues to unfold. While in 2015 we discussed our efforts to reduce our risk exposures, as of March 31 our loans to commodity traders were down to $241 million. That's down by more than 50% from the peak. On energy, oil prices did rebound off lows, but the sector remains under stress. Our balances were stable from the fourth quarter at $1.7 billion. As expected, we saw continued deterioration in the book. Energy NPLs were $168 million higher from the last quarter, but they represented the bulk of the total NPL increase during the quarter. The loans that moved into the NPL category were predominantly reserve-based loans. As these loans are generally well collateralized, (05:29) we do not expect a similar increase in net charge-offs. At the end of the first quarter, we only had $294 million in loans due to higher risk oilfield services companies. We held reserves of 6.2% against our total energy portfolio and we believe these reserves are more than appropriate. Our capital levels remain strong, with common equity Tier 1 of 9.8%. Our earnings contributed to a tangible book value of $16.32 per share, which was up 5% from last quarter and up 9% over last year. During the quarter, we also announced a share repurchase of $240 million of our common stock which settled on April 11 to retire approximately 14.5 million shares. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter operating results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financials summary on page four of the presentation. For the first quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $312 million or $0.40 per diluted share. There was a net benefit in the quarter of $0.03 per share, resulting from the gains on the Vantiv warrant and the branch sales, offset partially by the cost of the voluntary retirement program. We are pleased with the results, especially given challenging market conditions during the quarter. So let's move to the average balance sheet on page 5 of the presentation. Average commercial loan balances were relatively flat sequentially, but up about 5% year-over-year. Our end-of-period balances were up by $1.5 billion or 3% sequentially. The decline in average balances was partly due to higher pay-downs and delays in closings at the very end of last year. We experienced healthy activity in the latter half of the first quarter. Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and up 1% year-over-year. Residential mortgage loans grew by 2% sequentially as we continue to portfolio only jumbo mortgages and ARMs, and up 11% year-over-year. Indirect auto loans are down 3% from last quarter and 5% year-over-year, in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving returns in this business. The return profile of our first quarter production was one of the best in the last few years within the super prime market that we mainly focus on. Average investment securities increased by $317 million in the first quarter or 1% sequentially. Average core deposits decreased $1 billion from the fourth quarter. This decrease was driven by seasonally lower demand deposits, partially offset by higher interest checking balances. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 118% at the end of the quarter. Moving to NII on page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $5 million sequentially to $909 million, despite the negative day count impact. The increase was primarily driven by improvement in variable rate loan yields due to the increase in the Fed funds rate in December, with deposit betas remaining at low levels. Quarter-over-quarter, our earning asset yield increased by 8 basis points (sic) [10 basis points], accompanied by a 3-basis-point increase in cost of interest-bearing liabilities. These benefits were partially offset by the effect of a reduced Fed stock dividend payment and continued spread compression from the mix shift to lower-yielding higher-quality credits, which we've discussed previously. NII also benefited from the timing of the investments in the portfolio as cash flows were invested earlier in the quarter and the late debt issuance during the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our NII growth over last quarter and the 7% growth year-over-year. NIM improved 6 basis points to 2.91% quarter-over-quarter. Shifting to fees on page 7 of the presentation. First quarter non-interest income was $637 million, compared with $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our fee income, adjusted primarily for Vantiv-related items and the annual $31 million TRA payment in the fourth quarter, was $578 million, a decrease of $14 million or 2% sequentially. Despite seasonal headwinds and challenging market conditions, our results were strong. Corporate banking fees of $102 million were relatively flat sequentially and, adjusted for the write-down of a residual lease in the first quarter of 2015, were up 10% year-over-year. As we mentioned in January, corporate banking fees are seasonally lower in the first quarter and overall market conditions were weak during the quarter. So our performance was strong despite the challenging backdrop. Mortgage banking net revenue of $78 million was up $4 million sequentially. Originations were $1.8 billion in the first quarter, with 46% of the mix consisting of purchase volume. About 75% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels, and the remainder came through the correspondent channel. Gain on sale margins were up 57 basis points sequentially to 347 basis points, and net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $16 million, similar to last quarter. Deposit service charges decreased 5% from the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonal trends in consumer deposit fees, and increased 1% relative to the first quarter of 2015. Total investment advisory revenue of $102 million was flat sequentially, mostly reflecting weaker equity market activity during the quarter. This impact was offset by seasonally higher trust tax preparation fees. Excluding certain one-time items, our year-over-year revenue growth reached nearly 5%, a very good outcome in a challenging environment. Next, I'd like to discuss non-interest expense in page 8 of the presentation. Expenses were $986 million, compared with $963 million in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase was partly due to seasonally higher FICA and unemployment insurance expense, and a $14 million expense related to the voluntary early retirement program. The early retirement program was well received by our employees and approximately 160 employees participated. As a result, we expect a $9 million decrease in annual compensation expenses. As Greg said earlier, we continue to look for other similar opportunities to improve our expense run rate. I will provide an update on our expense outlook a little later. Turning to credit results on slide 9. Net charge-offs were $96 million or 42 basis points in the first quarter, compared to $80 million and 34 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2015, and $91 million and 41 basis points in the first quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was due to a $16 million increase in C&I net charge-offs. Of the total net charge-offs, $9 million were in energy. Non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased $195 million from the previous quarter to $701 million, resulting in an NPL ratio of 75 basis points. Commercial NPLs increased $202 million from the fourth quarter, driven by $168 million in energy NPLs. Consumer NPLs declined by $7 million sequentially. Overall, credit conditions, excluding energy, remained within our expectations. Consumer credit continues to improve and commercial credit, excluding energy, is stable. Our provision was $23 million higher than the total charge-offs in the first quarter and our reserve coverage moved up 1 basis point to 1.38% of loans and leases. It is important to note, as Greg mentioned, that an increase in energy NPLs should not necessarily translate into an increase in charge-offs of the same magnitude. This is because the majority of energy NPLs are well collateralized and consist of reserve-based loans. On slide 10, we have provided a breakdown of our energy portfolio. Our energy-related loans at the end of the quarter were $1.7 billion with total commitments of $4 billion. As you can see, our loans to oilfield services companies were only $294 million or 17% of our total energy loans outstanding and leaves only $170 million in unused commitments. We believe that we are appropriately reserved for losses in the energy portfolio based on detailed stress analysis that our teams continue to update, not only on the oilfield services portfolio, but also on our reserve-based loans. Based on detailed analysis, we believe that our energy reserves, which are currently at 6.2%, up from 4.8% at the end of last year, are adequate. Our stress case scenario over a nine-quarter period assumes that oil prices will be at $20 in 2016 and $25 in 2017. This stress scenario would add approximately $50 million to $60 million in net charge-offs over and above our current reserves. On slide 11, we provide a breakdown of our commercial real estate portfolio. It is important to note that our commercial real estate business today is much different than what we had pre-crisis. At the end of 2007, 21% of our total loans and leases were in commercial real estate. Today, we are at 11% below our peer levels. At the end of 2007, over 40% of our non-owner occupied exposure was in land and residential development. Today, that exposure is slightly above 4%. As you can see, our non-performing assets continued to decrease both within the commercial mortgage and commercial construction portfolios. At the end of the first quarter, NPAs in our commercial mortgage portfolio decreased to 1.84% from 2.56% a year earlier. NPAs in our commercial construction portfolio decreased to 23 basis points from 67 basis points over the same period. During the last two years, we significantly upgraded our credit resources in commercial mortgage and construction underwriting, which increased our focus on fine selection, geographical diversity and multi-factor stress analysis. Moving on to capital on slide 12. Our capital levels remained strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.8%, an increase of 30 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the first quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately 15 million. During the quarter, we announced and settled a common stock repurchase of $240 million and reduced the first quarter share count by 14.5 million shares. Now moving to outlook. The drivers of our overall outlook remain unchanged. We expect year-over-year commercial loan growth to exceed 3% and the consumer loan portfolio to decline. The decline of our consumer loan portfolio will primarily reflect lower auto loan originations, as we had previously discussed, and includes the impact of the sales associated with the St. Louis and Pittsburgh transactions. Our interest rate outlook now has only one rate increase in June as opposed to the two increases that we had in our original base case. For the second quarter, we would expect relatively stable net interest income compared with the first quarter, but despite one late rate increase, we still expect a 2.5% to 3% increase in NII year-over-year. In our base case, we would expect to see a 3-basis-point to 4-basis-point of NIM decline in the second quarter and then hold relatively steady in line with our results in 2015. Although deposit betas are expected to remain low, our outlook assumes incremental spread compression due to our continued emphasis on originating higher quality loans. This update improves upon our January guidance as it includes one less rate increase. Without a rate increase, we would expect NII to grow around 2%. Our overall fee income growth outlook is not changing. We expect to grow our fees between 4% and 5% on the 2015 base of $2.3 billion, which excludes Vantiv share and warrant gains that we had during the year. We are lowering our year-over-year expense outlook from 4.5% to 5% to the 4% to 4.25% range. We believe that our intense focus on expense control will result in an improvement in our operating efficiency compared to our January expectations. The quarterly run rate will increase from the first quarter levels and this will reflect seasonality and the timing of implementation of strategic initiatives, but we will have better year-over-year results than originally expected. Our second quarter results will also include a one-time approximately $10 million expense as a result of retirement eligibility changes related to long-term incentive compensation. These changes will align our retirement eligibility provisions with our peer group. This is just a change in the timing of the recognition of expenses and would lower our expense going forward. We continue to monitor our energy exposures closely. It is likely that we will see higher charge-offs in this portfolio, primarily in the oilfield services sector. Given the relatively modest size of our exposure, future credit losses should be manageable. Credit losses, ex energy, should remain in range, with some potential variability quarter-to-quarter due to the historically low-level of current charge-offs. With that, let me open the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thanks a lot. Tayfun, I was wondering if you could just follow-up a little bit more on the credit outlook. You mentioned that \u2013 we saw a big boost in the NPAs. You don't expect to see a lot more necessarily on the energy losses. But can you just flush out your confidence in seeing the benign underneath? And if you can just parse out the portfolios what you're expecting in kind of commercial ex energy and on the consumer side? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Frank is here. Frank's going to answer that question. Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer : Hey. Good question. Thank you, Ken. As we reported, non-performing assets are up in the quarter, almost all of that is energy-related, 90%-plus is energy-related. It's all tied to reserve-based lending loans, seven (21:57) loans. We feel very confident at this point that those loans are protected by the risk-adjusted collateral coverage that we have in place. All borrowers in the segment that are on NPL that were just moved are current. I think that's important. The regulators, as you've probably heard on other earnings calls, have taken a much stricter view of how they are classifying these loans from an accounting perspective. They are looking to cover both the first and the second lien positions on these companies. In our case, we have a super secured first lien position, and we've gone through a very detailed portfolio analysis of bottoms-up of all of our energy book to ensure that from a borrowing base perspective we're well secured. So NPLs are up. However, it's in a segment that's very well protected from a collateral position both historically and based on our current outlook. We could see additional deterioration from an energy perspective in NPL given that in the future, as Tayfun indicated. But we are not changing our outlook on overall credit losses. Beyond that, when you look at the rest of the portfolio, we've talked this morning about commercial real estate, and we feel very good about that book. The performance is holding up very well. We have very little exposure in commercial real estate in the energy states. We have four multi-family credits that are in Houston, two of which are stabilized, the other two are performing under construction according to the terms that we've set. And we have some exposure in Denver from a commercial real estate perspective, but that market has held up very well, that being in an energy sector. So the overall commercial real estate book at this point is performing to our expectations. Our middle market book is performing very well. We're showing very strong performance in most of our core markets. We're not concerned there. Our leverage book is stable. We'll have some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in leverage, but overall it's performing to our expectations as well. So I hope that was responsive to your question. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : It was. Thanks. And there's one quick follow-up. Tayfun, you'd previously talked about building reserves this year more reflecting loan growth. Is that also a reasonable expectation? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Again, we will have to look at the reserve situation on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Obviously, we did say that reserve releases are very unlikely and, by the end of the year, our provisioning will reflect loan growth ultimately. But that's a quarter-by-quarter analysis that we will share with you. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR & Company. Your line is open. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Yeah. Thank you very much. On your energy credits, have you seen any deterioration in any of your CRE markets associated with your energy? Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer : Hey. This is Frank. Let me speak to that. You're talking about non-energy credits that are... Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Yes, just the second derivative. A lot of people worry about the CRE markets and I guess other second derivatives to the energy market where a lot of people have claimed that a lot of the growth is coming out of the energy markets. So I was wondering if you saw any of the deterioration in some of these markets outside of energy that were related to energy? Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer : Yeah. One thing to keep in mind, we're really not a Southwest bank. We don't have a retail presence in the Southwest. We do other business there. Our commercial books held up very well. We don't see any deterioration from a traditional, commercial middle market or mid-cap perspective. I just talked about real estate. Again, in Texas, we just had four transactions, $100 million in total exposure, multi-family, through national developers. We see no problems there. If you switch over to indirect, we have about $1.5 billion in the energy states in indirect exposure, which is 4% of our total indirect... Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's indirect auto loan. Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer : Indirect. And so it's a $1.5 billion in total indirect exposure \u2013 in consumer exposure and the vast majority of that is in indirect auto loans. We've seen some uptick in past dues in that book. We've cut off a number of dealer relationships in Texas in order to pull in and shrink back that exposure. But, overall, we feel good about the consumer indirect book in Texas. Other than that, we really don't have any substantial consumer exposure in the energy states. So, again, our focus has been, and if you ask for concerns, it would be around what we have in real estate, but it's small and it's well managed, and on the indirect and the direct piece of consumer, it's 4% of our portfolio. Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.: Thank you very much, gentlemen. Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer : Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open. Stephen Moss - Evercore ISI : Good morning. It's actually Steve Moss in for John. Wondering on with regard to the mix shift on loans going to lower yielding, higher quality loans. Wondering if you could just quantify what you're thinking about the impact to loan yields over the course of the year. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's going to be a function of basically the payoffs and originations. Originations are clearly coming at the upper end of our credit spectrum. In March, for example, when we looked at our commercial originations, the average grades were sort of very close to the investment grade spectrum in our underwriting. Largely, the timing of the impact on margin will also depend on the payoffs from the lower-end of the spectrum, and that's a little bit tough to quantify. We will quantify that for you each quarter as the quarter goes by, but it's a fairly steady type of tightening at this point. James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. And one thing on our NIM outlook for the second quarter that's embedded in that is that, C&I yield, the expectation would be down a couple of basis points as a result of that loan yield compression as we continue to transition to a higher credit profile client... Stephen Moss - Evercore ISI : Okay. And also you mentioned improved profitability in the auto loan book here this quarter. I'm just kind of wondering where you're originating those, at what yields are you originating those loans this quarter and what were your total originations? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, in terms of the spreads, the spreads this quarter were a good 25 basis points, 30 basis points above what we've seen over the past number of quarters. But I just want to remind you that that was a very deliberate decision on our part to lower our annual originations to roughly $3 billion from $5 billion, which enabled us to focus on profitability rather than volume. Our auto business is a national business, that has not changed. The geographic distribution of originations is roughly about the same, except for what Frank mentioned earlier. The spreads have widened, the credit quality remains the same. So we're getting more return on the same type of capital allocation for the loans that we are originating. James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. And on the first quarter origination levels, it was a little bit ahead of $900 million or so and that was a little bit ahead of our expectations, frankly, given the pricing changes and the yields you've seen. So our outlook has increased the originations from about $3 billion at the end of the year to about $3.3 billion for this year, and I think you'll see yield expansion in the second quarter in that book. Stephen Moss - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Long from Raymond James. Your line is open. David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Just shifting gears here to the mortgage business. And a few weeks into the quarter here, can you give us some color on what the pipeline looks like and maybe what gain on sales spreads look like right now? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Pipeline looks good. I mean, obviously, the rates have stayed under 4% for most of the first quarter. It's a little early to make a comment on spreads for the quarter. Obviously, Q1 spreads were wider. We'll just have to wait a little longer to get a firmer perspective on gain on sales spreads for this quarter. David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just the second question that I had regarding the effective tax rate that's moved around a bit with the Vantiv-related transactions. Any color on how we can expect that to move here for the rest of the year? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I mean, I think actually the tax rate came in pretty close to where we expected for the year. We're going to be close to these numbers probably within sort of a 0.5 percentage level-ish. It really is no different than what we expected going into the year. David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Matt. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Matt. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on the margin guidance, Tayfun. You mentioned about the effect of the lower loan yields. Can you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about reinvestment yields with the 10-year treasury still visibly below 2%? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Jamie, why don't you take that? James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Right now, you saw on our book, at the beginning of the quarter, January, February, we reinvested some cash flows because we saw a little bit better entry point there and then you saw we lightened on an end-of-period basis on the investment portfolio as we closed out the quarter. So, frankly, if rates were to stay at these pretty low levels, you could expect from us just to reinvest cash flows because the entry points don't look real good. But if rates were to have a little bit of a sell-up here and present more opportunity, then you would expect our investment portfolio to grow in line with earning assets. But I don't think you'll see a lot of movement in the book one way or the other throughout 2016. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Remember, when we were building for LCR, Matt, in the last two years, there was quite a bit more movement in the size of the portfolio. But, looking out now, it's going to be a steadier direction. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And then, if I can just follow-up on a energy-related question, I'm curious in terms of the \u2013 it looks like the overall outstanding balance hasn't really changed much quarter-over-quarter. Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer : Correct. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : But within that, are you seeing loan pay-downs or other types of cash flow in from those borrowers that is offsetting some potential draw-downs from other clients? Lars C. Anderson - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, overall \u2013 and this is Lars. We've seen pretty steady balances on an overall basis in that portfolio as we continue to work through with our clients. What we did see in this past quarter was commitment levels declined, as we've repositioned and reduced our exposure level to a number of names. Accordingly, utilization rates moved up a little bit. But, frankly, we would expect that those overall balances committed and loan balances would come down over a period of time as the clients that we continue to work with very closely continue to sell off core, non-core assets, access the equity capital and debt capital markets and reduce their profile. But this is a great long-term business. We've got some expert bankers and we're working very closely with our clients. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then, just finally on the auto loan portfolio, you mentioned you're focused on prime and maybe even super prime in that portfolio. Doesn't look like from the 90-day past due volumes that that's changed very much. But can you just confirm that the asset quality in that portfolio really hasn't deteriorated much over the past 6 months to 12 months? Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer : This is Frank. It has not. We have not changed our position at all. We're predominantly a super prime lender to the top dealers and it continues to perform very well to our expectations. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open. Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. I just wanted to ask about operating leverage. You said operating leverage is a priority. But then we see expenses up in the first quarter. The efficiency ratio got worse quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. You're still \u2013 your expense guidance is lower than before, but it's still over 4%. And you had closed, I guess, two-thirds of your 100 targeted branches as of last quarter. So I'm just seeing a disconnect between some of the words. It's a priority, you're closing branches, and the result, expense is still growing faster than revenues. So I guess my question is, why do you still have expense growth over 4% in a revenue environment that seems pretty soft? And when will we see the benefits of those branch closings? Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer : Mike, this is Greg. Thanks for the question. First off, we are focused on, once again, continuing to rationalize all of our expenses. The branch closures that we announced last year, we should be completely through. We have already sold the Pittsburgh \u2013 or the St. Louis. We'll close on Pittsburgh this week. We expect to be through that exercise by middle of this year. And we're still on target for that $60 million annualized improvement on the branches. We also \u2013 as I mentioned before, we offered a early retirement program. We are very focused on expense management, but we're also focused on making the strategic investments that we have to make going forward, that we hope and we anticipate will continue to drive revenue, improve our operating efficiencies, improve our service quality. We've got to make those investments. We want to do this at the best price points. So we're even sharpening the pencil closely on how we spend that money to make sure we get the return we're looking for. We're very much focused on the execution of those initiatives and drive into the outcomes. So, going forward, we've guided lower on the expenses that we initially anticipated for this year, albeit still at 4%. We need to be lower than that obviously. We need to create positive operating leverage and that's what we're focused on. And hopefully, as we go into latter parts of this year, we'll turn the corner to positive operating leverage. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And Mike, remember, first quarter has, compared to the fourth quarter, $25 million, $26 million higher just in two line-items, which is FICA and unemployment insurance. So the first quarter typically is going to be a higher efficiency ratio quarter compared to Q4. But, as Greg said and he's been talking about this for a couple of quarters now, there's quite a bit of focus on taking out expenses from operations, so that we can reinvest back in the company. So our outlook \u2013 we believe that we will do better than what we've told you in January. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Yeah, that's helpful. Just one follow-up. Greg, I'm just curious about your style, I mean, as a new CEO, you start in the position and expenses are still growing faster than many of your peers. On the one hand, if you wind up with negative operating leverage a year or two from now, we're all going to be saying, wow, you should have not grown expenses that quickly. On the other hand, if some of your investments pay off, then we're going to say, wow, this was really forward-looking on your behalf. So can you talk about your style in terms of this spending for future gains, the risks and the opportunities as you think about it in your mind? Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer : Mike, first off, as I mentioned before, we have to make the investments to reposition the bank for the realities that we're operating in. And we're going to be in this low rate environment we believe for some period of time. We've got to focus on generating quality revenues with the right partnerships and we also have to focus on making sure that we have efficiencies in our organization. If you go back and look at our operation cost, we're running our central operations less than we did in 2007 at a much higher volume rate than we were in 2007. We have a good history of managing expenses in this organization, and we'll continue that history going forward. But we have to invest to re-platform our infrastructure, which we're doing, and we'll get paid well for that. We're pruning back and leaving back our distribution channels, as we mentioned before, around branches. We're moving to digital and on capabilities for our customers which will reduce our back-office cost, re-platforming our retail platform, our mortgage platform, which would be significantly more efficient going forward. We've got to get paid for those investments. So it's not lost upon me at the end of the day that we're making commitments. We've got to get the return on those commitments to the bottom-line of the company, and that's what we're focused on. We've mentioned that and I mentioned before that this year is a transformational year to make those investments, but we've got to get paid for them. So my style is this, is execution, getting it done and making the commitments that we made to the organization, our shareholders and our investors, and we're going to do just that. So, that's what we're focused on. Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from Sterne Agee. Your line is open. Peter J. Winter - Sterne Agee CRT : Good morning. Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Peter. Peter J. Winter - Sterne Agee CRT : I'm just curious how far through are you in terms of the mix shift to higher quality loans. And then, secondly, with this mixed shift, how do you think about through a cycle where your net charge-offs would be in a range versus historically? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So it's difficult to tell you exactly where we are in terms of the de-risking or repositioning of our balance sheet, and part of that is that we have a changing economic environment, interest environment, economic environment. But I would tell you that we continue to stay focused on it every single day. We're reallocating our resources to the businesses that best fit not just our risk appetite, but also produce the best returns for our shareholders over a long period of time. One of the keys here is not just, of course, to achieve the highest returns, but also position this balance sheet and our loan portfolio so that it'll outperform through the future cycles, which I think leads to the second part of your question, which Frank may want to have a comment on. Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer : Your question regarding loss, I mean our normal range is 30 basis points to 50 basis points of loss. We've performed to that number over the last several years. We've had some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter, but if you look at year-over-year performance, we've stayed within that range, and that's where we expect to be this year. As Lars said, we are really intently focused on managing credit really well through the cycle. And so we are looking at investing in businesses that we believe will do that. We're growing our asset-based lending business. We're growing our leasing business. But we're pulling back a bit on our leverage business. Those are all conscious decisions to ensure we have the appropriate risk and return in balance that will provide good returns and consistent performance through any cycle as we go forward. Peter J. Winter - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay. But so wouldn't it lower it through a normal cycle, just given this change that you're going through? Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer : Well, it should. Over an extended period of time, it should. But where we sit today, is we're managing what we have currently on the books, and currently, how we're managing the energy book. It's small relative to the overall size of our company at less than 2% of our outstandings, but we're in a choppy environment. Our performance overall is still I think very good and our outlook for this year is continue to be consistent. We haven't changed our outlook where charge-offs are. Lars C. Anderson - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I mean, I think, also just on an absolute basis, yes everything else being equal. But if the environment changes and we sort of get to the other side of this credit cycle, it is our expectation and belief that by doing what we are doing, de-risking the business, our credit performance relative to the industry should be better. That doesn't necessarily mean that at absolute levels it will stay, but relative to the credit cycles, we will do better. Peter J. Winter - Sterne Agee CRT : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. It looks like the Vantiv stock price, almost feels like every day it's setting new highs and the Fifth Third stock price isn't. So what is the strategic rationale for still holding the Vantiv stake and how strategically and financially do you think about whether it makes sense to exit that versus whether it makes sense to continue to hold it? Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer : This is Greg. First off, obviously, Vantiv has done extremely well and we're proud to have our ownership position that we have in that company. We've been very thoughtful over the last three years in how we monetize that position. I think the returns to our shareholders have been outstanding. We're going to continue to watch that company. We're going to continue to assess the value of their equity and their forward opportunities, strategically what they have in front of them and their opportunities, and we're going to make the best decision for our shareholders going forward with respect to how we continue to monetize our position. Consistently we've done that each year. We anticipate to continue that same path. To what extent and at what time, well, it really gets back to looking at the factors I just discussed, which is our long-term thoughts and projections on what they're going to be able to perform at and how we're performing, and we'll continue to monetize that position over time. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : But in terms of how you think about it now, is it purely a financial calculation around how you maximize the returns to Fifth Third or is there any kind of strategic benefit in having a stake at all? Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think, Geoff, we don't have trigger points where we feel that we are forced to take action. We look at that sector, the drivers of performance in that sector. We look at performance of drivers in the banking sector. We look at Vantiv's opportunities strategically. So it is really a multi-factor analysis that we go through and try to make the same type of decisions that we've made in the past for our shareholders. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Great. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy from Stephens. Your line is open. Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Terry. Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.: Greg, you were quoted in an article about Fifth Third early this week in your local newspaper talking about non-bank acquisitions, and I believe it mentioned smaller banks. I was wondering if you could expand upon your interest on the non-bank side as well as the small bank side. Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer : And we do have \u2013 and we continue to look at once again ways that we can continue to be a better partner and add value in our business. So, when you think about our payments area, we support obviously corporate strategy verticals like retail, healthcare and so forth. So, looking for opportunities in those sectors, we made a small investment in a company called Zipscene. We just made investment in another company called Transactis that was just recently announced. So those are the type of things I'm looking for. In addition to that, we're also looking for opportunities in the wealth management sector, insurance opportunities. That might make sense for us going forward as we continue to build out more capabilities in those sectors. So we're interested in where those opportunities lie, once again for the right value proposition, for the right long-term value for our shareholders, we're considering those. On the bank side of the house, as I mentioned in prior discussions, we're really focused on opportunities to be more relevant in the markets that we're in. And we can continue to build out a quality franchise in our higher growth markets like the Carolinas, Tennessee, Chicago markets. We're interested in when those opportunities materialize, that make sense for our shareholders, at the right price, at the right value proposition, we're going to continue to consider those also. Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.: And then just a follow-up question on the corporate banking line, you mentioned and then we saw that from the results are strong, first quarter despite where you normally see seasonality, how's the pipeline for 2Q and do you think that seasonality in terms of a quarter-over-quarter pickup in the second quarter will occur this year? Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer : No, we feel good about the pipeline, but I'll turn it over to Lars for some more color around the pipeline. Lars C. Anderson - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. So, if you break down corporate banking, you really look at the significant part of that capital markets where we really outperformed, and I think we outperformed the market. We're up 18% from the prior quarter. We're up on a common quarter basis also. And frankly, we grew almost every client solution and every product throughout our capital markets platform, other than corporate bond underwriting. Frankly, we're getting a lot of traction there. The pipeline is strong, it's strengthening. And a lot of that is because we're adding additional talent and capabilities. We're able to broaden current relationships and it's putting us into a position, frankly, to be more leaned left with a number of our clients. So I feel good about it over the long-term. But I think it's important to keep in mind that for capital markets, that the macroeconomic environment does have a significant impact quarter-to-quarter and it does tend to be a little bit of a lumpy fee income source. And we mean to diversify it, build it out, consistent with our relationship banking strategy. Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks, Lars. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Apologies if I am repeating something you said. Too many earnings calls going on at the same time, so we're trying to do the best we can. Just a couple of numbers on energy loans. What percentage are investment grade and what you have total NPLs on energy as of the first quarter? Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer : 52% of our core book is investment grade. Again, as we've talked about before, E&P loans make up 58% of our total portfolio. The vast majority of those are reserve-based lending loans, where we feel we're very well secured. We continue to be protected by our risk-adjusted collateral coverage. The issue we have is not there, the issue we have is on 17% of the portfolio which is oilfield services. And it's only on a third of that portfolio, where about $90 million where we have projected losses going forward. So it's a small book, 2% overall, and the portion that we're concerned about is 17% of that 2%, and only a third of that, if that makes sense. So we feel overall we're very well protected. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I'm presuming that's Frank who just spoke, right? Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer : Hey, this is Frank, yes. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yep. Frank, can you give me some numbers on just \u2013 I know you talked about NPAs' increase of $168 million. Could you give us a number what it was at the end of the quarter? Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer : On non-performing loans? Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, please. Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer : Yeah. We were just above the $180 million at the end of the quarter. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And switching now to Greg, going back to a question that was just asked, just a little more clarification on your interest and small bank acquisitions. Can you define small banks that are what size you're thinking about, for one? For second, Chicago, you've cited Southeast, whether Chicago fits into your interest better? Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer : Listen, we've got a good franchise in Chicago. There's opportunities to grow in that market. So we're being thoughtful about opportunities that may emerge in markets like Chicago and our other higher Mid-South (51:59) footprint opportunities. So we will consider those type of acquisitions. I don't want to put a size limit or opportunity out there on the size of the deal we do, but obviously there's going to be something we'll make sure that fit our franchise. This is something that we could execute well against. And once again, it gets back to the value preposition of that opportunity for our shareholders long-term. The market has not been favorable to recent deals that were announced, we're very mindful of that. We want to make sure we do the right deal at the right time for the right value preposition for our shareholders. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Gokhale, I turn the call back over to you. Sameer Shripad Gokhale - Head of Investor Relations : Okay. Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department and we'll be happy to assist you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Joana and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank's Q2 2016 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Sameer Gokhale, you may begin your conference. Sameer Shripad Gokhale : Thank you, Joana. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the second quarter of 2016. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I'm joined on the call by our CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up to questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Sameer, and thanks all of you for joining us this morning. As you can see on Page 3 of the presentation, we reported second quarter net income to common shareholders of $310 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.40. Some offsetting non-core items resulted in $0.01 negative impact to earnings per share in the quarter. Since I became CEO in November of 2015, I have reaffirmed the bank's key strategic priorities. These include growing fee revenue, streamlining processes to reduce expenses, and improving our customer experience, and investing for the future in order to deliver strong results through business cycles. I believe we have the right strategies in place, our second quarter financial results reflect the progress we are making towards those goals. Our Q2 results were solid especially considering the market volatility we experienced during the quarter. In addition, we were very pleased with the credit results. Fee income levels including corporate banking fees were also strong. As you know, we have been building out our capital markets capabilities for the last few years. We recently hired a team to further expand our M&A and strategic advisory services. Our investments are paying off as we continue to gain market share with our expanded set of differentiated products and services. Also our mortgage volume of $2.7 billion was up 53% sequentially. This represent the highest level since the third quarter of 2013. Net interest income was relatively stable in Q2 which was in line with our expectations and guidance and our results reflect growth in commercial loans of 2% and 1% growth in security balances along with disciplined loan pricing in targeted relationship management. Origination yields in our auto loan business improved compared to Q1 reflecting our decision to originate loans more expectedly in that business. Also as we had mentioned previously, we have been managing deposit rates tightly and we expect that to continue in this environment. We have planned on managing through the extended period of low interest rates with the follow-up from Brexit we are even more confident that that was the right approach. We have been very deliberate about growing fee revenue in order to mitigate the impact of lower interest rates. We have continued to maintain a steady and cautious strategy with respect to rate risk. Given our focus on outperformers in the cycle, we are better positioned to address market volatility and economic uncertainty at any point to bank's recent history. We remain focused on executing our strategies and continue to make significant progress. We recently closed on the sale to branches in Pennsylvania which resulted in $11 million pre-tax gain. As the consumer landscape evolves, we will continue to look for more opportunities to optimize our branch network. We are also making investments to enhance our digital and operational capabilities. For example, we recently hired Melissa Stevens as our Chief Digital Officer and Head of Omni-channel Banking and Steve D'Amico as Head of Innovation. Our investments in digital channel are paying off. In the second quarter approximately 20% of consumer deposits were made via our mobile app compared to 60% a year ago. In general, we have seen a 20% increase in mobile usage year-over-year. We also saw a 135% increase in year-over-year in checking and savings accounts opened online. We expect our investments to drive higher digital adoption and create a more integrated customer experience. Also in the quarter, we sold a small non-strategic agented credit card portfolio at a 12% premium. This allows us to continue focus our energies on our core credit card business. As you may have seen, we recently signed an agreement with a third- party to help consolidate our residential mortgage loan systems under one platform. This initiative will help streamline our mortgage processes and operations and improve customer closure times and significantly improve the overall customer experience. As we previously disclosed, we expect this investment to generate a full run rate benefit of $12 million annually. The strategic initiatives we shared with you in April are on track. We are actually implementing them in a more cost effective manner than we had initially projected. As a result of our strong execution and focus on expense management, we now expect year-over-year expense growth of 4% in 2016 compared to our guidance of 4.5% to 5% at the start of this year. Over time, as we realize the benefits of implementing these initiatives, we would expect annual expense growth to be well below 4%. The continued execution of our key initiatives will also support our longer range targets including a 12% to 14% core ROTCE ratio and a 1.1% to 1.3% ROA ratio. Finally, we recently entered into a couple of significant transactions with Vantiv. First we extend our process agreement with Vantiv through 2024. This agreement was previously set to expire in June of 2019. We are pleased with our new agreement as it would generate a meaningful level of revenue benefits and cost savings from the second half of 2016 onward. In addition, we entered into another agreement with Vantiv related to our roughly $800 million of existing TRA cash flows. We terminated and settled certain cash flows totaling $331 million over 18 years for an upfront payment of $116 million. We also have the option to terminate and settle another $394 million of future cash flows at pre-specified amounts through the end of 2018. I am pleased that we have reached this agreement that reduces future risk and enables us to monetize and redeploy that capital. Tayfun will provide further detail in his commentary. We have discussed our efforts to reduce our risk exposures as a necessary aspect of delivering consistent returns through the cycle. As of June 30, our exposure to companies in the UK and other European countries represent less than 2% of our total loans. It consisted mostly of exposure to large global businesses that are well diversified. Leading up to the Brexit vote, we engaged with our clients to assess any potential impact on our business. As a result, we reduced our direct exposure in advance to the vote. Therefore we believe our exposure to any fall from Brexit should be limited. In terms of our exposure to the energy sector, we continue to believe that our risk is well contained. Oil prices in Q2 increased relative to Q1 and our energy NPLs remain essentially flat. We are comfortable with our credit loss exposure in this portfolio. We also know there has been an increased concern about growth in commercial real estate loans. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we had a lower mix of CRE relative to peers. Additionally our growth in absolute dollars is lower compared to many of our peers. Our disciplined client selection in centralized loan underwriting process is designed to ensure that we have a consistent and conservative approach to making CRE loans. Moving on to capital, I'm very pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object for our 2016 CCAR plan. The 2016 plan allows us to invest realized gains from Vantiv share sales and realized gains from the monetization of the Vantiv TRA into share repurchases. We believe the economics of doing so are favorable. We will continue to be able to use the cash proceeds with share repurchases. The CCAR plan demonstrates our ability to generate and return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. Additionally, it demonstrates our ability to withstand severely stressful economical conditions for remaining well capitalized. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio reached 9.94% an improvement from 9.81% at the end of the first quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter operating results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financials summary on page four of the presentation. Overall we are pleased with our core results despite the challenging environment. Our corporate banking revenues were solid and mortgage originations have outpaced peers as well as the overall industry in the second quarter. We are deploying capital in businesses where return targets meet our long-term goals and are making good progress in executing on our strategic plans. As we shared with you previously, these projects were carefully vetted to minimize reliance on an improved economic environment. Operating leverage is the top priority with a strong emphasis on sustainable expense control without weakening our businesses strength and growing revenues. For the second quarter, there was a net negative impact of $0.01 per share resulting from several items. The most significant item was a charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap which was due to the rejection of the merchant litigation settlement. So with that let's move to Page 5 for the balance sheet discussion. Average commercial loan balances increased 2% sequentially and about 4% year-over-year. We achieved this growth with stabilizing spreads while repositioning the balance sheet for better risk adjusted returns. C&I loans contributed nearly 80% of the total sequential growth and average commercial balances. CRE growth of $199 million made up the majority of the remaining quarterly balance increase. Our CRE portfolio as a percentage of total commercial loans is one of the lowest among our regional peers. In construction, as well as in term lending, our teams are cognizant of valuations and supply demand dynamics created by the lack of attractive investment alternatives. As Greg mentioned, our disciplined client selection and credit underwriting in CRE will continue to rely on stringent standards. Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and down 1% year-over-year. Residential mortgage loans grew by 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year as we kept Jumbo mortgages and ARMs on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our residential mortgage originations were up 53% from last quarter and 7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 54% of our originations consisted of purchase volumes. Indirect auto loans were down 4% from last quarter and 9% year-over-year in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving risk adjusted returns in this business. The profile of our second quarter production was consistent with the first quarter. Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as loan paid outs continue to exceed originations. Average investment securities increased by $390 million in the second quarter or 1% sequentially. Average core deposits increased $258 million from the first quarter. This increase was driven by seasonally higher demand deposit in money market account balances partially offset by lower interest checking balances. Average core deposit balances were negatively impacted by approximately $201 million due to the previously disclosed sale of branches in Pennsylvania and $219 million due to the full quarter impact of the sale of branches in St. Louis last quarter. Excluding these deposits sold in the branch transactions over the last two quarters, average core deposits were up 1% on a sequential basis. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 110% at the end of the quarter. Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by $1 million sequentially to $908 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of $1.5 billion of unsecured debt issued in the first quarter of 2016 and from lower auto and home equity loan balances. The decrease was partially offset by growth in commercial loans and securities. The NIM decreased three basis points to 2.88% quarter-over-quarter driven by the full quarter impact of the debt issuance in the first quarter. We had previously guided to a decrease of three to four basis points in the net interest margin in the second quarter and guided to relative stability of those levels in the latter half of the year assuming a June Fed rate increase which did not occur. With no Fed moves during the remainder of the year, we now expect a two to four basis point NIM contraction in the third quarter which includes the full quarter impact of our second quarter debt issuance as well as one basis point impact due to day count. We will continue to execute a balanced interest rate risk management strategy as we have over the last three years. We will be able to mitigate some of the negative impact of the flatter yield curve with lockout cash flow in both securities that now constitute approximately 50% of our investment portfolio. Despite the NIM contraction, we are forecasting a stable NII for the second half of the year. For the full year, our balanced management approach will enable us to grow NII 2% despite the ongoing challenges with the low rate environment. Shifting to fees, on Page 7 of the presentation. Second quarter non-interest income was $599 million compared with $637 million in the first quarter. Our fee income adjusted for items I had previously mentioned was $602 million, an increase of $24 million or 4% sequentially. Despite challenging market conditions our results were strong. Corporate banking fees up $117 million were up $15 million or 15% sequentially reflecting increases in loan syndication revenue and institutional sales revenue. The growth in corporate revenues is indicative of the scope and scale of our product offerings and relationship driven target operating model that we are executing. Mortgage originations were $2.7 billion in the second quarter with 54% of the mix consisting of purchase volumes. About 75% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels and the remainder from the corresponding channel. Gains on sale were up 29% quarter-over-quarter with robust origination volume as the gain on sale margins was down 85 basis points. Mortgage banking net revenue of $75 million was down $3 million sequentially primarily due to servicing asset amortization as a result of higher refis in the servicing portfolio. The net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $29 million compared to negative $16 million last quarter. Deposit service charges increased 1% from the first quarter reflecting seasonal trends in consumer deposit fees and decreased 1% relative to the second quarter of 2015. Total wealth and asset management revenue of $101 million decreased 1% sequentially reflecting seasonally lower trust tax preparation fees from the first quarter. As you may recall, our prior guidance calls for 4% to 5% annual fee growth over reported 2015 fees excluding the impacts from Vantiv share sales and warrant valuation adjustments which was approximately $2.3 billion. Excluding Vantiv related items and the Visa total return swap adjustment this quarter and any other potential Vantiv related gains we expect to grow our fees 5% as a result of a strong first half and the expectation of continued strength during the next two quarters. Next I would like to discuss non-interest expense in page 8 of the presentation. Expenses of $983 million were $3 million lower than in the first quarter reflecting a seasonal decrease in FICA and unemployment expense, partially offset by a $9 million expense due to retirement eligibility changes. First quarter's results were also impacted by a $14 million expense related to the voluntary early retirement program. As Greg said earlier, we are making good progress in executing on key strategic initiatives and managing our expenses. We now expect expenses to grow at 4% level slightly below our April guidance. This guidance includes the impact of the higher FDIC assessment. I also would like to remind you that our guidance includes the impact of the increased amortization of our low income housing investments which most of our peers reflect in their tax line, the increase in the provision for unfunded commitments, and the impact of one-time benefits related to the settlement of legal cases in 2015. These three items make up roughly 2% of the forecasted 4% increase in expenses. As I mentioned earlier, operating leverage is our top priority going into 2017. Although we are taking a cautious approach to maintain our franchises strength in growing revenues, there are a number of identified areas that we are focusing on that I would like to review with you. We plan to engage third parties in some areas to optimize our savings. The first is the end to end commercial loan origination, underwriting, and servicing process. This is a natural area of attention given the size of our commercial business. In addition to cost efficiencies, we also believe that our work here will have significant positive impact on client service quality. Similarly we are looking at opportunities in central operations. With new senior management in place, we have identified consolidation opportunities in our facilities and believe that we will be able to extract more savings going forward. This morning we announced a 5.5 year extension to our operating agreement with Vantiv. The new agreement will reflect reduced expenses for Fifth Third and enhance revenue opportunities that both companies enjoy in this mutually beneficial partnership. We will continue to look for opportunities across the board in all of our vendor relationships. We also believe that our significant offshore presence will continue to be a source of savings in all of our business operations including our risk and compliance areas. The long-term performance targets that Greg reviewed require a focus and disciplined approach to expense management and we are confident we can execute. Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were $87 million or 37 basis points in the second quarter compared to $96 million and 42 basis points in the first quarter of 2016 and $86 million and 37 basis points in the second quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a $7 million decline in C&I net charge-offs. Of the total net charge-offs less than $2 million were in energy. Non-performing loans excluding loans held-for-sale were $693 million down $8 million from the previous quarter resulting in an NPL ratio of 74 basis points. Overall credit metrics remain strong. While there may be volatility in credit metrics periodically, our portfolio is performing in line with our expectations. Our provision was $4 million higher than total charge-offs and our reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases was unchanged at 1.38%. Relative to our peer group, our NPA net charge-off and reserve ratios compare favorably. Our previous guidance that net charge-offs would be range bound with some quarterly variability's unchanged. Also we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth. On Slide 10, given the recent events overseas we have provided a breakdown of our UK and European exposure. As Greg already mentioned in his earlier remarks, our second quarter UK exposure is minimal at less than 2% of total loans. We do not anticipate any significant issues from our portfolio which is diversified and consist primarily of loans to large corporate customers. Moving on to capital on Slide 11, our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.9%, an increase of 52 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the second quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately 4 million. During the quarter, we executed open market share repurchases of $26 million which reduced the share count by 1.44 million shares. This completed our previous CCAR repurchase activity. On Slide 12, as Greg mentioned earlier, we recently entered into another agreement with Vantiv related to a roughly $800 million of expected TRA cash flows. This transaction mitigates future risk related to these cash flows and enables us to reinvest the realized gains into share buybacks. As we discussed with you many times in the past, our ability to realize these cash flows over to next 15 plus years, depends on factors such as U.S. corporate tax rate and Vantiv's taxable income levels. With that in mind, at the end of last year, we terminated and settled a portion of these future cash flows and this week we executed another agreement for a termination and settlement of $331 million in cash flows for an upfront payment of $116 million. In addition, under a quarterly put call structure owned by Fifth Third and Vantiv respectively, we will have the ability to terminate and settle another $394 million of future cash flows for a total of $171 million payable to Fifth Third in 2017 and in 2018 in eight separate quarterly optional executions. We have essentially locked in the ability to receive a minimum of approximately $15 million per quarter in 2017 and $26 million per quarter in 2018. This transaction will require an upfront asset booked on our balance sheet this quarter as it essentially removes the contingencies associated with these future cash flows. I would like to remind you that we will also receive our annual normal payments this year and next year. These TRA flows are related to all share sales executed up to this point. There is roughly an additional $1 billion in future TRA flows related to future potential sales of our current ownership at the current Vantiv share price. We believe that our actions around the Vantiv relationship are in the best interest of our shareholders. Relative to CCAR 2016, the Federal Reserve's review is complete and we received a non-objective to our capital plan. Our capital plan includes the ability to increase the quarterly common stock dividends to $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2016, the repurchase of common shares an amount up to $660 million, and the ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized after-tax gains from the sale of Vantiv stocks. Additionally, this year, our capital plan now also includes the ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized after-tax gains from the termination of any portion of the Vantiv tax receivable agreement we just discussed. We believe our results demonstrate the relative strength of both our capital positions and our internal capital generation capacity. We have included the overall outlook on Slide 13 for your reference and with that let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A. Sameer Shripad Gokhale : Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start the Q&A as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Joana, please open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe : Just to be really clear on the TRA. So I get that you executed on the $116 million that seems to be a locked in gain. Just the way the pressure it reads about the additional what the $394 million, I guess you get $171 million coming in, I just want to make sure that is -- is that a locked in gain in third quarter such that if you go on Slide 12, you get $279 million gain in third quarter? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, Ken. So these are basically put and call structures. We own a put option and Vantiv owns a call option on a quarterly basis on predetermined cash flows. And both of these options basically removes the contingent fee associated with the TRA cash flows and therefore we are required to book an upfront asset for the present value of these assets which will basically result in $163 million pre-tax gain in Q3. So we will book an asset of $163 million on the pre-tax basis. And then we have basically the cash payment of $116 million that we will be receiving for the $331 million in gross cash flows, so that's the combination of the two. Jamie Leonard : And Ken, this is Jamie. One nuance to the CCAR approval and Tayfun's reference to realized after-tax gains, when it comes to capital deployment of these gains the $116 million because it is recognizing and realized would result in our ability to deploy that capital on an after-tax basis in the $76 million or so range this quarter. And the reason we broke out Slide 12 the way we did was to show you that the capital deployment related to the recognition of the asset for the receivable, the $163 million would be deployable as those puts and calls are exercised and cash is exchanged in the quarterly installments you see in 2017 and 2018. Ken Zerbe : Got it. So the right-hand chart basically so the left-hand chart as you book an asset of $163 million, the right-hand chart says as the cash comes in you don't recognize the gain, you simply isn't offsetting asset. Jamie Leonard : Correct. Ken Zerbe : So capital goes up and asset goes down. Jamie Leonard : Correct. Operator : The next question comes from David Eads with UBS. Your line is open. David Eads : I wanted to talk about the NII outlook. It looks like there was on a ending -- end of period that basis there was a pretty big ramp up in securities. Was there anything unusual with that strategy there and I guess should that benefit the NII outlook in next quarter, was there anything unusual positioning on the securities there? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, good question, one item related to the end of period balance sheet versus the average is that the end of period includes the unrealized gains and the average balances do not. So good news is we had a $1.335 billion unrealized gain in the portfolio that makes it looks like on an end of point basis we had added some leverage. But to your question in terms of the outlook on the portfolio, the one assumption in our NII outlook is that given the low rate environment, the flatter curve, and the tight spreads, we don't expect to reinvest portfolio cash flows in the third quarter of roughly a $1 billion or so during the quarter so that you should expect on the securities portfolio that average balances would be stable to down slightly from second quarter to third quarter. David Eads : All right, that's very helpful. Thanks a lot. And maybe you talked about the two to four basis points NIM pressure in 3Q, if we assume no rate hike just simplicity, should we expect more pressure on NIM going forward or what's the kind of headwinds around the loan, the debt issuances come through, can NIM be a little bit more stable from there? Tayfun Tuzun : David, I think the NIM contraction looking forward, we gave you some guidance for Q3 and there may be a little bit more left in contraction if rates do not go up and obviously these comments depend on the shape of the yield curve. But over the long-term if we all see an environment like todays in the next year or two, our expectation is that our NIM will be fairly stable. I mean there may be some contraction from here but it's not going to be a continuous bleed out of the NIM. We expect that given our risk exposures and interest rate risk management approach we will be able to stabilizing them. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey good morning. Guys just wanted to ask you a question on the fee outlook. So this quarter seems like you had the servicing hedge was a bit of a delta and you mentioned the good pipelines you have on mortgage. So I just wondered if you could help us understand this, the drivers of core income, its impact is just mostly related to kind of getting that back on the mortgage side or do you also continue to expect good growth in some of the core fee line items? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes so let me make a couple of comments on fee seasonality. Obviously given the rate movements, we do expect a good quarter in mortgage. I think our pipeline look strong at the end of the second quarter which should play well for the third quarter and also we had a very strong corporate fee performance in Q2. Typically we would see some weakness just general seasonal weakness in the summer, in corporate fees but we expect a healthy environment in Q4 and so good corporate growth in Q4 and we would expect the other fee lines in general to be stable. So our expectation of a second half sort of strength in fee income relates to continued strength in mortgage here in the near-term and then good corporate strength as we approach the end of the year. Ken Usdin : Okay, great. And if I could follow-up on the TRA comments, so the $163 million that is in asset, when you get the cash flows back next year, are you able to buyback the amount of the cash flows that are laid out on the right side of Page 12? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes but on an after-tax basis. So the TRA payments from Vantiv to Fifth Third will need to be tax affected for capital deployment. Ken Usdin : Right. I just want to, I think there is some confusion so the $116 million you're very clear on that you can do right away, the $163 million -- Tayfun Tuzun : In the tune of $76 million, yes. Ken Usdin : Right on after-tax basis. And then the $163 million comes through and the cash was received on the right side but on an after-tax basis you could then buy those back but only as they recognize along that schedule of 2017 and 2018? Tayfun Tuzun : That is exactly right. Ken Usdin : Okay. And you didn't sell any shares this quarter, so that still is an open-ended question to about what's the thought process behind when and your decision tree is behind incremental actual share sales? Greg Carmichael : Ken, this is Greg. This discussion comes up quite a bit. We've been very, very disciplined on how we monetize our equity position at Vantiv. I would say we continue to look at what's the right thing for our shareholders. I want to continue to do that as we move forward in the remaining of this year. But we have been disciplined as rewarded our shareholders very well, it's something we always consider and we will continue to consider and evaluate as we move forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR & Company. Your line is open. Tim Wood : Good morning. Greg Carmichael : Good morning. Tim Wood : Hey guys. This is Tim for Paul. Touching on the average loan growth outlook that 2% how does that stack up your expectations from last quarter. I believe you guys have mentioned 3% growth on the commercial side on the last call and so should commercial loans still grow at a faster pace than the rest of the portfolio? Greg Carmichael : Yes so what I think, what we shared in the past is that we would expect to outpace GDP and that's exactly what we delivered. For this quarter particularly in commercial loans, you saw good growth, very diversified across our markets, across a number of businesses that we continue to emphasize, invest in, and we would expect that we would have that same type of performance throughout the balance of the year as Tayfun has previously guided. Tim Wood : Okay. Understood and then just kind of that end, the dropdown of provisions was that solely due to an improvement in credit and outlook for credit or do reflect a change in loan growth assumptions that $91 million that you guys did this quarter; is that a good base for provisions that grow off or should we see further improvement? Greg Carmichael : Yes first of all we -- I just want to make sure that everybody understands our coverage ratio remained at 1.38%. So we did not drop the coverage ratio, it's just reflective of the loan growth and it's a quarterly analysis and you went through our analysis that credit trends look good and we just provided $4 million. Going forward, as I commented, I think provision will reflect loan growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: A couple of follow-ups on topics that have already been covered a little bit. But just on the commercial loan growth, I guess why haven't we seen more growth there, I know there have been some de-risking going on and you have been very focused on pricing but I guess when do those factors run its course and you get back to may be kind of more industry commercial loan growth levels? Lars Anderson : Well first of all, I would tell you, we feel good about our commercial loan growth for this quarter, it was largely in line with our peers. I mean we've had some headwinds as we have repositioned our portfolio as we've decreased exposures to non-strategic relationships in industries such as commodity sector of it. This is really about not overreaching and focusing on client selection and thus we're going to focus on what we can control. And frankly we're doing that, if you look across all of our business, all of our verticals we are seeing some excellent growth, we are continuing to expand those, we're seeing growth across our core middle market franchise that's very promising for us. So when we would expect to see any significant change in us relative to say H8 data, very difficult to tell. We are going to focus on what we can control and that is building deep client relationships with attractive returns for our clients very deliberately so that we prudently use our capital and our liquidity and frankly we would build long-term relationships with our clients. Greg Carmichael : And this is Greg, the only thing I would add to Lars comment, this is one of our core strategies, building our balance sheet could be good for the cycle but we've been very selective on the relationships, the geography, asset diversification extremely important. We're very pleased with the commercial loan growth that we saw in this quarter, it's consistent with our strategies as we move forward. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then may be a follow-up on NIM for Tayfun or Jamie, I think the comment was beyond the third quarter, I think you can keep the NIM relatively stable even in this rate environment and which is helping to get a little more color on that. That's obviously better than peers and will be an accomplishment in a difficult rate environment. So you mentioned some hedging and swaps for tax but just elaborate a little bit on how you keep NIM stable beyond 3Q? Jamie Leonard : Yes, Matt, I think on NIM and what you've seen from us the past couple of quarters is that most if not all of our contraction are from things we've intentionally done whether that's debt issuance or the sale of some of the non-strategic assets that we've completed. And going forward the NIM compression whether it's the third quarter or perhaps even after the third quarter again would if we were to have compression, it would be based on things we're intentionally doing if we were to have more debt issuances that could be factor to drive a little bit more compression but overall we're pleased with how we position the securities portfolio, as Tayfun mentioned the bullet and locked out cash flows and we're not susceptible to this low rate environment over the next few quarters. But if this environment were to continued for an extended period of time then it would be more challenging to have stable NIM, but at least over the foreseeable future, we feel like we positioned the book as well as if we could for this lower from longer environment, we've talked you guys about that over the past two years as we built the securities portfolio. And then but one factor you haven't heard from us over the past four quarters is the fact that loan yield compression just really hasn't been a factor in our NIM and given the pricing strategies and success that we've had executing on the loan side, we think we can continue to deliver stable NIM as the loans come on the sheet as yields were comfortable. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, Jamie just may be tag on to that we are being very deliberate in terms of our disciplined credit pricing, and as Greg had mentioned our client selection. We are very focused on businesses in markets in which we believe that we can outperform and frankly that has really helped us to stabilize those loans spreads. In a couple of areas we've seen some slight improvement. We're going to continue that that strategy. I would tell you that post-Brexit, we have seen a little bit more competitive environment but we're going to continued to stay focused on this strategy it's producing the right kinds of outcomes specifically consistent with what Greg has shared previously. Greg Carmichael : Yes and I also want to clarify that I did say that, we may see just a few more basis points in Q4 based upon what Jamie just mentioned about some capital market activities but beyond that I think for looking out another two, three quarters I think we expect stability. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Matt Burnell : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow-up on the comment you just made in terms of your how deliberate you are, you've been in terms of client selection and pricing. I'm curious either in terms of other markets where there is greater pricing pressure and therefore more pressure to try to get clients to drive fee income within your footprint or those more in the lending offices that may not be in the middle of your branch footprint. Jamie Leonard : Yes so, I mean we do see variation geographically from quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year and clearly we have some markets that are more competitive than others. But I'll tell you our value proposition what we're delivering is being very well received. I'll give you an example, Chicago. This is a very competitive marketplace. We've seen and in fact that's been our fastest growing regional market that we have in our footprint, every day we are having to earn it client by client, but also I would tell you across the industry verticals, we continue to focus on put stacking our resources against those opportunities where we can get the best returns. But it's not just about the balance sheet; I'll remind you it's about the total client relationship. And it's one of the reasons that as Greg shared, earlier we continue to invest another fee sources and solutions to build out an advisory based relationship with our clients and frankly that's helping to drive the P&L also for us. So I think that this is all coming together nicely for us. Matt Burnell : Okay and for my follow-up with Tayfun may be if I could follow-up in terms of the 5% fee growth guidance. I just want to make sure that we understand the basis of that that excludes any Vantiv related gains, but it includes other sale gains or all of those excluded the way you would exclude them for core fee income? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, so first of all the base compares in 2015 is about a $2.3 billion number. So our report number was I think $2.4 billion. Matt Burnell : Right. Tayfun Tuzun : So you just exclude -- I'm sorry $3 billion so you exclude all the Vantiv related gains in 2015 you get to a point $2.3 billion. The 5% is relative to that number excludes any Vantiv gains. The only gain really that -- it also excludes obviously the branch gains as well. So it would be from our perspective a core performance this year. Matt Burnell : Okay. That implies a relatively greater growth in the second half in fees roughly about 9% by my calculation, in the second half versus the second half of last year. I appreciate that you expect to rebound in the fourth quarter in corporate fees. But that seems a bit stronger than then you've had previously? Tayfun Tuzun : I think our numbers may not necessarily compare, well I wouldn't get to a 9% type number. I think you already know our first quarter and second quarter numbers if you exclude the gains that were booked against the branch sales. So I would basically advise you to follow that 5% growth off of $2.3 billion take out the first half and then look at the remaining two quarters. Again with some weakness incorporated in the summer, but they pick up in the fourth quarter and strengthen mortgage in the third quarter. So those are how we are getting to our 5% number. Matt Burnell : Okay I'll circle back with Sameer to get my numbers right, thank you. Sameer Shripad Gokhale : Okay. Greg Carmichael : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open. Steve Moss : Good morning it's Steve Moss for John Pancari. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, Steve. Steve Moss : I wanted to touch base on the European exposure that you have. Do you plan to grow it further or reduce it further? Jamie Leonard : Yes, so I think as we've underscored previously and is in the earnings that that we have relatively light exposure in Europe. Let me just reinforce what our strategy is. Our focus is on developing relationships with European and in some cases Asian based very typically large strong corporate parents that are focused on expanding into the U.S. where we can deliver domestic services to them that that's our key strategy. So are -- do we plan to grow that in the future, I would say yes. However consistent with our Brexit and EU plans and processes and market risk review, we're going to continue to be very cautious about that. But I would see this as an opportunity for us to continue to grow our domestic franchise and build some attractive relationships while we do see some disruption in the marketplace. Greg Carmichael : Steve this is Greg. And it's important once again that we stick to the strategy that we put forth in support of our international relationships. You've watched us also over the last couple quarters simply reduce our exposure same relationship it doesn't meet our strategic objective. Steve Moss : Okay. And then also on the CRE downgrade that you guys disclosed earlier in the month just wondering if there's any incremental work related to that or and/or if there's any restriction on M&A activity? Greg Carmichael : This is Greg. First off we're very disappointed in that downgrade. Let me remind everybody that was poor period of 2011 to 2013. It was not reflective of CRE activity with respect to lending investing in our service commitments. Actually we scored satisfactory outstanding in all those areas. It really is reflective in other agencies issues with respect to some lending activities that were all closed out recently. So that was disappointing. Also look that the Group know that the Fed will be in later this year to perform the next exam that will go up through mid-2016 and we're very confident that rating will be changed very shortly so that's kind of state of the environment. With respect M&A and there is still opportunities, if you go in to bank M&A it's been very, very low on our priority, bank M&A I mean it's at the lowest level of our priorities for how we deploy our capital. We still think in this environment that we trade today the buying back our equity is the best use of deploying our capital. So we don't see this impeding our ability to deliver on our strategies and once again will be back in later this year, perform the next exam. Operator : Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Your line is open. Christopher Marinac : Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to reinforce the NII conversation of earlier, how do you feel about growing NII in 2017? Tayfun Tuzun : It's going to be a function of earning asset growth. Again depending upon obviously rates moves but assuming that there are no more rate moves over the next 18 months then NII growth will be a function of earning asset growth. I mean beyond that I think it's tough to necessarily predict what happens to credit spreads et cetera. But assuming some stability reflective of the current market conditions it will depend upon our ability to go earning assets. Christopher Marinac : Okay, great thank you for that. And then just a follow-up on the energy book. Is there any way to handicap how the snag example go this fall for the next round should that be less owners would been earlier this year. Frank Forrest : Good question. This is Frank, thanks for the question. And as you know, the first quarter that exam was focused very heavily on energy type of what we know those follow back up they'll go back and look at the same portfolio and the same credits that they evaluated in the first quarter what's changed obviously the price of oil per barrel has stabilized down a little bit last week or two but far higher than where it was before. We are -- when you look at our price tax and when you look at our all of our scenarios that we run from base to stress the price of oil is well above, well above that. So I don't think this is going to be near as much noise depending on where price moves between now and then. We moved eight credits over in the first quarter that were all but one reserve base credits the non-accrual but we have very little if any loss forecast from those credits. Our portfolio is stable at this point and as you know our portfolio was only 2% of our total book its small, it's certainly nominal. We manage it very well, we manage it through our vertical and our outlook for the rest of the year is really unchanged based on what we know today. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi, what inning are you in for the ramp up in investment spending and what inning are you in for the savings from all of your initiatives. I can elaborate a little more, the investment spending you mentioned digital regulatory back office on investment side and on the saving side you mentioned vendors, facilities, offshore, mortgage loans system, commercial loan system, and the branch closings. GregCarmichael: Right, those first up where are we as I mentioned before Mike we're at this will be the high watermark we believe for investments and technology and from a regulatory perspective investments we have to make. We've been focused on, very focused on as how to implement those opportunities of strategic investments in a most provable way and you've seen us accomplished that's why we brought our guidance down expenses for the remainder of this year and total for the year. So we feel pretty good about what we are at on from an expense position on our investment. This will be the high watermark so we're in the later endings of that. We're also starting to realize some of the value created by the focus we put on reducing our infrastructure, also the branch reengineering, personnel reengineering, investments we made to renegotiate our contracts such as Vantiv, MasterCard, and I go down the list. We're starting to see those benefits hit us actually in the second half of this year you'll see more that as move into 2017. So once again I know as you are we are we're very focused on positive operating leverage and we fully expect, there are plans and our actions will get us there in 2017. Mike Mayo : May be just a follow-up on the savings, where do you stand with the closing of the 100 branches? GregCarmichael: Yes we've completed the closing of 100 branches with the sale of Pennsylvania for a $11 million gain last quarter. So, we'll had a full year, full year run rate established by the end of this year that $60 million will be full run rate going into 2017. Once again we will remind you Mike that's an annual exercise as our consumer preferences evolved we will continue to assess our opportunities and then may be more opportunities as we think about 2017. Mike Mayo : And last follow-up just if you add in all the savings from the other initiatives too I guess you haven't really given a number of that but your goal is for positive operating leverage when starting in 2017 and do you have a number for all of those? Tayfun Tuzun : Mike we are not giving 2017 guidance but clearly going into the planning period that's our target for all of our businesses and staff functions. GregCarmichael: And Mike everything we do we put to the lens doesn't meet those objectives that I step forward with ROTCE and ROA and our ability to execute. But thank you for the question. Mike Mayo : All right, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello, thank you for taking the question. On the Vantiv transaction, I think I understand the economics, but what was the rationale for the second stage of the transaction being this so-called option structure? Tayfun Tuzun : So clearly the goal of the CRE transactions both from last year as well as this year was to ensure that from a risk management perspective and this is risk related to corporate tax rates that taxable income et cetera, to make sure that we have visibility to the value of those cash flows. And clearly this is an agreement between us and Vantiv; it's a function of their ability to engage in cash transactions upfront versus using cash availability in future periods. Geoffrey Elliott : Thanks. And then just one more quick one. There was this news earlier in the week about the Chief Legal Officers leaving because of a conflict, I wondered if you could elaborate on that little? Greg Carmichael : First that's always a difficult situation. So comment I've ever made and we've made as a bank is there was a personal matter that's been brought to our attention if their belief represents a conflict of interest. So to resolve those we've determined the best course of action was a separation. And it was a very qualified lawyer in this manner has nothing to do with any of the legal work done by Heather doing the tenure in her time to fit their naturally all I can say. Operator : Your last question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Kevin Barker : Thank you. During this quarter I mean obviously position that mortgage banking may be better in the third quarter, but you also experienced quite a bit of decline in gain on sale margins versus the previous quarter and the first quarter was obviously higher than what we saw from a run rate. Was there any particular hedging losses or something that caused the severe decline? Tayfun Tuzun : No, there isn't. I think the gain on sale margins are a function of channel production also the realization of the revenues during the quarter into the quarter. So it's not necessarily reflective of anything specific going into the third quarter we would expect more of a stability if margins are looking good for them. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then in reference to the MSR valuation adjustment of a positive $6 million. The rate movement in the second quarter was less severe than we saw in the first quarter. Was there less hedging gains this quarter as well in regards? Greg Carmichael : In which part are you talking about MSR hedging or are you talking about in the production side pipeline hedging? Kevin Barker : The MSR asset. Greg Carmichael : No, I mean on the MSR side our valuation, net valuation last quarter was $11 million and $6 million this quarter. And it really ultimately and it would have been fairly tight in terms of our hedge coverage. So it really comes down to the last day of every quarter where we stand in the valuation of those. Operator : There are further questions in the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back to the presenters. Sameer Shripad Gokhale : Thank you, Joanna, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions please contact the Investor Relations department and we will be happy to assist you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Shelby and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sameer Gokhale, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Sameer Shripad Gokhale : Thank you, Shelby. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the third quarter of 2016. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. Additionally reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference to in today\u2019s conference call are included in our earnings release along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. A copy of our most recent quarterly earnings release can be accessed by the public in the Investor Relation section of our corporate website www.53.com. This morning, I'm joined on the call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up to questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you can see on Page 3 of the presentation, we reported third quarter net income to common shareholders of $501million and earnings per diluted share of $0.65. During the quarter some notable items resulted in a net positive $0.22 reported earnings per share. Tayfun will provide further details in his opening comments. During the quarter we continue to focus on North Star Initiative. Our Q3 results provided further evidence of the progress we were making. Our net interest margin was well managed and stable sequentially, reflecting our focus on higher quality customer relationships. Adjusted fee income excluding MSR valuation adjustments was up 4% year-over-year and the growth rate has accelerated since the beginning of the year. Expenses were down 1% this quarter, compared to second quarter of 2016. During the quarter credit quality remained stable with a decrease in both non-performing and criticized asset levels for the second quarter in a row. The slight elevation in our charge-offs primarily reflects quarterly volatility in the low levels we\u2019ve been experiencing. We expect the benign credit environment to continue for the foreseeable future. Production metrics continue to be strong with mortgage volume up $2.9 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 27% from last year. Q3 volume represented the highest level of quality originations in the last three years. In our commercial business, we remain focused on higher quality relationships that will enable our business to outperform through the cycle. As a result commercial loan production for relationship manager is up 7% and fees for relationship manager up 22% on a year-to-date basis. Our overall commercial loan balances reflect the soft loan demand which persisted during the quarter. Regardless of the environment we\u2019ll continue to focus on relationships that meet our return objectives. We\u2019re also investing in developing new origination channels. For example, during the quarter we announced our strategic alliance with GreenSky and investment in and partnership with GreenSky will help us to efficiently generate additional consumer loan volumes while allowing us to leverage the technology platform in existing merchant relationships. While we continue to invest for growth in our businesses, we recognize that this remains a challenging environment for quality revenue growth, given a limited support from the broader economic environment to maintain a strong focus on expense management. The ongoing reviews across business and staff functions, we\u2019ve already taken significant steps to reduce our expense base. We completed sell and consolidation of 108 branches this year which is expected to drive approximately $60 million in annualized cost savings. Last month we announced the plan to sell and consolidate an additional 32 bank branches, which should generate incremental cost savings of $12 million annually. As a result total branches are expected to be down 12% since we began this process late last year. We expect these actions to generate expense savings of $72 million yearly. With rapid changes in technology and customer behavior we\u2019ll continue to implement our omni channel strategy. We believe this will allow us to further optimize our branch network to best serve the needs of our customers. We\u2019re also making a necessary technology that just acts like [ph] digital and operational capabilities. Our investments in digital channel are paying off. In the third quarter approximately 20% of consumer deposits were made using our mobile app, compared to 60% a year ago. Overall, we\u2019ve seen a 25% increase in mobile usage year-over-year. We\u2019ve also seen 106% increase year-over-year in checking savings accounts opened online. We expect to continue to making investments to drive higher digital option and creating more integrated customer experience while creating efficiencies [indiscernible]. To optimize workspace utilization, we\u2019re evaluating non-branch facilities for additional efficiency. During the quarter we saw one of our Michigan facilities which generated $11 million pretax stake. We\u2019re working on similar opportunities to reduce expense, run rate, while improving the overall work environment for our employees. We also renegotiate key vendor contracts during the quarter as disclosed earlier. As a result of our strong execution and focus on expense management, we now expect year-over-year expense growth to be sub 4% in 2016, compared to our original guidance of 4.5% to 5% at the start of the year. The actions we\u2019re taking should help us to achieve a positive operating leverage in 2017. For the near term expense management is at the top of our priority list, we\u2019re also maintaining a long-term perspective on our strategic plans. During the third quarter, we formerly launched Project North Star to line our entire organization toward a higher and more sustainable level of profitability within the next three years. Our energies are focused on generating the right mix of expense reductions, key revenue enhancement opportunities and balance sheet optimization in order to achieve ROTCE targets. Assuming the current operating environment persists, we expect to achieve 12% to 14% ROTCE run rate by the end of 2019. We expect the contributions from Project North Star to be additive to the improvements that we\u2019re already making on our base run rate. These initiatives will leverage our strength and middle market lending, industry verticals, especially lending areas in our commercial business. In the consumer business growth initiatives in mortgage banking and personal lending will provide support for more balanced growth in our overall loan portfolio. We continue to expand our capabilities in businesses such as capital markets, insurance and wealth management that generate attractive returns. In initiatives such as our commercial end-to-end process redesign project will help generate additional efficiencies for improving the overall customer experience. We intend to achieve these targets without changing our risk appetite or our ongoing discipline of maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our capital and liquidity levels remain strong and improved from last quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio reached 10.16% from 9.94% at the end of the second quarter and our liquidity coverage ratio was 150%, 25% above the current requirement. As previously disclosed, reserve an object [ph] to an increase in our common dividend of $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter. In summary, I was pleased with the solid results we generated despite soft economic conditions. Our results demonstrate the progress we\u2019re making toward our targets on the Project North Star as well as our longer term strategic goals. I also want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication and for keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. With that, I will turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter operating results and current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financials summary on Page 4 of the presentation. As Greg said, overall we are pleased with our results in the current economic environment. The growth in our net interest income, the stability of the net interest margin and the decline in our expenses are indicative of our focus on improving shareholder returns. For the third quarter, there was a net positive impact of $0.22 per share resulting from several items. The most significant item was $280 million pre-tax gain from the termination and settlement of certain Vantiv TRA gross cash flows and the expected obligation to terminate and settle the remaining TRA gross cash flows. Our underlying fee revenues were solid during the quarter. Mortgage origination and pass through fees were 31% higher in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. Corporate banking revenues were seasonally down slightly from a robust second quarter as we had previously indicated. Expenses continued to be tightly controlled as we continue to look for efficiencies throughout the organization. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in overall key credit risk indicators is supportive of the benign credit outlook. So with that let\u2019s move to Page 5 for the balance sheet discussion. Average commercial loan balances decreased 1% sequentially and increased about 1% year-over-year. The sequential decline reflected some softness in C&I loan demand and was consistent with industry trends. Our spreads widened as we continued to reposition and optimize the portfolio into a more attractive risk return profile that we believe will be more resilient in the economic downturn. Our C&I has increased every quarter since the third quarter of last year. CRE growth of $354 million this quarter partially offset some of the decline in C&I loan balance. As we discussed before, in construction as well as in term lending our teams are cognizant of valuations and supply demand dynamics created by the lack of attractive investment alternatives. Our discipline client selection and credit underwriting in CRE will continue to rely on stringent standards. Average consumer loans decreased $78 million from last quarter and we\u2019re down 2% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 3% from last quarter and 12% year-over-year in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving risk adjusted returns in this business. Our strategy so far this year has resulted in higher returns on assets and capital than our initial expectations in our indirect auto business. Residential mortgage loans grew by 3% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, as we kept jumbo mortgages, RMs as well as 10 and 15 year fixed rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our residential mortgage originations were up 7% from last quarter 27% year-over-year. During the quarter our origination mix was roughly in half between purchase and refinance volumes. About 70% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels and the remaining were originated through the correspondent channel. Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, as loan pay downs exceeded strong origination volume. Our originations this quarter were up 15% compared to last quarter and 20% higher year-over-year. Our goal is to achieve a better balance between commercial loan growth and consumer loan growth. Our new partnership with GreenSky should help enhance our ability to generate consumer loans, especially as we start to implement their technology in our own business. In addition our new initiatives in credit card lending should also support stronger growth going forward. Average investment securities decreased by 239 million in the third quarter or 1% sequentially. Our yield widened by 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter, partly due to higher discount accretion during the quarter. Average core deposits decreased $98 million from the second quarter. Average core deposits were negatively impacted by approximately $302 million due to the Pennsylvania branches sold in April. Excluding these deposits, average core deposits were flat on a sequential basis and up 1% on a year-over-year basis. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 115% at the end of the quarter. Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation; taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $5 million sequentially to $913 million. The increase was primarily driven by improved investment portfolio yields, an increase in 1-month LIBOR, and the impact of the day count. The increase was partially offset by the full quarter impact of $1.25 billion of unsecured debt issued late in the second quarter and lower average C&I loan balances. The NIM was stable from the second quarter at 2.88% and wider than we forecasted in July. The positive impact of higher yielding investments and an increase in 1-month LIBOR was offset by the full quarter impact of the second quarter debt issuance and the day count. Our outlook for NIM has improved relative to our July forecast. With no rate hikes for the rest of the year, we now expect the NIM to be stable to down 1 basis points in the fourth quarter, which includes the full quarter impact of our September debt issuance. On a full year basis, we would expect a NIM of about 2.89% which is up 1 basis point from 2015. We expect NII to be down slightly in the fourth quarter from the full quarter impact of our debt issuance and more normalized discount accretion on the investment securities portfolio. We are still projecting full year NII growth of 2% despite ongoing challenges the low environment - the rate environment and stable loan growth. We will continue to execute a balanced interest rate risk management strategy as we have over the last three years. Our NIM out performance should not imply that we have outside exposure to a declining portfolio yields. We estimate that in a static interest rate environment, the investment portfolio would only have a detrimental impact of 2 basis points in 2017 on the Bancorp\u2019s net interest margin. A key contributor to this stability is that approximately 48% of our investment portfolio consists of lockout and bullet securities. Keeping nearly our entire investment portfolio in the available for sale category has also allowed us to maintain some flexibility to reposition the investment portfolio in response to changing market conditions. Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation, third quarter non-interest income was $840 million compared with $599 million in the second quarter. Our fee income adjusted for items disclosed in our earnings release was $596 million. Also excluding the impact of the net MSR valuation, fee revenue was up 2% versus last quarter and up 4% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Despite the environmental factors, our underlying fee revenues were solid. Mortgage production gains on sale were up 13% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the robust origination volume that I mentioned earlier and a 39 basis points increase in the gain on sale margin. Mortgage banking net revenue of $66 million was down $9 million sequentially, primarily due to net MSR valuation adjustments during the quarter. Net MSR valuation adjustments were negative $9 million, compared to a positive $6 million last quarter. We expect our fourth quarter mortgage origination revenue to be seasonally a little lower than the third quarter by 5% to 10% above last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Corporate banking fees of $111 million was seasonally down $6 million or 5% sequentially, reflecting decreases in loan syndication revenue and foreign exchange fees, partially offset by an increase in corporate bond underwriting revenue. These were up 7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong corporate bond underwriting and loan syndication revenues. The expansion highlights, our efforts to increase the scale and scope of our product offering in line with relationship driven model that we\u2019re executing. We expect corporate banking fees in the fourth quarter to be stable relative to the third quarter. Deposit service charges increased 4% from the second quarter driven by a 6% increase in retail service charges as well as 3% increase in commercial service charges. The increase in retail service charges reflected seasonally higher customer activity. Deposit service charges decreased 1% relative to the third quarter of 2015, reflecting reduced monthly service charges as part of our new consumer checking account line up. Total wealth and asset management revenue of $101 million was flat sequentially as market value improvements were offset by lower transaction driven retail brokerage fees. Revenues declined 2% relative to the third quarter of 2015 as investment management and institutional fees were more than offset by lower brokerage fees. We discussed the third quarter impact of Vantiv TRA transactions in July during our second quarter earnings call. These transactions were very beneficial from both risk management as well as shareholder return optimization perspective. As you may recall, our prior guidance for 2016 called for 5% annual adjusted fee growth off base of $2.3 billion for 2015. The space excluded impacts of Vantiv as previously discussed which are mentioned on Slide 11 of our presentation. Excluding Vantiv related items the Visa total return swap adjustments and any impacts from branch sales and consolidations we continue to expect annual fee growth of 5% growth for the full year. Next, I would like to discuss noninterest expense on Page 8 of the presentation. Expenses of $973 million were $10 million lower than in the second quarter including the impact of the FDIC surcharge. This reflects a decrease in compensation related expenses and employee benefits resulting from the impact of the second quarter of 2016 retirement eligibility change as well as other reductions in operational expenses. As Greg stated earlier, we are making good progress in executing on key strategic initiatives and managing our expenses at the same time. We now expect expense growth to be below 4% level compared to our July guidance of 4% and 4.5% to 5% at the start of the year. Once again I would like to remind you that our guidance includes the impact of the increased amortization of our low income housing investments which most of our peers reflect in their tax line. On an annual basis this line item contributes nearly 3% to our efficiency ratio. It also includes an increase in the provision for unfunded commitments and the impact of one-time benefits related to the settlement of legal cases in 2015. These three items make up roughly 2% of the forecasted increase in expenses. As we have previously discussed generating positive operating leverage is our top priority going into 2017 and our recent trends are supportive of that outcome. Turning to credit results on Slide 9, net charge-offs were $107 million or 45 basis points in the third quarter, compared to $87 million and 37 basis points in the second quarter of 2016 and $188 million and 80 basis points in the third quarter a year ago. The sequential increase in charge-offs was primarily due to $22 million increase in C&I net charge-offs. Total non-performing loans excluding loans held for sale were $586 million, down $107 million or 15% from the previous quarter resulting in an NPA ratio of 63 basis points. Commercial NPAs decreased $94 million or 17% from the second quarter. In addition our criticized asset has steadily improved over the last four quarters and our criticized asset ratio is now at the lowest point since third quarter of 2007. The strength in the key credit metrics indicates continued overall stability, but given the absolute loan levels there may be volatility in some periods periodically. Our provision was $11 million lower than that last quarter, partially driven by improving non-performing loans and criticized asset levels. Our results in reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases decreased one basis point to 1.37%, but was up two basis points from last year. Our previous guidance that led charge offs would be range bound with some quarterly variability is unchanged. We expect the fourth quarter charge-offs to be lower than the third quarter charge-offs. Also we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth. Moving on to capital and liquidity on Slide 10, our capital levels remain strong and are growing. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.16%, an increase of 22 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 76 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the third quarter common shares outstanding were down approximately 11 million or 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2016 and down 40 million shares or 5% compared to last year's third quarter. During the quarter we executed an accelerated share repurchase of $240 million which reduced the share count by 10.98 million shares. This repurchase includes our 2016 CCAR repurchases as well as the third quarter after tax cash flows realized from the Vantiv TRA termination and settlement. Our book value and tangible book value are up 12% and 13% respectively year-over-year. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be between 23.5% to 24.5% range. This quarter we will be finalizing our 2017 financial plan as well as our outlook for Project North Star which is a three year project. As Greg said, we expect Project North Star to contribute meaningfully to our base performance which makes it slightly [ph] improving dependency compared to our more recent performance. The priorities embedded within the North Star project are intense focus on expense management, smart balance sheet management and capital efficiency and revenue growth initiatives in high return businesses. These expectations include higher to historical growth in personal lending including credit cards, expansion of our middle market and vertical business commercial and widening the scope and scale in our capital markets businesses. Expense savings should include lower infrastructure and delivery cost in IT, lower total compensation cost and other operational expense savings in foreign exchange management, legal work and savings related to a more efficient data infrastructure and end-to-end process redesign. This quarter we are working on finalizing our 2017 financial plan as well as the construct of our Project North Star. Our goal is to share our expectations with you later this quarter and more in our January call. We have included the updated outlook on Slide 11 for your reference. And with that let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A. Sameer Shripad Gokhale : Thanks, Tayfun. Before we begin Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Shelby, please open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jill Shea with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Jill Shea : Good morning guys, just on the loan growth side, can you provide us some color in terms of what you are hearing from customers and just any color in terms of overall demand and then just how much is the foreign exchange related to the environment and softness and demand and how much it is actually related to deliberate pulling back in terms of relationships or industries? Lars Anderson : Yeah, so Shea this is Lars and just a few comments there. First of all what we are hearing from clients, they continue to be cautious, they are asking about making significant investments. I guess you'd seen some of that play out in the lower M&A activity that we are seeing as we've headed further into the year. That uncertainty also revolves around questions about political what is going on in China, Brexit, EU type issues. So those are certainly coloring some of the advancement that we are seeing. We did clearly see a slower production in the third quarter, but I would see that as a little bit more seasonal which we typically see lower levels in July and August. So I would say it was more pronounced this third quarter, however with the things that we are doing investing in our verticals, new businesses and frankly we\u2019ve got some geographies some markets there are performing very well. I would expect that we will continue to see loan growth at a good stable rate on a go forward basis. We got great business model one that clearly is being well received in the market place, our advisory base relationship model is long embraced and we are seeing that reflected in deeper client relationships that is helping us to drive fee income. Jill Shea : Great thanks, it\u2019s very helpful and then maybe just quickly on the margin, it held up quite nicely this quarter. Can you just walk through the moving parts there, I think you spoke to some of that in your opening remarks in terms of the loan and securities yields, but could you just walk us through your expectations keeping that margin stable sequentially as we move forward, maybe just some puts and takes there? Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah, I think, we obviously were happy to see a stable margin, a good amount of that is due to what Lars just talked about, discipline pricing on the commercial side, we actually as I mentioned has been able to increase our C&I yield four quarters in a row now, that is helping out, very focused management of the investment portfolio, environmental factors clearly have played out very similar to the way we envision them and the investment portfolio is contributing a lot to. Jamie, anything else you want to add to the margin side? Jamie Leonard : Yeah, as Tayfun mentioned the third quarter walk is what we would expect some of these to recur in the fourth quarter. So from the second quarter to the third quarter, loan yield expansion was one basis point of improvement and then the investment portfolio of this kind of accretion was another 2 basis point on top of that and that was offset by the day count impact of negative 1 basis point in the debt funding impacts of negative 2 basis points. So we expect going forward for the fourth quarter, obviously it\u2019s been an active year on the debt side for us and we have refinanced all of our maturities for the year, so the debt you can expect to be pretty quiet. But the long yield expansion that we\u2019ve seen every quarter this year we expect to continue into the fourth quarter and for us it is driven by C&I and auto yields, they both increased 3 basis points in the third quarter. And then the one - normally from the third quarter would be the investment portfolio had tremendous performance in the third quarter with the discount accretion, you saw that how we are obviously pleased with our position on the portfolio, but that should normalize in the fourth quarter just given the faster speeds in the third quarter than what we are expecting in the fourth quarter. So that will be a little bit of headwind for us in the fourth quarter but I think the loan yield and the other actions we have taken to generate either a stable and perhaps down a basis point and that assumes there is not Fed increase in the fourth quarter. Greg Carmichael : Jill, and if I could just tag on this has been a very deliberate strategy over the past years. We focused on balance sheet managed event and redeploying our capital into business that we felt that we could get better returns. By stabilizing our core coupon we have been able to benefit more from the LIBOR rise than many of our peers and we are going to continue to do that and in fact that\u2019s part of our North Star strategy. Tayfun Tuzun : And beyond the fourth quarter we stand by our statement that we made last quarter that we see stability in 2017 without any rate increases and what is encouraging is when you take a look at the debt refinancing that we had this year, 2017 is relatively lighter year, so that also would be supportive of that stable outlook for 2017. Jill Shea : Okay, great thank you so much. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : So I just wanted to ask a follow up question, you mentioned that beyond fourth quarter you see stability in the net interest margin without a rate hike. I am wondering as you continue to go through the balance sheet optimization which is clearly beneficial to margin, how should we think about average earning asset growth going forward? It\u2019s been flattish this year and I am wondering if some of the heavy lifting in terms of exiting certain portfolios is going to abate next year and perhaps average earning asset gross could pick up. Greg Carmichael : Thanks for the question Erika, this is Greg. First of all we have done a lot of - maybe in the last year plus and really exiting out of all other sectors and focusing on profitability would it be commodities, term loans, leverage loans. We basically pushed out almost $2 billion over the last year. So while that is going to abate as we go into 2017, 2018 a lot of heavy lifting is going to be done and has been done this year. So when you get to think about next years, we\u2019re looking at the forecast, we expect commercial loan growth to be close to nominal on GDP maybe slightly north of that. And consumers given some of our focus on indirect auto and bringing down the originations, there we expect that to be flat to slightly up next year. Then we focus on other opportunities such as mortgage and unsecured lending as Tayfun mentioned in his operating comments. And Lars do you want to add any colors. Tayfun Tuzun : We will be finalizing this outlook obviously before in January and I don\u2019t take this as guidance for 2017, but the trends that Greg mentioned is fairly high intact [ph]. Lars Anderson : Yeah, I would just emphasis again this has been a very deliberate plan of balance sheet management and to ensure that we are optimizing our capital and our liquidity from a corporate perspective and is an alignment with our relationship banking strategy. And I would tell you one of the complements to this is, as we build out businesses such as the verticals where we are delivering specialized industry expertise, it is also helping to speed our capital markets business and drive that at rates that are far beyond the expansion of what has been pretty much a flat industry. We may be growing our capital markets in the 14%, 15% rate. Tayfun Tuzun : And the other color I want to make Erika is, away from the commercial portfolio, our decision to take down auto loan originations at the start of this year had an impact clearly on total loan growth on an average to average basis compared to last year\u2019s third quarter, our auto loan portfolio balances are down $1.3 billion. So making those adjustments and focusing on capital returns and other balance sheet target. Actually we are quite pleased with where we are with respect to where our balance sheet is today. Erika Najarian : Got it and my follow up question is, I thought you made a very important point on the defensiveness of your securities yield. Could you explain further what exactly it means to have, I'm talking about 48% of your investment portfolio and lockout or bullet securities as we think about in a static environment for the yield curve, why that's not going to pressure the yields further? Gregory Carmichael : Thanks for that question and I'm going to ask Jamie to provide some details. We have seen some write-offs during the quarter that clearly had a different tone and what we are seeing. So, it's important for us to provide you more details about our thoughts here. Jamie? James Leonard : Yeah, what's important about it is, Erika, and one of the changes we actually made in the disclosure this quarter was that when you have 48% of the portfolio or last quarter's 51%, we actually updated that disclosure to reflect the 24-month time horizon where is prior times we've discussed it. We just looked at it 12 months, but obviously this is a big focus item for all of the analysts and investors just given the outperformance in the yield and the point and then updating the disclosure was the same in the next 24 months about half our portfolio, we will not have cash flows return to us and we've talked every quarter about whether we were or not going to reinvest cash flows out of the portfolio. In the third quarter we didn't like the entry points we were seeing and so we didn't reinvest over half of the cash flows from the portfolio, but the total level of cash flow that come off the portfolio are a pretty low level as a percent of our book relative to our peers and that's really where you can dig in and see when folks are invested in pass-through securities, you have extension risk and you have prepayment risk in the bullet and locked out cash flow play that we've been running for over two years and talking to you about that really benefits in the environment that we're seeing today and that's why we're very pleased with how we're positioned. We're obviously over a long-term time horizon going to be subject to market yields and next year that will be about a two basis point NIM impact if rates were to stay where they were today. But overall this is just not a big risk for the third given how we've positioned the portfolio. Gregory Carmichael : Yeah, we've seen it in the third quarter with respect to how this discount accretion played against free amortization that was deliberately done. We positioned the portfolio for potentially higher prepayment. So, I think all in all we\u2019re pretty pleased with where the portfolio stands. Erika Najarian : Thank you. That was a clear explanation. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Your line is open. Christopher Marinac : Thanks. Good morning all. I want to delve into the GreenSky relationship that I was curious. We will see bounces in the fourth quarter from that and also how many quarters in the future until the technology is beginning to be implemented system wide? Gregory Carmichael : Chris, we\u2019re onboarding on assets as we speak and we're very pleased with the initial pathways that we're in right now. The average cycle of boring [ph] right now is about 750. So, we are onboarding assets as we speak. We\u2019ve targeted roughly $90 million to $100 million a quarter. It\u2019s what our forward-looking expectations are for - as a generation of Green Sky. On the technology front, we're going to focus on two phases. First phase is our digital adoption, deploying our digital channels or mobile web-based applications that will start to roll out second quarter next year is what was targeted for right now and then after that we\u2019ll focus on the branch adoption of the technology, which will probably be at 2017, early 2018. Christopher Marinac : It sounds great, Greg. Thank you. Gregory Carmichael : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Matt Burnell : Thanks for taking my questions. Let me start by asking a question on the margin and I know you haven't spent a lot of time talking about 2017. But if we were to get a 25-basis point hike in late December, I presume that doesn't have much effect on the December - sorry on the fourth quarter margin. But last year the margin was up about six basis points from the fourth quarter - sorry for the first quarter \u201816 after the hike in the fourth quarter. And I'm curious if your positioning is similar to that now where you might expect a roughly similar benefit from a 25-basis point hike. And then if that occurs, what you're thinking about margin through the course of the year since this year the margins sort of worked its way back down after the initial benefit in the first quarter? James Leonard : Yeah, Matt, this is Jamie. I\u2019ll take that one. The benefit to us if the Fed were to move in the second week of December, it\u2019s about one basis point to margin benefit and that's what we saw in the fourth quarter of \u201805 with that move. When you dice that, the margin transition from 4Q \u201815 to 1Q \u201816 we were up six bps, eight of that actually was driven by the Fed move. So, our view on December 2016 move, if it were to happen, it's probably going to be slightly less beneficial than the eight basis points that we saw last year just given the deposit rates maybe a little more competitive on the second move in each prospective move. So I think on the high side it would be eight and then we're looking at this more in the six range. But, yes, it would - we\u2019re positioned that it would be very beneficial to us. And then as Tayfun said, part of the change that occurred from Q4 \u201815 to where we are today on the margin was in a large part driven by the $3.7 billion of debt maturities we had this year and now - next year we\u2019re at a $1.2 billion level of maturities. That was really the biggest influence on the margin compression this year that that obviously would not repeat and therefore you would expect some stability to growth in them going forward if that were to be raising rates. Matt Burnell : Okay. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, let me ask about deposit growth. It seems relative to others who have reported so far this quarter that your deposit growth even adjusting for the sale is really typically flattish. Many other banks have almost been complaining about the level of deposit growth relative to loan growth. How much of your client optimization activities have been - have affected deposit growth and what other trends are you seeing in deposit growth that you think might improve over the next couple of quarters? Tayfun Tuzun : I think you have to look at that picture from two sides. One is commercial. The other one is consumer. And on the consumer side, I think we expect to continue to grow the consumer book at healthy levels. On the commercial side, almost the entire decline has been on deliberate customer actions. And those are unlikely to repeat at that level and given our plans in the treasury management business and the expansion of our relationships, we would expect to get back on a growth pattern in commercials. Matt Burnell : Thank you, Tayfun. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Gregory Carmichael : Good morning. Matt O'Connor: Can you talk a bit about the underlying expense growth if we think about exiting this year into next? Obviously 2016 was a big year on the technology, the compliance spend, has that peaked? And some of the puts and takes and any comments on the overall expense growth as you think about next year? Gregory Carmichael : I\u2019ll make a few comments and I'll turn it to Tayfun. First off, we are fully committed and we expect to have positive operating leverage as we go into 2017, so that's number one objective. We\u2019ll continue to stay focused on expenses. As I mentioned in prior discussions on our technology investment, the high watermark will be 2016. So, we expect our technology investments to subside as we go into 2017 and 2018, not at the current levels we are seeing today 2016, so we expect that to improve. In addition to that a lot - as I mentioned before on Project North Star, as you think about Project North Star, the opportunity to benefit we get from Project North Star is expense improvement. We expect to see that start to impact our run rate in 2017, some of the actions that we've already taken and actions that we have planned going forward. So, Tayfun, if you want to pull the bucket on here [ph]. Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah, it\u2019s a bit too early to provide more detailed outlook on \u201817, Matt. But we clearly are keeping a very close eye on compensation expenses and FD accounts. So, that is going to help us. And as you said many times here, over the last two, three quarters, or even going beyond that to late \u201815, we expected and we did achieve a peak on our recent compliance related headcounts and going forward that type of increase is unlikely to repeat itself. Some of these larger vendor contracts in 2017 will be hitting our expense line on a full year basis, which is going to be beneficial. There is going to be workspace management saves, some related to branch closings, some related to broader tactics and strategies that our team is executing there. So, there is a combination of factors that indicate to us that this expectation of positive operating leverage even in a static environment is achievable. Matt O'Connor: And then now just separately a clarification question regarding next year, you had said, I think the NIM percent, was it going to be stable? If I may choose the NIM percent versus net interest income dollars stable in a flat rate environment and on what bases that half of it? If it\u2019s a NIM percent that half of 289 that you expect for this year? Gregory Carmichael : Yeah, we\u2019re already basically going through the full year NIM and at this point, Matt, it\u2019s too early to give you an interim guidance for 2017. Matt O'Connor: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Hey, guys, thanks very much. Your credit quality continues to be very good aside from the points you made about variability, I was just thinking the pretty sizable release this quarter and they still have upper 1,3 type of reserve ratio. With the move to also build the consumer going forward, you mentioned that provisioning would be in line with loan growth. Can you just help us think about just how much improvement you still see is underneath the surface and what would you be concerned about as far as any variability in other parts of the book? Lars Anderson : Yeah, so I\u2019ll ask Frank to also join in and comment on the credit quality. Look, I think we have seen a very significant change in the underlying credit factors right. When you think about the decrease in NPLs, the decrease in criticized assets, those are meaningful, visible, and important changes and again results of some deliberate actions that we've taken over the past year or so. Beyond - obviously they all contributed to where we ended up with the results. But you have to keep in mind the reserve coverage only went down by 1 basis point and we've been watching our peer group over the last two, three quarters. We've seen more meaningful decreases in coverage from others and ours has been relatively stable. We're actually up compared to last year's third quarter. As we look forward clearly - if there is a significant change in the way the portfolio grows that we will reflect that in the provision as we said baring any significant environmental changes we would expect provision to move overall with loan growth and that probably is a statement that other have made. Frank, any color on sort of credit environment today? Frank Forrest : Ken, and excuse me, I have laryngitis. The work we've done has really been deliberate over the last 18 months to reposition the portfolio. The result of that is we cut $0.5 billion less in criticized assets this quarter, big number, very meaningful. We've taken about a billion for off the leverage book in the last 12 months and that was the high risk piece of the leverage book. Our commodity exposure today in outstanding is $35 million. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s all we have left. We're essentially out of the coal business. Our real estate exposure relative to our peers is much lower and it's underwritten primarily to national and large regional developers, we believe in a very, very prudent manner. And our energy book as we talked about before is 2% of our total book. We're looking at maybe $60 million to $80 million of losses in energy that's over the next eight to nine quarters. So, we've taken very deliberate actions for the work we're doing and coordinated with Lars on the commercial side to reposition this balance sheet to ensure that as we move towards the next recession, we're far better done in control and a far better position to be very successful in managing credit through the cycle and so all of these things are, I think, are pretty self-evident today. Our non-accrual loans, again we've talked about before continue to come down quarter after quarter. We'll see some lumpiness like everybody does. But for the most, our outlook is very positive for 2017 relative the credit based on all the different things and the actions we've taken very deliberately with a lot of discipline in the last 18 months. Ken Usdin : Great, thanks for that color. And so, as a follow-up to that point, you've gone to the - it seems like more to the end of kind of cleaning up the book, cleaning out the book, and so as you pivot to future loan growth, obviously a couple of things where you are clearly talking about on the consumer side, but where do you expect to then be looking to grow, I should say, on the commercial side aside from what the environment will give us, is to change this philosophy in terms of like how fast you want to be growing in other parts of commercial and where do you see the commercial side growth coming from? Lars Anderson : Yeah, so first of all, I think, Ken, you\u2019ve touched on a good point. I mean part of it's going to be driven by the overall economic environment and that's why we guide towards GDP. But as we continue to build out our industry verticals, those are continuing to provide nice lift for us, as well as drive excellent fee income and frankly attractive returns for our shareholders. We're going to continue to focus on that. We're going to continue to build that industry expertise, but I would tell you in some of our core middle market regions, we've seen nice growth in North Carolina, Chicago, throughout the Europe, South Florida, Cincinnati, so we're going to continue to focus on execution, improving that client experience, investing in new industry verticals, and frankly growing what is a very healthy commercial real estate portfolio where we've really seen some nicely improved attractive asset quality metrics under a underwriting structure that is much different from the last cycle centralized in an expert line of business both on the line and with risk partners. Gregory Carmichael : Ken, the only other thing I would add to the Lars\u2019 comments, if you exclude the deliberate exits, we would have grown the commercial book 6% to 7% in 2016. So, it gives you some perspective of just how much lift we've done to reposition a book about quality and profitability. These guys have done a fantastic job. Ken Usdin : Helpful, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Gregory Carmichael : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Regarding the North Star initiatives, I just want to try to get a little bit more detail there. I know you just said that the amount of cost saves is about a third of the overall benefit that you expect out of the program. So, of that cost save component, can you give us an idea of the timing of the recognition as you move through \u201817 and then \u201818? I'm just trying to get an idea how we could really start to put that to numbers. And then separately around the revenue enhancement side, assuming obviously that\u2019s the rest of the savings that two-thirds, what type of revenue enhancement are you looking for? Thanks. Lars Anderson : Yeah. So, in terms of - the way we look at project North Start to give you a very broad picture, the qualification of the improvements in returns translates to a roughly $800 million type pretax income improvement between now and 2019. So, the way we think about it is there is a base performance uplift from the businesses that we have and in a base-case scenario probably roughly divided, let's call it a $300 million to $400 million. We can do that by managing the expenses and then growing the revenues that are already in place. And then we look at some of the balance sheet optimization targets that we are establishing. That probably, I don't know, it\u2019s called itself in the [ph] $100 million to $150 million range and then roughly another $150 million to $200 million in fee income growth. So, that leaves somewhere around $150 million or so in expenses. These are broad numbers. We will share more details with you. The timing of the expense saves will start coming in 2017. Some of them are already in play. You probably see the major restructuring and I think it will accelerate into 2018 and 2019. Some of the projects, underlying expensive projects relate to the commercial business and to redesign that project is picking up. It's going to have somewhat of a delayed impact, but again we would see probably a more meaningful save in 2018. And then there are other infrastructure investments that we're making. But that doesn't mean \u201817 does not have any of those. I think there are some expense initiatives in play that also will contribute to \u201817 and those are the types of details that we would like to share with you as we approach the year end and the beginning of the New Year [ph]. John Pancari : Okay good and then I know you gave the ROTCE expectations and ROA expectation. Have you given what this all means in terms of the efficiency ratio for North Star? Jamie Leonard : Our target for North Star John is sub 60 by the end of 2019 run rate. John Pancari : Okay all right and then secondly on just a quick here on the credit side do you have your shared national credit balance as of September 30,I believe it was around $26 billion or so last quarter. Jamie Leonard : It is right around $26 billion, that\u2019s correct. John Pancari : Okay, so unchanged. Jamie Leonard : Yeah, unchanged. John Pancari : And then the leverage loans, do you have that quantification? Tayfun Tuzun : We haven\u2019t given out that probably and I don\u2019t I think it is a little bit of misleading at this point given there is no single definition of market [ph] for us. Greg Carmichael : I would tell you that we have, continue to reposition that portfolio so that we position ourselves to outperform through more challenging economic times. We have been very specific and deliberate there so we are in a better position today. John Pancari : And you are talking about the leverage portfolio, correct? Greg Carmichael : Leverage portfolio. John Pancari : Okay and has there been any pressure to slow the growth initiative for the [ph] credit portfolio? Tayfun Tuzun : Well, what we are really focused on is buying relationship and building those out to the extent that we leverage the shared national credit market, that\u2019s more kind of just symptomatic, it is not an end for us, we are not focused on growing snick [ph] what we are focused on is growing industry expertise core middle market where we believe that we can add value, develop deep client relationships that fit within our risk appetite and provide attractive returns. Greg Carmichael : Let me add a little bit to that, if you look at the snick portfolio again which is $26 billion or about 49% of our total commercial book, its investment grade quality. If you exclude the inter GPs of snick for a moment we have very little lose in that. Our criticized asset levels 3.75% [ph] on the entire snick, but it\u2019s primarily an investment grade portfolio. Three quarters of that portfolio is as large as really deep relationships about a quarter is credit only and a lot of those are fairly new relationship to over building a relationship on, so this is not a standalone portfolio credit only book that we are buying jut to grow a portfolio. It is tied deeply into our strategy of dealing with relationships with top clients and I will tell you in many of our snick relationships we have a very meaningful piece of the fact that number of banks there is a syndicated facility [ph]. So we feel very good about it and I don\u2019t think at the end of the day all exceed 50% of our total book over time but we don\u2019t necessarily have a problem with where it is relative to the performance that has given us and the fact that it is built in to our core strategy of deepening our industry vertical in our lid cap relationship. John Pancari : Okay great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning guys. Greg Carmichael : Good morning Scott. Scott Siefers : I think at this point most of my questions have been answered but maybe Tayfun or Jamie just sort of take that question the base of running assets. So your end of period versus your average I think the end of period base is a couple of trillion dollars higher. Can you just go through sort of nuance of what happens with the base of running assets in the fourth quarter, just trying to get a sense for movement within the balance sheet. Jamie Leonard : Scott are you looking at end of period interest earning assets? Scott Siefers : Yeah exactly, which I think are about $2 billion to $2.5 billion higher than the average base. Jamie Leonard : Yeah, because in that you do have the $1.2 billion mark on the investment portfolio in the end of period and then you also will have a run up in some of the cash balances and then in our NIM guidance and our guidance for the fourth quarter we typically see a run up in those cash levels as we do expect strong deposit growth and so our short term overnight investments might have a little bit of a load there, but nothing that\u2019s - we are not expecting anything that\u2019s unreasonable to what it occurred last year. Tayfun Tuzun : If you look at Page 29 of the earnings release table on the just loan side you don\u2019t see that [indiscernible]. Scott Siefers : Okay, just the average just as kind of the [indiscernible] the best think to kind of go off nothing unusual at the end of period? Tayfun Tuzun : There is nothing unusual. Jamie Leonard : We haven\u2019t talked about it but I think part of what your question headed is just on the investment portfolio we will reinvest portfolio cash flows in the fourth quarter and that should result in average security portfolio being stable the third quarter level so, don\u2019t expect a lot of movement from the investment security both in the quarter. Scott Siefers : Okay, all right, that\u2019s perfect. Thank you for the clarification. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA, your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi I was looking for more color on project North Star, I didn\u2019t completely understand that base performance up lifts, you are looking for $800 million in additional pretax and it looks like about equal amount balance sheet optimization fees and expenses and that base performance uplift is what and just more generally how do you think about expenses over the next to get to that 12% to 14% RTCE, the expenses stay flat or they go up a little bit or down or what? Jamie Leonard : Based on the performance on the expense side is pretty flat Mike. I mean in terms of if you check out initiatives I think we probably will be lot more stability in the expenses and in terms of the expenses related to these initiatives and number of them are truly sort of well I guess more changes and investments that truly are going to lift revenue fairly quickly. So our goal clearly is to fund those expense initiatives, to fund those revenue initiatives with expenses elsewhere so, that\u2019s the only way we will be able to get to sub 60% efficiency level so we are not necessarily looking to have added investment cost to achieve revenue growth but actually achieve based expenses to fund those initiatives. Mike Mayo : So flat expenses from 2016 to 2019 is that the concept? Jamie Leonard : Mike just be patient with us as we finalize the details we will share more of it towards the end of the year or early next year. Mike Mayo : Okay and just a big picture question and you have 1191 branches now and you have been passed out of the Greg and reduced those branches, you have more to go and also your mobile banking that is big percent, 20% consumer deposits for mobile apps that I guess that is better than some big banks. What is the right number of branches as digital delivery catches hold I mean if you look out over the some three to four year period where could that number go? Greg Carmichael : Mike it is a great question and I don\u2019t know the answer, it really gets down, we looked it over 50 variables that we mentioned before when decided to close or consolidate branch. So it is really is driven by the consumer preferences and you\u2019re seeing that migration and adoption to our mobile apps on our digital capabilities, I think 40% plus of all of our checks are now coming digital channels, 20% through mobile, so that\u2019s going to pace us, could it be another 10% plus, absolutely. So we are going to look at this every single year, we\u2019ll continue to test against it, probably get through the lenses, 50 different variable we assess and we will continue to make adjustments to our branch infrastructure. Obviously that helps us fund some of our investments in digital or [indiscernible], so we are looking for that transformational cost also as we reduce our branch infrastructure, but more to come there as far as the pacing the numbers I am not comfortable giving you a number. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Greg Carmichael : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello, thank you for taking the question. If I look at slide 10, I can see that the capital ratios have continued to build up even with the pretty significant repurchase you got. So I was wondering given the changes we have been hearing from the Fed on how the [indiscernible] process is going to work, how they're going to look at different sorts of capital return, whether it's buyback or dividend, how does that influence your thinking on the role that increased capital return could play in getting you to that 12% to 14% ROTCE? Tayfun Tuzun : So, our thoughts around capital returns really don't incorporate a significantly different capital base than what we have today. So, we're not counting on our ability to leverage the balance sheet more so than what we are doing today. Clearly, we are cognizant of the communication coming down from the regulators in terms of the design of the regime that they're expecting over the next, a number of years. It's a little too early exactly how that will play an impact on our business. We are mildly positive. But in our financial projections, we are foreseeing a stable capital picture, give-or-take a quarter from where we are today. So, it is not meaningfully contributed to the return expectations that we have. Geoffrey Elliott : And then if I could just clarify on something you were saying earlier, I thought I caught a number of 1.3 or maybe 1.4 billion decline in leverage loans, but then I also heard you say you didn't disclose the leverage loan balances. So, maybe you could just kind of tie those two comments together? Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah, I think, Lars and then Greg have commented on the drop. We - the definition of leverage loans, of course, today is not quite uniform. So, it's a meaningful drop. Let me stay it that way. It's a meaningful drop from our leverage loan book. And I doubt that our leverage loan book is significantly different from peers. Frank, I don't know, if you want to - or Lars, if you want to comment on that? Frank Forrest : The thing to focus on with leverage lending at least from our perspective, there is all types of companies that are leveraged. That\u2019s where we've had injuries and where most of our peers, I think, have had issues. They\u2019ve been over reliance on enterprise value lending, financing M&A transactions and deals went sideways. And when they went sideways, the problem is the loss and the default [ph] is very high. That's our prior experience. And as a result of that, we've been very judicious and going through as Lars has talked about and looking at all of our client relationships, looking at our sponsor relationships, looking at the types of credits that we would finance, and our leverage environment, industries that we should consider and industries, probably cyclical industries for example, we probably shouldn't consider finance in a leverage environment. So, we talk about 1.4 billion reclassifying or leaving the books. It's the highest risk piece that we've focused on which are enterprise value deals, highly leveraged deals, clients who don't fit our risk profile and leverage that's outside of our comfort zone. And those are the credits that we\u2019re moving out. So, whether it's 10% or 20% to me it's a more meaningful number than that, because we're taking the highest risk slice of the portfolio and that\u2019s leaving the books. And what remains of portfolio that we think is performing very well. We have clients that we know well. We respect well. We have a great history with them through cycles and they have the ability to manage their leverage, because they\u2019ve proven it over time and it's the right kind of leverage in an industry that is much more stable versus much more cyclical. So, I think we know this space well. We\u2019re repositioning ourselves in a place where we can continue to be delivering leverage finance to the right clients, right relationships, the right returns with a lot less volatility than what we've had in the past. Geoffrey Elliott : Great, thank you. Lars Anderson : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi, a couple of questions. Tayfun, I think I heard you say that or maybe it was Greg about balance sheet optimization as part of project North Star and you've talked about reducing your single product relationship. So, how much more run-off should we expect from commercial loans as part of that? Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah. So, it is a core part of North Star as we look in particular as a commercial bank. It will be difficult to tell the exact number as we look out over the next three years. I would maybe give you a little guidance that all things being equal in the economic environment, as Greg had said, we've done a lot of the heavy lifting this past year around $2 billion. I could see another billion dollars of balance sheet optimization, but frankly that's going to be over a period of time and we're going to be reinvesting that capital in relationships that provide the right kinds of return and right risk profile for our company on a go forward basis. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And given then intense competition for C&I loans, you\u2019re confident of being able to get some higher spread, because obviously competition hasn\u2019t awaited given the loan growth we are seeing in the industry? Gregory Carmichael : Yeah, to that point, I mean, I think Lars and team have done a fantastic job and we have four quarters in a row. We've seen our yields improve in C&I lending. So, once again a testament to the work they've done to reposition the balance sheet and the relationships and, Lars, if you want to add any? Lars Anderson : Well, I would just kind of go back to the prior question. This is about balance sheet management. This is about prudently using our capital and reinvesting it in the right kinds of relationships. And it's not just about credit, it's about the entire relationships. It's about the solutions in developing deep strategic advisory type relationships and we're seeing that happen and play out on a go-forward basis. So, I would just underscore as I look across almost every business line that we have in the commercial bank, we've either stabilized or slightly increased and in some cases moderately increased our core loan spreads, which has allowed our company really to benefit from a large part of the rise that we've seen in LIBOR or in some institutions you've seen some of that absorbed away within our spreads. Let me tell you something. The market is no easier today from a competitive environment perspective than it was several quarters ago. In fact, I would submit that it is more aggressive today. Smaller banks are going up market. Larger banks are going down market and non-banks are playing at levels we haven't seen before. So, we're going to have to be at our best. So, frankly we've got great bankers with great businesses. I've got a lot of confidence in them that we can continue not just for bulk orders, but for the long-term to produce. Vivek Juneja : And with this asset-based lending fit into that, has that been as part of your growth in this? Lars Anderson : Yeah, that's a great question. So, asset-based lending, as you know, we would not include in the leverage lending portfolio. But it\u2019s something that\u2019s very attractive. When we are out with the client, we want to be very active in providing a broad range of solutions including credit solutions. ABL has not been a growth area of this company. We have a new leader. We have a new team in a number of our producers and we have new alignments both on the line and in credit and we see it as a significant area of growth for us on a go-forward basis. One of the benefits of that is it's a very relationship-centric type extension of credit with treasury management and other products and services and it also tends to outperform when the cycle turns, which is complimentary to what Greg shared with us as the vision for our company. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Tayfun, if I may, just one quick one. Tax rate, very low for fourth quarter, is that a sustainable longer term rate and if so, what are you doing to get that much loss you\u2019ve seen of [ph] any of our banks? Tayfun Tuzun : So, I think we commented that there was a positive tax impact from a couple of lease terminations here this quarter. Look, in terms of the tax as a combination of the fact that we are using a different accounting for our low income housing investments and leasing business really is contributing as well. I gave you some guidance for the next quarter and beyond that I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any other color on the tax rate. Vivek Juneja : Yeah, my thought was, is the next quarter\u2019s tax rates sustainable level going forward or is that just good to be in an unusually low level for that quarter? Tayfun Tuzun : Let\u2019s talk about next year - when we give the guidance for next year Vivek. The 23.5 to 24.5 for the next quarter right now is the only comment that I\u2019ll make. Vivek Juneja : Okay, all right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray Your line is open. Kevin Barker : Good morning, could you just expand upon some of the declines that you\u2019re seeing in your auto loan balances. I know you\u2019re re-pricing your yields on that, but are you moving into a more riskier credit or a less riskier credit, given that the yields are moving higher in that portfolio? Lars Anderson : That is more about our approach heading into the year to trend back production in some of the lower spread, lower yielding asset classes. So for us last year we originated close to 5 billion, this year our expectation is, we\u2019d be in the $3.4 billion range in terms of auto originations. But the credit profile this year - the average FICO was 746 year-to-date where 56% used, 45% new and that\u2019s consistent with \u201815 levels, so it was 69 month average term and obviously the rations are much shorter than that and advance rate LTB is in the 91% range this year. So it\u2019s pretty much the same old [ph] that we\u2019ve had versus prior years. It\u2019s more a function of trimming volume and focusing on getting better pricing. Kevin Barker : So when you refer to better risk adjusted pricing, you\u2019re just saying it\u2019s not worth it to take market share in this type of market, is that fair? Lars Anderson : Absolutely right. Kevin Barker : Okay and then are you seeing the competitive pressures being stronger in the higher FICO scores or in the lower FICO scores? Lars Anderson : I think the competitive pressures are about the same, I mean everybody is sort of focusing on this broad spectrum of origination and some even lower FICO bans than we are. Kevin Barker : Okay, thank you for taking my questions. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Sameer Shripad Gokhale : Okay, thank you Shelby and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department and we\u2019ll be happy to assist you. Operator : This concludes this morning\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Larry and I will be the conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank Q4 2016 Earnings Release. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Sameer Gokhale, you may begin your conference. Sameer Gokhale : Thank you, Larry. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we\u2019ll be discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2016. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We\u2019ve identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. Additionally, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference to in today\u2019s conference call are included in our earnings release along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. A copy of our most recent quarterly earnings release can be accessed by the public in the Investor Relation section of our corporate website www.53.com. This morning, I\u2019m joined on the call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up to questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg? Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Sameer and thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you\u2019ll see in our results, we reported full year 2016 net income of $1.6 billion and EPS of $1.93 per share. We believe that 2016 marks an inflexion point for Fifth Third. During the year, we took a number of important steps to help position our bank to deliver superior results through business cycles and better serve our customers. In September, we announced project North Star with a specific financial goal of generating a return on tangible common equity of 12% to 14% by the end of 2019. For the course of the year, we invested heavily in risk management, compliance and information technology. We invested in FinTech companies such as GreenSky, ApplePie, AvidXchange, and Transactis. We\u2019re also pleased to receive a partnership with QED Investors, a leading FinTech venture capital firm. In addition, we announced the acquisition of Retirement Corporation of America, a registered investment advisor. We continue to evaluate acquisitions that would help augment fee revenue. Several of these investments particularly on the digital side are table stakes. Over time, we believe that these partnerships and investments will help us one; expand our delivery channels, two; enhance our digital capabilities, three; develop new process services and four; drive additional business volume. During the year, we took several actions to help improve the profitability of our bank for enhancing our ability to serve our customers. We announced the agreement with Black Knight to consolidate our existing mortgage platforms. This investment will lower our cost in resi mortgages, increase our mortgage loan origination capacity and significantly improve our customer experience. We\u2019re continuing to invest in areas of automation to optimize operations. Reflecting the rapid change of technology and customer behavior, we\u2019re on track to implement our omni-channel strategies. We believe this will allow us to better serve the needs of our customers. Over the last 18 months, we have closed or announced plans to close branches representing 12% of our branch network. There\u2019s been good response to both in changing customer preferences and our desire to need of focus in our core markets. We initiate a program to redesign our commercial client experience which will streamline many of our processes from end-to-end and reduce our cost to deliver. We renegotiate several key vendor contracts driving significant run rate savings. We\u2019re focused on relationships that meet our risk adjusted return hurdles, we were unwilling to sacrifice spreads or credit quality for balance sheet growth. As an outcome of our disciplined approach, we exited $3.5 billion of commercial loans that did not meet our desire risk or return profile. Excluding these deliberate exits, our period end commercial loans would have been up 7% year-over-year. We launched two credit card products which should help drive higher returns in loan growth over time, both in credit cards and other consumer loans should also allow us to achieve a better balance better commercial and consumer loan growth. During the year, while we continue to make investments, we kept a close eye on expenses. In 2016, our expenses only increased by 3.4% compared to our initial expectations of 4.5% to 5% at the start of the year. We tend to continue to generate positive operating leverage in 2017 and beyond. Lastly, we remain prudent[ph] towards capital and returned nearly $1 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases in 2016 even as our capital levels improved. There\u2019s more work to be done but we believe that the steps we took in 2016 will help us achieve our performance objectives. Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication over the last year. I believe the foundation we have laid in 2016 will position the bank to deliver higher and more resilient returns in 2017 and beyond. Moving to the fourth quarter results, we reported net income to common shareholders of $372 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.49. Some non-core items highlighted in the earnings release resulted in a positive $0.01 impact through core earnings per share in the quarter. Tayfun will provide full details about these items in his opening comments. Our adjusted net interest margin expanded three basis points sequentially. This improvement reflected our continued focus on higher quality customer relationships and the benefit of higher interest rates during the quarter. Expenses were down 1% this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2016 as we continue to tightly manage expenses in this environment. Credit quality continued to improve with a significant in criticized asset levels for the fourth consecutive quarter. A decrease in criticized assets provides further evidence of our focus on stability, and maintained relationships for a better credit profile. Net charge-offs also continued to improve this quarter. On a full year basis, our commercial net charge-off ratio was the lowest that has been in the past 15 years. While we continue to expect the benign credit environment to continue for the foreseeable future, charge-offs can exhibit quarterly variability. Fee income was up 2% sequentially, adjusted for notable items in the earnings release. Fee revenue was down 2% year-over-year driven by lower mortgage and retail brokerage banking revenue. We believe that we have an opportunity to accelerate fee growth in 2017 led by our capital mortgage business. We also think evaluating strategic acquisitions that will help drive fee growth. Production metrics remain strong but the mortgage originations were affected by seasonality and higher rates in Q4. Volume of $2.7 billion was down 5% sequentially but up 54% from last year. Our commercial loan production for relationship manager was up 80% with fees for relationship manager up 30% year-over-year. Our investments in digital channel are paying off, approximately 61% of all transactions are made through digital channels compared to 30% just a few years ago. Overall, we have seen a 29% increase in mobile usage year-over-year. We have also seen a 170% increase year-over-year in checking and savings accounts opened online. Our capital levels remain strong and improved from last quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 10.4% and 10.17% last quarter. The strength of our balance sheet and earnings allow us to increase our common dividend by approximately 8% or $0.14 per share in December. At Fifth Third, we still believe in supporting our communities. In the fourth quarter, we publicly announced our five year $30 billion community commitment with National Community Reinvestment Coalition. We were pleased to work with CEO John Taylor and 145 of their member organization signing on to a program that will improve lives in communities we serve. It includes broad-based lending, investment and services plan. We also announced a new financial alliance with EverFi, a leader in digital and structural technology. We believe this mission will educate more than 150,000 high school students annually throughout our footprint. Overall, I\u2019m pleased that our strong results for the year enabled us to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders, make strategic investments and support the communities we serve. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our 4Q results and our current outlook for some additional color in our project North Star. Tayfun? Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I will start with the financial summary on slide four of the presentation. As Greg mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter. During the quarter, the expansion of our underlying net interest margin, the sequential decline in our expenses and excellent credit quality reflect our continued commitment to driving improved financial performance. For the fourth quarter, there was a net positive impact of $0.01 per share resulting from several items; the most significant item was the $16 million pre-tax charge to provide refunds to certain credit card customers, offset by the previously disclosed Vantiv gain, a positive mark from our Visa swap and a tax benefit from the early adoption of an accounting standard. Our adjusted net interest margin which excludes the credit card charge, expanded three basis points sequentially. We maintained pricing discipline during the quarter and our asset sensitive position allowed us to benefit from the rising interest rate environment. Our reported NIM contracted by two basis points. Expenses remained tightly controlled as we continue to look for efficiencies throughout the organization. Credit quality was excellent as evidenced by our ongoing improvement in criticized assets and a decline in net charge-offs during the quarter. Our focus on improving our returns led us to deliberately exit certain commercial relationships and reduce indirect auto-loan originations. This led to a sequential decline in our total loan portfolio. In aggregate, we exited approximately $3.5 billion of commercial loans in 2016 and we expect to exit roughly another $1.5 billion in 2017. So with that, let\u2019s move to slide five for the balance sheet discussion. Average commercial loan balances were down 1% sequentially and flat year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, throughout the year we made deliberate decisions to exit lending relationships that do not meet our desired risk and return profile. This had a negative impact on C&I balances which decreased by 1% both sequentially and year-over-year. During the quarter, we maintained our origination spread levels as LIBOR increased, driving a five basis point increase in our C&I yield. We will continue to optimize the portfolio to achieve better returns while improving the stability of our credit performance. The sequential decline in average C&I balances was partially offset by 1% growth in commercial real-estate this quarter. As we have discussed in prior calls, in construction as well as in firm lending, our teams are cognizant of valuation and supply-demand dynamics. Our disciplined client selection and credit underwriting in commercial real-estate will continue to rely on stringent standards. Average construction loans grew by 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter. As a sign of healthy construction portfolio, loan run-off increased this quarter as underlying projects were completed and sold or refinanced. Our pipelines are diversifying away from multi-family and we are becoming more selective as the sector gets deeper into the later phase of the cycle. Average consumer loans were flat from last quarter and were down 2% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 3% from last quarter and 13% year-over-year in line with our reduced originations. Throughout 2016, we maintained a consistent focus on improving the profitability of this business. We are continuing to work on additional tactical changes to further improve the returns in 2017. Residential mortgage loans grew by 3% sequentially and 10% year-over-year as we kept jumbo mortgages, ARMs as well as certain 10 year and 15 year fixed rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as loan pay downs exceeded origination volumes. Our originations this quarter were seasonally down 14% compared to last quarter and flat year-over-year. Our credit card portfolio grew by 1% sequentially but was down 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 including the impact of the sale of the Agent portfolio in June. Excluding the sale of the Agent Bank portfolio in the second quarter of 2015, our credit card portfolio would have grown by 3% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. The introduction of two new credit card products last October and investments we are making to significantly upgrade our analytical capabilities should lead to faster growth in credit card outstandings. In addition to our new initiatives in credit card lending, our GreenSky partnership should support faster consumer loan growth as well. We started funding loans in October and are confident that our partnership will help us achieve a better balance between commercial and consumer loan growth. Average investment securities increased 3% sequentially in the fourth quarter, partially due to under investment during the previous quarter. Our investment portfolio yield was stable with only a one basis point decline sequentially. We had three top priorities for 2016 in terms of managing our balance sheet. First, we wanted to make material progress in positioning our loan portfolio for improved and stable returns through the cycle; second, we sought to balance our interest rate risk exposure; third, we wanted to maintain a healthy level of liquidity on our balance sheet. We achieved all three goals by focusing on originating loans that met our targeted return requirements, exiting relationships with sub-par risk return profiles and optimizing our mix of liabilities. These objectives will also remain our top priorities for 2017. At this time, we have exited approximately two-thirds of the commercial lending relationships that did not meet our desired profile and have roughly another $1.5 billion to go. Excluding these deliberate exits, we expect to grow total commercial loans by 4% to 5% in 2017. Including these exits, we expect our commercial loan portfolio to grow by closer to 2% at year-end. We plan to maintain indirect auto loan originations at $3.4 billion in 2017 which will likely result in a roughly $1.5 billion decline in that portfolio. Including the impact of the auto run-off, we expect our overall consumer loan portfolio to grow modestly in 2017 on a period end basis. We also expect to maintain our investment portfolio at roughly the same level we are at today. Average core deposits increased 2% sequentially driven by increased commercial interest checking account balances and consumer money market account balances. Excluding the impact of the two market exits, Pittsburgh and St. Louis, average core deposits were up 2% on a year-over-year basis. Inclusive of the impact of the market exits, core deposit growth was approximately 1% year-over-year. Our modified liquidity coverage ratio of 128% at the end of the year was very strong and exceeded the new 100% minimum. Moving to NII on slide six of the presentation. Excluding the impact of the credit card charge, taxable equivalent net interest income increased $12 million or 1% sequentially. Including the charge, NII was down $4 million to $909 million. The impact of the credit card item was partially offset by improved short-term market grades in the fourth quarter and higher investment securities balances. Excluding the credit card charge, the NIM on an FTE basis increased three basis points from the third quarter to 2.91%. The impact of the charge was five basis points resulting in a two basis point contraction in our reported NIM. Fourth quarter margin performance was largely driven by an increase in short-term market rates during the quarter and continued pricing discipline in our loan portfolio. We expect the NIM to widen by approximately 8% to 9% basis points from the fourth quarter reported number to about 2.95% in the first quarter. On a full year basis, we expect the NIM to range between 2.95% and 3%. The low end of the range is based on the rate scenario with no additional Fed moves, while the upper end of the range assumes two additional Fed moves in June and September. We will continue to execute a balance interest rate risk management strategy as we have done over the last three years. Our risk management approach aims to limit a downside impact of low interest rates while maintaining an asset sensitive position. The cumulative increase in LIBOR over the last two quarters, and our ability to maintain pricing discipline have had a sizeable positive impact on our NIM. If the expectations for higher interest rates actually materialize, NIM expansion will be a function of deposit pricing lags and betas. Our disclosures on this topic are very transparent in terms of the impact of various interest rate and deposit balance scenarios. Including the impact of day count, we expect our first quarter net interest income to be up by 1.5% to 2% from the reported fourth quarter net interest income. With the background of our earning asset growth expectations that I detailed earlier, we are projecting full year net interest income growth of 3.5% to 5% bracketed by the two rate scenarios that I just outlined. Shifting to fees on slide seven of the presentation. Fourth quarter non-interest income was $620 million compared with $840 million in the third quarter. Our fee income adjusted for items disclosed in our earnings release was $608 million, up 2% from the adjusted third quarter level. Mortgage banking net revenue of $65 million was flat sequentially as lower production gains were offset by positive net MSR valuation adjustments during the quarter. Originations were seasonally down 5% from last quarter and up 54% year-over-year. During the quarter, 41% of our origination mix consisted of purchase volumes and 59% consisted of refinance volumes. Approximately 70% of the originations continued to be sourced from the retail and direct channels and the remainder were originated through the correspondent channel. Gains on sale were down 51% sequentially reflecting the lower origination volume and 132 basis points aside of gain on sale margin. Net MSR valuation adjustments were positive at $23 million compared to a negative $9 million last quarter. Corporate banking fees of $101 million were down $10 million or 9% sequentially, reflecting the impact of election related volatility from the time of capital markets activity. Decreases in institutional sales revenue and lease remarketing fees were partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange fees. In 2016, we grew our capital markets fees by 14% reflecting strong performance in all of our investment banking products including M&A advisory, equity capital markets and corporate bank underwriting revenue. Additionally, adjusted for a lease residual impairment reported in 2015, our corporate banking fees were up 4% for the full year in 2016. These results suggest that our relationship driven model and our efforts to increase the scale and scope of our product offerings are bearing fruit. We expect corporate banking fees in the first quarter to be stable relative to the fourth quarter. Deposits service charges decreased 1% from the third quarter and 2% relative to the fourth quarter of 2015. This primarily reflected reduced monthly service charges as part of our new consumer checking account line up. Total wealth and asset management revenue of $5 million was down 1% sequentially. Our focus on reducing reliance on transactional revenue has resulted in nearly 80% of fourth quarter fees now being driven by recurring resources versus 73% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenues declined 2% relative to the fourth quarter of 2015 mainly due to lower retail brokerage fees. Result of the fourth quarter included $9 million pre-tax gain from the Vantiv warrant exit that we announced during the quarter. With this transaction, we have exited our remaining warrant position and the final tally on our Vantiv warrants is $812 million in pre-tax gains for our shareholders. Our recurring TRA payment of $33 million is also included in our total non-interest income. Third quarter results were affected by the TRA termination and settlement transactions. The Vantiv related transactions during the last two quarters were very beneficial in terms of managing the risk parameters around our financial interest in Vantiv and reducing volatility in our reported results. Excluding mortgage-banking revenue and non-core items shown on slide 14 of the presentation, we expect non-interest income to grow by 3.5% to 4% in 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, on the same basis, and excluding the annual $33 million TRA payment in the fourth quarter, we expect non-interest income to be roughly flat sequentially. In addition, we expect mortgage origination fees to decline by 10% to 15% in the first quarter. Next, I\u2019d like to discuss non-interest expense on slide eight of the presentation. Expenses were well managed this quarter down $13 million or 1% compared to the third quarter to $960 million. As Greg stated earlier, we are making good progress in executing on key strategic initiatives while controlling expense growth. For the full year, our expense growth was under 3.5% year-over-year compared to our initial guidance of 4.5% to 5% at the start of the year. We expect expenses in 2017 to be up 1% compared to 2016. Our guidance includes incremental expenses associated with new initiatives under North Star. In the absence of North Star related expenses, we would have expected our total expenses to decline by about 0.5% in 2017. Over the past few months, we have stated that we intend to achieve positive operating leverage in 2017 and today\u2019s guidance reflects that expectation. More importantly, we believe that we will achieve positive operating leverage, even if the Fed decides not to raise interest rates further. Once again, I\u2019d like to remind you that our total expenses includes the amortization of our low income housing investments, which most of our peers reflect in their tax line. In 2016, this line item added 3% to our efficiency ratio. Our first quarter expenses will be more elevated this year relative to other years due to timing of certain expenses. We have changed the grand date for our long-term compensation award this year for all of our recipients which will pull forward about $15 million of expenses from the second quarter to the first quarter. In the first quarter, including a merit increase that will become effective during the quarter, we expect our total expenses to be approximately 2% higher year-over-year. Slide nine has a list of initiatives which we shared with investment community last month. As you can see, we are not and we were not expecting a significant revenue impact from these initiatives in 2017. They are in the execution phase and will be providing support for revenue growth in 2018 and beyond. The important note related to these initiatives is that we are paying for these investments by cutting costs elsewhere. Turning to credit results on slide 10. Net charge-offs were $73 million or 31 basis points in the fourth quarter, an improvement from $107 million and 45 basis points in the third quarter of 2016 and $80 million or 34 basis points in the fourth quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily due to $36 million decrease in C&I charge-offs. Recoveries during the quarter were down $6 million from last quarter and $1 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. Total portfolio non-performing loans were $660 million, up $59 million from the previous quarter resulting in an NPL ratio of 72 basis points. The sequential increase was driven almost exclusively by a single RBL credit in our energy portfolio that is well collateralized and current on all interest. Our criticized assets were down $354 million quarter-over-quarter. Our criticized asset ratio has steadily declined over the last five quarters and continues to be at the lowest levels since before the financial crisis. The decline in criticized assets and low net charge-offs suggest that the credit quality should remain relatively stable. However, credit losses especially on the commercial side - also on a quarterly basis. Our loss position was $26 million lower than last quarter. Our resulting reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases of 1.36% was one basis points lower than both last quarter and last year. At the end of 2016, our reserve coverage was among the highest in our peer group and well above the median. Our total net charge-offs in 2016 were $363 million or 39 basis points. Our previous guidance that net charge-offs will be range bound with some quarterly variability is unchanged. Also we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth. Moving on to capital and liquidity on slide 11. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.4%, an increase of 23 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 58 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the fourth quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately $5 million or 1% compared to the third quarter of 2016 and down 36 million shares or 4% compared to the last year\u2019s fourth quarter. During the quarter, we executed an accelerated share repurchase of $155 million which reduced the share count by $4.8 million shares, primarily reflecting the decline in unrealized securities gains given the rising rate environment, our book value and tangible book value were down 3% and 4% respectively from last quarter. Book value and tangible book value were up 7% and 8% respectively compared to last year. As I mentioned perilously, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased by 58 basis points from 9.82% at the end of 2015 to 10.4% at the end of 2016. This result, when combined with 1$ billion capital distribution to our shareholders during the year, demonstrates our ability to generate capital at Fifth Third. As we are now going through this year\u2019s CCAR exercise, it is too early to give you meaningful color on our expectations, but sufficed to say, that we will remain good stewards of our shareholders\u2019 capital. During the past four to five years, we targeted stable capital ratios entering the new CCAR cycle and in near term, we would expect to maintain the same approach. The composition of our capital distribution between dividends and share buybacks will be reviewed and approved by our board. With respect to our taxes, the early adoption of an accounting change had a positive impact on our taxes in the fourth quarter of approximately $6 million. We expect our first quarter and full year 2017 tax rate to be in the mid-25% range. Given the anticipation for meaningful changes in the corporate tax regime, there\u2019s a lot of interest in how potential changes may impact our effective rates. It is clearly very early to confidently predict the nature of these potential changes. Our tax positions are similar to other financial institutions in the form of tax credits associated with low income housing, a small portfolio and a very small mini portfolio in some leasing activities. All else being equal, we believe that we should be able to allow a large percentage of any reduction in corporate tax rates to drop towards bottom line, but it is too early to define on the dynamics of the competitive environment and how that may ultimately impact bank\u2019s ability to retain any potential benefits associated with the anticipated changes. Our 2017 financial plan reflects the benefits from our recent actions and provides the four core initiatives of the North Star. These initiatives will leverage our strength in middle market lending, industry verticals and specialty lending areas in our commercial business. In the consumer business, growth initiatives in mortgage banking, credit card and personal lending will provide support for more balanced growth in our overall loan portfolio. We continue to expand our capabilities in businesses such as capital market, insurance and wealth management which generate attractive returns. Our revenue growth outlook, our ability to achieve positive operating leverage without changing our risk appetite, our ongoing discipline of maintaining a strong balance sheet and a longer term strategic positioning of our business lines together provide a positive backdrop for our shareholders. We have included the updated outlook on slide 12 for your reference and with that let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call for the Q&A. Sameer Gokhale : Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We\u2019ll do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Larry, please open the call up for questions. Operator : Yes sir. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. You may ask your question. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning everyone. Just the first question if you could talk about just the overall balance sheet, Tayfun in reference to still some C&I relationships that you\u2019re still exiting and you\u2019re also exiting auto. So just in the context of your loan growth and keeping securities balances fairly flat, would you expect to see much change in the overall size of the balance sheet? How would you just kind of imagine the moving parts across that? Tayfun Tuzun : Ken, I think with the flat investment portfolio and the 2% year-over-year growth, earning assets will grow. It\u2019s probably going to be closer to sort of 1% type number as the average the two dollar items. Ken Usdin : And as far as loan growth then and your commentary on credit, just wondering if you could help us understand I think reserving for growth makes reasonable sense. But any context you can give us around recency of your loss expectations, you guys have had a pretty decent swing in your quarterly losses, I\u2019m understanding we\u2019re at that lumpy part, but just a way to understand kind of how to think about your progression on just underlying credit for the year would be helpful? Thanks. Frank Forrest : Hey, this is Frank. Good question. We\u2019ve had very consistent asset quality results in this year and back in 2016. And again, our focus has been on deliberately changing the risk part of the balance sheet, as you know had a significant number of de-risking activities both on the consumer and the commercial side of the portfolio. We don\u2019t have a significant energy book, it\u2019s very small so we\u2019ve not really had any losses of any size there. Our commercial real-estate book\u2019s performing really well and it\u2019s limited and it\u2019s capped at 15% from a concentration limit of our total book which is lower than our peers. We have a larger midcap book into large cap that is primarily investment grade and it\u2019s performed exceptionally well. The other thing to consider relative to NPLs we reported $660 million NPLs for the year, 72 basis points, 31% of that number are tied to energy and they\u2019re tied to reserve based loans which are very well secure. And the loss profile on that portfolio is roughly 2% max in our opinion, that\u2019s far lower than what you would typically see in an NPL portfolio with substandard loans that generally as a portfolio have anywhere from 10% to 15%-20% loss. So again, the profile of that portfolio by the NPLs the balance sheet management composition of our assets we believe is well diversified and that does very well and we expect in 2017 that are credit losses as Tayfun said should be range bound but should be down for what we reported this year which was 39 basis points at an enterprise level. Ken Usdin : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliot from Autonomous Research. Please ask your question. Geoffrey Elliot : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. You helped give us some numbers around expense growth what that would be without the incremental North Star investments. Can you help us think about the same sort of math on fees and on net interest income? What would that look like without North Star this year? Tayfun Tuzun : So on fees Geoffrey, as we indicated before, we were not expecting much of a lift in 2017. These initiatives are underway, some of them will come to their final phases this year. For example, the mortgage system will go online the fourth quarter of this year, there are others on the capital market side. We are gradually executing that includes potential insurance etcetera. So our expectations with respect to fee income were focused on growth in 2018 and beyond. We have significant investments in our credit card and personal lending areas that would be encouraging both from a fee side as well as the balance sheet side in 2018 and 2019. So, my overall comment is whether it\u2019s NII or fee income, in 2017, you are seeing the results of what we have done so far through the end of 2016. On the expense side, we clearly have started executing some of the expense initiatives earlier in 2016. Now if you include some of the exit strategies in commercial in 2017, those are more negative than positive for NII as you can imagine from \u2013 just the pure 2017 calendar year perspective. So that\u2019s why some of the 2017 guidance appears to be a bit more muted, but we are pretty optimistic as we look forward into \u201818 and \u201819. Geoffrey Elliot : Thanks. And then just to follow up on fees, I think you said something on mortgage income sequentially, I wondered if you could just repeat that for us. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, the mortgage income we expect the origination income to be 10% to 15% above I think we said last year\u2019s levels. And that\u2019s purely obviously was just an impact of interest rates actually in mortgage a number of our efforts as we get closer to year-end will boost our ability to support a higher origination level. We just need to manage that transition period between higher interest rates and our new system coming online in an efficient manner. Geoffrey Elliot : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Please ask your question. Erika Najarian : Yes, hi. Good morning. Frank Forrest : Good morning. Erika Najarian : I just wanted a little bit of clarification on your loan growth guide for the year and thank you very much for giving us the details underneath. So, if I\u2019m taking 2% of $92.1 billion that assume $1.8 billion of net gross. And I\u2019m wondering given your guide for C&I of 2% so that\u2019s about $830 million and then you have the $1.5 billion of decline in auto. I\u2019m wondering where the rest of the growth is coming from? Frank Forrest : So you have the numbers are roughly \u2013 on the C&I side we will see growth \u2013 on the commercial side, we will see continued growth in construction, so that will be one source of growth just on a year-over-year basis. We clearly will see some moderate growth in leasing and we expect to see growth in credit card outstandings on a Q4-over-Q4 level and relative stability may be little bit of growth in mortgage as well. And then you also have the positive impact of our GreenSky partnership which we said would produce about $90 million to $100 million growth on a quarterly basis. Greg Carmichael : Should be about $300 million for the full year, 2017. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just to clarify on the fee guide for the first quarter, so obviously taking out Vantiv and mortgage, we\u2019re looking for stable fees from the $510 million base from 4Q? Frank Forrest : On a core basis, no. On that base, we will have growth I mean we\u2019re clearly are not taking our guidance down to $510 million for the first quarter. And I think we need to get you a little bit more detail. We are expecting sort of stable to moderate growth in so our processing income, deposit fees should be stable. We guided for stability I think in corporate banking overall and wealth and asset management should be stable to moderate growth because there are some seasonal factors there that support Q1 growth. The bigger change clearly will be in other sort of non-interest income \u2013 other fees which includes the $33 million impact from TRA payments. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Frank Forrest : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please ask your question. Scott Siefers : Good morning. I guess first question, can you just clarify the dollar base of which you are guiding for 1% growth in expenses? I think you guys reported $3.9 billion in \u201816 and there was some noise so you get $35 million $40 million lower if you were to use an adjusted base, what is that base? Frank Forrest : I mean that\u2019s what we are using basically the same, the $3.9 billion number\u2026 Scott Siefers : $3.9 billion? Okay. Perfect. And then I think I\u2019m getting a little confused on fee guidance now, when you say, so I want to follow up on Erika\u2019s question, when you say adjusted flat excluding mortgage in the first quarter, exclude mortgage in the TRA payment. I think that does come to about $510 million so is that adjusted flat with year-over-year or may be if you can just clarify that? Tayfun Tuzun : That\u2019s for sequentially, adjusted for the TRA payment and mortgage, flat sequential Scott. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right. Perfect. Let\u2019s see, I think that does it for me. Actually one final question, provision was about as low as it\u2019s been in last three or so. I imagine a portion of that was to release that some reserves in the energy portfolio. Is it realistic to think that you could repeat and have provisions this low again, or would we revert to something along the lines of what\u2019s been the last few quarters I think we\u2019re in that kind of $90 million to $100 million per quarter range. Do you have any sense or can you provide any clarity there? Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah so without necessarily giving a precise guidance on total provision dollars, I would point out that this quarter\u2019s provision as lower due to one significantly lower commercial charge off dollar number and two, the EOP over EOP declined in loan balances. So as loan balances grow, you clearly are going to \u2013 with these releases of growth in that line item and then Frank just talked about overall in terms of charge-off expectations. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily take the $28 million commercial charge-off and project that over the entire year on a quarterly basis which will guide your provision expectations a little bit. Scott Siefers : Yeah, okay. Good, I appreciate the color. Thanks guys. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question. Ken Zerbe : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Sorry to keep asking about this, but just on the mortgage banking side, I just want to make sure I\u2019m really, really clear because I heard the 10% to 15%, is that first quarter versus fourth quarter or is that full year \u201817 down 10 to 15 versus full year \u201816? Frank Forrest : No I\u2019m not guiding full year mortgage guidance, I\u2019m basically guiding 10% to 15% and I\u2019m talking only about sort of the \u2013 if we give guidance, we\u2019re only giving guidance over just for the origination of fees and we\u2019re saying that the origination fees should be 10% to 15% lower than what we saw in the fourth quarter of this year. Ken Zerbe : Versus of the $65 million, got it. Frank Forrest : $65 million includes the MSR gains, so I\u2019m not giving guidance on MSR, I\u2019m only giving guidance on just the \u2013 of these which is about $30 million or so. Ken Zerbe : Got it. So $30 million down 10% to 15% and then all the MSR\u2026 Frank Forrest : And then you have basically the servicing fees, the servicing assets, amortization etcetera, that would make up the rest of the mortgage revenue line item. Ken Zerbe : Got it. All right. Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi, I want to make sure I understand what you\u2019re guiding to. So for 2017, you\u2019re guiding for at least 250 basis points of positive operating leverage assuming no rate hikes, is that correct? In other words, you take the 3.5% for net interest income and at least 3.5% for fees, that\u2019s the 3.5%, you guided for expenses for 1% that would be 250 basis points of positive operating leverage. Is that correct or no? Frank Forrest : The only thing that I would point out Mike is that we are not providing \u2013 there is a mortgage line item that we\u2019re not providing there. So you need to include that in your numbers and just to make sure that we\u2019re all on the same page, the basis that we\u2019re using for that is $3.64 billion of net interest income in 2016, about $2.4 billion number for fees in 2016 and about a $3.9 billion non-interest expense in 2016. So, yes I mean we\u2019re giving you a very clear guidance on the percentages. Mike Mayo : Okay, so we plug this in our model later, if we include mortgage, how much positive operating leverage would you expect \u2013 would you still expect it assuming no rate hike? Frank Forrest : Well I\u2019m not giving you mortgage guidance so therefore I don\u2019t think I can answer your question. But just sufficed to say that we are expecting positive operating leverage and wherever our efficiency ratio ends up, you need to subtract 3% from that to make it comparable to our peer group statistics. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then one follow up, North Star, you\u2019re targeting a 12% to 14% ROTCE by the end of 2019. In 2016, the way you look at it, the reported was 11.6% in 2016, we had a lot of noise, what would you consider a poor ROTCE in 2016? And if you were just to give us some very simple waterfall on how you get from your core ROTCE in 2016 to the 12% to 14% that would be helpful? Tayfun Tuzun : I think we gave some indication as to how we go from the current level \u2013 I think the number that we\u2019re looking for 2016 in terms of core ROTCE is probably about 10%. So, - and we will take you and I think we\u2019ve given you some examples as to how that 10% gets to 12% to 14% and the combination of expense saves, balance sheet \u2013 and fee income growth. And Mike we will continue to clarify that path as we execute these initiatives. But obviously the current environment, it materializes whether it\u2019s with respect to interest rates or the tax rates, our expectation is that we would clearly be closer to the upper range of that guidance because we clearly stated that we would reach the lower range of our guidance with no rate increases and a meaningful change in the environment. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Unidentified Company Representative : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Couple of areas clarification again, sorry if there\u2019s any repeating going on here, but in terms of how to think about the end of period loan balance for the fourth quarter here, that was good amount below the average of loan balance I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s because of some of the loan exits that came in late in the quarter. So therefore it\u2019s still a fair base to grow off of as we think of \u2013 growth in loans going into next quarter? Greg Carmichael : John the only comment I\u2019ll make and let Lars give some color on is, it\u2019s roughly $1.2 billion of the $3.5 billion that we talked about exits expected in our credit hurdles or our return hurdles $1.2 billion that was in the fourth quarter. If you exclude the $3.5 billion, we would have been up 7% year-over-year on end of period basis on commercial loans. I\u2019ll let Lars add a little bit color there. Lars Anderson : Yeah John, keep in mind as you know the end of period number that\u2019s a balance sheet item, it\u2019s a point in time. We\u2019ve already seen frankly a rebound in utilization rates for example in corporate banking, it was off about 200 basis points on a linked quarter basis end of period. We did see encouragingly in the core metal market in the regions about 100 basis points pick up which we do think is may be a reflection of some improved optimism that we\u2019re hearing across our footprint from our clients. So, I think it\u2019s too early to say it\u2019s a trend, but clearly that was a portion of that end of period. But I think we\u2019re really well positioned on a go-forward basis. You\u2019ve heard Tayfun talk this morning about the way that we repositioned the balance sheet, asset quality\u2019s improved, we\u2019ve had five consecutive quarters of yield increases, loan spreads have stabilized in spite of running higher risks, higher coupon assets from the company, capital markets have been benefited from our strategic strategy. We\u2019re taking to the market, so frankly we feel really good about the way that we\u2019re positioned for \u201817. John Pancari : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then the guidance that you provided on the EOP basis of up 2%, just to confirm, that implies that the average balance year-over-year in loans is going to be down 1%, is that fair? Lars Anderson : No, no the average balance will be up, but it will be up modestly I mean it will be up I don\u2019t know between may be 0.5% or 1%. John Pancari : Okay. All right. And then on your expense clarification that you gave, you expect expenses for full year \u201817 would have been down or the expectation would be for them to decline only about half a percentage point ex the North Star cost. Does that include cost savings that would be coming from North Star as well or are you excluding that as well or is that in that 0.5% down number? Frank Forrest : It\u2019s in that number that regarding to the 1% includes some of the savings associated with the North Star initiatives or the number would be higher than that from an expense growth perspective. So we\u2019re taking to the savings and reapply those savings into the investment and also take some of that into the bottom line. John Pancari : Okay. So it does include the saves but does not include the investments, that down 0.5%... Frank Forrest : That\u2019s correct. John Pancari : Okay. And then lastly, the efficiency ratio, I\u2019m just trying to think of a fair way to assume where it could end up for full year \u201817 given the guidance you gave. Is it fair to assume that that could end up around 63% coming off the 64% level for 2016 just trying to weigh in where we think the operating leverage could play out? Frank Forrest : I think that\u2019s right. I think you\u2019re pretty close, again, obviously interest rates will play a role because there\u2019s 1.5% difference in NII growth based upon what you\u2019re assuming. For the full year, yes, I just \u2013 we gave you some guidance on Q1 numbers because of some timing changes, Q1 will be a high point and then we would expect to go down from that level, but your full assumption is pretty close. John Pancari : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please ask your question. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I was hoping to follow up on the North Star comments about 2017 about it being a modest net drag a possibility and kind of just what\u2019s the walk from this modest drag into 2017 to the positive $800 million contribution in 2019? May be give us some concrete numbers or percentages of when that $800 million comes in? Frank Forrest : Matt you\u2019re going to have to be a bit patient with us. We will give you guidance, but today, we\u2019re giving 2017 guidance. We will provide more color on \u201818 and \u201819 as the year progresses. Matt O\u2019Connor: I mean I guess to push a little bit like as we exit the 2017, will we start seeing some of the net benefits? Frank Forrest : Yes. Greg Carmichael : If you look at a lot of initiatives Matt, the \u2013 whether it\u2019d be mortgage system or end to end commercial restructuring or small business platform and the investments that we\u2019re making some of the strategic initiatives with respect to the FinTech space in businesses like GreenSky, a lot of the revenue components of that really start to show up at the end of 2017 into 2018 and expense opportunities associated with North Star we\u2019re seeing some of that benefit in this year to help pay for some of those investments. But more than revenue side of the house, the fee side of the house it really starts to show up at 2018 and 2019. Frank Forrest : But at the exit this year, you [indiscernible] start seeing signs of those lifts. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And you still expect the full impact I think it\u2019s year-end \u201819 if that\u2019s correct the full $800 million benefit? Greg Carmichael : Yes, that\u2019s given the macro environment in a no additional rate increases, we\u2019ll be at the lower end of our 12% to 14% ROTCE range. If we get a better economic environment, we get an improved rate environment, we\u2019d hope to be at the higher end of that range. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker from Piper Jaffray. Please ask your question. Kevin Barker : Thank you. Just a follow up on some of the comments you made about North Star and it appears on one of your slide, it shows about most of your projects being complete just under 50% or some projects over 50% completed by year-end \u201817. Is it fair to say that at least 30% of North Star\u2019s embedded by the end of 2017? Tayfun Tuzun : To kick off you mean for 2018 guidance? Kevin Barker : Yes. Tayfun Tuzun : I mean I think I don\u2019t have the exact sort of necessarily split in terms of the revenue pick-ups in front of me right now, but you will start seeing those lifts as we get near the end of this year. The few areas where I think it will be more visible clearly personal lending will be one. I think as we sort of finalize the analytical investments in credit card lending, you will start seeing that in 2018. I think you will start seeing capital markets, you will also in addition to that seeing the impact of sort of the exits this year of $1.5 billion left will be coming to an end, so that will provide a built-in improvement in loan growth into 2018. So those are all pointing to a pretty good 2018, but we will continue to provide more details as this year goes on. Kevin Barker : So what percentage of North Star would you say is completed by the end of \u201817? Tayfun Tuzun : I don\u2019t have that number right in front of me, Kevin but we will again just give us some time and we will quantify that. Kevin Barker : And then in regards to the gain on sale margin within mortgage declined quite a bit this quarter, were there any particular fall outs from like a very high level of closings that may have caused some hedging mismatches within the gain on sale\u2026 Frank Forrest : Yeah it\u2019s not a hedging mismatches, but the timing between great loss and lower funding is always from a quarter to quarter may create some volatility. In general, in this environment, we should not expect sort of the three plus percent type margins and we will probably come inside that as \u2013 there\u2019s nothing unique in terms of our business, but more reflective of what\u2019s going on in the sector. Kevin Barker : Thank you. Frank Forrest : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Please ask your question. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my first question is more of a strategic type of question, I appreciate the discipline when it comes to credit risk in commercial relationship, but how do you balance that strategic philosophy or strategic bend with the potential for better economic environment. Do you feel like you\u2019re able to get the incremental upside in 2018 and probably start to pick up and get that upside especially from your more profitable relationships? And I\u2019ll ask my second question now on capital, I guess you guys gave a little bit of your views on your capital strategy and position. But with 2% loan growth, 1% asset growth, you built capital this year ROTCE\u2019s moving up, is it fair to say that there\u2019s room for pretty notable increase in terms of your payout in future CCAR cycle? Greg Carmichael : This is Greg, I\u2019ll take the first one. First off, you think about 2017, you look at our strategic portfolio, we did a nice job in 2016 in growing the strategic portfolio. We anticipate and expect to grow that portfolio 4% to 5% in 2017. If the economy improves, we get some of the expectations that are out there right now, so to materialize right now I would categorize our customer base is \u2013 optimism right now, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity I think it\u2019s believed to be out there until we start to see some of these investments we have made, some of the changes taken place. We hopefully will capitalize that, we\u2019re well positioned with our regional model to take advantage of that, especially in that middle market space. In addition to that, with our investments in our vertical strategies, we\u2019re well positioned to take advantage of any upside in the economic environment. As we mentioned before, from a non-strategic perspective, there\u2019s still roughly $1.5 billion we will push out this year, but even with that expectation, we expect to grow the balance sheet modestly, but with some upside in the economy we would hope to be even more robust. James Leonard : Yeah this is Jamie, on your second question regarding capital deployment, I think as you know, we do have some capital poised to be deployed in the form of the TRA quarterly options. That\u2019s about $170 million over \u201817 and \u201818 on our pre-tax proceeds basis that will most likely be deployed each quarter going forward that would obviously increase our payout ratio and then in terms of how we\u2019re managing capital. Clearly, we have had a nice capital build that we\u2019re pleased with and that certainly provides us flexibility, but as we sit here today, we still don\u2019t have the instructions, the economic environment for this year\u2019s CCAR. So until we see that, we think it\u2019s a little premature to dictate what the payout ratios will be. However, it is nice to have a little dry powder there if the regulatory provides us with that opportunity, and I think the number most folks would like to hear would be for running of that 10-4 level of what would payout ratios be if we were to maintain a 10% common equity Tier 1 and for us to put you in the 80% to 90% payout ratio before the TRAs. So certainly some upside there, but again, it\u2019s a little premature. Kevin Barker : No that\u2019s helpful. And if I can just ask a quick clarification on the loan growth guidance, the 2% loan growth you gave, but excluding the $1.3 billion exiting of the non-strategic relationships, commercial grew 4% to 5% and you also said, you\u2019re seeing modest growth in consumer loans obviously with the decline in the indirect \u2013 did I get that correct? Greg Carmichael : First of all, it\u2019s actually $1.5 billion and not $1.2 billion\u2026 Kevin Barker : I\u2019m sorry, right. Frank Forrest : Overall, I think you\u2019re around the right numbers. Unidentified Company Representative : Especially if you focus on the commercial component of it, we\u2019ve had a lot of traction as Greg referenced our strategic portfolio were up 7% this past year or so. We feel like we\u2019re very well positioned for that and can accomplish that. We\u2019ve done some other things internally and in terms of realigning some of our credit specialties such as asset base, lending, how we go to market with our leverage lending strategies. And frankly, as we continue to build out our strategic solutions, fee solutions, these are all opportunities not only for us to grow just the balance sheet but also of our fee income. So I think that we\u2019re well positioned to deliver. Kevin Barker : Okay, great. Thanks. That\u2019s very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Please ask your question. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Tayfun, we\u2019ve been having this ongoing kind of debate on deposit betas and you have kind of forecasted that eventually deposit betas are really going to tick up and in your base case you\u2019re using about a 70% deposit beta. When you look at the guidance you\u2019ve given, you\u2019ve given so much explicit guidance on everything, the real delta on what you\u2019re going to earn next year is really what happens to the interest rate scenario and how much you benefit from that. On the first rate hike, you\u2019re kind of forecasting four to five base of point improvement for the December hike, but for the next two you\u2019re only generating about five basis points of improvement. I was wondering what kind of deposit beta you\u2019re assuming in the first and then in the next two rate hikes? James Leonard : Marty it\u2019s Jamie, I\u2019ll take that one. On the deposit betas, what we experienced on the move in December of 2015 was a beta that started off high single digits, but by June over that six month period, we experienced about a 15% beta. So, on the move that just occurred on December of 2016, we\u2019re assuming a 20% beta and we believe each successive rate hike you\u2019ll see slightly higher betas along with shorter lags in the repricing so that if we were to get a June move, we model a 25% beta and if were to get a move after that whether it\u2019s September or December, we model a 50% beta and we do expect lower betas in the consumer space and higher betas in the commercial space, you\u2019ll just have a higher percentage of index to count in that line of business. And as you said, as a reminder, our interest rate disclosures do model a linear 70% deposit beta. Marty Mosby : And then a bigger question Greg, the North Star initiative and everything you\u2019re doing there feels like you\u2019re taking a bank and really amping it up and making it a well run bank. But strategically, Fifth Third used to be of low cost, high currency to be able to go out and really use that a weapon in acquisitions, so we knew what Fifth Third was. What strategically are you going to be that\u2019s going to make you different, that\u2019s going to give you that competitive advantage once you complete all these initiatives and just becoming a better bank? Greg Carmichael : The first thing is when you look at \u2013 when you think about how we\u2019re going to run this business, it\u2019s really about being good through the various business cycles. We want consistency of earnings, quality of earnings and the right return on our balance sheet and that\u2019s we put the expectations out with respect to the range of ROTCE, ROA, or efficiency. We\u2019re going to be a very well run bank consistently managing our balance sheet, the profitability, and quality if we go through the cycle and we believe that that gets rewarded over time consistently. And we believe if we achieve those objectives that we put in place from a financial perspective, that will make us the top performing bank and give us the currency we need to continue to do strategic opportunities in the future. Frank Forrest : This is Frank. Let me just add to that on the, if you look historically on the credit side as Greg said, we\u2019ve had more volatility than our peers probably to go back over the last 15 years. We\u2019ve been very deliberate of the \u2013 intentional and very disciplined in changing that and you\u2019ve seen the results of that already over the last 24 months and that will continue. We\u2019re going to do an outstanding job of balancing risk and rewards, we\u2019re not in the business just moving off assets off balance sheet, we\u2019re in a business of evaluating credit, getting paid for the risk, picking the right clients and managing the book in an appropriate manner. Our goal is to be not only good to the cycle, our goal is to help perform our peers through the cycle so that we do have a competitive advantage when we get to the other side of the cycle. Historically, that\u2019s not what we played, we played with a much higher elevated level of criticized assets as you know, that\u2019s no longer the case at all. And we are now well positioned, confident that we can perform not only exceptionally well through the cycle, but we can do it at a competitive advantage that will benefit the company for the long-run. Marty Mosby : I get the I mean your both answers reflect that you are going to be a better run bank, but competitively what\u2019s going to make you different than just being a good bank? I mean what is \u2013 is it a consumer strategy, is it a commercial strategy? At the end of the day, what makes Fifth Third to be able to go out and take business away from another bank that is well run? Frank Forrest : I think if you talk \u2013 first off, we have a great business model, we have the right businesses that we are in, we do a fantastic job of going to the market and our people do a fantastic job going in the market really as one bank Fifth Third. It\u2019s really about harvesting the pool relationships or the customer relationships on the consumer side, on the commercial side. It\u2019s about providing the right products and services to our customers and really be the one bank our customers most value and trust. We worked hard to put that model in place across our franchise. So we feel very good about that. And really our strong brand and our footprint is extremely important to us and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on our brand equity in the marketplace. But when you look at it across the board, we have strong earnings capacity, we have a great team in place, we\u2019ve invested heavily in the right products. We\u2019ve made some strategic moves recently that positions well for the future and I think we have the products, the services and the team to deliver on that in the market. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Frank Forrest : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo Securities. Please ask your question. Matt Burnell : Thanks for taking my question. Jamie let me follow up on capital discussion if I can. Your dividend payouts specifically was a little bit below 30% last couple of years. I understand why that is. I\u2019m just curious given your capital position and the fact that more of the regional, lower risk regional banks appear to be able to get over a 30% payout ratio, some more so than others. How are you thinking specifically about dividend payout ratios over the next couple of years at Fifth Third rising about the 30% level or are you going to keep it there and just do the capital management via buybacks? James Leonard : Yeah I think you saw our recent dividend increase which is one sign of our confidence in our earnings trajectory as well as our ability to increase that dividend. But I think the one point of clarification when you look at our payout ratios for 2016 is that we have the TRA transactions that are included in those net income denominators. So it makes the payout ratios look a little muted. That TRA gain came in two parts, one was a gain that we did deploy and a buyback of $75 million in the third quarter, but the other gain that we had was $170 million pre-tax gain in 2016 that is deployed or able to be deployed in 2017 or 2018 if the proceeds are received from Vantiv in the quarterly options. So if you factor in or take that out of the denominator for 2016, our payout ratios are actually higher in the 70% range in total as well as the dividend payout ratio I think it was around 31% or so and I think given our earnings capacity as Greg referred to along with our desire to maintain the dividend payout ratio in that 30% may be little bit north of 30% level and I think we have some capacity in the future to deploy that if the board were so inclined. Matt Burnell : Okay. And Tayfun for my follow up, just looking at the adjusted non-interest income, excluding mortgage banking net revenue on slide 23, that total\u2019s $2.1 billion for 2016, but if I adjusted the Vantiv TRA related transaction, that gets me to the $2.4 billion number that you referenced as a starting point for fee revenue growth in 2017, correct? Tayfun Tuzun : Correct. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thank you very much. Greg Carmichael : Thank you. Operator : Speakers, you may you continue with your presentation. Sameer Gokhale : Okay, thank you Larry and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department and we will be happy to assist you.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to this earnings release conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Sameer Gokhale, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your call. Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp : Thank you, Natalie. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. Additionally, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference during today's conference call are included in our earnings release along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. A copy of our most recent quarterly earnings release can be accessed by the public in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, www.53.com. This morning, I'm joined on the call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : Thanks, Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you'll see in our results, we reported first quarter 2017 net income of $305 million and EPS of $0.38 per share. Before, I get into the core quarter results, like to make an observation about the operating environment. I believe that the geopolitical uncertainty and concerns about administration's ability to implement pro-growth policies have caused borrowers to remain cautious. Having said that, we at Fifth Third are not getting distracted by these macroeconomic challenges and are continuing to execute on initiatives we outlined for you in the Project North Star. Now, in terms of the quarter, overall, our results for the first quarter were solid. During the quarter, we benefited from higher interest rates, while credit quality remained stable, our balance sheet positioning as well as the benefit from increased short-term interest rates. We will continue to focus on limiting the downside impact of lower interest rates by maintaining an asset sensitive position. During the quarter, we diligently managed our expenses, while continuing to invest in certain areas of growth. Non-interest expenses were flat year-over-year. This include the impact of the $18 million in compensation-related expenses that we typically recognize in the second quarter, but recorded in Q1 given the change in our long-term incentive grant date. Our adjusted net interest margin expanded 7 basis points sequentially. Our NIM is currently at the highest level since third quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we managed funding costs very tightly and we expect that to continue in this environment. Our total loan balances decline 1% sequentially, primarily driven by C&I loans and some seasonality in our consumer portfolio. Excluding the impact of roughly $600 million in commercial loans we intentionally excited, total commercial loans were up 1% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Our clients remain cautiously optimistic about the prospects for increased economic activity, and we have seen some improvement in our loan production pipeline in April. As we discussed earlier in the year, we plan to exit about $1.5 billion of C&I loans this year, which will impact our net loan growth. Fee revenues were lower sequentially and year-over-year, primarily due to a lease remarketing impairment and lower mortgage banking revenues. The sequential comparison was also impacted by the $33 million, Vantiv TRA payment that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. Corporate banking revenue was affected by a $31 million lease remarketing impairment related to oilfield services exposure. Excluding this impairment, corporate banking revenue was up 4% sequentially. Expanding our capital markets business remains an integral part of our North Star strategy. Our capital markets fees were up 90% compared to the fourth quarter and 14% year-over-year. The recently hired key talents expand our M&A advisory and investment banking capacities. They should further improve our ability to generate additional fee revenues. Our M&A groups provide advice to a wide range of vertical industry sectors, including consumer retail, diversified industrials, downstream petroleum, healthcare, and technology, media and telecommunications. Mortgage banking revenue was affected by seasonality and higher rates as expected in addition to lower MSR hedge gains. Total mortgage origination volume of $1.9 billion was up 10% from last year and higher than almost all of our peers. Despite the increase in originations, mortgage banking revenue was down 33% year-over-year. This reflected significantly lower rate loss volumes in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2016. As many of you know, we recognize revenue when we enter into rate loss. This can cause the timing of revenue recognition to differ from the timing of loan funding. It also reflects small derivative gains and lower MSR revaluation gains compared to a year ago. Growth in our wealth and asset management revenue was strong during the quarter, up 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year, as our revenue reached an all-time high. Along with capital markets, wealth and asset management revenue is expected to provide a lift to our fees as we execute on our strategic initiatives. During the quarter, credit quality remained stable. Non-performing assets and non-performing loans decreased and our criticized assets remained relatively flat. Within our commercial real estate portfolio, criticized assets are currently at their lowest levels since 2004. We believe that our prudent underwriting strategy and the focus on larger developers is bearing fruit. We expect the credit environment to remain stable for the foreseeable future. We're making good progress on our North Star initiatives across the board. In retail banking, our omni-channel investments and branch automation projects will start to benefit our results more meaningfully later this year and into 2018. Our ongoing efforts in digital have resulted in continued growth in both mobile usage and overall engagement with our mobile offerings. Our loan enrollment is up 56% year-over-year and nearly 50% of all deposits are now made through our mobile and ATM channels. The initiatives in unsecured lending and credit card businesses are well underway. We're also making good progress in expense initiatives in operations and technology, as well as workspace management. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 10.8% from 10.4% last quarter. Our earnings contributed to a tangible book value of $16.89 per share, which was up 2% from last quarter and up 3% over last year. We recently submitted our 2017 CCAR plan to the Federal Reserve. Our strong capital levels and ongoing earnings power are supportive of higher levels of capital return to our shareholders. Overall, our results were solid and we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term objectives. I am pleased that Fifth Third Bank was just awarded Gallup's Great Workplace 2017 Award for the fourth time in a row. This award is the measure of employee engagement, the degree in which our employees feel connected, valued and supported in the workplace. I want to thank all of our employees for their continued dedication in serving our clients and improving the performance of our bank. Our employees are our most important asset and I believe that our focused strategy and the high degree of employee engagement create a powerful combination. Now, with that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial summary on slide 4 of the presentation. During the quarter, the expansion of our net interest margin, our focus on disciplined expense management and stable credit quality reflected our continued commitment to driving improved financial performance. The quarter's results included two items that had a net neutral impact on earnings per share. First quarter results reflected the partial reversal of a charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2016 for estimated credit card refunds. This was offset by a negative mark from our Visa swap. Another isolated item was a $31 million lease remarketing impairment related to an exposure to an oilfield services company, which negatively impacted our non-interest income. Average commercial loan balances were down 1% sequentially and year-over-year. As we have discussed over the past few quarters, we continue to exit lending relationships that do not meet our desired risk return profile. Excluding the impact of these exits, commercial loans were up 1% sequentially and grew by 5% year-over-year. The sequential decline reflected the combination of softer loan demand resulting from a less certain fiscal outlook as well as elevated capital markets activity driving higher corporate loan refinance volumes. Healthy level of capital markets activity is keeping loan spreads at very competitive levels, but our teams continue to focus on growing relationships to create value both for our clients and our shareholders. The sequential decline in average C&I balances was partially offset by 2% growth in commercial construction loans this quarter. This growth came predominantly from drawdowns on existing commitments. Spread from construction loans are stable and coupons have expanded reflective of the move in LIBOR. At this time, we have roughly another $900 million of exits to go for the remainder of 2017. Our outlook remains relatively similar to our guidance in January. Excluding these anticipated exits, we continue to expect to grow total commercial loans in the low-to-mid single digits in 2017. Including these exits, we expect our commercial loan portfolio to grow by about 2% on an end of period basis. Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and down 2% year-over-year. Excluding auto loans, consumer loans were flat sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 4% from last quarter and 13% year-over-year. We firmly believe that reducing capital deployment in this business is the right decision, especially given the changing risk profile due to the pressures on used car values. Residential mortgage loans grew by 2% sequentially and 10% year-over-year as we continued to retain jumbo mortgages, ARMs, as well as certain 10- and 15-year fixed rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 3% sequentially and 8% year-over-year, as loan pay-downs exceeded strong origination volumes. Our originations this quarter were 9% higher year-over-year. Unlike the auto loan space, this is a portfolio that we intend to grow. The portfolio decline is predominantly due to pay-downs in the legacy home equity portfolio, and a growing preference for personal unsecured lending over HELOCs. With improved analytics and targeted marketing campaigns, we expect to start growing this portfolio in the second half of this year. Our credit card portfolio was seasonally down 2% from the fourth quarter and down 2% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the agent bank portfolio, which we sold in the second quarter of 2016, our credit card portfolio would have been up modestly on a year-over-year basis. As we have discussed before, this is an area of significant emphasis within our North Star project. We expect the upgrades in our analytical capabilities to start showing results during the second half of this year and into 2018. Our GreenSky partnership is also continuing to perform in line with our expectations. This partnership should also help support faster consumer loan growth. Excluding the deliberate reduction of indirect auto loan balances, we are expecting to grow our consumer and mortgage loans by a mid-single digits rate in 2017 on an end of period basis. Consistent with our strategy, the redeployment of capital from indirect auto lending to other parts of Consumer Lending franchise will provide further support for higher ROTCE and ROA levels. Average investment securities increased 4% sequentially in the first quarter, primarily due to opportunistic investments made at the end of the fourth quarter. We expect to maintain our investment portfolio at roughly the same level. Average core deposits were flat sequentially driven by increased commercial and consumer interest checking balances. On a year-over-year basis, core deposits were up 2%. Excluding the impact of the strategic exits from St. Louis and Pittsburgh in 2016, core deposits were up 3%. Increases in money market and savings balances were partially offset by a decline in CDs. Our modified liquidity coverage ratio continued to be very strong at 119% at the end of the quarter. Adjusted net interest income was up $2 million from the previous quarter. The fourth quarter's reported result included a $16 million estimated charge for refunds to certain bank card customers. In the first quarter, with the completion of our analysis, this charge was revised and resulted in a $12 million reversal of the prior charge. Our solid underlying NII performance includes the $13 million negative impact of a lower day count, reflects higher short-term market rates and lower wholesale funding balances, partially offset by declining loan balances. Excluding the credit card charge and reversal, the adjusted NIM increased 7 basis points from the fourth quarter to 2.98%, exceeding our guidance of 2.94% to 2.95%. We currently expect NIM expansion of 2 basis points in the second quarter compared to our adjusted first quarter margin of 2.98%. On a full year basis, we expect the NIM to be at the high-end of our original guidance range of 2.95% to 3% that we gave in January, assuming additional rate increases in September and December. Overall, deposit betas so far have remained low and are in the mid-teens with commercial betas in the low 20% range. Our guidance assumes that on a blended basis, consumer and commercial deposit betas will increase to the 30% range in the coming months for the most recent move in March and the next rate hike. For subsequent rate hikes, we expect deposit betas to be closer to 50%. Including the impact of day count, we expect our second quarter net interest income to be up by 1% to 1.5% sequentially from our adjusted net interest income in the first quarter. Adjusted non-interest income in the first quarter was $536 million, compared to $608 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2016 included $33 million in TRA income from Vantiv. Mortgage banking net revenue of $52 million was down $13 million sequentially. Originations were 10% higher compared to last year's first quarter, but our gain on sale margin was 198 basis points compared with 347 basis points last year due to lower rate lock revenues and a larger proportion of correspondent originations. In addition, we also had lower net MSR revaluation gains in the first quarter. During the quarter, our origination mix was relatively evenly split between purchase and refinance volumes. Approximately two-thirds of the originations continued to be sourced from the retail and direct channels, and the remainder were originated through the correspondent channel. While we are building up our capacity to grow mortgage originations, we are also investing in our servicing business. Recently, we executed two acquisitions for a total of $6 billion in service loans. These portfolios are in the process of being on-boarded. Corporate banking fees of $74 million were down $27 million or 27% sequentially, reflecting the impact of the $31 million lease remarketing impairment. Excluding the impact of the lease impairment, corporate banking revenue increased 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by solid capital markets fee growth of 19%. Deposit service charges seasonally decreased 2% from the fourth quarter and increased 1% relative to the first quarter of 2016. Card and processing revenue decreased 6% both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. The sequential decrease partly reflects seasonality following higher holiday spending in the fourth quarter. The payments business is an important focus area for our North Star project. In addition to targeting growth in consumer payments, we have ambitious plans in the commercial space. We are combining improvements in our existing business and are complementing them with new partnerships like Transactis and AvidXchange. Total wealth and asset management revenue of $108 million was up 8% sequentially, due to strong brokerage revenue and seasonally strong tax-related private client service revenue. Revenues increased 6% relative to the first quarter of 2016, mainly due to the higher personal asset management and brokerage revenue. Excluding mortgage banking revenue and non-core items shown on slide 13 of the presentation, we expect non-interest income to grow by 3% in 2017. The adjustment to previous guidance on non-interest income is largely due to the lease impairments that we recorded in the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2017, on the same basis, we expect non-interest income to be up 8%. In addition, we expect mortgage origination fees to increase by approximately 30% sequentially in the second quarter. We remain focused on disciplined expense management while still investing in areas of strategic importance. Non-interest expenses were flat compared with last year, including the impact of approximately $18 million in long-term incentive expense that was pulled forward from the second quarter to the first quarter due to a change in the date of our long-term compensation awards. Excluding this item, expenses were down 2% year-over-year and were up less than 1% sequentially, reflecting seasonally higher compensation costs. The sequential increase in FICA, workers' comp and 401(k) expenses totaled $36 million or nearly 4% of our expense base. We expect expenses in 2017 to be up about 1% compared to 2016, including the incremental expenses associated with new initiatives under Project North Star, the same as our guidance last year quarter. In the absence of North Star related expenses, we would have expected our total expenses to decline by about 0.5% in 2017. Our first quarter expenses came in below our expectation and guidance by a significant amount. Despite this outperformance, we expect our expenses in the second quarter to be lower than in the first quarter. Our guidance today continues to reflect our commitment to achieve positive operating leverage in 2017, while we're making substantive progress in lowering our efficiency ratio towards our long-term target of sub 60%. Adjusting for the 3% impact from the difference in accounting for low income housing compared to all of our peers, which has no bottom line impact, this is an ambitious target. Turning to credit results on slide 9; net charge-offs were $89 million or 40 basis points in the first quarter, an increase from $73 million and 31 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016, but an improvement from $96 million or 42 basis points in the first quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was primarily due to an $11 million increase in C&I charge-offs. Total portfolio non-performing loans were $657 million, down $3 million from the previous quarter, resulting in an NPL ratio of 72 basis points. Total NPAs were down 3% and loans 90 days past due and still accruing decreased 11% sequentially. Our loss provision was $20 million higher than last quarter. Our resulting reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases of 1.35% was 1-basis point lower than last quarter and 3 basis points lower than last year. Our allowance coverage of NPAs increased to 172% from 157% at the end of the first quarter of 2016. Our previous guidance that net charge-offs will be range bound with some quarterly variability is unchanged, and we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth. Our capital levels remained very strong and grew during the first quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.8%, reflecting an increase of 37 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 95 basis points year-over-year. Our tangible common equity, excluding unrealized gains and losses, increased 28 basis points sequentially and 60 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the first quarter, common shares outstanding were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and down 20 million shares or 3% compared to last year's first quarter. We have buyback capacity of approximately $340 million remaining in our CCAR 2016 plan that we expect to execute this quarter. Book value and tangible book value were both up 2% from last quarter. As I mentioned previously, our common equity Tier 1 ratio has increased very significantly over the past year, while we steadily continued to de-risk our balance sheet. We have submitted our capital plan under the 2017 CCAR. This plan includes a request for additional share buybacks and dividends. Given the 95-basis point increase in our common equity Tier 1 ratio since the first quarter of last year, our strong capacity to generate additional capital and the reduced level of risk exposure across the board, we are seeking to increase the level of capital distributions over the next CCAR cycle. With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate was positively impacted by an $8 million benefit associated with the exercise and vesting of employee equity awards. We expect our second quarter tax rate to be roughly around 25% and the full year 2017 tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range. Our guidance reflects the benefit from our recent actions and provides support for the initiatives under Project North Star. Our North Star performance expectations were clearly stated last year : end of 2019 run rate ROTCE between 12% and 14%; ROA between 1.1% and 1.13%; and efficiency ratio sub 60% without any meaningful help from the environment. We also projected that given the timing of the project 2018 would be the first year of step-up towards these targets. At this time, we are expecting on a full year basis to be above an 11% ROTCE and close to 1.1% ROA with continued strong expense control. The timing of the progress is more than one year ahead of our original expectations, given the improvement in rates, assuming that there will be two additional Fed rate increases this year and two more next year. These initiatives will leverage our strength in middle market lending, industry verticals and specialty lending areas in our commercial business. In the consumer business, growth initiatives in mortgage banking, credit card and personal lending will provide support for more balanced growth in our overall loan portfolio. Additionally, efficiency initiatives in retail banking, aided by use of technology, should continue to drive increased shareholder value. We continue to target higher revenue growth by expanding our capabilities in businesses such as capital markets, insurance and wealth management, which generate attractive returns. Our revenue growth outlook, our ability to achieve positive operating leverage without changing our risk appetite, our ongoing discipline of maintaining a strong balance sheet, and the long-term strategic positioning of our business lines together provide a positive backdrop for our shareholders. We have included the updated outlook on slide 11 for your reference. And with that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open up the call for Q&A. Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp : Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time that we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Natalie, please open the call up for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe starting off on the net interest margin, 7 basis points of core NIM expansion this quarter, but it sounds like you're talking about something lower, maybe 2 basis points in 2Q. So, could you explain to us where that dynamic comes from? Why a smaller 2Q benefit than 1Q benefit? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : You maybe referring to the reported net interest margin there because we are \u2013 adjusted net interest margin is 2.98%. Jamie, you want to comment on what we're seeing here in the next few quarters? James C. Leonard - Fifth Third Bancorp : Sure. Geoffrey, it's Jamie. On the first quarter NIM expansion of 7 bps on the core basis, 7 basis points of improvement was driven by LIBOR and the Fed short-term rate increases plus 2 basis points from day count, and then the benefit of 1 basis point from lower cash levels and then that was offset by a return to more normalized discount accretion levels, so that was 3 basis points of erosion in the first quarter from the investment portfolio. As you recall in the fourth quarter, we had strong levels there. So that's what drove the first quarter 7-basis point improvement. And then to your question as to why not another 5 to 7 basis points in the second quarter, as Tayfun mentioned in the script, we expect a 2-basis point improvement and that will be driven by the fact that our forecast doesn't have another Fed move in it until September, so we have rates relatively flat. We will benefit in the C&I yield area probably 8 basis points on a yield basis, so let's translate that into 3 to 4 basis points of NIM improvement from the March Fed move, net of the deposit betas and some funding mix, and then that will be partially offset by 1-basis point erosion from day count and then potentially 1-basis point decline in loan spreads. So, when you add it all up, the first quarter really benefited from both the December move and the fact that the market had an increase in LIBOR rates ahead of the March move and our second quarter will only have in it the benefit of the March rate hike. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : And also we gave you the underlying beta assumptions and if we see more discipline in deposit pricing in the market and outperform, then our margin expectations may prove to be more conservative, but that remains to be seen obviously. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : And just on that point, I guess, on the call, you mentioned 20% beta so far, 30% expected for the next couple of rate rises, 50% later, but then if I look at slide 16, you're talking about 70%. Should we kind of see that slide 16 disclosure as more kind of academic at this point? How do we kind of square out the 70% on slide 16 with the 30% and the 50%? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yeah, we have been using those assumptions in our rate risk disclosure since, I think, the end of 2015. But we basically disclose sensitivity tables around those numbers. So despite the fact that we are using, clearly, a 69%, 70% beta in the risk disclosures, we are also bracketing it by disclosing the impact of potential deposit runoff as well as 25% higher and 25% lower beta. So we're giving you enough information to bracket the beta behavior and then we're supplementing that with what we are seeing today, and also, based on what we are seeing today, we're giving you our expectations. So we want to give you the full picture, that's why we are continuing to use those assumptions and those risk tables. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Great. Thank you. Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : Good morning, Matt. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Tayfun, you mentioned that you're still committed to operating leverage improvement this year, which has been a pretty consistent theme of yours. But I believe, in the January call, you mentioned a specific basis point amount of improvement at around 250 basis points, is that still your target or has that changed from January? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Are you referring to the efficiency ratio improvement? Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Okay. We are still expecting an efficiency ratio improvement. I don't quite recall exactly how we guided the efficiency. But, again, when you go back and look at our guidance, our guidance really has not changed from January. So what we committed to in January still holds. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Can you maybe... Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : With the exception of \u2013 the only change we made, I want to clarify that, because in the morning I saw some reports. The only reason why we made a change in our non-interest income expectations is just due to the lease remarketing impairment that we recorded in Q1. With the exception of that, we actually moved our NII guidance up a little bit from where it was. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. That's good color. And Jamie, maybe a question for you. It looked like securities yields were stable or a little bit lower this quarter. If that's correct, can you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about reinvesting the cash flows coming off that portfolio since you're guiding to relatively stable AFS securities balances? James C. Leonard - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yeah. On the available for sale book, we did have a decline in the security yields from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Again, that's just driven by the discount accretion outperformance in the fourth quarter. Our book is very close to par from a premium position. And with 52% of the portfolio in bullet or locked-out cash flows, I would say that this is going to perform a very stable portfolio. We had about $600 million of cash flows in the first quarter. That's what I would expect to continue over the remaining three quarters. And I would expect the portfolio yield on a full year basis to be in a 3.05% to 3.10% range, again, very stable strong performance. Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you for the color, gentlemen. Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : Thank you. Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp : Good morning. Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Tayfun, could you give us \u2013 I know this is more of a theoretical hypothetical type question, but obviously there's regulatory change coming on the horizon, possibly the global SIFI number will be lifted to over $250 billion in assets and you guys won't be considered as a SIFI. In that scenario, where would you be comfortable in taking the LCR ratio down, assuming you got relief on that as well? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : I think our thoughts around LCR ratio in terms of today's environment is to manage it right around the 100% to 115% level. Gerard, it would be speculative for me to necessarily project an LCR ratio in a different environment because in that environment, probably, there will be other changes. But any change on that would be positive. It would be positive for earnings, it would be positive the way we manage our liquidity, but I don't want to necessarily speculate an expectation based on that. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Sure. And then moving on to a second question, obviously, you guys have highlighted your strategy on bringing down auto. Can you share with us \u2013 you mentioned that there is a higher risk profile, which we all are aware of. Can you share with us what you're seeing, whether it's residual values or delinquencies or loan to value of the automobile is a problem? And also, can you remind us where you think you want to get the automobile portfolio down to it before it stabilizes? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yes. So, I think \u2013 I'll answer your second question first. I think the stabilization in that portfolio will be achieved sometime during 2019. And the portfolio today is going down by about $1.5 billion or so a year. So, by the end of this year, we would expect to be right around the $9 billion \u2013 maybe a little bit lower than $9 billion. I think, ultimately, the average balances in 2019 are probably going to be around $7 billion \u2013 $7 billion, $7.5 billion, and that's probably a balance that we would comfortably manage going forward. We are not \u2013 our statistics on the auto portfolio are a little bit skewed because you have a declining balance portfolio, therefore, the basis point numbers, whether it's in delinquencies or charge-offs are skewed compared to somebody who's growing their portfolio. We are clearly seeing loan recoveries. Certain used cars are showing deterioration. In terms of default percentages, we're not seeing default percentages going up because the portfolio is a high prime portfolio, which is not as sensitive as subprime borrowers, but the recovery rates in general are looking weaker. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : You're welcome. Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : Good morning, Erika. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I just wanted to make sure I understood one of Tayfun's remarks correctly. Because of a more optimistic outlook on the Fed, we can now expect you to achieve 12% to 14% ROTCE a year earlier, in 2018 versus 2019? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : We are expecting \u2013 the guidance that I gave was in 2018, we are expecting to be above 11% ROTCE and close to a 1.1% ROA. So we are entering our North Star target that we projected for very end of 2019 in 2018 now. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I see. And my follow-up question is, embedded in that guidance for next year in terms of ROTCE above 11%, are you assuming a fully realized deposit beta of 50%? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yes. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp : Good morning, Peter. Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : Good morning, Peter. Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp : How are you? Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: At the onset of the call, you guys talked about that with the macro environment that borrowers remain cautious. I'm just wondering could you talk about what you're seeing in terms of loan pipelines and just the loan environment in the Midwest. Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : I'll start off and ask Lars to provide additional color to it. First off, I would tell you, we use the term cautiously optimistic in the past. Lot of the uncertainly that's happening in the administration and there are concerns around their ability to basically achieve some of the objectives they haven't finalized with the corporate tax rates, improve the economic growth and so forth are some concerns out there. So it's been pretty sluggish. With that said, we look at our strategic portfolio, we've been able to grow our C&I portfolio roughly about 5%. If you strip out the things that we were pushing out, that $600 million we talked about earlier, but it's been pretty sluggish. But we are starting to see the pipeline pick up in April and we're optimistic that by the full year end of period growth in commercial will be over 2%. Lars, I don't know if you want to. Lars C. Anderson - Fifth Third Bancorp : I think you hit it well. I would just tell you that we did see a pickup in activity levels as we moved through the first quarter. I would say that the comments generally are somewhere between optimism and enthusiasm. However, we have not yet seen that kind of come through to fundings, but I must say I'm a little bit more optimistic about our pipeline as we look at the second quarter and later in the year. However, ultimate results are obviously going to be impacted by the overall macroeconomic environment. We got a number of lines of business that I would say despite the fact that this is a slow growth environment, you can see that in 8-K data, do continue to do very well, particularly in some of our industry verticals, some of our geographies look attractive. Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Great. And just a quick follow-up. On capital, you mentioned that you're going to increase the capital return as part of the 2017 CCAR. I'm just wondering do you target a capital ratio for a common equity Tier 1. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Traditionally, what we said was that in our CCAR submissions, we intend to keep capital ratios flat going in and coming out of the CCAR period. But we have seen, as I said, nearly a 1% increase over the past 12 months. I think 10% probably is a decent level in this environment and regime for us to target and that's the number that we have in mind. Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: And is there a timeframe that you want to hit that level? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Look, ultimately, we are forced to manage our capital over the next four, five quarters, so that's what the market horizon is. Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Rahul Patil - Evercore Group LLC : Yes, this is Rahul Patil on behalf of John. It looks like the better revenue environment, given higher rates, is helping you achieve Project North Star targets sooner than expected. But could you provide an update around your expense reduction efforts as part of the North Star, are you still targeting around $116 million in cost saves? Any incremental color on that front would be helpful. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yeah. Obviously, we are displaying, as of today, a pretty good discipline on expense management, so some of our recent efforts from 2016, including renegotiation of contracts, et cetera, are helping out quite a bit. As we look forward, there are many areas of focus, including workspace management, including \u2013 in technology, utilization of cloud space and other infrastructural investments, investments in more efficient data infrastructure as well as improvements in just overall consulting legal expenses, et cetera. They're all underway. They are moving in line with our expectations. Our goal is to continue save on our day-to-day operating expense base in order to be able to finance North Star related projects. And all of those in general are in line with our expectations. Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp : Operator, can we move to the next question? Rahul Patil - Evercore Group LLC : Hello? Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yes, Rahul, go ahead. Okay. Natalie, I think \u2013 let's move on to the next question. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp : Hi, Ken. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Good morning. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : One further follow-up on the expense side. So great \u2013 good start on the first quarter, and then I see the second quarter guidance versus a year ago, which is also pretty flat. So just wondering, just underneath that, Tayfun, you just made the point about good expense control. Do we see a kind of downward trajectory from here, especially as we get into the more meatier part of North Star next year? What if any \u2013 gross increases are you still burdened by, whether it's tech compliance otherwise or why can't we see kind of a netting down from here? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yeah, but for the expense related to North Star initiatives, our expenses would've been down this year again. In general, organically, we have some organic inflation in compensation expenses. Our goal is to fund that organic increase in comp expenses, which is basically a reflection of wage inflation, by saving across the board in the next two, three years, so that we can actually absorb that and find other savings to fund the remaining North Star expenses. So we are optimistic that as some of the North Star initiatives come online, including the branch digitization efforts that reduce a significant amount of branch transportation costs, and other expenses, that we will be able to achieve that. So in terms of when do we expect the absolute numbers coming down, into 2019, clearly, as some of the North Star initiatives start easing up, we are going to build that into our forecast. At this point for 2017, the numbers are looking very good with very, very modest increases in total expense. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Okay. And then just a second point on the fee side, taking your point that the second quarter growth is a lot related to just the first quarter low start in corporate services. Can you just talk a little bit about fee dynamics, where do you see growth? And then also if you could \u2013 you did talk about mortgage. I know you excluded because of the volatility of it, but \u2013 and try to just help us think about some of the dynamics underneath the mortgage business and the moving back and forth between servicing and production? Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : I'll start off. First off, when you think about the fees in this year as you look to the second, third and fourth quarter, areas of opportunity, growth in wealth and asset management, we're really pleased with the performance we're seeing. As we mentioned, we're up 6% year-over-year and we expect that to continue to be a strong performer this year, as well as the large investments we made over the last four or five years are in capital markets, including a lot of talent acquisitions. We expect to continue to see strong performance in capital markets. We're up 90% sequentially and 14% year-over-year is another opportunity. Mortgage, we'll expect as you would the seasonality in second quarter to pickup over the first quarter. We're also replacing and implementing a completely new digital platform that goes online this year, which will improve our efficiencies and our capacity in that business, so we're very optimistic about our prospects to grow that business as we move into the latter part of this year and into next year. So those are the areas of strength and I'll let Tayfun to add anything else he wants to comment on that? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yeah. So in terms of a few more items on \u2013 line items, in payments processing, I would expect that line item to be steadily growing as the year progresses. In deposit fees, obviously, it's been a tough environment with respect to growth in deposit fees for the sector, but our expectation is, again, into second half of the year, we have some initiatives especially in corporate treasury management, and we would expect a slight pickup in that line item in the third and fourth quarters. Mortgage, we expect a pickup in the second quarter. I think, given sort of the rate outlook today, once we achieve that uptick in Q2, we should see those levels holding up in Q3 and Q4. So, obviously, that bodes well for the second half of the year. Wealth and asset management unless there's a significant change in market level should see steady growth throughout the year. Greg mentioned capital markets and overall corporate banking; we would expect a steady increase in that line item. That should give us a very healthy increase year-over-year in corporate banking. So, all-in-all, our expectation is that we will do well across the board. There are number of initiatives, as I said, that are underway that would support this type of loan growth \u2013 I'm sorry, fee growth. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thanks for all the color. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. Tayfun, I want to ask you about the purchase of servicing. We've heard several banks talking about that. Are we kind of leveraging the arbitrage between the assumed prepayment speeds and the actual prepayment speeds, because what we looked at with the value of servicing, is it's been pushed so far down relative to any historic value that once rate started to go up and prepayment speeds began to slow, there was a lot of hidden value in those portfolios. So was that part of the \u2013 kind of strategy here is to take advantage of the difference between assumed and actual prepayment speeds? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Marty, that's probably part of it. Although, I don't think that necessarily we're making aggressive assumptions about prepayment speed changes. But when you think about it, going back two, three years, we had servicing capacity that far exceeds where we are today due to higher prepayments over the last couple of years. And we have a certain fixed cost base. It is a good business from a return perspective. We do it well, and we are very selective in terms of the profile of the servicing portfolios that we go after, and we service them very efficiently, and therefore, we view servicing, given the certain fixed cost basis, as a very good return business. And we will continue \u2013 we're adding, as I said, $6 billion worth of servicing here. Those transactions are being on-boarded, and we would expect that to grow going forward. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : And then when we did our deposit analysis, we showed that your \u2013 the high watermark or the most aggressive pricer on Jumbo Time over one year, you got a relatively high rate there. I was curious what the funding strategy was or what you had in or thinking in that pricing mechanism? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : That's more of a leftover initiative from a couple years ago where we ran some promotional offers there. But, right now, I would expect that to be a fairly stable line item for us. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : And then lastly, Greg, from a strategic standpoint, we've heard a lot today about financial efficiencies and looking at maximizing and optimizing portfolios, but as you're going through Project North Star and you're thinking about strategically where Firth Third is heading, what kind of progress are you seeing, what kind of successes, what are the things that you're seeing develop as Fifth Third is kind of creating a new identity for itself in the marketplace? Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : Marty, we talked about being good through the cycle, so everything we do, we put through that lens, and that's why you've seen us optimize the balance sheet the way we have and do some heavy lifting, we did $3.5 billion last year, we pushed out either credit related or return related another $1.5 billion this year, $600 million in the first quarter, so a lot of heavy lifting around the balance sheet and you're seeing that start to show up with respect to, on the credit quality, and what we expect from that balance sheet going forward from a performance perspective. On the investment side of the house, we're investing heavily in the things that create additional efficiencies for the company. We talk about new mortgage loan origination platform, we talk about the digitization of our whole branch infrastructure, we're going to eliminate hundreds of thousands of documents that move back and forth between the branch network with significant cost savings. We reduced our branch count by about 12%. We continue to look for ways to continue optimize that. We did $6 million improvement in staffing and re-optimization \u2013 or optimization in that sector. Vendor negotiations, we did $40 million of cost takeouts. So we're going to continue with those type of opportunities. We've added heavily in our technology space and our risk and compliance space. There's opportunities to continue to optimize around those areas. We'll look at artificial intelligence to really focus on our operations to create more efficiencies in that sector. So we're focused on the efficiencies, but we're also looking at how we drive revenue and improve our fee businesses. So that's why you're seeing additional investments in areas like M&A advisory services, expansion of all the capital markets capabilities, but what we're looking forward is to create a balanced infrastructure and business that would be good through the cycle with a higher rate of fee contribution onto our revenue and the balance sheet that will perform well through this cycle. That's what we're working on, that's how we put \u2013 the view we put on anything we look at with respect to what we're going do or not do it. And then it gets down to execution, and we tend to execute extremely well. We have clarity on what we're executing towards. So we feel really good about the talent we have to execute these plays. And as we have already, you'll see those results continue to show up in our numbers. We talked about the expenses we're at today. We think there is a lot of upside or opportunity to drive improved expense performance going forward. We want to see some of that materialize before we talk more about it. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Your line is open. Saul Martinez - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to drill down a little bit on a couple of fee lines. First, on corporate banking, there is obviously some lumpiness there in terms of the quarterly results and you had, obviously, the impairment this quarter, you had a similar thing in 1Q 2015. But if I take a step back and I look at sort of the quarterly run rate for corporate banking fees, it's been pretty consistently in the sort of $105 million to $115 million range for a few years now. So I wanted to \u2013 can you just talk a little bit about or outline some of the efforts there to sort of really restart and really get that fee line moving and what's your level of optimism that you can kick start that revenue line and really sort of break out of the range you've been in over the last couple of years. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Hey, Saul, let's \u2013 I'm going to sort of digest it a little bit and then I'm going to turn it over to Lars in terms of what we are doing. In terms of the capital markets fees, so capital markets fees is roughly 60% of total corporate banking fees any changes obviously from quarter-to-quarter. The challenging part there that also includes our FICC revenues, the interest rate derivates, commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, et cetera. That business has been under pressure just due to environmental factors. And the overall capital markets fee growth is being somewhat limited by the pressures on that business. We are actually doing certain things in that business. I'm going to turn over to Lars to articulate those. So, as that business recovers, I think we'll do well, the rest of the capital markets business is a combination of corporate bond fees, loan syndications, and M&A advisory equity capital markets. Again, Lars and his team are working very diligently to change the slope for any growth. The remaining pieces in corporate banking fees other than capital markets are basically the lease remarketing, obviously, that's been a bit lumpy, and then just overall fees associated with loan activity, letter of credit and other corporate banking fees. So those obviously \u2013 as the loan environment changes, those also would be positively impacted. But Lars, you guys are doing a lot of things here to change the slope. Lars C. Anderson - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yeah. So I think the point on our FICC businesses is critical. That's been one that obviously globally we've seen kind of a risk off ever since Brexit. What you've seen across a lot of the regional bank platforms is the FRM businesses and foreign exchange, interest rate commodity hedging have been very weak. However, in spite of that, that historically has been a big part of our company. We're there with our clients, we're talking to them, we're strategizing, so that when we get back into a risk on type of environment that we will be positioned with them. And I would tell you that we're making technology investments there to improve even the delivery and go to a digital real-time environment. And I see that this frankly is a North Star opportunity for us to drive some significant fee income for us for the future. So I'm optimistic on that part of it that Tayfun referenced. The investment banking piece of it, loan syndication, corporate bond underwriting, equity underwriting, M&A \u2013 our investment banking revenues are up 45% on a common quarter basis. So I don't think there's any question about it that we're moving market share in the regional banking space there. And that's really important to our core strategy that Greg talks about. It's advisory base, it's a relationship base, and we're bringing solutions and ideas to these clients to help them to grow, be successful. This is a developing story and one that we continue to invest in, in technology as well as talent and align it with our industry verticals, the areas of our company that we want to grow. Saul Martinez - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. No, that's helpful. And I'd love to pick your brain at some other point offline on what you're doing. But if we can move to payments as well, and obviously, you guys highlighted some of the things that impacted the results this quarter. I think you mentioned reward, the agent bank card sale, obviously, seasonality sequentially. But can you talk more broadly about business momentum? It's obviously \u2013 it seems like a pretty important part of your strategy going forward. And do you feel like you're getting traction and how optimistic are you that you can really start to ramp up the revenues. I think you did mention that you see steady growth during the course of the year, but if you could maybe comment a little bit more broadly on your strategy, what you're seeing in the marketplace and how quickly can you really start to see that line item move in an upward trajectory? Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : We're optimistic that we can grow that line as we move forward. A lot of the investments that we recently made as part of Project North Star start to really take hold in the second, third, and fourth quarter of this year and into next year, of course, on the card business. We introduced a couple additional products. We completely reengineered our analytics team in that area and we're optimistic \u2013 and we're starting to see it already, some lift in that business as we had projected we would, which will continue to materialize through the year. In addition to that cash management, we made numerous investments in technology, in fintech space, in partnerships to continue to be additive to support our verticals, which is extremely important. We continue to focus on cash management solutions such as our CPS technology. We've got over 10,000 plus devices now installed, and you're really starting to see that show up in a meaningful way as we move through the rest of this year. So we're optimistic we can grow that line item, and Tayfun, if you want to add any more color. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yeah. So, when you think about payments business and split it into consumer and commercial; on the consumer side, with respect to balances, as Greg said, we introduced a couple of new cards in Q4. And when you do that, it tends to have an impact on just outstanding balances. So we're going through that, but those cards are getting great traction and we expect that they will contribute to balance growth. And also, as Greg mentioned, we are truly investing in our analytical capabilities and partnering up with some teams well known in the industry to improve both the front-end analytics as well back-end. So the consumer side is going to be an important part of the picture. But on the commercial side, the two areas that we are currently very focused on is pricing and optimization and regular treasury management in the regular treasury management portfolio, which is basically a stand-alone project without even touching upon growth there. And the other piece is commercial card. Our commercial card revenue is, in general, about $60 million, $65 million on an annual basis, but I think we are expecting with this new project of integrating commercial card into our overall relationships across the board, we are expecting healthy growth there as well. So, you will see more credit exchange coming, which is matched a little bit, obviously, with higher cash rewards, but overall going into 2018 and 2019, we are very optimistic about (01:06:17). Saul Martinez - UBS Securities LLC : That's helpful. Did you disclose how much the sale of the agent bank card portfolio impacted the payments line year-on-year? Was it material? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yeah, that was in the second quarter and was about $10 million... Saul Martinez - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : ...of gains in the second quarter of last year. Saul Martinez - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ricky Dodds - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys. This is actually Ricky Dodds from Matt's team. Most of my questions have been asked, but maybe following up on Marty's question, a bigger picture one on some of the recent investments you've made. I think you said in the prepared remarks that GreenSky is performing in line with expectation. I was wondering if you could touch on some of the other recent investments there or partnerships, things like ApplePie, and perhaps give us a sense of their performance versus maybe your initial expectations and then, additionally, how meaningful can these businesses be over time? Thanks. Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yeah, first off, GreenSky, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is ramping up, and we're very pleased on the performance of GreenSky with respect to our expectations from balance sheet perspective, but also some of the more strategic components of that on the referral part and also the investments in the technology sector embedded into our franchise will start to come on later this year. So that's going well and as planned. Other areas that we're looking at, you mentioned ApplePie, we're just in the infancy of really studying that opportunity and determining how best to position that, and right now, we're early in that phase. So I wouldn't comment too much about that one. Other investments that we're making that will come online, as I mentioned, the mortgage loan origination platform, that comes online third quarter of this year. We'll start to roll it out segment by segment. Our branch optimization and digitization, that starts to come online later this year. So we expect to see the returns of that, and the improvement of that. And then investments in Transactis and AvidXchange are right on target with respect to our expectations. Albeit, they will be fairly modest this year, but we expect those to ramp up over time as we move into 2018 and 2019. Ricky Dodds - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then, lastly, maybe a quick question on Vantiv, just wondering if you can provide maybe your updated thoughts on the stake and then what the plans would be when and if you were to decide to monetize that? Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : Right now, we have an equity position about 17.8% in Vantiv. We've been very, very diligent about how we've managed that position. It's a significant source of our off balance sheet capital for us. We've been very strategic with it. When you look at this, trust me, every single quarter, right now, we're comfortable where we're at, but that may change next month. But we'll continue to look at it. Once again, it's all focused on what creates the greatest value for our shareholders. And over time, our patience has paid-off well for our shareholders. Ricky Dodds - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks, guys. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac from FIG Partners. Your line is open. Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners : Thanks. Just wanted to ask about the criticized loan mentioned in the slides, would that be applicable for the commercial as well? Frank R. Forrest - Fifth Third Bancorp : I'm sorry. What is your question regarding criticized loans? Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners : Would criticized loan be applicable for the commercial and the consumer side in terms of being flat? Frank R. Forrest - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yes. Criticized loans were slightly up this quarter about $70 million. But, as a reminder, over the previous four quarters, criticized assets were down $955 million and we project that they will continue to remain flat to slightly improve for the rest of the year. Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners : Great. Thanks for that, Frank. And then just a quick question for Tayfun; what are the mechanics on lower tax rates in the future? Should we be thinking of that as sort of retention of whatever cuts may occur? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Are you talking about with respect to potential changes in the tax rate regime? Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners : Correct, correct. So for every drop in tax, how does that work? Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yeah. Look, I think, clearly, the corporate tax rate alone does not necessarily define the ultimate picture. As you know, our guidance for this year is in the 25% range. So we do have deductions and it's important for us to maintain those deductions in place as the overall corporate tax rates come down. I don't have a guidance as to what every percent of change in tax rates would be just because the outlook is very cloudy as to how the complete tax regime may look like in the future. We will benefit from it. We'll benefit more if we can maintain our reductions, but if they take it away we'll benefit less. That's our current thinking. Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners : Great, Tayfun. Thanks very much for the color. Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of quick ones; could you give us your retail sector exposure? Frank R. Forrest - Fifth Third Bancorp : Hi, this is Frank. Let me break it down for you. We've got right under $1 billion in CRE retail, that's broken out between the stabilized portfolio, which is about $650 million and construction, which is $350 million. And then on non-CRE retail, we have a $1 billion to general retailers and we've got another $3 billion to specialty retailers. In the non-CRE retail, the outstanding is around $1.8 billion and, to give you an idea, that's about 3.5% to 4% of our commercial portfolio, and it's performing very well. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. And how much of this is ABL or is it just straight lines, unsecured lines? Frank R. Forrest - Fifth Third Bancorp : Well, it's a combination, most of these are mid-cap and large-cap companies that tend to be revolving lines of credit, some term credit. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Okay. Thanks, Frank. Lars \u2013 a couple of questions for Lars. Lars, you mentioned something about that you're doing commodity hedges. Could you tell us what you're doing in commodity hedges and also in equity underwriting? In response to an earlier question, you mentioned both of those. What kind of an infrastructure you built up in equity underwriting? Lars C. Anderson - Fifth Third Bancorp : Yeah. So, today, what we're essentially doing is we're laying off on the commodity hedging, we are providing risk management services effectively there to our clients as they look out into the future and they're trying to manage their margins, obviously, with a risk off environment. There's been less activity there. The equity underwriting has been something that has been an area that we have more recently been growing. It's a relatively small part of our overall investment banking platform are dominated by loan syndications, corporate bond, underwriting. But, for selective names, we're certainly in the underwriting of often times conversion of some of their balance sheet over to equity where we can improve their capital stack. So it's an advisory-based business, and we don't expect to be a leader in equity underwriting, but it's got to be a part of the entire kind of capital stack solution advisory approach to our clients. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. So you're not in the business yet of like equity research or equity trading capabilities...? Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp : No, we're not. Lars C. Anderson - Fifth Third Bancorp : No, we're not. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : There are no more questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to presenters. Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp : Thank you, Natalie, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department and we will be happy to assist you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is TaShawn and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Fifth Third Bank\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Sameer Gokhale, Head of Investor Relations, the floor is yours. Sameer Gokhale : Thank you, TaShawn. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the second quarter of 2017. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. Additionally, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference during today's conference call are included in our earnings release along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. A copy of our most recent quarterly earnings release can be accessed by the public in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, www.53.com. This morning, I'm joined on our call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you'll see in our results, we reported second quarter 2017 net income available to common shareholders of $344 million and earnings of $0.45 per share. our reported EPS includes negative $0.01 per share impact from the Visa total return swap. Our results for the quarter were very strong and reflected our continued focus on profitable revenue growth, expense management and credit discipline. Our ROTCE and ROA metrics improved both on a sequential and year-over-year basis as we made progress toward achieving our North Star objectives. We're also pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan. This will allow us to both increase our dividend and significantly increase capital distributions to our shareholders compared to last year. At approximately 120% of consensus earnings estimates, our expected payout ratio is one of the highest in the industry. I like to make a few observations about the operating environment. Given the political gridlock, the timing of potential changes to the regulatory environment remains uncertain and expectations for more fiscal stimulus have been tempered. On the other hand, the data on jobs growth is encouraging and we like other banks are benefiting from recent Fed rate hikes. A strong jobs outlook combined with modern inflation and healthy consumer spending also leads me to believe the yield curve will steepen as long-term interest rates begin to rise.  However, the sustainability of the strong employment data and the prospect of higher interest rates will depend on whether we see acceleration in real GDP growth. We like many of you will like to gain more clarity to get a better directional read on a longer term outlook. We are operating under the assumption that economic growth in the near term will remain muted. When I laid out our vision for North Star in September of 2016, we announced that we expect to realize significant benefits without assuming any meaningful changes in the regulatory and macro environment. As our Q2 results demonstrate, we're going to make progress towards enhancing our profitability while improving our balance sheet resiliency. In Q2, we benefited from effective expense management, an improvement in our key credit metrics while growing revenues. Our asset sensitive balance sheet allows us to continue to benefit from increased short-term interest rates. Our commercial loan production in the second quarter was the strongest since the first quarter of 2016 with a healthy pipeline as we look ahead to the rest of the year. Our adjusted net interest margin expanded 3 basis points sequentially, exceeding our previous guidance reflecting the benefit of higher rates. In addition, we maintained pricing discipline on commercial loans which helped the overall net interest margin. Our pricing discipline partly reflects our focus on client selection as we are interested in building durable long-term relationships rather than pricing simply to drive faster near-term loan growth. Our total average loan portfolio was flat sequentially. This reflected the impact of delivered commercial exits as well as continued decline in indirect auto loan balances. The trend in our loans continued to reflect our decision two years ago with curtailed originations to improve our returns on capital. From a commercial perspective, we announced at the beginning of the year that we plan to exit about $1.5 billion of commercial loans this year, which will impact our net loan growth.  In the first half of 2017, we have exited $900 million of loans, split evenly between return and credit related exits. Excluding deliberate exits, our average commercial portfolio grew 3% year-over-year compared to reported decline of 2%. And in the consumer portfolio, if you exclude the auto loans, average consumer balances grew 4% year over year compared to the reported decline of 2%. In terms of fee income, excluding the impact of [indiscernible] in earnings release, fee revenue was 7% higher sequentially. The sequential increase primarily reflected $31 million lease remarketing impairment recorded last quarter. During the second quarter, we continued to diligently manage our expenses while investing in other areas of strategic importance. For example, we invested in repositioning our brand through print, television, radio and digital advertising. While it is early, the feedback on our brand launch has been very positive. In Q2, non-interest expenses were down 3% sequentially and year-over-year. The year-over-year decline partially reflects the benefits of our early North Star initiatives to reduce expenses. We now expect 2017 expenses to be flat year-over-year and Tayfun will expand on this in his prepared remarks. Turning to credit quality. During the quarter, credit quality continued to improve. Our criticized asset ratio decreased significantly to 5.5%, is now at the lowest level in over ten years. Non-performing assets also decreased with our NPA ratio at the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2015. These forward-looking credit metrics to adjust that credit quality should remain relatively stable in the near term.  Our net charge-off ratio also decreased significantly and remains at pre-crisis levels. Our capital and employee levels remain very strong with our common equity tier-1 ratio at 10.6%, while LCR exceeded the regulatory requirements over 20%. As I mentioned previously, we are very pleased with the outcome of this year's CCAR exercise. Our capital plan allows us to increase our dividend by 29% compared to current levels and increase capital deployment for share repurchases by 76% compared to last year\u2019s CCAR submission. Under the Federal Reserve\u2019s DFAS scenario, we again show less capital destruction compared to the peer group median. The plan we submitted was prudent from a risk management perspective, but appropriately focused on achieving the right results for our shareholders. The results prove that there is no inherent conflict between those two goals. We\u2019re also making solid progress on our North Start initiatives. We expect to generate an ROA near 1.1% and ROTCE of roughly 11% by 2018 and remain confident in our ability to achieve our North Star targets by the end of 2019. We have previously communicated that with project North Star we expect to generate $800 million in incremental analyzed pretax income by the end of 2019. This was a function of expected base improvements, additional expense savings and revenue growth initiatives. These improvements consist of continued improvements in our core expenses such as vendor management, staffing, and process improvements. The additional expense saves we had mentioned will come from a number of items such as IT efficiencies and facilities management. On Slide 11 of the earnings presentation, we are providing you with more specifics on North Star revenue initiatives that we expect will drive growth in pretax income.  We expect these initiatives to drive almost $300 million of annualized pretax income growth by the end of 2019. One area of particular focus is in our commercial business, but we plan to expand that depth and breadth of our client offerings over the next few years. In commercial lending we are investing to improve fee income as well as net interest income. Our balance sheet initiatives include growth in middle market lending, with expansion to new markets, significant growth in asset-based lending and additional vertical build outs. The objective to develop a strategic partnership with our clients by providing expertise in delivering a differentiate customer experience. This approach helps building during relationships, allows us to manage risk and drives profitability. About a year ago, we started expanding our ABL capabilities with investments in infrastructure and talent. We now have the ability to underwrite and service any type of ABL product and over the past year we have closed a number of complex deals that we could not have done before.  In fact our ABL portfolio has roughly doubled in the past year. We have also made substantial investments to build out industry verticals. Our go-to market strategy by vertical has proven to be effective that allows us to build and leverage sector expertise to better serve the needs of our customers. We continue to evaluate new opportunities that add to our existing verticals in healthcare, T&T, energy, retail and entertainment leisure and lodging. While we\u2019re undertaking these growth initiatives but at the same time implementing a project to improve effectiveness and efficiency of our commercial money processes to support growth and enhance client service. The objective of this project is a streamline of processes to improve cycle times, reduce our cost of serve and also provide our relationship managers with additional capacity to generate new business. This is what help produce better outcome for our clients, our employees and our shareholders.  In capital markets, our investments include significant upgrade for technology platform, expansion of our sponsored coverage group and additional ECM and DCM capabilities with added resources and talent. Our wholesale payments initiatives include recently launched projects to grow our commercial card business, enhance our commercial portfolio with advanced liquidity managed tools to better manage cash flows and leverage technology solutions similar to AvidXchange and Transactis. These investments are all aimed at keeping our relationship and generating higher and more consistent commercial payments revenue. Insurance is a new initiative for us with modest by expanding on expectations. We believe this business is a good complement to our other commercial offering. In the consumer business we are in the process of rolling out a new loan origination system with a correspond mortgage channel. In the fourth quarter, the new system will be implemented in our direct and retail mortgage channels. During the first half of next year, we will work on integrating the new system with our home equity platform.  This initiative will create both NII as well as fee income opportunities while reducing our cost to originate consumer mortgages. As we discussed previously, we are also in the process of digitizing our branch operations in an effort to get to a paperless environment. This will be achieved with branch scanning, the use electronic signatures and running more self-service transactions. Once completed this initiative is expect to reduce our paper count by 700 million pages per year, with efficiency generated from reduced paper and transportation expenses, we expect to save $10 million annually. This initiative includes replacement of our branch teller software, this new platform will improve the customer experience, mitigate compliance and operational risk through automation and ultimately improve the efficiency and speed of transaction processing. We have powered this in 10% of our branch network and are very happy with the results. We\u2019ll gradually implement this across the rest of our branch network in the second quarter of 2018.  We are working diligently on our personal and small business lending initiatives and have entered into select partnerships to help drive loan growth. These initiatives will help us achieve a better balance between commercial and consumer loans. We are partnering with fintech companies to reduce cycle times, run our product line up and expand our distribution channels. Partnerships with companies like ApplePie Capital to enhance our product offerings and cover a wide spectrum of borrowers with the diverse funding needs. In consumer credit cards, we have already launched an initiative to upgrade our analytical capabilities focused on growth in our footprint. We are partnering with a consulting firm with deep expertise to enhance our in-house abilities and we believe we have an opportunity to simply grow our consumer payments business. The wealth in asset management, we are focused on expanding our remarket capabilities through acquisitions, additional resource deployment and a rollout of a digital investment platform that will enhance the economics for certain clients segments. We are on target to launch the new digital platform in December. Overall, we had a very good quarter and our North Star initiatives remain on track. Tayfun will share additional financial details around these initiatives in his prepared remarks. I would like to once again thank our employees for their hard work and dedication evident in our financial results and our customers\u2019 satisfaction scores and community outreach efforts. We certainly launched a series of community advisory forms both at the regional and national level. This gives us a terrific opportunity to increase engagement and better meet the needs of the communities in which we serve. I am also especially proud of our efforts initiated on May 3 or Fifth Third Day to provide over a million meals supporting local food banks during the quarter. Furthermore, we recently announced a $10 million contribution to support the Cincinnati Cancer Consortium, this gift is a critical step in supporting an effort to achieve a National Cancer Institute designation with Cincinnati Cancer Consortium and NCI designation will lead to more research funding and better outcomes for cancer patients throughout the greater Cincinnati region. I\u2019m pleased that our entire organization is aligned in fulfilling our stated purpose to improve the lives of the people in the communities we serve. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook for the remainder of the year. Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's begin with a financial summary on Slide 4 of the presentation. Greg mentioned, during the quarter our continued focus on disciplined expense management, the expansion of our net interest margin, stable credit quality and efficient capital management all reflected our commitment to driving improved financial performance. We achieved positive operating leverage both on a year-over-year and sequential basis during the quarter. We expect to achieve positive operating leverage again next quarter and for the full year. Overall, average loans were flat sequentially mostly as a result of continued exits from certain commercial exposures and the planned decline in our indirect auto loan balances. New origination levels were strong giving us an optimistic outlook for 2018 and beyond as the deliberate acts especially in C&I will be coming to an end this year. Average commercial loan balances were flat sequentially and down 2% year over year. Excluding the impact of the exits that Greg mentioned in his prepared remarks, average commercial loans were up 1% sequentially. The sequential decline in average C&I balances was partially offset by 2% growth in commercial real estate loans this quarter. Much of the quarterly average growth in construction loans came from drawdowns near the end of the first quarter. With the summer construction season in full swing, we would expect client utilization to remain strong. On the other hand payouts will continue into 2013, 2014 vintages as construction loans either sell or move to the permanent market. We are currently seeing increased pipelines in office and industrial as the demand for multi-family is moderating. We've kept a conservative risk profile in construction lending and will continue to be diligent in underwriting as we are at the later stages of this cycle. Expanding new production spreads, combined with the move in LIBOR result in a 24 BP yield improvement in that portfolio. At this time, we have roughly another $600 million of exits to go for the remainder of 2017 which should be split about evenly across the next two quarters. Excluding these anticipated exits, we expect to grow total of commercial loans in the low to mid single digits in 2017. Assuming the muted economic environment persists, including these exits we expect our commercial loan portfolio to grow by about 1% on an end of period basis, which is slightly below the guidance we gave last quarter. We remain competitive in all of our markets and maintained a disciplined approach in pricing and underwriting, which is enabling us to grow profitable relationships. To further boost future loan growth, we are expanding our commercial sales force in both regional and national businesses. As Greg mentioned, we are also looking to expand through additional geographies in middle market lending, which we expect will increase future loan and revenue growth. Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and down 2% year-over-year. Excluding auto, average consumer loans were up 4% year over year. Auto loans were down 14% year over year. The reduction in auto balances continues to reflect our decision to curtail indirect originations and redeploy capital elsewhere. Residential mortgage loans grew by 1% sequentially and 10% year over year as we continue to retain jumbo mortgages, ARMs as well as certain 10 and 15 year fixed rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our home equity loan originations were 17% higher this quarter sequentially and up 7% year over year. As loan paydowns in our legacy book continued to exceed strong origination volumes, portfolio outstandings decreased 3% sequentially and 8% year over year. And credit card portfolio was down 3% from the first quarter, although end of period balances were up 2% sequentially. We are seeing stronger growth related to the new card rollout that we executed at the end of last year with purchase active accounts up both sequentially and year-over-year. We expect that our simplified and more competitive card offerings along with our enhanced analytical capabilities will allow us to drive faster growth in the second half of this year and into 2018. Excluding the deliberate deduction of indirect auto loan balances, we are expecting to grow our consumer and mortgage loans by a low to mid single digit rates in 2017. The outlook reflects our current expectation, the HELOC paydowns on older vintages will continue to outpace production in the near term. Consistent with our strategy, the redeployment of capital from indirect auto lending to other parts of our consumer lending franchise should provide further support for higher ROTCE and ROA levels. Our investment portfolio balances remained relatively stable in the second quarter as we had expected. We continue to expect to maintain our investment portfolio at roughly the same level. Average core deposits were down 1% sequentially as growth in the consumer portfolio was offset by declines in the commercial portfolio. As sequential decline in money market and interest checking accounts was offset by increases in savings balances. We feel good about our deposit balances as we continue to make rational decisions between pricing them appropriately for profitability and maintaining and growing relationship based LCR-friendly deposit. The market especially in large commercial accounts is becoming more competitive, which we expected all along and our margin and NII outlook already reflect the market dynamics as we observed them today. Our modified liquidity coverage ratio continued to be very strong at 122% at the end of the quarter. Net interest income of $945 million was up $18 million or 2% from the previous quarters adjusted NII and is up $37 million or 4% from last year. Our strong underlying NII performance reflects the positive impact of higher short-term rates. Growth in NII came both from the consumer and commercial portfolios, reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher wholesale borrowings. Over the last year, expansion in earning asset yields significantly outpaced the increase in our cost of funds. The adjusted NIM increased 3 basis points from the first quarter to 3.01% exceeding our previous guidance. Excluding the prior quarters card remediation impact, our total loan yield was up 11 basis points sequentially, with commercial yield up 13 basis points. As we look ahead, third quarter NIM should be a couple of basis points wider than the second quarter NIM. With the assumption of a rate increase at the very end of the year, we currently expect the full-year NIM to be roughly in line with our margin in the second quarter. Overall deposit betas so far have remained low and are in the mid teens with commercial betas in the 30% range. Our guidance assumes that on a blended basis, consumer and commercial deposit betas will increase to the 40% range in the coming months for the most recent move in June. For subsequent rate hikes, we expect deposit betas to be in the 50% range. If we see betas at lower ranges, our margin could exceed our guidance. We expect our third quarter net interest income to be up by about 2% sequentially. For the full year we expect NII growth approximately 5%. Excluding the impact of the Visa swap, non-interest income in the second quarter was $571 million compared to $536 million in the first quarter which included a $31 million lease remarketing impairment. Mortgage banking net revenue of $55 million was up $3 million sequentially. Originations were 17% higher than the first quarter and our gain on sale margin improved to 209 basis points compared with 198 basis points. Original fees were up 28% sequentially in line with our guidance. During the quarter, our origination mix was heavily weighted toward purchase volumes as refinance activity remained muted despite the lower rate environment. Approximately two thirds of the originations continued to be sourced from the retail and direct channels and the remainder originated through the corresponding channel. This quarter we executed on the purchase of servicing rights on nearly $4 billion worth of mortgages in addition to the $6 billion we discussed with you last quarter. $2.4 billion of the nearly $10 billion has been onboarded this far, with the rest scheduled for the third quarter. Corporate banking fees of $101 million were up $27 million or 36% sequentially, reflecting the impact of the $31 million lease remarketing impairment last quarter. Corporate banking revenues this quarter reflected a broader decline in trading activity across the industry. We expect that this line item will exhibit some quarterly variability given the nature of the capital markets business. We currently expect corporate banking fees to increase 6% to 8% in the third quarter sequentially. We have a strong pipeline that we look to execute during the second half of the year. Deposit service charges were relatively stable, up $1 million from the first quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2016. Card and processing revenue increased 7% sequentially. The sequential performance was driven by an increase in customer transactions and spend volume compared to the seasonally lower first quarter. Total wealth and asset management revenue of $103 million was down 5% sequentially, due to seasonally higher tax related private client for services revenue in the first quarter, partially offset by higher personal asset management revenue. Revenues increased 2% relative to the second quarter of 2016, mainly due to higher personal asset management and brokerage revenue. Recurring revenues in this business have increased to 80% of fees from 75% in the second quarter of 2016 and 72% in the second quarter of 2015 as we have continued to shift our product and service offerings toward more recurring revenue streams to limit our reliance on transactional activity. Excluding mortgage banking revenue and non-core items shown on Slide 14 of the presentation, we expect non-interest income to grow by 2% in 2017, the change from our previous guidance of 3% is primarily due to the second quarter\u2019s lower capital markets activity, which we expect to pick up in the second half of the year. For the third quarter on the same basis, we expect fee growth of approximately 2% over the second quarter levels. We remain focused on disciplined expense management, while still investing for a future revenue growth. Non-interest expenses were down 3% both sequentially and year-over-year, which was better than our guidance and was broad based across nearly all of our expense lines. Since the beginning of 2016, we have been able to report improving expense results almost every quarter.  Excluding the impact of the amortization of low income housing related investments, which nearly all of our peers show in their tax line, our efficiency ratio is approaching 60%. We will maintain our expense discipline, we now partially fund the wide array of investment that Greg discussed. We plan to invest a portion of our savings this year to drive near-term growth momentum. A good example of this is our investment in direct marketing, we believe we\u2019ve significantly improved direct marketing analytics capabilities which we have been enhancing over the last year, we will be able to impact future retail household growth to support both loan and deposit production. As a result of our improved outlook, we will grow our direct marketing expenses in the third quarter. Similarly, our investments in technology continue to support many revenue growth and expense saving opportunities across our company. Our teller automation project is nearing completion, the mortgage project is in progress and our teams are working on the initiatives to enable easy access to direct personal credit offers. Despite all that investment activity, we now expect the expenses in 2017 to be roughly flat compared to 2016 including incremental expenses associated with new initiatives under project North Star. This improves upon our guidance last quarter that called for expenses to be up 1%. Any increase relative to this guidance would be related to higher than anticipated growth in business activity. In the absence of North Star related expenses, this guidance implicitly points to a decline by about 1.5% in 2017. Given the expectation of a ramp up in some North Star investments and the marketing spend that I just mentioned, we currently expect third quarter expenses to be up about 1% from reported expenses in the third quarter of 2016. Our guidance today clearly reflects our commitment to achieving positive operating leverage in 2017. We are making substantive progress in lowering our efficiency ratio towards our long-term target of sub-60%. Turning to credit results on Slide 9. We are very pleased with our second quarter credit results. Total quarterly net charge offs were the lowest in nearly 17 years. Net charge-offs were $64 million or 28 basis points, an improvement from $89 million and 40 basis points in the first quarter of 2017 and from $87 million or 37 basis points in the second quarter a year ago. The sequential improvement was driven by an $18 million decrease in C&I net charge-offs. C&I net charge-offs were positive impacted by higher than normal recovery levels. Consumer charge-offs were down $70 million sequentially and stable year over year. Total portfolio non-performing loans were $614 million, down $43 million from the previous quarter, resulting in an NPL ratio of 67 basis points. The largest concentration is in energy with roughly a third of the balances related to 2016 downgrades. New transfer to the NPL portfolio were at their lowest levels since the second quarter of 2015. Total NPAs were down 7% from last quarter, with sequential improvement in nearly all loan categories. They criticized asset ratio has decreased to 5.5% from 5.8% of commercial loans at the end of the first quarter and has had a ten-plus year low. Our loss provision was $22 million lower than last quarter reflecting the positive trends in our loan portfolio. With the resulting reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases of 1.34% only one basis point lower than last quarter. Our allowance coverage of NPLs increased to 200% from 188% last quarter. Our previous guidance that net charge-offs will be range bound, some quarterly variability remains unchanged. And we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth. Our capsule levels remained very strong during the second quarter. Our common equity tier-1 ratio was 10.6% reflecting a decrease of 12 basis points quarter over quarter and an increase of 70 basis points year-over-year. The sequential decline in capital was driven by a $342 million share buyback initiated during the quarter. Our tangible common equity excluding unrealized gains and losses decreased 13 basis points sequentially but increased 38 basis points year-over-year. The result of this year's CCAR exercise were very strong. The combination of our strong current capital levels, the continuing improvement in the risk profile of our balance sheet and our strong earnings resulted in a consensus payout ratio, which is near the top of our peer group. We expect to increase both dividends and buybacks strongly over the next four quarters subject to economic conditions and the ultimate approval of our Board of Directors. Going forward, we intend to be balanced between dividend increases and share buybacks. As you know any future reduction in our Vantiv ownership gives us additional capacity for further share buybacks. We also think that our current capital levels are higher than what we need to run our company from a through-the-cycle safety and soundness perspective, given the significant improvement in the risk profile of our organization. As we continue to execute our strategy in this evolving regulatory environment, it is likely that we may see further decrease in our overall capital levels. At the end of the second quarter, common shares outstanding were down 11 shares or 2% compared to the first quarter of 2017 and down 17 million shares or 4% compared to last year second quarter. Book value and tangible value were both 1% from the last quarter. With respect to taxes, we expect our third quarter tax rate to be roughly around 25.5% and a full-year 2017 tax rate to be in 24.5 to 25.5 range. Our guidance reflects the benefits from our recent actions and provide support for the initiatives under North Star. Slide 12 provides an updated outlook for your reference. As we discussed with you some of the initiatives are already impacting our performance especially on the expense side. The implied decline in our base expenses excluding our North Star related expenses is indicative of the ongoing impact of the expense initiatives. Our North Star performance expectations were clearly stated last year. End of 2019 run rate, ROTCE between 12% and 14%, ROA between 1.1% and 1.3% and efficiency ratio sub-60% without any meaningful help from the environment. We also projected that 2018 would be the first year of step up towards these targets. During last quarter's earnings call, we guided to a 1.1% ROA and 11% plus ROTCE in 2018 assuming two more rate increases this year and two more next year. We had one of the rate increases in June and we have one more project in December of this year. If we see two more in 2018, our expectations should still hold. Our revenue growth outlook, our ability to achieve positive operating leverage without changing our risk appetite, a strong balance sheet and our strategic positioning give us confidence in our ability to create additional shareholder value. To that end, we are pleased to announce that we will be hosting our first ever Investor Day on December 7 in New York. Our Executive Team will share additional details about their businesses and the progress we are making towards our strategic objectives. With that let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A. Sameer Gokhale : Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional question. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question and answer period, lease provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. TaShawn, please open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question does come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill + Partners. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Tayfun, I was hoping you could just - obviously a lot of guidance I appreciate the transparency. As you look into the back half of the year, you suggested a rebound in corporate banking revenues off a softer 2Q due to capital markets. I\u2019m wondering if you can maybe walk through some of your expectations for some of the other drivers that you see gets you to the updated guidance for the full year, just in fee income specifically. Greg Carmichael : Yes. So I\u2019ll make some overall comments and then Lars probably can provide some color on corporate banking. In general, our expectation, when you look at the main parts of our fee revenues, mortgage, I think, it's going to be a fairly stable quarter in the third quarter. So we're expecting the current environment to continue, so there's nothing out of the extraordinary in terms of our expectations for mortgage. Wealth and asset management has been weighing up so stably, nicely growing for us.  The deposit piece, we're seeing payments income growing into the second half of the year similarly. I don't have any out of the ordinary expectations with respect to any of the other fee income items. I just want to remind you that we obviously, the way, as we always do, we have the fourth quarter TRA payment that we are expecting from Vantiv. Turning over to the corporate banking side, clearly, we have a look at our pipeline and maybe Lars can provide some color on what we're seeing there. Lars Anderson : Yes. So first of all, when you look at the overall corporate banking fees, I would point out, you may see in the appendix there that the core business lending fees were actually up nicely on a linked quarter basis and Scott that was reflective of the record production that we've had this quarter, the highest level that we've seen in -- over a year. Beyond that, obviously a lot of headwinds in the sales and trading and FICC business which you of course have seen across the industry. That's going to be largely driven by the yield curve, volatility in the overall market place in what we see and some of our FRM businesses. So that will impact that. The good news for us is that, is we've continued to strategically position ourselves to build out our advisory businesses, in particular in the investment banking, M&A and that's become a much bigger part of our overall, our overall corporate banking fee mix. So that's a real positive, because as I look towards the second half of the year, we're seeing activity level start to pick up, Scott, both at the larger transactional level and in our core middle market that look fairly promising.  And I think that would help us to deliver some pretty attractive fee incomes. We're also continuing to add expertise and resources that align with a number of our industry verticals, which -- that too will be incremental I think to the growth of some of our corporate banking fees for the second half of the year and beyond. Scott Siefers : And then finally just one kind of ticky tack question, either for you Tayfun or maybe Jamie. I think in the past, you guys have talked about securities yield in like the 305, 310 range for the full year. Any update on how you guys are thinking about? Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah. I still believe that we will be right in that range. We think the portfolio is well positioned and we're pleased with the results. Operator : And your o next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Maybe starting with Vantiv, clearly there is potential for them to undertake a pretty significant transaction. I wondered if you could give some thoughts on how a big transaction by Vantiv would change, just your thoughts around continued ownership. And then second, any accounting impact from your percentage ownership dropping down? Greg Carmichael : Geoffrey, thanks for the question. This is Greg. At this point right now, since we\u2019re just in early stage due diligence with Worldpay, we are not in a position to make any comments about that transaction or the impact or how we feel about that transaction to Fifth third. So more to come on that on our next earnings call once that transaction materializes or decided to do something different. At this point, we have no comment on that transaction. Tayfun Tuzun : And on the equity method accounting that you were alluding to, Geoff, there is a pretty low threshold for that. I think the ownership percentage would have to decline to low single digits before the accounting methodology would change. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. And then another one on non-interest income, I guess kind of taking a step back, if you look at the lines that make that up year-on-year, service charge is up 1%, wealth and asset management is up 2%, but pretty much everything else looks like it's down year-on-year. So how should we think about understanding that in the context of the growth initiatives that you're talking about? Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah, I think, the one comment that I will make because it is such a large item, corporate banking piece are a significant line item and there is fee income associated obviously with the nearly $4.5 billion of loans that we've exited over the last 18 months. So we need to take that into account when analyzing the year-over-year change in corporate banking. As we move forward and reach the end of the year, with those exits coming to an end, I would expect the momentum in corporate banking to actually move up. And also in capital markets, on page 11, we are listing a number of initiatives that directly impact being fee income growth in addition to other areas such as wholesale payments, insurance. So as we look forward into \u201918 and \u201919, there are some significant pick-ups in all of these areas with respect to fee income growth expectations. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Greg, when you look at what the Treasury proposed about a month ago in changes for the banking industry, both legislatively and regulatorily, if you had to pick one or two that you think would best benefit Fifth Third, what would those choices be of some of the proposals they meant. Greg Carmichael : First of all, so I think on the, of course, the thing was very well done and 149 pages, [indiscernible] institutions and some of the things that they\u2019re looking at and we\u2019re all basically put together by input from the banks and I think LCR would be one that we want to look at, they\u2019re looking at, if we can see some improvement on how that is calculated and how that\u2019s viewed. I think that would be very positive. In addition to that, I think overall on the capital management, I mean, as we talked about, we\u2019re strong from a capital perspective, our ability to put that capital and making it easier for us to do business, especially in the area of small business lending and some of the changes that the guidance would suggest, I think it would be make it easier for us to serve that sector. So those are the two areas that we like to see some progress made. And then obviously from a regulatory perspective overall, some of the activity with the [indiscernible], trying to get that a little more fluid and a little less complex in some of the redundancy that creates, the cost to create for banks would be another step forward I think and allowing us to better serve our customers. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And I apologize if you guys mentioned this on the call and I missed it, but when you -- when we look out, as you mention you're in a strong capital position, did well in CCAR, what's the long term dividend payout ratio you guys think you'll get comfortable with. Obviously, the Fed seems to have lifted that line in the sand at the 30% mark where you guys can go higher or how do you guys think about it? Greg Carmichael : First off, it really gets down to how we view our forward earnings opportunities and the amount of capital we have to deploy. As the CCAR data suggests, we\u2019ve got forward an increased dividend of 2% this quarter, another 2% or $0.02 in the 9 months from now. So that's very strong. I would see that south or north of 30%, but with respect to putting a number on it right now, I don't want to do that, but I think if you look at the next -- the next 9, 12 months, I think we feel really good about our ability to increase our dividend and deploy capital for that line. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks again for that revenue slide on North Star. I wanted to ask you, you mentioned that you're not including the baseline in the expense initiatives, so just given the fact that you guys can or willing to articulate the revenue side of North Star, can you help us understand what was originally I think you guys said 150 million to come from the cost side and how you'd expect that to kind of project and manage the overall growth rate of expenses? Thanks. Lars Anderson : Yes. Thanks, Ken. So when we started to play out our expectations last year, we mentioned that about 45% of the improvement will come from an uplift in our base performance and we still believe that is the case. And we clearly have a very strong business composition and we look to see better performance over the next two years. In terms of -- you are correct, in terms of the expenses, our expectation is roughly 20% of that money, of that amount that we identified. Obviously, we have started some of those initiatives and the ongoing improvement in our actual expenses and expense guidance reflects the results, whether it\u2019s related to vendor re-negotiations, any work space management savings or even on just headcount efficiencies.  I think we are moving on with some of those initiatives. As we look forward and we discussed this in some meetings last quarter with investors, we expect our base expenses, excluding North Star related investments to remain well managed. We will be entering our planning period here shortly in the next 90 days and our guidance to our businesses will be to maintain their expense base, the core expense base into next year, but we will see what the outcome will be and we will update all of you during the Investor Day, but we clearly expect ongoing efficiencies coming out of our business as we look forward. Ken Usdin : Okay. So we'll look forward to that update. Then just one follow-up on the NIM, to clarify before, you\u2019re 305, 310 on the securities book and what you're expecting for the full year on NIM, but can you just talk about just progression from here and the puts and takes given the June hike and then just the balancing act between deposit betas and asset repricing. Thanks. Jamie Leonard : Sure. This is Jamie. As you look ahead on the third quarter NIM, we do expect as Tayfun mentioned, a two basis point expansion from the second quarter 301 into the third quarter and that\u2019s really driven by three basis points improvement from the June Fed move, net of the deposit betas, which is a 40% assumption and then 2 basis points of improvement from continued loan pricing discipline and the favorable loan mix shift you're seeing on the balance sheet and that's offset by 1 basis point erosion from day count and 2 basis points of a detriment from our funding actions, which you saw in part was the June holding company issuance. And so in our outlook, we do assume a December Fed move in, however as we said here today, that's looking less likely. The good news is it doesn't have that big an impact on our projections. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Just a follow-up question on fees, I just want to make sure understanding the fee guidance correctly, so based upon which we\u2019re growing full year fees adjusted on a 2% basis ex-mortgage, is that 2016 base, 2.1 billion. Tayfun Tuzun : That's correct. Erika Najarian : Okay. And so if I think about the progression again, I mean my peers had sort of asked about this, but the progression is pretty significant on an implied basis so if 500 -- if the adjusted fee is in the first quarter with 484 and the second quarter is 516 and then you gave us guidance for 3Q that implies 526, that means that fourth quarter fees ex-mortgage would have to be over 600 million. And I'm wondering what I'm missing there or if I'm not missing anything, what's driving that significant progression upward. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. So Erika, just another reminder that in the fourth quarter, as we\u2019ve had for many years now, we have a 40 plus million dollar payments related to the Vantiv TRA agreement. So that\u2019s clearly the small item that moves the fourth quarter fee income up. In addition to that, there are a couple of obviously pipeline related expectations in corporate banking. The timing of that is, we cannot necessarily plan for the timing. We are laying it out for the second quarter and that\u2019s providing a lift and also, relative to the first quarter, which was weaker in corporate banking, I think the third and fourth quarter numbers look better. That's what\u2019s driving the increase as we approach the end of this year. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just as a follow-up question, just switching gears, as you pointed out during the call, the CET1 ratio of 10.7 seems very robust for your size and risk profile. And I'm wondering what your thoughts are over time what an appropriate, sustainable level of CET1 would be for your company? Tayfun Tuzun : I think that given the risk profile of our company, in the long term, the company can be operated with a capital ratio of 8.5% to 9%, but I think it's very early for us to guide to that, but if the regulatory environment continues to evolve in a direction it has been, we can see our capital ratios starting to move to a nine handle. And whether or not we can take it down below that would be a reach at this point, but somewhere around 9.5% is clearly a very good number that we can achieve without the significant change. Our CCAR filing has a 10% number as we exit the currency CCAR period. So there is some room for us to improve our leverage ratio from the current level. Erika Najarian : And just squeezing one more in since Greg mentioned LCR as a binding constraint that you'd like to go away, given your robust LCR today, how much in freed liquidity could be deployed if LCR is not applicable to bank your size? Jamie Leonard : Yeah. This is Jamie. A couple of benefits from the -- if the LCR were to be eliminated, there are benefits besides the ability to deploy those excess securities into loans or other things, including the flexibility to rotate out of the lower yielding level one securities into level twos. That help would be 20, 25 basis points of yield enhancement. Right now, we're up about $10 billion of level ones and then that also generates a better convexity profile going forward. So the benefits aren't just the ability to deploy the excess capital or the excess liquidity. It's also what we currently hold could generate higher returns.  Right now, in our LCR calculation, 122% at the end of the quarter, within that number, we have about 2.9 billion of level 2As above the cap. So at a minimum, that could be deployed. And then, the final benefit that we see from an LCR revision standpoint is that certain classes of deposits will certainly become more bankable and more valuable, such as financial sector deposits that have 100% outflow assumption and we believe that could alleviate some of the pricing pressure that we're seeing on commercial deposits today. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe : I guess first question just in terms of slide 11 you have in terms of North Star, specifically the personal lending line, it's obviously the biggest contributor to the 299 million, but can you just remind us, maybe break it out a little bit more, I mean how much of that 74 comes from tech enhancements versus the higher net interest income from unsecured lending, which I would imagine would come at a bit more risk than the rest of your portfolio. Thanks. Lars Anderson : First of all, let me answer the first part of your question. That's a combination of our own credit card growth, so pure net interest income and our GreenSky partnership where we continue to grow the portfolio. In addition to that, we also have expectations of an expanded offer for our own personal unsecured lines. In terms of the risk profile, Ken is, we, first of all, the GreenSky portion of that growth is coming at a super prime level. I mean, we're talking about 750, 760 type FICO scores.  We\u2019re monitoring that and it's behaving within our expectations. So we don't see a significantly increased risk profile, even in our under stressed conditions. Similarly, in our credit card portfolio, the focus is in footprints and this is retail customers who have a very positive credit risk profile. And the same approach would be used in our own personal unsecured lending. So our expectation is this growth is not going to alter the risk profile of our consumer lending. Ken Zerbe : Got it. Okay. And just sort of related credit question. On slide 19, you talk about your retail exposure. So thanks for the additional information there. But you do mention the 3.1 billion as being higher risk retail and I just want to kind of make sure we clarify, like how much of that is truly, truly higher risk? Are you seeing deterioration and I see you have anchor malls or mall anchors, regional malls, et cetera, and how do you differentiate the risk within that retail portfolio? Frank Forrest : Hey, this is Frank. Good question. I would call it core retail, higher risk is probably not the right terminology. So think about it this way. As the slide shows, we\u2019ve got just over 3.1 billion all in, in retail exposure floor that we manage. We manage the vast majority of that -- two thirds of that through our vertical, very closely 3% of our total loan book, it\u2019s not substantial. When you look at the 1.9 billion on the slide, most of that is specialty retail. The remainder of that would be general retail.  The vast majority of that is not to the clothing sector or to the electronics store sector that\u2019s been most volatile, 3% of it\u2019s the mall anchors, but really what\u2019s more important to your question is that 98% of the specialty and general retail that you see there ,the 1.9 billion, they\u2019re pass rated credits. There's only 2% of that portfolio that\u2019s criticized.  So we're not seeing deterioration. It\u2019s performing better than our overall C&I book at this point. When you look at the balance, there's less than $1 billion in CRA, which gets a lot of attention, 769 million. Only a third of that is to regional malls, you know that over 80% are to AB property. So we feel very good overall and the REIT book is primarily very high grade exposure. We feel very good about the overall exposure we have to retail. So higher risk is really not the right term when the vast majority of this portfolio is [indiscernible] performing to our expectations. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : On the commercial loan growth front, for the second quarter, aside from the exits that you flagged, it still appears that the underlying commercial growth trends were somewhat weaker and I know part of that could be some of the -- on the real estate side, some of the permanent financing market impact, but what other areas did you see any softness in the quarter and is it indicative of any demand factors on the commercial side? Thanks. Tayfun Tuzun : Speaking specifically, I think John to this quarter, we saw a pickup in activity frankly and it was across nearly all of our verticals with the exception of healthcare, which we've been managing very carefully over the last couple of years is, there's obviously a lot of uncertainty there to client selection and working carefully with that vertical. It\u2019s been a high priority for us, but we've seen nice growth in a number of our verticals that I mentioned previously. Commercial real estate is really, that's actually been a source of some growth for us. I would not see that as a headwind.  A lot of the growth that we've seen more recently over the past two quarters to our earlier point is later stage, the maturity of our construction portfolio, but we would expect that the growth rate of that would begin to reduce over a period of time. In fact, if you looked at it, commercial real estate on a year-over-year versus linked quarter, you would see that already beginning to play out. If you look across our core middle market franchise, we saw a pickup in activity level. In fact, we saw the highest production in our core middle market also this past quarter in over a year.  Indiana, Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina is a perennial leader in the clubhouse there. So I'm feeling more optimistic about our ability to grow that core middle market franchise in commercial -- overall commercial portfolio. But it will certainly be influenced by the overall economic environment as we head into the second half of the year, but pipelines look promising. We're investing resources into it. We're expanding our capabilities and frankly I think that we're well positioned to grow that for a number of quarters to come. Lars Anderson : John, I wouldn't describe our second quarter activity as weaker. I mean, we had -- it was strongest origination quarter since the first and second quarter. Greg Carmichael : John, the other thing I would add John is, if you excluded the strategic assets of 600 million and look at what we\u2019ve done this year, we would be up 3% year-over-year in the commercial growth and that\u2019s the focus of the organization is on the opportunity that we\u2019re looking forward to, that the relationship we want to bank. I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job, especially in a very muted environment, we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of building these relationships. We\u2019re growing our commercial relationships, we\u2019re growing our consumer households. That\u2019s what this bank is focused on, the quality, return profile of our balance sheet and that\u2019s been evidenced in the numbers we discussed today. John Pancari : Okay. So that decline, the modest decline in end of period commercial balances on a linked quarter basis and the 3% year-over-year decline in commercial balances, that\u2019s mainly all the, for the quarter, that\u2019s mainly all the exits then? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Greg Carmichael : Yes. Like I said, 2% is for the full -- where we're at right now on the strategic assets. If that comes to an end John, at the end of this year, those strategic assets are done, we\u2019ve accelerated those types of assets, I think the outcomes with respect to yield, with respect to credit quality we\u2019ve got, demonstrate that was the right decision. Our thought around the indirect auto lending and what we\u2019re seeing with used car prices and the volumes out there, we\u2019re a year ahead of everybody else. We like what we\u2019re doing in that sector. Once again, it\u2019s about quality and being good for this cycle. So we feel really good about production and where we\u2019re at for the remainder of this year, given the environment we\u2019re operating in, the competitive nature of the quality relationships that we\u2019re going to go after. So I\u2019m very encouraged with what the team is producing. Tayfun Tuzun : And one last thing John that I would just kind of give is evidence of the growth of our quality portfolio with very careful client selection is, we continue to take market share in the investment banking face, for regional banks, we\u2019ve done that throughout \u201916 and this year. That's a key part of our relationship building, fine strategy, aligning that with where we want to grow, right risk appetite, right risk profile, right return profile. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Wanted to ask about capital allocation strategy, you obviously have a ton of excess capital, especially in light of, Tayfun, your commentary about where you can operate ultimately. And so in, obviously you have Vantiv in your back pocket, but how do you think about capital allocation in the context of M&A, your M&A strategy? And once you get off of any sort of regulatory or CRA restrictions, how would you be thinking about potentially doing something from a, not only just degeneration businesses, but would depository institutions also be part or could they be part of this strategy? Greg Carmichael : So right now, our focus is building a strong bank with all the objectives that we've already stated as project. So that\u2019s job one for this business right now that we\u2019re focused on. We've been very, very thoughtful about how we deploy capital for strategic opportunities in the non-depository sector, non-banking sector such as our investments in the fin-tech space, wealth and asset management, insurance space. We\u2019ll continue to do that and deploy capital smartly in those opportunities because it creates the opportunity for us to enhance our value proposition to our customers. That makes sense. With respect to doing a brick and mortar bank type of deal, that is right now not in front of us. It's not we're focused on. And the regulatory environment will play itself out and the environment at some point will probably be more conducive to doing these type of deals, but right now, it's not what we're focused on. Saul Martinez : Just switching gears, very helpful color on Project North Star, the revenue growth plans. Can you just give us a sense so as to how much of the growth in the or the revenue figures for \u201918 and \u201919 are sort of fee based opportunities and how much of it is more balance sheet driven or NII. Could you give us a sense of sort of the parameters around that? Greg Carmichael : Hey, Saul. I\u2019ll give it to Tayfun in a second, but we\u2019ve communicated, it\u2019s really a third, a third, a third of our North Star, 800 million. A third of it is expense, A third of it is balance sheet optimization and a third from fees. So in general, that\u2019s how you should think about the numbers we\u2019re putting forth and how we\u2019ll achieve that 800 million improvement. Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah. I think, Saul, it\u2019s, the one area in terms of balance sheet growth, given some direction with respect to GreenSky alone and that will move the balance sheet. The other balance sheet items are likely to come towards the end of 2018 and into 2019nine. And when we get together in December, in the Investor Day meeting, we will give you a better breakdown of fee versus net interest income. Saul Martinez : Right. So if I look at -- if I think about the 112 and the 299 respectively, it sounds like it's really more fee generation that -- at least initially than sort of balance sheet and NII. Tayfun Tuzun : The goal is, yeah, I mean I think at the beginning, you'll see a higher fee income growth and NII growth will probably catch up to a certain extent in 2019. Saul Martinez : And final just related question, in terms of, there was obviously a big swing 13 million to 112. Just the glide path, should we be thinking that\u2019s later \u201918 or earlier \u201918 or any sense of just the glide path in terms of when that really starts to kick in and move the needle on your revenue growth. Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah. Many of these projects are longer term projects that start to provide the bottom line support. So it is going to be more back ended than front ended. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Your line is open. Christopher Marinac : Thanks. So just want to go back to the improvements on the portfolio and the quality of relationships, et cetera. Should we be seeing some loan pricing improvements the next couple of quarters or again going back to the North Star improvements that you outlined in terms of what it captured there? Lars Anderson : Yeah. So I mean, first of all, I would tell you, we were pleased to see loan spreads actually widen on new production this quarter. We continue to stay very disciplined in terms of our pricing strategy and overall relationship strategy. I'm not sure that I would count on that type of expansion on a linked quarter basis throughout the balance of the year, but I do think it evidences our overall sales force\u2019s commitment to building out relationships with a very disciplined credit pricing, but overall commitment to relationship pricing. Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah. I think, Chris, two factors that play a role there. One is the exit, especially the credit related exits that carry a higher coupon, so from a overall portfolio yield perspective, we are very pleased that we achieved what we achieved even after that and then the other one is the market continues to be very competitive. It\u2019s difficult to be predictive about the widening of spreads. Lars Anderson : Yes. So back to John\u2019s question about loan growth in those first two quarters, if you think about that $900 million that came out, there was a large portion of that that we would define as leverage, higher coupon and yet in spite of that, we were able to execute in verticals and in areas where frankly we've been able to largely offset that. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: The expenses came in a lot lower than I think you were guiding to a few months ago, I think it's about maybe 25 million, which obviously annualizes a big number. And I'm just wondering is that realization of some of the efficiency savings a little bit sooner, is it some of the fee revenues coming in a little bit weaker, kind of general lumpiness, just help reconcile the expenses being much lower than what you thought a few months ago? Greg Carmichael : This is Greg, Matt. I think first off, we'd done a nice job of managing our personnel expenses and really focused on that. Also, the other areas of non-discretionary line items, we've been very myopic and really going out to what we see those opportunities. We put the pedal down, so to speak, on continued focus on vendor management, information technology and those areas. So we feel that most of that improvement really didn\u2019t come from a production perspective, came really from our focus on improvement in expenses and the organization is well designed to go after these opportunities, we put a lot a focus on it and quite frankly some of it just matured quicker than we anticipated and which is encouraging, because a better execution and a better credibility to execute on these plays, so we're very proud of what we're seeing right now that\u2019s mostly on just execution initiatives. Operator : And there are no further questions over the phone at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Sameer Gokhale for closing remarks. Thank you, TaShawn and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department and we will be happy to assist you.

These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. Additionally, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference during today's conference call are included in our earnings release along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. A copy of our most recent quarterly earnings release can be accessed by the public in the Investor Relations section of our corporate Web site, www.53.com. This morning, I'm joined on the call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Head of Commercial Bank, Richard Stein; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you\u2019ll see in our results, we reported third quarter 2017 net income available to common shareholders of $999 million and EPS of $1.35. Our reported EPS included a net benefit of $0.87 from a few significant items including our August Vantiv share sale. Our results for the quarter were strong, reflect the progress we continue to make for our long-term financial targets by strengthening our balance sheet, building profitable relationships and returning excess capital to our shareholders. Before discussing highlights of the quarter, I\u2019d like to make a few observations about the broader macroeconomic environment. Our commercial clients remain cautiously optimistic about their business expansion opportunities. Consumer confidence, consumer spending and the overall labor markets continue to be strong. But our customers like to gain more clarity to the direction of the U.S. economy. Although U.S. GDP growth picked up in the second quarter, it is unclear where this acceleration will continue. The Fed currently forecast U.S. GDP growth of approximately 2% for 2018, which is still relatively tepid. Many of our clients also continue to take a wait-and-see approach for cash reform and other administration\u2019s public pro-growth policies. Additionally, this is one of the longest periods of economic expansion for the U.S. Fiscal stimulus may help extend this expansion but is unclear how much faster the economy will growth from the current run rate given the length of this cycle. Lastly, the Fed\u2019s decision to reduce the size of its balance sheet could put some pressure on market liquidity in interest rates. While some of the economic indicators are positive, there is still uncertainty about how much faster the economy can grow given the factors I just mentioned. Our results continue to demonstrate that we are making progress towards our financial targets that I laid out over a year ago with project North Star. In Q3, we benefitted from revenue growth, effective expense management and an improvement in our credit metrics. Our asset-sensitive balance sheet allows us to continue to grow net interest income resulting from increased short-term interest rates and higher growth \u2013 growth in higher yielding loans. Although loan demand remains relatively weak, we grew period end loans inclusive of the impact of our strategic exits. Our commercial loan production for relationship manager is up 14% this year on top of an 18% improvement last year with fees per relationship manager up 8% year-over-year. Our net interest margin expanded 6 basis points sequentially exceeding our previous guidance. This reflected a benefit of higher rates and a shift into higher yielding consumer loans. We also maintained our commercial loan pricing discipline which helped our overall net interest margin. Our total average loan portfolio was relatively flat sequentially. This reflected the impact of deliberate commercial exits as well as a continued decline in direct and home equity loan balances. In our commercial business, we announced at the beginning of the year that we plan to exit about $1.5 billion of commercial loans this year which will impact our net loan growth. For the first three quarters of 2017, we have exited $1.3 billion of loans. Excluding deliberate exits, our average commercial portfolio grew 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. As we have stated previously, we continue to expect that the commercial loan authorization efforts will be completed by the end of this year. In the consumer portfolio, excluding auto loans, average consumer balances were 3% year-over-year. During the third quarter, we continued to manage our expenses diligently while investing in areas of strategic importance. For example, we increased our direct marketing spend reflecting improved analytical capabilities to grow households through more targeted mailings. The results of these campaigns have been very positive with an internal rate of return two times higher than previous campaigns. Our expenses also continue to reflect IT spending necessary to better serve our customers, investment infrastructure upgrades and enhance our cyber security measures. Despite these as well as other strategic investments, Q3 noninterest expenses were flat year-over-year. We continue to expect full year 2017 expenses to be flat compared to 2016. We continue to manage credit risk effectively and nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets decreased substantially during the quarter. Our NPA ratio was at the lowest level since 2006. Our criticized asset ratio remains stable during the quarter of 5.5% with our classified assets at the lowest level in over 10 years. Our net charge-off ratio continues to remain at historically low levels. Although credit quality remains strong, we expect some upward pressure on provisioning from select loan growth. This again assumes that the economy remains relatively stable. Any weakness in the economy would clearly have an impact on credit losses. Our capital and liquidity levels remain very strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio at 10.6% while our LCR exceeded regulatory requirements by over 20%. Our strong capital position allowed us to both increase our dividend to 14% and to invest nearly $1 billion in share repurchases during the quarter. We have increased our dividend 23% since the third quarter of 2016. We\u2019re also making progress on our North Star initiatives. In December, during our Investor Day in New York, we plan to provide you a detailed update on our progress. As I\u2019ve stated before, we are accelerating the pace at which we are introducing new and better products, services and experiences. We are focused on implementing the best solutions to solve customer problems as quickly as possible. To that end, we are embracing select acquisitions with think-tank partnerships to fuel growth. We\u2019re also leveraging in-house innovation. We recently opened an innovation and capability center at the company\u2019s headquarter to help foster this culture of innovation. One particular area of focus for us relates to our Millennial Research Project. Although we aren\u2019t ignoring other generations, we recognize the tremendous long-term opportunity with what is already the largest generational segment in the U.S. today. The first millennial idea activated out of our innovation incubator was our app called Momentum. Millennial see student loan debt as one of our biggest drags on their financial well being and they want to pay down that debt as soon as possible. Through our app, customers are automatically rounding up their transactions to help pay off their student loan balances. In the first 30 days since we launched Momentum at the end of August, the app was downloaded 10,000 times and the early results are very promising. We will continue to rollout additional millennial-focused solutions in the future. We\u2019re also leveraging innovation with new geographical science capabilities. We have developed specialized technology in the analytics to more accurately assess our branch network and staffing allocation and refine sales goals. We also recently announced additional strategic relationships acquisitions in equity investments. This follows several other agreements we have discussed with you throughout the first part of the year. Our recent acquisition of Epic Insurance Solutions and Integrity HR enables us to enhance our insurance capabilities and HR consulting services. We expect this acquisition to provide value-added products and services to help clients with their most pressing financial and risk management challenges. The acquisition complements our R.G. McGraw Insurance acquisition early in the year to further build on our modest of expanding insurance capabilities. Our strategic relationship and equity investment in NRT and Sightline, the largest pure play casino payment technology company in the world enables us to provide a comprehensive suite of treasury management and payment solutions to our entertainment, lodging and leisure vertical. We also recently announced a strategic relationship with AvidXchange and Mastercard to bring best-in-class automated accounts payable solutions to our customers. We are proud to be the first bank on the forefront of revolutionizing commercial payments by joining Mastercard\u2019s B2B Hub. This Hub provides an end-to-end automated platform that converts payable processes traditionally done by paper into an electronic transaction. We expect that over time these solutions will result in increased insurance, HR consulting and payment solutions fee revenue. We are very focused on improving the customer experience. Our objective is to provide appropriately tiered solutions and to be a trusted advisor to our customers into every aspect of their financial life. Our efforts are bearing fruit in addition to being ranked in the top three across the industry by two independent surveys for overall customer satisfaction earlier this year. We were just named the 2017 Javelin Online Banking leader in two categories, including recognition for our customer service and for customers\u2019 ability to move money easily and securely with confidence. We\u2019re also aligning resources to further improve the client experience in our payments business. We recently announced the addition of Jed Scala to head our Payments and Commerce Solutions division. Jed has over two decades of experience in financial services. He joined us from American Express where he most recently led the U.S. Consumer Lending business. We are fortunate to have Jed as part of the Fifth Third team. Today\u2019s reality is that our competition is no longer the bank across the street but the customers\u2019 last best experience. The bar is continuously rising to deliver a world-class customer experience in the branch, on the phone, on the Web and on our highly rated mobile applications. While we are developing new client facing solutions, we also know that data security is just as important. Especially given the recent cyber attacks in the news, we continue to be proactive with ways to future enhance our cyber security controls. Although systems and controls are critically necessary to prevent attacks, I firmly believe that each of our nearly 18,000 employees are the key to defending the bank and our customers\u2019 data from the ongoing risk we face. I\u2019d like to once again thank our employees for their hard work and dedication which is evident in our financial results, our customer satisfaction scores and our community outreach efforts. I was pleased that we were again able to deliver strong financial results and our North Star initiatives remain on track. We plan to share more information about this at our Investor Day in December. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook for the remainder of the year. Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let\u2019s move to the financial summary on Slide 4 of the presentation. As Greg mentioned, during the quarter our NIM expansion, continued focus on disciplined expense management, stable credit quality and efficient capital management, all reflected our commitment to driving improved financial performance and shareholder returns. Relative to last year\u2019s third quarter, our net interest margin was up 19 basis points, NII was up 7%, noninterest expenses were flat and total net charge-offs were 36% lower, so core revenues were 3% higher. These positive results were accompanied by a 42 basis point increase in our common equity Tier 1 ratio and a 7% reduction in shares outstanding. Although some of our balance sheet decisions had a negative impact on loan growth over the past year, the benefits of these strategic actions are apparent in our financial results and will continue to have a positive impact on shareholder returns in coming years. Reported results were materially impacted by our Vantiv share sale during the quarter which boosted pre-tax income by over $1 billion. We also recognized a $47 million charge as a reduction to noninterest income associated with the Visa swap. The charge is attributable to litigation developments during the quarter and to the increase in Visa share price. Pre-provision net revenue adjusted for items disclosed in our presentation increased 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Our focus on prudent expense management enabled us to drive positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. We expect to achieve positive operating leverage again next quarter and for the full year of 2017. The environment continues to be challenging in commercial lending, whether it is the uncertainty related to tax policy and its impact on capital investments or the ongoing back and forth related to healthcare legislation and its impact on the healthcare sector, these uncertainties are understandably keeping a lot of clients on the sidelines. The lack of clarity on these important topics has also slowed M&A activity overall. Having said that I think we actually did a very good job navigating through these challenges this quarter in our commercial business. Average loans were flat sequentially. Growth in commercial real estate, residential mortgages and other consumer loans was mostly offset by the reduction in certain C&I exposures that did not meet risk return hurdles as well as the planned decline in our indirect auto loan portfolio. Average commercial loan balances were flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year including the impact of our planned exits. Excluding the impact of these exits, average commercial loans were up 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of the exits were credit based and the remainder consisted of return-based exits. We have seen a strong pick up in our regional production, especially in our larger markets in Cincinnati, Chicago and Indiana. Production coupons were stable. The sequential decline in average C&I balances was partially offset by 2% growth in commercial real estate loans this quarter, most of it in construction. The growth in construction loans was mainly driven by embedded funding from existing construction loans. We continue to maintain a conservative risk profile in construction lending as we are in the later stages of the cycle. Certain segments such as hospitality and urban luxury multifamily are losing their attractiveness while others like self-storage and industrial segments are more appealing. Expanding new production spreads, combined with the move in LIBOR resulted in a 22 basis point yield improvement in that portfolio. At this time, we have roughly another $200 million of commercial exits to go for the fourth quarter of 2017. We are expecting modest growth in the commercial portfolio during the fourth quarter, which will reflect the impact of these exits. We remain competitive in all of our markets and are maintaining our focus on growing profitable and doable relationships. Commercial loan production across the board has been steady. To further boost loan growth, we are expanding our commercial sales force. We also continue to assess additional geographic expansion within middle market lending which should provide future loan or revenue growth opportunities. Including the planned decline in the indirect auto loan portfolio, average consumer loans were flat sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Excluding auto, average consumer loans were up 3% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 12% year-over-year reflecting the ongoing impact of our decision to curtail indirect originations and redeploy capital. Returns to this business have improved with the high single digits from the mid single digits earlier in the year. Our pace of origination activity will depend on how much returns continue to improve. Residential mortgage loans grew by 1% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as we continue to retain jumbo mortgages, ARMs, as well as certain 10 and 15-year fixed rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our home equity loan originations were 2% lower sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. As loan pay-downs in our legacy book continued to exceed origination volumes, our portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. Our credit card portfolio increased 3% from the second quarter. Purchase active accounts were up both sequentially and year-over-year reflecting stronger growth from new card rollout at the end of last year. We expect our simplified and more competitive card offerings along with our enhanced analytical capabilities to drive faster growth in the fourth quarter and into 2018. We are expecting portfolio growth rate to accelerate closer to 5% in coming quarters. Other consumer loans increased 18% sequentially. Growth was driven by our personal lending portfolio primarily through loans generated from our GreenSky partnership. We currently expect personal lending balances to grow to $2 billion by the fourth quarter of 2019 and were approximately $600 million at the end of third quarter 2017. Loan originations will remain focused on high-quality prime customers with GreenSky providing first loss coverage as we had discussed before. Growth in personal loans should allow us to generate a higher ROE revenue stream and help us achieve a better balance between our commercial and consumer portfolios. Excluding indirect auto loan balances, we continue to expect low to mid-single digit growth in consumer and mortgage loans in the fourth quarter. Our investment portfolio balances remained relatively stable in the third quarter as we had expected. We expect to continue to maintain our investment portfolio at roughly the same level in the fourth quarter. Average core deposits were down 1% sequentially. A sequential decline in commercial money market, consumer savings and consumer demand deposit accounts was partially offset by increases in commercial demand deposit accounts and consumer money market balances. Deposit markets are competitive and international banks in particular are competing aggressively for deposits. We feel good about our deposit balances as we continue to make rational decisions between pricing them appropriately for profitability and maintaining and growing relationship-based LCR-friendly deposits. Improving marketing analytics drove an increase in new DDA account openings which were up 14% from last quarter and up 5% from last year. Our modified liquidity coverage ratio continued to be very strong at 124% at the end of the quarter. Taxable equivalent net interest income of $977 million was up $32 million or 3% from the previous quarter\u2019s NII and is up $64 million or 7% from last year. Our strong NII performance primarily reflects the positive impact of higher short-term rates. Growth in NII came from both the consumer and commercial portfolios. The increase in the NII reflected higher interest rates, a funding benefit from the temporary influx of cash related to the Vantiv sale and a modest benefit from interest payments on nonaccrual loans that paid off during the quarter. The NIM increased 6 basis points from the second quarter to 3.07% exceeding our guidance. On a sequential basis, our total loan yield was up 14 basis points with commercial yield up 15 basis points. The NIM reflected a total benefit of 2 basis points from the temporary influx of cash and the interest payment on nonaccrual loans that I just mentioned. Due to the temporary nature of these two items in the third quarter, the NIM in the fourth quarter should be a couple of basis points lower compared to the third quarter. Excluding the impact of these items, we expect the NIM to be stable quarter-over-quarter in Q4. Overall, deposit pricing so far has remained relatively muted with cumulative beta since the end of 2015 when the Fed triggered the first rate hike in the sub-20% range on a blended basis. Consumer has been in the mid-teen range with commercial in the low 30s. The incremental blended beta for the last move in June is in the low 30s and we project a data in the mid-40s for the next potential move in December. For subsequent rate hikes, we continue to expect deposit betas to be in the 50% range. If we see betas at low ranges, our margin could exceed our guidance. We expect our fourth quarter net interest income to be similar to our third quarter NII. This includes the full quarter impact of an auto securitization executed near the end of the third quarter. The market remains competitive and our margin and NII outlook reflects current market dynamics. Credit spreads continue to pressure margins across the banking sector, but the strategic actions we have taken during the last two years have led to redeployment of capital away from low-returning loans and is helping us achieve very stable NII and NIM performance. We would expect to maintain this relative stability even in the absence of future Fed rate increases in the coming quarters. Excluding the impact of the Vantiv sale and Visa swap, noninterest income in the third quarter was $571 million compared to $573 million in the second quarter. Underlying noninterest income would have been up about 1% had we not reduced our ownership stake in Vantiv during the quarter had the sale reduced equity method earnings from our ownership stake. The Vantiv transaction was clearly an important milestone in our very successful partnership with the company. Since the initial joint venture with our private equity partner in 2009, we recognized over $5 billion in pre-tax gains. After the sale, which generated an after-tax gain of $679 million, we owned 8.6% of the company. This will decrease the 4.9% of the new company once their acquisition of Worldpay closes. The sale is figured roughly $650 million in future growth CRA cash flows under the current corporate tax regime. A 10% reduction in the marginal corporate tax rate would reduce this amount by about a third. Our remaining ownership is worth roughly $1 billion. We expect to report an approximately $350 million pre-tax step-up gain upon the close of the Worldpay acquisition which will leave us with an unrealized pre-tax gain of roughly $0.5 billion at current market prices. We believe that this was a very good transaction for our shareholders. We will continue to benefit from utilizing the equity method of accounting going forward related to our ownership in a larger and now global company. Moving on to other fee income categories, mortgage banking net revenue of $63 million was up $8 million sequentially. Originations of $2.1 billion was 6% lower than the second quarter, but our gain on sale margins improved to 228 basis points from 209 basis points in the third quarter. Volumes in our direct and retail channels dropped in September largely tied to the hurricane in Florida. Origination fees were up 8% sequentially. During the quarter, two-thirds of our origination mix consisted of purchase volume. Approximately two-thirds of our originations continued to be sourced from the retail and direct channels and the remainder through the correspondent channel. In servicing so far this year, we have acquired MSRs tied to $10 billion of residential mortgage loans and will continue to assess opportunities in the future. Corporate banking fees of $101 million were flat compared to the second quarter. Most of our individual line items were above the second quarter levels but were offset by lower lease residual gains which somewhat masked the underlying strength in our capital markets business. Although the market environment and low levels of client activity continued to challenge revenue growth in the FICC business, we saw double-digit growth in capital markets fees for the quarter. Financial risk management, loans syndications, equity capital markets and M&A all showed growth sequentially and versus last year\u2019s third quarter. We\u2019ve also seen good quarter-over-quarter growth in corporate bond revenues. Capital markets fees will continue to exhibit some quarterly variability given the nature of the business. We currently expect corporate banking fees to increase 10% to 15% sequentially driven by deals in our pipeline that we expect to close by the end of the year. Deposit service charges were relatively stable, down $1 million from the second quarter. Card and processing revenue was flat sequentially reflecting an increase in credit card spend volume offset by higher rewards costs. Total wealth and asset management revenue of 122 million was down 1% sequentially due to lower brokerage fees and specialty service fees, partially offset by higher personal asset management revenue. Revenues increased 1% relative to the third quarter of 2016 mainly due to higher personal asset management revenues. Recurring revenues in this business have increased to 82% of fees from 78% in the third quarter of 2016 and 73% in the third quarter of 2015. We will continue to shift our product and service offerings towards more recurring revenues to limit our reliance on transactional activity. For the fourth quarter, excluding mortgage banking, we expect adjusted fee income growth of approximately 10% with the potential to reach low teens from the third quarter. This outlook also includes Vantiv JV earnings adjusted for our reduced ownership. Recall that our fourth quarter noninterest income guidance incorporates the impact of our recurring annual TRA payment which is expected to be approximately $40 million. Our fourth quarter fee guidance is strong with this recurring payment but the underlying trend is very healthy both to mid digits and operating fees. Despite some current environmental volatility and subdued low client activity, we are still optimistic about our fee growth trends in light of the investments that we are making to grow the scale and scope of our fee-producing products and services. We remain focused on disciplined expense management while continuing to invest for future revenue growth. Noninterest expense was flat compared to the third quarter of 2016 and up 2% sequentially. We will focus on continuing to drive positive operating leverage while still making strategic investments that position us for long-term outperformance. A good example of this is our investment in our direct marketing and analytical capabilities over the last year. These enhanced capabilities will help us generate future retail household growth to support both loan and deposit production. Our investments in technology continue to support many revenue growth and cost saving opportunities across the company. We continue to target new opportunities to create value for our customers while investing to compete effectively with larger banks and non-bank competitors. Similarly, as Greg mentioned, fraud protection and cyber security are in the top of our priority list. Bad actors are still very active and there is an ongoing need to upgrade our defenses both to protect our clients\u2019 information and to prevent fraud losses from increasing. We continue to expect total expenses in 2017 to be flat relative to 2016 as we guided last quarter. Fourth quarter expenses are expected to be up about 1.5% from reported expenses in the third quarter. Turning to credit results on Slide 9. We are very pleased with our third quarter credit results as gross charge-offs remain at a 17-year low. Our charge-off and nonperforming loan results fully reflect the impact of our recent Shared National Credit Review completed in the third quarter. Net charge-offs were $68 million or 29 basis points, up 1 basis point from the second quarter of 2017 but down 16 basis points from last year. Commercial charge-offs of 21 basis points continued to be positively impacted by our decision to deliberately exit certain loans which no longer meet our desired risk parameters. Commercial charge-offs are up 4 basis points from last quarter but down 22 basis points from last year. Consumer charge-offs of 43 basis points were down 3 basis points sequentially and down 6 basis points year-over-year led by lower charge-offs of residential mortgage and home equity loans. Total portfolio nonperforming loans and leases were $506 million, down $108 million or 18% from the previous quarter and down 16% from last year resulting in a NPL ratio of 55 basis points. C&I NPLs were down 36% from last quarter. The largest concentration of nonperforming loans continues to be in energy which comprises roughly 30% of the balances. Total NPAs were down 14% from last quarter and down 28% from last year. Nearly all loan categories showed a sequential improvement. At the end of the third quarter, the criticized assets ratio remains stable with the previous quarter at 5.5% of commercial loan and remains near a 10-plus-year low. Our loss provision was up $15 million compared to the second quarter, largely due to a $12 million release in the prior quarter. The reserve ratio declined 3 basis points to 1.31%. This decline was primarily driven by a $20 million reserve reduction due to the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity. Our reserve coverage over NPLs increased 238% from 200% last quarter. Our coverage of NPLs is at a multiyear high with the broader reserve coverage over NPAs at the highest point since the end of 2004. While remain in a relatively stable credit environment, we continue to caution you that charge-offs are at near historic lows and that we could potentially experience some upward pressure in the future. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily a reflect of loan growth and some normalizing of credit losses. Despite the highly competitive market with some banks relaxing underwriting standards, our top priority continues to be focusing on maintaining our disciplined client selection. Our capital levels remained very strong during the quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.6% reflecting a decrease of 4 basis points quarter-over-quarter but an increase of 42 basis points year-over-year. The sequential decline reflects the $990 million share buyback initiated during the quarter which included the after-tax gains from the Vantiv sale and a declaration of our $0.16 dividend which was a 14% increase from the prior quarter. Our tangible common equity ratio, excluding unrealized gains and losses, decreased 13 basis points sequentially or increased 11 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the third quarter, common shares outstanding were down 33 million shares or 5% compared to the second quarter of 2017 and down 50 million shares or 7% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. Book value and tangible book value were both up 4% from last quarter. Effective capital management is a very important component of our overall strategic approach. We will always be very prudent with the amount of capital that we keep on our balance sheet to support the current and future risk profile of our company and aim to maximize the long-term return on that capital in alternative environments. With the lessons learnt from the financial crisis, we will remain focused on long-term shareholder value. At the same time, we do not intend to keep more capital than we need and will look to return it back to our shareholders prudently. With respect to taxes, our third quarter rate was impacted by the partial sale of our Vantiv stake and a specific Vantiv tax item noted on Page 1 of the release. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 31.9%, but excluding the Vantiv sale, our tax rate would have been 25.8%. A large gain reported in the third quarter also impacts our tax rate for the last quarter of the year. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be slightly elevated from the normal levels to around roughly 29% to 30%. Excluding this impact, we would have projected the fourth quarter tax rate to be in the 25% to 26% range. This would result in a full year 2017 tax rate in the 28.5% to 29.5% range. Our revenue growth outlook, our ability to achieve positive operating leverage without changing our risk appetite, our strong balance sheet and our strategic positioning give us confidence in our ability to create additional shareholder value. As Greg mentioned in this remarks, we will be hosting our first-ever Investor Day on December 7 in New York. Our executive team will share additional details about their businesses and the progress we are making towards our strategic objectives. With that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A. Sameer Gokhale : Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Melissa, please open the call up to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks very much, guys. I actually wanted to ask on your comments about the NII trajectory. You said, Tayfun, that the fourth quarter should be kind of flattish and then you\u2019d expect to be able to keep that flattish, ex-rates. Was that what you said? So could you just walk us through kind of how you\u2019re expecting to grow NII? What are the drivers of future NII, ex-rates? And then the follow on would just be what incremental rates due from here? Thanks. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, the reason why I provided that color, Ken, is there\u2019s a lot of interest obviously from the investor community to understand NII dynamics in the absence of rates. So what we are projecting is even if the Fed does not have any rate increases left, we do believe that we will be able to maintain a stable NIM and NII. And obviously loan growth with a stable NIM, loan growth will be the factor that influences NII. We clearly still expect widening NIM and growth in NII resulting solely from Fed\u2019s rate increases, but even in the absence we\u2019re not seeing an erosion in our expected numbers. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then just a follow up on the loan point then. At what point do you expect to be kind of clear of incremental either C&I exits or get to a comfort point with some of the portfolios that you\u2019ve been slowing the growth? So I guess at what point do we get kind of a better base to kind of start to grow back off of? Greg Carmichael : Ken, this is Greg. What we\u2019ve communicated is by the end of this year this optimization program is over and there\u2019s more business as usual. So we talked about 5 billion for the last couple of years, 1.5 billion of that this year. We\u2019re pretty much through that, a little bit left in the fourth quarter and then we\u2019re done with the optimization efforts. So you could expect us going forward of a more stable base. Tayfun Tuzun : The one color that I would add to that is Greg\u2019s comments relate to the commercial loans but we will see continued reduction in auto loans because our originations will still continue to be under our long-term trends. But we expect obviously with added consumer loans in other line items to make up for that reduction in auto loan outstanding. Ken Usdin : Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On the noninterest income, I know there are a couple of details you called out around lease residual gains and so on. But if you look at the year-on-year comparison; service charges down 3% year-on-year, corporate banking revenues down 9% year-on-year, wealth is up 1%. It doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a lot of growth there. Can you maybe give us a kind of update on the initiatives you\u2019ve been running to grow fees, where you feel like things are working, where you feel like there\u2019s more to do? And then some thoughts on how we should look at noninterest income going forward, what you can do to get growth back into positive territory again? Tayfun Tuzun : Great. Thanks, Geoffrey. I\u2019m going to make some general comments and I\u2019m going to turn it over to Lars for his perspectives as well. So in general, clearly a number of our initiatives going forward are focused on fee income generation. That includes payment processing. It includes mortgage banking. It includes capital markets. When you look at the year-over-year comparisons, you also need to keep in mind that especially in commercial related line items such as treasury management and such as capital markets, we are seeing some impact of the exits that Greg detailed over the last 24 months. So I think Lars is going to give you some color on the underlying strength on the commercial side. We are also as you know focusing on growth in wealth management through either acquisitions or expanded sales force. There\u2019s insurance acquisitions going on. So as we look forward, there are a number of line items that we would hope to discuss with you in December to support stronger fee growth. Lars, any sort of specific color? Lars Anderson : Yes. So maybe speaking to corporate banking fees in particular, Geoffrey, a couple of things. As Tayfun had pointed out, that prior period comparison and what those prudent leasing gains as we actively manage that leasing portfolio is really an important part of that strategy. So you really do have to kind of look a little deeper into it. And I would tell you I business lending fees on a year-over-year basis were up about 2% and that\u2019s why we executed on our balance sheet optimization. So we continue to feel good about those business lending fees and the opportunity to accelerate those as we see the overall lending market grow. But in particular, corporate banking fees are \u2013 over 60% of that is capital markets. You know what is going on in the FICC kind of segment this year and the pressure there. But we continue to make investments in our FICC business in replatforming that business to enhance the client experience. That\u2019s going to be rolling out in the coming quarters. But despite that, we\u2019ve stayed very close to our client because we knew, as Fed tightening became closer, that we would see clients begin to take action on a linked quarter basis. Actually our FICC business was up 13%. Investment banking was up 22% on a linked quarter basis. Again, I\u2019ve shared with you that we\u2019ve continued to invest in our loan syndication, capital, our equity and corporate bond, underwriting capabilities, our M&A advisory very strong. That 22% gives us an 18% linked quarter growth overall in capital markets. So we\u2019re going to position ourselves with our clients to capture that. I think we\u2019ve got the right products for the right lines of business and in both our industry verticals and core middle market to continue to accelerate that in the future, albeit that this is a variable area of our noninterest income and the overall economic environment will influence it. Geoffrey Elliott : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Siefers from Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. I was just curious on the expense base, just trying to figure out sort of the puts and takes in that you look at sort of year-over-year the expense growth has certainly been pretty well controlled but it looks like they\u2019re going to be up in the fourth quarter and we will be up a couple of percent from when you first announced the North Star initiative. So I guess I\u2019m just wondering given how large North Star is just in terms of dollars, would there be a point where we would see absolute declines in the cost base or should we be thinking about it despite the sizable dollar values involved as sort of offsetting nature growth in the expense base? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, I think so obviously I don\u2019t know how many quarters in a row now, but we have done better than we guided. We continue to focus both on headcount expenses as well as expenses in other line items. There is some increase into the fourth quarter somewhat seasonal in some of the operation areas given the pickup towards the end of the year, some increase in IT expenses related to the timing of the projects coming on line. Our goal is to clearly \u2013 first and foremost is to achieve positive operating leverage. The ability to lower expenses will depend upon the investments that are needed to boost our revenue growth opportunities. And we\u2019re not necessarily looking at expense management solely by itself but at how it relates to future growth opportunities. Having said that, it is clearly our goal to maintain a low level of expense growth in order to also achieve \u2013 make sure that we achieve operating leverage in this environment which continues to be challenging with respect to revenue growth opportunities. So the company is very focused. We will share more obviously about 2018 with you in December and in our upcoming fourth quarter earnings release in January. Scott Siefers : Okay. Thank you. And then, Tayfun, I just want to make sure I understand the tax guidance correctly, the 29 to 30 in the fourth quarter. I think in your prepared comments, you kind of implied that\u2019s simply a fourth quarter event. That\u2019s just not the new run rate we should be thinking about in 2018? Tayfun Tuzun : That is correct. It\u2019s simply a fourth quarter impact. And let me give you maybe a little bit more of a color there. As you can see on the first page of our earnings release, the after-tax impact \u2013 after-tax gain on Vantiv share is $679 million this quarter. If you include the fourth quarter impact on our tax rate, that ultimate resulting after-tax gain is going to be around $657 million, $658 million which is the marginal increase \u2013 which leads to the marginal increase in our tax rate. And that year-ending after-tax of $657 million, $658 million in Vantiv is very close to what we disclosed in September at Barclays Conference. So that\u2019s a one-time only tax rate increase that will not show up again in 2018. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Martinez from UBS. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hi. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions. First, you mentioned that the exiting of commercial relationships has kind of run its course and presumably the runoff on the auto books starts to lessen a bit, albeit it\u2019s going to be there for a little bit. As we think about loan growth going forward beyond 2017, how do you think about how quickly you can grow and are there opportunities to gain share and how do you think about what could be sort of a more normalized level for loan growth being your different portfolios? Lars Anderson : Good question. As we look forward to 2018, Tayfun has made some prior comments and we\u2019ll be sharing a little bit more about that in December at the Investor Conference. But we\u2019re looking obviously to grow our commercial portfolio at a rate that would be around nominal GDP plus. We obviously are very focused on moving market share. We\u2019re positioning our businesses to have the capabilities and the talent to frankly execute on that. We continue to build out our industry verticals, which has been a very successful strategy for us. We\u2019re also, as Greg mentioned earlier, we\u2019re focused on also expanding some of our middle market banking operations and markets in which we\u2019ve been operating in the past through verticals and corporate banking around the country. So I believe that with the things that we\u2019ve been investing in and our payments, treasury management, capital markets, we really do have an advantage as we head into the coming quarters. Obviously, the overall economic environment is going to have an impact on it. Our clients, we continue to hear from them. They are more optimistic today I would tell you than they were six months ago. However, there is still a lot of commerce that\u2019s on the sideline. It\u2019s very ready to go, but they need clarity and at that point I think that we can really accelerate the growth. Greg Carmichael : The only thing I would add to Lars\u2019 comments on the consumer side, credit card has been an area of focus for the organization. You see the slight increase this quarter. We expect that to continue onto next year with the investments we\u2019ve made both in people and products in this space. In addition to that, unsecured lending is also another bright spot in our partnership with GreenSky, more originated there and the quality of that relationship, we\u2019re very pleased with. In addition to that, we expect to continue to grow consumer mortgages as we rollout our new platform that\u2019s rolling in at course [ph] already, but we\u2019ll roll in to our retail and direct channels later this year. So we feel confident that we can continue to grow roughly, as Lars said, on low GDP levels. Saul Martinez : That\u2019s helpful. And if you can\u2019t kick-start loan growth and start to grow closer to nominal GDP plus, what does that mean for deposit cost pressure? Does it \u2013 your LTR moved up a little bit. You\u2019re at 90% plus. Obviously rates are moving up. How do you think about deposit betas in an environment where we do start to see a little bit more growth? Jamie Leonard : This is Jamie. As Tayfun mentioned in his prepared remarks, betas have been pretty benign. We\u2019re at about 18% cycle to-date but we\u2019re certainly expecting betas to increase the June move during the quarter was at 20 beta, but we think it will be a 30 beta by the end of the year and a December move we\u2019re modeling in the mid-40 range. So we certainly expect competition to pick up as the Fed continues to hike rates. In terms of deposits, they were down sequentially about 900 million. There was some consumer seasonality softness combined with an ongoing trend on the commercial side that we saw in the second quarter that continued into the third quarter and that\u2019s really driven by a few factors. One, there are certain segments where liquidity is being deployed for working capital or other seasonal needs such as in CRE and pub funds. Also, we\u2019ve seen the large corporate customer base that currently has excess liquidity begin to seek alternative investment options or seek higher deposit rates and that\u2019s a phenomenon where we\u2019re keeping the customer but we lose those excess deposits, because we\u2019re unwilling to match those overly aggressive rates. I think one good data point back to your LCR comment; within our LCR calculation, our nonoperational deposit categories are where we have had the runoff. It\u2019s down about 1.6 billion whereas our operational deposits continue to increase and that\u2019s really as we look forward where we expect to be funding this loan growth in 2018 has continued improvement in the commercial deposit gathering space driven by strong TM client acquisition. Tayfun Tuzun : Having said all of that, just keep in mind we\u2019re not giving 2018 guidance, we\u2019re not giving guidance on loan growth in 2018 at those levels. So I just want to caution you. Saul Martinez : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Winter from Wedbush. Your line is open. Peter Winter : Good morning. Greg Carmichael : Hi, Peter. Peter Winter : I was wondering, can you just talk about some of the factors puts and takes that keeps the margin stable without a rate hike? Tayfun Tuzun : The biggest impact, Peter, is the decision that we made two years ago to reallocate capital away from lower returning assets into higher returning assets, whether it\u2019s in autos or whether it\u2019s in C&I. The churn of that capital into higher returning assets is clearly a defense mechanism that has worked well for us. At the same time, we are also seeing very healthy and stable origination coupon. Now that doesn\u2019t mean necessarily that spreads are not under pressure and also the betas on deposits so far have fared below our expected levels. But in general overall as we guide for stable NII and stable NIM, this continued churn away from lower returning assets into higher returning assets whether it\u2019s from auto to secured, unsecured lending or within commercial to better relationships is helping us. Peter Winter : Great. And just one quick follow up. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve said it but how much was the auto securitization at the end of the quarter and was there any gain from it in the third quarter? Tayfun Tuzun : The auto securitization was on balance sheet it was $1 billion transaction where we held one of the tranches. So it provided 750 million of proceeds but simply was a funding mechanism, no gain or loss on that transaction. Peter Winter : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe : Great. Thanks. Just had another follow-up question on the deposit side. I hear what you\u2019re saying but we still see the core deposits coming down. What\u2019s the launch from strategy there? Should your deposit beta be higher? Should you be paying up more to retain some of those deposits or even grow your operational deposits to fund balance sheet growth? I\u2019m just kind of trying to get a sense of how you \u2013 where you want deposit growth to be over the next, say, few quarters? Jamie Leonard : Ken, it\u2019s Jamie. We definitely want deposit growth but we want it in the right categories. And if you look year-over-year, our commercial space we\u2019re down 2 billion in deposits and we\u2019re up 2 billion in the consumer side. And so we\u2019re definitely focused on growing our households and we\u2019ve been very successful in doing that on the consumer side. On the commercial side, we\u2019ve allowed deposit balances to run down just simply from the economics where we have the flexibility when faced with aggressive deposit pricing levels to let deposits run off and fund it through the FHLB. So over time, in '16 and '17, that\u2019s allowed us to experience a lower beta. We still have significant amount of flexibility and contingent liquidity to do so; however, we are focused on growing commercial operational deposits going forward. Ken Zerbe : So I guess that kind of leads into the second part though, does there come a point where deposit betas don\u2019t price gradually? Where you say, okay, we\u2019re done with the commercial runoff, we actually need the commercial deposits and therefore we see a much more meaningful step up in your deposit betas that you try to stabilize that portfolio? Jamie Leonard : I think it\u2019s possible that that would happen but not at the type of Fed increases we\u2019re expecting which are pretty low step-ups from the Fed. We\u2019re just not at that point yet. Ken Zerbe : All right, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Greg Carmichael : Good morning. John Pancari : Back to the loan growth, I heard that the exiting of the commercial relationships has pretty much run its course at the end of next quarter. Can you just remind us of the Shared National Credit portfolio, was is the size of that as of today and was that part of any of the intentional runoff? Lars Anderson : This is Lars. Let me just take that question. To give you a little bit of background on that, we had a number of years ago an increase in the Shared National Credit portfolio in particular consistent with the build out of some of our industry verticals which frankly really benefitted us in a large way. However, Shared National Credits, it\u2019s not a line of business. It is just an outcome of our business strategy. If you look at our SNC portfolio, it\u2019s been fairly stable in that 50%, 51% type range over a number of quarters now. It\u2019s stabilized as we continue to focus even more on our middle markets portfolio. And I would remind you of this too. Our Shared National Credit portfolio is underwritten with the same risk team to the same standard, held to the same pricing discipline, same expectations in terms of risk profile. In fact, if you look at the asset quality of that portfolio today, you would see that it largely matches our overall commercial portfolio the same thing in terms of the overall returns. And we\u2019re really pleased with what we\u2019ve been able to drive there as we have executed on our balance sheet optimization. There has been a churn in that Shared National Credit portfolio today. About 80% of those Shared National Credit relationships have multiple products with us which is very high. The other 20% frankly our newer relationships, ones that we are actively building out and deepening client relationships as we bring to them strategic options in treasury management, more sophisticated products that we\u2019re investing in. So we feel good about our strategy there. But I wouldn\u2019t expect that that would grow significantly in the future in particular as we invest in our core middle market franchise even more on a go-forward basis. Greg Carmichael : The only thing I\u2019ll also add to Lars\u2019 comments is our SNC criticized assets are lower than our overall commercial in general. So they performed extremely well and have even through the cycle performed well for us. John Pancari : Okay. And I know you mentioned that it shouldn\u2019t grow, but you think that at the current level that 50% to 51% range I guess with that 25% to 30% of total loans that that\u2019s pretty much where it\u2019s going to stay? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, it\u2019s hard to say quarter-to-quarter where things will go depending upon the overall economic environment. But our longer term goal would be for that to be a smaller portion of our overall balance sheet. As I said before, we\u2019re putting a lot into our core middle market business banking focus and we would expect to be accelerating the growth of that in the future. John Pancari : Okay. And then one more follow up on that. What is the average yield of your Shared National Credits? And then separately what percentage of them are you lead arranger? Thanks. Tayfun Tuzun : We are not disclosing the specific yields in sub-portfolios and clearly where we are the lead arranger, that\u2019s a smaller percentage of the total. Lars Anderson : Yes, again I would just \u2013 I\u2019d reinforce that 80% of that Shared National Credit portfolio that we have multiple products. These are relationships and that\u2019s what we continue to focus on building out moving from just a provider of our balance sheet to true relationships, supporting our verticals and some of our larger core middle market clients. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Steven Duong : Hi. This is actually Steve Duong in for Gerard. Thanks for taking our call. A question on your CET1 ratio. You\u2019re at 10.5 today consistent with the prior quarter even after a pretty large buyback. Is there a target CET1 level that you\u2019re looking to get to? And if so, what is the payout level do you think you need to reach that target? Tayfun Tuzun : Obviously in the very near term, our CCAR results and guidance dictates where that capital is. In general, we\u2019ve been targeting a 10% type level and we still have three quarters ahead of us in terms of adding more to our buybacks. Over the long term, that target potentially may change. Our peers clearly are talking more about a 9 handle with respect to their capital ratios. And I think roughly 50 basis point type of reduction in capital would equate to about \u2013 if I\u2019m not mistaken a $500 million, $600 million type of additional buyback if we do chose to go there immediately. We clearly believe that the risk profile of our balance sheet and the business composition would dictate a lower capital ratio than what we are carrying today; whether it\u2019s 9%, 9.5%. Time will show. Steven Duong : Great. Thank you. And just a follow-up question on the technology side. You guys mentioned about your innovation center. As far philosophically, where are you most focused in on the technology development more on the client-facing side or are you more on the backend, or what\u2019s your philosophy on it? Greg Carmichael : We see the digital transformation really impacting both ends of the back office or for continued optimization which I think we\u2019ve done a nice job of. But there\u2019s opportunities around artificial intelligence, we\u2019re biased, that we\u2019re looking at right now to more streamline our processes and reduce our overall cost which we expect to achieve. So that\u2019s a focus. In addition, our client-facing side of the house would be our advancements in our mobile application, our Web platform and the investments we\u2019re making and payments to help our commercial customers automate their back office. We\u2019ll continue to see that. And also around the distribution channels, how we touch our customers, whether the partnership with GreenSky, as we mentioned before, ApplePie, the new partnership we\u2019ve just established with NRT Sightline is another example of that. So we\u2019ll continue to make those investments on both sides. Once again, it gets back to the return and the value we create for our commercial customers and consumer customers and our shareholders. Steven Duong : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Terry McEvoy from Stephens. Your line is open. Terry McEvoy : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Earlier in the call you mentioned international banks being more competitive as it relates to deposits. Is that something new that has emerged over the last quarter? And would you say it\u2019s in market retail consumer competition or more on the national if not international businesses that you operate? Lars Anderson : It\u2019s not a new phenomenon. It\u2019s been going on definitely over the past year since the Fed really began increasing rates and it\u2019s definitely on the commercial side you\u2019re seeing and plus types of pricing from FBOs. Terry McEvoy : And then just a follow up to John\u2019s question, could you substitute leverage lending for the SNC portfolio? Was the planned reduction in commercial centered at all on those loans and I\u2019m not sure if you disclosed the size of that portfolio today? Tayfun Tuzun : You\u2019re asking about the size of the leverage loan portfolio? Terry McEvoy : That\u2019s correct. Tayfun Tuzun : It\u2019s been \u2013 for a number of quarters now it\u2019s been going down. It is currently \u2013 we don\u2019t typically disclose it, but we\u2019ve seen now over the last two years it\u2019s fairly significant for us on our leverage lending -- Greg Carmichael : Terry to your question, that was part of our optimization efforts over the last couple of years, leverage loans. Tayfun Tuzun : Which interestingly enough actually was a headwind with respect to spreads and margins. So our ability to stabilize NII and NIM in light of the reduction in our leverage lending portfolio also points to a pretty decent strength in the way we manage this. Terry McEvoy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Tayfun and Greg, a couple of questions for you guys. One is the CET1, I want to go back to that. So why not lower \u2013 so why 10% if I heard that correctly? I know you said each 50 basis point would do this, but why not lower given what you\u2019ve done? Is there something that\u2019s holding you back? Are there other plans for which you\u2019re trying to hold on to the capital? Tayfun Tuzun : Vivek, we need to clearly make sure that we watch where the industry is going. There\u2019s a pure regulatory aspect of this. In the last CCAR, they enabled us to be a bit more flexible with respect to our capital return to our shareholders. But we still are cognizant of that additional dimension of where the peer group is. We are currently right in the middle, maybe a little bit above the middle range of the distribution of our peers. There is nothing on our balance sheet that suggest that we need to keep a 10% plus capital, but we would like to make sure that the progression to a lower range is in line with the way our peer group moves their capital as well. So that\u2019s really the factor that dictates, because ultimately when you think about CCAR, it\u2019s a group exercise. Yes, there is idiosyncratic impact of one\u2019s balance sheet and income statement, but when the Fed looks at it, they look at it as a group and we cannot ignore where the peers are. And also the other piece is in terms of our preferred bucket, we still have room of about $400 million to $500 million in additional preferred issuance. So as we think about the composition of capital, that is also a factor. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thanks. One more small question and maybe this goes to Lars. On leasing residual gains, did I hear you right? You said they are \u2013 you\u2019ve taken some gains. Are they to run at this lower run rate, or is that \u2013 or was this just a blip this quarter, because it\u2019s something that can be episodic? Lars Anderson : It really is episodic. We don\u2019t necessarily have a plan for that line item. It depends on where the portfolio is, where asset values are. We don\u2019t necessarily try to maximize residual gains. And last quarter [indiscernible] strong quarter, so the comparisons for last quarter gets a bit weaker. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, and we just have a very robust process where we\u2019re viewing and actively managing that portfolio and we\u2019re taking those gains where we think is appropriate. Vivek Juneja : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Gokhale, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you. Sameer Gokhale : Thank you, Melissa. And thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department and we will be happy to assist you.

My name is Adam and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sameer Gokhale, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin. Sameer Gokhale : Thank you, Adam, and good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials. And we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. Additionally, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference during today's conference call are included in our earnings release along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. A copy of our most recent quarterly earnings release can be accessed by the public in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, www.53.com. This morning, I'm joined on the call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and our Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you'll see in our results, we reported full year 2017 net income of $2.2 billion and EPS of $2.83. Our results reflect the hard work of our employees, the support of our North Star initiatives. In 2017, we again took a number of significant steps to improve profitability and better position us for success. We will discuss the economic environment in our fourth quarter results. I would like to take a few moments to review some of the key accomplishments during the year. First, we continued to optimize and strengthen the balance sheet. We exited approximately $1.5 million in C&I loans that did not meet our targeted risk or return profile and this helped drive a significant improvement in our credit metrics. This fold [ph] the exit of $3.5 billion in C&I loans in 2016. As I mentioned before, we have now completed this process. We also continue to reduce our indirect auto exposure. This reflects our decision over two years ago to curtail originations to improve returns while mitigating credit risk. We have succeeded in improving returns in this business and plan to gradually increase our production volumes in 2018. These decisions highlight our commitment to building a franchise that performs well with the various business cycles. During the year, we re-launched our brand campaign through print, television, radio, and digital advertising. As we share with you this number, the re-launch was very well received and continues to strengthen our brand in the marketplace. We continue to focus on improving the customer experience by advancing our digital first, customer centric agenda and have made significant progress through several of our North Star initiatives. We launched our innovation center and just recently introduced an app called Momentum that helps millennials tackle student debt. As you know, student debt is an issue for many millennials. Since we launched Momentum in September of last year, we have had over 40,000 customers download the app. We also replaced our branch teller software platform. The new platform helps to mitigate compliance and operational risk through automation and improves the efficiency and speed of transaction processing. Our new mortgage loan origination system was launched across all channels in 2017. Although there is more work to be done, this initial will generate both NII as well as fee income opportunities by reducing our cost of originating mortgages. This business remains very important to Fifth Third as an anchor product and a proven tool to acquire households. We are leveraging analytics to drive both an improved client experience and to enhance our own capabilities. We unveiled several innovative solutions this year, including the rollout of a digital real-time financial risk and equity management platform for our commercial customers. This platform significantly improves the information our customers have access to in a convenient digital format. We implemented advanced propriety data analytics to help in further optimizing our branch network. And we significantly enhanced our use of data analytics and improved the way we market to our customers. Our continued focus on customer service and creating more durable relationships has a recognizing number of third-party customer surveys. We are rated as one of the best brands in commercial middle market banking, and number one among our peers in relationship manager, product knowledge for Greenwich Associates. Expenses continue to be well-managed. Excluding [indiscernible] tax reform, full-year expenses were flat year-over-year. We achieved this while investing heavily in key initiatives in the project North Star. We expect to generate further efficiencies in 2018 as we continue to implement our North Star initiatives. In 2017, we increased the pace in which we delivered better price and services through our buy partner build philosophy. We completed several acquisitions and strategic partnerships this year, including the acquisition of Epic Insurance and Integrity HR and R.G. McGraw Insurance which allowed us to continue to develop our insurance capabilities. Our strategic partnership and equity investment in NRT and Sightline expand our product offerings within our entertainment, largely in leisure vertical. We are the first bank to join Mastercard's B2B Hub. This Hub provides an end-to-end automated platform that converts payable processes traditionally done by paper into an electronic transaction. Our CRA rating was upgraded outstanding, reflecting our commitment to improving the lives of our customers and wellbeing of the communities we serve. We received top rankings in several employee satisfaction surveys, including the Gallup Great Workplace Award for the fourth year in a row. Our employees are responsible for recommending our strategies, and we believe that a highly engaged workforce will help us to achieve our strategic and financial objectives. We hosted our inaugural Investor Day in December. Our senior leadership team laid out a detailed roadmap of our strategic parties, how our operations are designed to facilitate our one bank approach, and how we are leveraging technology in order to improve the customer experience. The strength of our balance sheet and earnings allows to raise our quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2017 and we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders during the full-year of 2017. As a remainder, we have Fed approval to increase our dividend and additional $0.02 in the second quarter of 2018, waiting for approval. Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I want to take a moment to discuss the new tax legislation. There was a uncertainty for much of the fourth quarter as borrowers await to more clarity. We believe new tax law will help energize the economy and further accelerate growth in our businesses. We are optimistic that we will retain most of the run rate benefits of lower taxes with a super pan on the competitive dynamics. At year-end, I was also excited to distribute a portion of the benefits from tax reform to our employees in our charitable foundation. Moving to the fourth quarter results, we reported net income of $509 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.67. Some non-core items, including additional benefits from the new tax legislation, resulted in a positive $0.15 impact to reported earnings per share in the quarter. Tayfun will provide further details about these items in his opening comments. Despite the impact of delivered commercial exits as well as a continued decline in indirect auto loan balances, our total average loan portfolio was flat sequentially. Our adjusted net interest margin expanded three basis points sequentially. This improvement primarily reflected higher yields on our investment portfolio as well as a good mix of consumer loans with higher yields. Excluding the impact of non-core items mentioned in our earnings release, expenses were flat compared to the third quarter 2017, as we continue to focus on managing our expenses diligently. Credit quality remains stable, criticized assets were at the lowest levels in nearly 12 years, while non-performing assets continue to decrease, marking the lowest our NPA ratio has been in over 11 years. Fee income was up 3% sequentially. Adjusted for renewable items mentioned in the earnings release as we had discussed at our Investor Day, we believe fee growth should accelerate as our North Star initiatives are fully implemented and as we pursue additional strategic acquisitions and partnerships. Our capital liquidity levels remain very strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio at 10.6%, while our LCR exceeded regulatory requirements by nearly 30%. I would like to once again thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication as evident in our financial results and our customer satisfaction scores, and our community outreach efforts. I was pleased that we were able to deliver strong financial results in our North Star initiatives, and remain on track. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on slide 4 of the presentation. As Greg mentioned, during the quarter, our underlying NIM expansion, continued focus on disciplined expense control, stable credit quality and efficient capital management reflected our commitment to driving improved financial performance and shareholder returns. Reported results were significantly impacted by the items noted on page 1 of our release, including a number of items primarily resulting from the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The largest item was a $220 million income tax benefit resulting from the re-measurement of our deferred tax liabilities. The detailed benefit was partially offset by a $68 million impairment related to affordable housing investments in the fourth quarter. We also recognized a $27 million reduction to interest income related to the re-measurement of our leverage lease portfolio. Lastly, we recognized $30 million in one-time discretionary expenses related to employee bonuses and charitable contributions in response to the passage of the tax act. In addition to the items associated with the new tax law, our reported results were impacted by a couple of other items. As we discussed during the last quarter's earnings call, this quarter's taxes reflected additional tax expense of $20 million related to our gain from the Vantiv sale in the third quarter. Our fourth quarter results also reflected an $11 million reduction to non-interest income associated with the Visa swap. Adjusting for the non-core items disclosed today and in our prior periods, on a sequential, year-over-year, and full year basis, our ROA, ROTCE increased, our efficiency ratio improved, net interest margin expanded, expenses remained relatively flat, and our credit metrics also improved. We achieved our objective of delivering positive operating leverage, while lowering the risk profile of our company and increasing regulatory capital levels from last year. Relative to last year's fourth quarter, our adjusted net interest margin was up 19 basis points, adjusted NII was up 7%, non-interest expenses were flat, total charge-offs remained stable, NPAs were down 34%, and the criticized asset ratio declined 70 basis points. These positive results were accompanied by a 22 basis point increase in our common equity tier I ratio and 8% reduction in shares outstanding. Although some of our balance sheet decisions had a negative impact on loan growth in 2017, the benefits of our strategic actions are apparent in our financial results. And we expect them to continue to have a positive impact on shareholder returns going forward. Moving to slide 5, the environment continues to be challenging for commercial loan growth. Despite the wait and see approach that many clients took during the fourth quarter while the tax bill was being debated, we generated the highest commercial origination volume since the second quarter of 2015. Although our loan production was strong, net loan growth was muted as payoffs also remained elevated. As the tax legislation is now final, companies have begun to adjust their capital investment plans. We are optimistic that increased spending will drive higher loan demand. Average total loans were flat sequentially. Growth in C&I, commercial real estate, residential mortgage, credit card, and other consumer loans was mostly offset by a continued reduction in home equity and commercial lease balances, deliberate commercial exits and the planned decline in our indirect auto loan portfolio. Average commercial loan balances were up approximately $150 million compared to the third quarter and were down 1% year-over-year, including the impact of our planned exits. Excluding the impact of these exits, average commercial loans were up 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. We continue to see strong middle market originations in our regions, especially in Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Chicago, and Tennessee markets. The sequential increase in average C&I balances along with 1% growth in commercial real estate loans was partially offset by a 1% decline in commercial leases. As we mentioned in December, given our focus on profitable relationship-oriented growth, we have halted originations in non-relationship based equipment leasing. We expect end-of-period commercial leases to decline $400 million to $500 million by the end of 2018. Average growth in commercial real estate loans in the fourth quarter was mainly driven by drawdowns at the end of the third quarter as commercial construction balances were down 2% on an end-of-period basis. We continue to maintain a conservative risk profile in construction lending as we are in the later stages of the cycle. As of year-end, we have completed our balance sheet optimization initiatives, which has resulted in over $5 billion in deliberate loan exits since the first quarter of 2016. This includes approximately $200 million of commercial exits in the fourth quarter of 2017. Growth patterns in 2018 and beyond will now reflect business as usual activity. Commercial loan production across the board has been strong. We remain competitive and are maintaining our focus on profitable relationships, particularly in our middle market lending business, which is a focus area in 2018 and beyond. We recently expanded our middle market lending footprint to California and are in the process of evaluating other geographies. This should provide future loan and revenue growth opportunities. Additionally, as we mentioned in December, we plan to launch two new verticals this year to augment C&I loan growth within our corporate lending portfolio. We currently expect our end of period total commercial total portfolio to grow about 1% from yearend in the first quarter and about 3% by the end of 2018, which includes the impact of the run off of our national leasing business. In consumer, including the planned decline in the indirect auto loan portfolio, average loans were up 1% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Excluding auto, average consumer loans were up 3% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 10% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing impact of our decision to curtail indirect originations and redeploying capital. Our pace of origination activity will continue to be correlated with risk adjusted returns in this business. Given current spreads and returns on capital, we currently expect our total production to be closer to $4 billion and at the end of period auto portfolio declined approximately $500 million by end of 2018. Residential mortgage loans were flat sequentially and up 5% year-over-year as we continue to retain jumbo mortgages, ARMS as well certain 10- and 15-year fixed rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our home equity loan origination volumes were 2% lower sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. As loan pay downs in our legacy continue to exceed origination volumes, our portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. Our credit card portfolio increased 3% from the third quarter. Purchase active accounts were up both sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting stronger growth from new card rollouts at the end of 2016. We continue to expect our new card offerings and our enhanced analytical capabilities to drive faster growth in 2018. While we expect balances to be flat sequentially in the first quarter reflecting seasonally higher pay downs, we currently expect card balance growth in the mid to high single-digits by the end of 2018. Other consumer loans increased 28% sequentially. Growth was driven by the personal lending portfolio primarily through loans generated from our GreenSky partnership. We continue to expect personal lending balances to grow to $2 billion by the fourth quarter of 2019 from approximately 900 million at the end of 2017. Loan originations will remain focused on high quality prime customers with GreenSky providing first loss coverage as we have discussed before. Growth in personal loans should allow us to generate a higher ROE revenue stream and help us achieve a better balance between our commercial and consumer portfolios. In the first quarter, we expect total end of period consumer loans to be stable relative to the fourth quarter. For 2018, we expect end of period loan growth of between 2% and 3%. Excluding indirect auto loan balances we expect consumer growth north of 4% driven by the initiatives we have previously discussed. Our investment portfolio balances remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter as we had expected. We expect to continue to maintain our investment portfolio at roughly the same level in the first quarter. We had strong deposit performance in the fourth quarter. Average core deposits were up 2% sequentially. The sequential increase in commercial interest checking deposit and commercial demand deposit account balances was partially offset by lower consumer savings and commercial remarket account balances. Typical of rising rate environments, deposit markets remain comparative. We continue to make rational decisions between pricing appropriately for profitability and maintaining and growing relationship based LCR friendly deposits. Despite the environmental pressures, we believe we have an opportunity to steadily grow the consumer book while accelerating growth in commercial deposits. Our modified liquidity coverage ratio continue to be very strong at 129% at the end of the quarter. Taxable equivalent net interest income of $963 million was down $14 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to the leverage lease re-measurement triggered by the change in tax law. Excluding this item, adjusted NII was up $13 million or 1% from last quarter and up 7% compared to the adjusted NII from the fourth quarter of 2016. Our strong NII performance primarily reflects the positive impact of higher interest earning asset yields as well as the continued shift into higher yielding consumer loans. The NIM adjusted for the same lease item increased three basis points from the third quarter to 3.1%, exceeding our previous guidance by five basis points. The sequential improvement was driven by improving investment portfolio and loan yields predominantly from our consumer categories. The NIM in the first quarter of 2018 should be approximately 3 to 5 basis points higher compared to the fourth quarter. We expect full year 2018 NIM in the 3.15% range, exceeding our December guidance including the impact of two rate hikes one in March and another one in September. Absent any Fed moves in 2018, we would expect full year NIM to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017 at around 3.1%, five basis point impact of these two partial year moves approximate the full year impact of a 25 basis point move in the fed funds rate for us. Supporting this outlook, overall deposit pricing so far has remained relatively muted with cumulative betas since the first fed move at the end of 2015 in the low to mid-20% range on a blended basis. Consumer has been in the mid teen range with commercial in the low-40s. The incremental blended data for the last move in December is in the high-20s and we project a beta in the 45% to 50% range for subsequent rate hikes. If we see betas at lower ranges, our margin could exceed our guidance. We expect our first quarter net interest income to be between $975 million and $980 million or down approximately 1% from fourth quarter's adjusted NII, which is largely driven by day count. For 2018, we expect NII growth to be approximately 5% from the adjusted 2017 NII of between $4 billion and $4.07 billion, exceeding -- again exceeding our December guidance. Credit spreads continue to pressure margins across the banking sector, but the strategic actions we have taken during the last two years have led to a redeployment of capital away from lower returning loans and help us achieve a very good NII and NIM profile. Excluding the impact of the Visa swap and Vantiv gains, non-interest income in the fourth quarter was $587 million compared to $571 million in the third quarter or up about 3% sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily due to the $44 million Vantiv TRA payment in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase in wealth and asset management revenue, partially offset by a decline in corporate banking due to the lease residual impairment and seasonally lower mortgage banking revenue. Mortgage banking net revenue of $54 million was down $9 million sequentially. Origination fees were down $8 million sequentially, reflecting lower rate lock volumes and tighter spreads. Originations of $1.9 billion were 10% lower than the third quarter with a fourth quarter gain on sale margin of 206 basis points compared to 228 basis points in the third quarter. During the quarter, 57% of our origination mix consisted of purchase volume. Approximately two-thirds of our originations continue to be sourced from the retail and direct channels and the remainder through the correspondent channel. Corporate banking fees of $77 million were down $24 million compared to the third quarter. The sequential decline was due entirely to a lease remarketing impairment which was previously disclosed at our Investor Day. Excluding the impairment of $25 million, corporate banking revenue was up $1 million. Despite the continued challenging market environment, we grew FICC revenue 20% sequentially. We saw broad based growth with derivatives, commodities and institutional brokerage, all up from the last quarter and last year. FX revenues were also up 16% sequentially. This was offset by lower other capital markets revenue from deals that were pushed out from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of this year, primarily with an ECM and DCM. We currently expect corporate banking fees to increase between 5% and 10% sequentially, excluding the lease remarketing impairment from this quarter, driven by an already solid pipeline that was augmented by deals pushed out from the fourth quarter of 2017. Deposit service charges remain unchanged from the third quarter. Card and processing revenue was up 1% sequentially, reflecting a seasonal increase in credit card spend volume and debit transactions, offset by higher rewards. Total wealth and asset management revenue of $506 million was up 4% sequentially, reflecting the equity market improvement during the quarter. Recurring revenues in this business have increased to 83% of fees from the mid-70s last year. We plan to continue to shift our product and service offerings toward more recurring revenue streams to mimic our reliance on transactional activity. In the first quarter, we expect to record an approximately $415 million pre-tax step up again, given the recent close of Vantiv\u2019s acquisition of Worldpay. This gain is greater than previously expected and leaves us with an additional unrealized pretax gain of roughly $0.5 billion at current market prices. Given the post-acquisition name change, we will be referring to the company has Worldpay going forward. As our ownership percentage of the new company will be approximate 4.9%, we will continue to benefit from utilizing the equity method of accounting going forward related to our ownership in a larger and now global company. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect fees to be between $560 million and $570 million excluding the Worldpay step up or down approximately 4% from our fourth quarter adjusted non-interest income shown in the release. Recall that this comparison incorporates the impact of the TRA payment which was $44 million this quarter. Excluding the impact of the TRA, we expect core fee income growth of 4% in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. For the full year of 2018, we expect fees to grow between 5% and 6% from adjusted 2017 levels and grow to approximately $2.4 billion. Implicit in this guidance is a $20 million of TRA related income in the fourth quarter of 2018 rather than the $44 million level in 2017. Despite subdued client activity, we are optimistic about our fee growth trends given the investments that we are making to grow the scale and scope of our fee producing products and services. We remain focused disciplined expense management while continuing to invest for revenue growth. Reported non-interest expense increased 10% sequentially. Excluding the onetime items that were recorded in the aftermath of the tax law changes, expenses were flapped from the third quarter of 2017 against our October guidance of 1.5% growth. Overall, expenses were well managed in 2017 and our focus on operational efficiencies along with our revenue growth led to positive operating leverage for the year. Our adjusted efficiency ratio for 2017 was under 62% in the fourth quarter and under 64% for the full year. Recall that the amortization of our low income housing investments is recognized in expenses, which most of our peers reflect in their tax line which adds approximately 2.5% to our efficiency ratio relative to our competitors. We will focus on continuing to drive positive operating leverage while still making strategic investments that position us for long term out performance. We expect that strategic investments in technology will continue to differentiate us from our peers, while also supporting revenue growth and cost saving opportunities across our company. As we have evidenced over the course of 2017, we will continually scrutinize other areas to reduce run rate expenses in order to achieve our long term efficiency target of sub 60%. We currently expect total expenses in 2018 to be between $4 billion and $4.1 billion. This guidance largely matches our guidance in December except for the impact of the minimum wage increase that we implemented and higher amortization on low income housing investments triggered by the change in tax law, which in total is about $30 million. Furthermore, our outlook also includes about $20 million in expenses associated with insurance acquisition that we closed late in the fourth quarter. First quarter expenses are expected to be up about 9% from adjusted fourth quarter expenses, mostly related to annual seasonality associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. The quarterly expenses are expected to be coming down meaningfully from the first quarter levels every quarter as the year progresses. Turning to credit result on slide nine, fourth quarter credit results followed the positive trend that we've seen all year as the charger offs remain at pre-crisis levels impacted by our strategic decision to focus on reducing volatility and charge offs. Net charge offs were $76 million or 33 basis points, up four basis points from the third quarter of 2017 and up two basis points from last year. Commercial charge offs were 22 basis points, up one basis point from the third quarter and two basis points year-over-year. Consumer net charge offs of 51 basis points were seasonally up eight basis points sequentially and were up two basis points year-over-year. Total portfolio non-performing loans and leases were $437 million or down $69 million or 14% from the previous quarter and down 34% from last year. Our NPL ratio of 48 basis points was at a 10 plus year low. Total C&I NPLs at were down 19% sequentially and 42% on a year-over-year basis. Nearly all loan categories showed a sequential improvement. At the end of the fourth quarter, the criticized asset ratio improved significantly from the previous quarter to 4.6% of commercial loans which will continue to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our performance in stressed environments. Our loss provision was flat compared to the third quarter, reflecting among other factors improvement in criticized assets and non-performing loans, offset by an increase in net charge offs and higher period end loan portfolio balances. The reserve ratio declined one basis point to 1.3%. Our reserve coverage over NPLs has now increased in three consecutive quarters to 274% and is one of the highest among our peers. While we remain in a relatively stable credit environment and the economic backdrop continues to support a continued benign credit outlook, we nevertheless caution you that we could potentially experience some upward pressure in the future. That being said, in light of our strength in balance sheet, we believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth and some normalizing of credit losses. Our capital levels remained very strong during the fourth quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.6%, essentially flat quarter-over-quarter and up 22 basis points year-over-year despite the $273 million share buyback initiated during the quarter and a declaration of our $0.16 dividend. In 2017, we returned over $2 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchase or 95% of earnings. Recall that we have another potential $0.02 dividend raise scheduled for June pending approval from our board. Our tangible common equity ratio, excluding unrealized gains and losses, increased five basis points sequentially and increased seven basis points year-over-year. At the end of the fourth quarter common shares outstanding were down 12 million shares or 2% compared to the third quarter of 2017 and down 57 million shares or 8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Book value and tangible book value were both up 9% from last year. Effective capital management is a very important component of our overall strategic approach. As we mentioned in December, we believe that the improved overall credit profile of our company has translated into an ability to operate our company at lower capital levels. Our goal is to always be very prudent with the amount of capital that we keep on our balance sheet and aim to maximize the long term return on that capital through varying environments. Business environments change and we have to make sure that our balance sheet remains resilient. With the lessons learned from the financial crisis, we will remain focused on creating long term shareholder value. With respect to taxes, our fourth quarter rate was impacted by the BTL re-measurement and other items disclosed in our release. These items grow the tax benefit for the fourth quarter. Excluding the BTL and the Vantiv tax recognition carryover from the third quarter, our tax rate was 25.5%. We expect our full year 2018 tax rate under the new legislative environment to be in the 15.5% to 16% range, which is impacted by the step up gain from the Vantiv Worldpay deal. Excluding this onetime impact in 2018, we project our normal run rate to be between 14% and 14.5%. Our guidance in December based on the 20% marginal tax rate was 12.5% to 13.5%. With the 21% corporate tax rate, this outlook is very close to our previous guidance. Overall, our tax credits continue to impact our effective tax rates. As Greg mentioned, net of the increased compensation that he announced at year end in conjunction with the tax reform and the trigger change in our low income housing and acquisition, we expect most, if not all of the tax benefits to fall to the bottom line. This should by definition increase our long term return targets. On a normalized run rate basis, a 12% to 12.5% reduction in our effective tax rate should have a positive impact of 1.5% to 2% on our North Star ROTCE targets. This moves the upper end of the ROTCE target to the 15.5% to 16% range for the fourth quarter 2019 and beyond and increases our ROI targets by approximately 15 basis points to a range of 1.35% to 1.45%. Our revenue growth outlook, our ability to achieve positive operating leverage without changing our risk appetite, our strong balance sheet and our strategic positioning give us confidence in our ability to create additional shareholder value. With that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A. Sameer Gokhale : Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in our time we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Adam, please open the call up for question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Gerard Cassidy. Gerard, your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Greg Carmichael : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Tayfun, can you share with us with the step-up process that you pointed out of $415 million in the first quarter of 2018, in the past, if I recall, the gains that you've been able to garner from this investment have been used to repurchase your common stock. Do you plan to -- go back to the Fed intra CCAR period to do that again, or would you wait until the next CCAR, and possibly use it at that time to buy back the stock. Tayfun Tuzun : Gerard, given that we are getting -- we're past the half-point and we're getting closer to the end of this CCAR period, we would plan to do that in the next CCAR period. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, very good. And then second, on the commercial loans. I think you said you had elevated payoffs in the quarter. Can you give us some color what you're seeing where your customers are paying off the loans vis-\u00e0-vis what you saw maybe earlier in the year? Greg Carmichael : Yes, Gerard, good question. We did see, I think along with most of our other peers in the industry, significantly elevated pay-downs and payoffs. Over half of that I'd characterize in -- I would direct to our commercial real estate portfolio line of business. The majority of that were asset selling, very low cap rates, high quality assets. Also, a number of those that were moving to the permanent market with a continued flat yield curve, the balance of that would be some of those end-of-year movements that you've seen in the industry, where companies were simply de-levering and maybe positioning themselves relative to the new tax policy. Frankly, we're still trying to figure that one out and see where that one goes. But I would say that was widespread though across geographies and across our businesses, but nothing out of the ordinary beyond that. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you, guys. Greg Carmichael : Sure, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Erika Najarian. Erika, please let us know your company name too. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. Bank of America. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Thank you so much for the detailed outlook. And I'm wondering, you were very specific in terms of reiterating a dollar expense range for 2018. And as we think about the NII outlook and the NIM outlook, it appears as though there's some conservatism baked into either the number of hikes or the deposit reprising assumptions. And the question here is, if the revenue results in 2018 are better than what's outlined on slide 11, does the $4 billion to $4.1 billion range hold regardless? Tayfun Tuzun : With respect to the expenses, I would say, yes. I think more movement on the expense base related to variable revenues comes more from the fee line items. But in general, the impact of a higher-than-guided NII performance should still keep that expense range intact. Erika Najarian : Got it. So just to be clear, if you outperform an NII that expense range is intact, but if you outperform on fees then that's when you may be at the high end or out of the range but still keeping with the positive operating leverage target? Tayfun Tuzun : Absolutely. Greg Carmichael : And Erika, this is Greg. We continue to focus on expenses as evident on our 2017 performance of flat year-over-year growth. This is an area of heighted focus in the organization. We continue -- will continue to focus on that as we move into 2018, and do a better job of managing expenses on as we move into the year. Tayfun Tuzun : And just so you know, in general, if during the year we outperform NII, everything else being equal, only, and only due to rate changes, our variable compensation typically does not move. Erika Najarian : Thank you. That was clear, appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari. John, please let us know your company name. Thanks. Your line is open. John Pancari : Evercore ISI. Wanted to get your thoughts on the payout target, longer-term post tax reform, any change to your targeted 120 million to 140 payout. Tayfun Tuzun : Look, I think in general, the more money we make, you would expect a higher payout in dollars. We're still clearly waiting for the Fed\u2019s CCAR assumptions and background, and we will run that through our numbers. But we are still targeting a sort of mid 9-type cap -- CET1 position for 2019. And our payoffs will correlate to that target. John Pancari : Okay, thanks. And then my follow-up is around North Star. I know initially, when you laid out the program and in several of your updates posted, you were commenting on the 800 million in pretax income that you were targeting under North Star, but you didn't focus on that 800 million at the Investor Day. So is that still a target, that dollar amount? And does it change at all with tax reform, and if so what is the new number? Tayfun Tuzun : It does. And I don't necessarily have an updated number for you as to the impact of the tax reform. But as you recall, in December, during our Investor Day, we discussed that there were some adjustment to revenue expectations, especially related to loan growth assumptions. And we did say that, both in 2016, and '17, and also in '18, our loan growth assumption is somewhat lower than the initial estimate that we had when we laid out our expectations. But in return, we also mentioned the lower asset growth enabled us to purchase a higher amount of capital, which continues to support the same ROTCE targets that we laid out. And as the tax reform also is moving these targets out, we are actually ahead of our initial expectations with respect to that. John Pancari : Okay, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please, your line is open. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Greg Carmichael : Hi, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Sorry if I missed it. The expected TRA in the fourth quarter going forward, should we assume it stays at the $44 million, which I think came in higher than expected or what's the expectation on that at this point? Jamie Leonard : Yes, Matt, this is Jamie. The fourth quarter of '17 number was $44 million. That is what we guided to all throughout 2017, because it's based off of the Vantiv tax return from a year prior. So that number is locked in a year in advance. So the 4Q '18 number is also fairly close to being locked in, and that's about $20 million. And then going beyond 2018, given the change in tax rate from 35% down to 21%, the go-forward number on those TRA cash flows would be in the $24 million range. And then those numbers shouldn't change appreciably as long as Worldpay has sufficiency of income to utilize and tax rates don't further change. And the only then variable to all of this would be whenever we would sell our remaining Worldpay interest, it would generate another $340 million or so of cash flows over the next 16 years. So, really look at $20 million for 4Q '18, $24 million beyond and until another disposition occurs. Matt O'Connor: Okay, that's helpful. And then just separately, if we look at your [Technical Difficulty] seeing at some peers, as we think about reserves to loans. And I'm just wondering if you feel like that gives you a little more flexibility to essentially grow into the reserves levels or how you're thinking about those. You've obviously been de-risking, the loans have not been growing, and most of the credit metrics have been improving, and you've had very good release. So just wondering how your thought of those levels going forward. Thank you. Greg Carmichael : And I'll ask Frank to comment on the credit profile of that, but in general, we believe that the reserve levels are at the right level. So in that sense, I wouldn't characterize a future flexibility associated with the ratio. But, Frank, do you want to comment on credit? Frank Forrest : Yes, I mean, our charge-off are a crazy number. Our commercial losses over the last five quarters have ranged from roughly 20 to 30 basis points. Our consumer losses have been in the 40 to 55 basis points range. Those have been slightly higher actually than our peers. Again, it's a trailing number. Our NPAs have been coming down nicely, and in fact, we talked about criticized assets. That will come down, but now the other remainder is from our perspective, we\u2019re nine years into a recovery, and I think we will continue to see some early signs that we will continue forever. And so, there certainly is conservatism. I view this realism, that's nine years is far beyond where we typically would see a pressure. So overall, we feel we are not where we are, but 130 coverage we are comfortable with that that covers 275% [Technical Difficulty] we feel that that's prudent based on where sit today. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill. Scott, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Brendon on the line for Scott. Just I wanted to start with the commercial loan outlook, I believe just compared to the outlook you gave in December, if you look, you've improved the outlook for commercial growth a little bit, can you just talk about what's underlying that improvement in the commercial outlook? Greg Carmichael : Well, first of all, I will tell you that as I look at the activity levels that we had in the fourth quarter, they were substantially elevated. It was a very strong quarter of production, and it was across all of our corporate banking verticals, it was across nearly all of our geographies. If the tax policy changes, beginning to come into play, I frankly -- I had a lot of conversation with a number of CEOs and CFOs, middle market corporate relationships over the last few days, and various -- unquestionably a growing optimism, that can create a tailwind I believe for us as we look at 20018. But I'd also remind you that we've continued to reallocate our resources. We've, consistent with our North Star strategy, have built out new verticals, our TMT vertical continues to frankly accelerate, and we are developing a very strong name there. Our healthcare vertical had a great quarter. I think they were well positioned for 2018. The ACA Act, with that kind of becoming a little bit less of an issue; there is more clarity in that industry. We are very active there, and I think that you will see more around that space in the near future; energy -- with energy prices that's clearly creating a tailwind. And frankly, I'm really pleased we have some leadership, we have recruited additional middle market bankers throughout, some of our footprint, look you know, what we shared in the past around the Floridas and North Carolina, we got Tennessee really moving, Indiana being our strongest region for the year. But some of the markets where we have recruited bankers, we have new leadership such as Georgia, such as Cleveland, Northeast Ohio, such as Chicago, these are markets that frankly had a really good fourth quarter and we believe are very well positioned for 2018. Tayfun shared with you growth in that nominal kind of GDP, I believe that there could be some tailwind there. I'm optimistic we got the right business model, we got great talent and I'm looking forward to again. Unidentified Analyst : I appreciate all the detail and color over there. And then, just turning to corporate bank fee just want to make sure I have the guidance for the 1Q, correct. Is it fair to say you take the 77 million from this question, add back the $25 million impairment and then the growth of 5% to 10% off of that higher level, is that correct? Greg Carmichael : Yes, it is correct. Operator : And your next question comes from Peter Winter from Wedbush. Peter, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is actually Anthony on for Peter. My first question on deposit costs. They seem to tick up across most categories again similar pace we saw last quarter. Any of that promotional or what are you seeing there in terms of deposit pricing competition. Jamie Leonard : Yes, this is Jamie. The betas that Tayfun referenced, cumulative beta, roughly 22% does include some increases in promotional offers, both in the retail segment as well as with some exceptional pricing in commercial. In terms of the acceleration of the beta, the June hike, we experienced about a 35% beta relative to that 22% that we've had cycled to-date and when you break that down by product, commercial accounts experienced above average beta at about 41% cumulatively whereas the consumer accounts have experienced a below average beta of about 15%. And then add a little more color, when you break it down by the line of business, that 22% cumulative data translates to 6% in retail, 46% in our wealth and asset management line of business and then 52% in commercial. So I think that highlights where we\u2019ve come and as Tayfun I mentioned, we are in that 45% to 50% modeling for the next couple of rate hikes. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And my follow-up is on the auto charge-off rates, it seems like it ticked up again a little bit this quarter about 10 basis points. I know you're looking to shrink the auto portfolio, but can you give any color on what's driving the continued increase in the charge-off in auto? Thanks. Jamie Leonard : Yeah. You have to realize that there is a denominator impact of that as well because the portfolio is shrinking and beyond just some seasonality, there is really no, but we\u2019re pretty pleased with what's going out on the auto. Operator : The next question comes from Christopher Marinac from FIG Partners. Christopher, your line is open. Christopher Marinac : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask about the LCR and as it pertains to not being part of your guidance and to what extent that could help if that plays into your hand later this year? Greg Carmichael : Our LCR target is to operate north of 110 level, so clearly the 129 is a bit elevated driven to some extent by just seasonal inflows and some cash positions, but it certainly gives us some flexibility as the year progresses. But also keep in mind, that\u2019s just a point in time on the last day of the quarter. So it does move around intra quarter. But it would certainly give us some flexibility as 2018 progresses. Christopher Marinac : Do you think that will drive both margins and NII if that changes in your favor? Greg Carmichael : Yes. Christopher Marinac : Okay, great. Thank you very much guys. Greg Carmichael : Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from Saul Martinez from UBS. Saul, your line is open. Saul Martinez, your line is open. Please state your question. Greg Carmichael : All right. Okay, I think we will end the call there. Thank you Adam, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department and we will be happy to assist you. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

This morning, I'm joined on the call by our Chairman and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported first quarter 2018 net income available to common shareholders of $689 million and EPS of $0.97. Our reported EPS included a positive impact of $0.40 from a few significant items including a step-up gain of $414 million recognized from a Worldpay stake. Our first quarter results were strong and reflect our efforts to enhance the resilience of our balance sheet, capitalize on rate hikes and maintaining tight control over expenses. Recall that last quarter we revised our ROA and ROTCE targets higher after tax legislation resulted in lower corporate tax rates. Now on year two of Project North Star, our first quarter results showed that we remain on track to achieve the upper-end of our leasing device ROTCE target in the 15.5% to 16% range, an ROA of 1.35% to 1.45% by the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the Worldpay gain, another non-core items are underlying ROTCE for the first quarter was over 30% further adjusting for additional capital generated from the step-up gain or ROTCE for the quarter was 13.7% compared to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2017. We remain focused on driving improved shareholder returns as we continue to executive on our strategic initiatives under project North Star. We're discussing some of the highlights for the quarter, I'd like to make a few observations about the broader economic environment. We are closely watching our commercial client activity and remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for employment and capital investment. For the low level of employment is supportive of a healthy consumer sector we\u2019re also cognizant of elevated consumer debt levels. Moving on to our first quarter results, our asset sensitive balance sheet allows the benefit from increased short-term interest rates. Our adjusted net interest margin expanded eight basis points sequentially and exceeded our previous guidance primarily reflecting higher interest rates. We also benefited from our focus on maintaining commercial loan pricing discipline. End of period commercial loans and leases increased 1% sequentially, while the industry balances were reflect. A sequential increase in our commercial portfolio was primarily driven by growth and C&I loans which grew by 1% on both a period end and average basis. As some of you may recall, we discussed our commercial client experience initiative or TCEI at our Investor Day last December. TCEI is enabling us to significantly improve customer service in our middle market lending business by streamlining origination underwriting process, our relationship manager is able to spend more time on cultivating new relationships and better servicing our existing customers. With all these initiative already paying off and we\u2019re extremely pleased with the implementation. In the consumer portfolio excluding our loans, average consumer balances grew 2% year-over-year largely driven by continued growth in our unsecured lending portfolio. As we have discussed previously, we would like to achieve a better balance between consumer and commercial loans. Growth in our unsecured lending portfolio is consistent with this objective and the mortgage space I'm pleased to announce that all distribution channels will rely on new mortgage loan origination system this week. This system will help improve the customer experience, increase employment engagement and support market share growth. In terms of fee income, we experienced another record quarter in our wealth and asset management business reflecting seasonally high tax credit fees, growth in new relationships and strong equity market performance over the past year. Our corporate banking revenue was negatively impacted by newly market activity. We sold sequential growth in our M&A advisory business and corporate bond fees which was stronger than the - overall industry average. Although consistent with general market trends for the quarter, we generated lower loans syndication fees. So non-interest income was also impacted by lower equity method income resulting from the Vantiv Worldpay merger. For the first quarter, we managed our underlying expenses well below previous guidance despite ongoing strategic investments in project North Star. At Fifth Third we appreciate the importance of ensuring that our core expense base is optimized for the realities of our operating environment. We believe we saw room for improvement and are working with a third-party consulting firm to help identify and execute on additional expense saves throughout 2018 and into 2019. The initiatives we are currently reviewing are in addition to what we had planned under project North Star and could increase our return targets closer to 17%. These are pure expense initiatives and include spend of control design, back to middle office efficiencies and enhanced focus on vendor spend. In light of evolving customer preferences, we continue to assess the optimal size of our branch network and decide to close nine branches during the quarter. We are also considering opening new branches in our high growth markets where we have opportunities to expand our franchise.. This process is an ongoing exercise and we continue to leverage our newly developed analytical capability, optimize the size of our retail branch network. During the quarter, credit quality remains strong. Credit size loans declined again reflect the attribute of taken over the past two years to strengthen our balance sheet, net charge-off and nonperforming loans also remained at or near pre-crisis levels. Our capital and liquidity levels remain very strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio at 10.8%, while our modified LCR continues to be well above regulatory requirements at 113%. With our strengthened balance sheet and focus on through the cycle credit performance, we continue to believe our optimal CET1 ratio should be significantly below current levels in a 9.5% to 9.7% target range. As a result, we anticipate a total payout ratio over 100% over the next year or so with a continue balance between higher dividends and share buybacks. We also recently announced additional strategic partnerships, acquisitions and equity investments. Our recent acquisition of Coker Capital Advisors built upon the strength of our healthcare vertical and experience our M&A advisor capabilities. Turning to our Epic Insurance and Integrity HR acquisitions from last year, we expect this transaction to help support fee income growth. Our strategic approach with fee related acquisitions tends around acquiring and growing within our markets, fully integrating these businesses into the bank and leveraging our unique one bank every mile to grow in a efficient demand. As many of you know, student debt is a challenge facing our millennial customers. We launched our momentum app last year to help with this problem and we\u2019re pleased to recently announce an equity investment in common bar. One of the largest digital student loan originators and look forward to working with them to bring proper solutions to the market. We\u2019ve also made significant progress on our commitment to improving the communities we serve. In particular, we recent became the first Fortune 500 Company to sign a power purchase agreement to achieve 100% renewable power. This achievement will help promote a healthy and sustainable environment and help protect our plan for future generations. I\u2019d once again like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication which is evident in our financial results. I was pleased that we were able to deliver strong results and remain on track to achieve our North Star targets. With that, I\u2019ll turn over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial summary on Slide 4 of the presentation. As Greg mentioned, during the quarter NII growth and expansion, expense control and ongoing strength in credit quality metrics reflected our commitment to driving improved financial performance and shareholder return. Reported results were positively impacted by the items noted on Page 1 of our release. The most significant item was the $414 million positive pretax impact of the Worldpay step-up gain which we had previously discussed. This was partially offset by a $39 million pretax charge related to the Visa total return swap and $8 million impairment related to our plan to reduce our branch network by nine branches and an $8 million charge associated with an increase in litigation reserves. As we had discussed on last quarter's earnings call, our first quarter results were affected by seasonally higher expenses resulting from compensation related item. Despite this headwind, our underlying ROA, and ROTCE metrics improved substantially from the fourth quarter. Core ROA of 1.23% improved 11 basis points sequentially with core ROTCE of 13.4% up 1.7% from adjusted fourth quarter result. Recall that last quarter we revised our ROA and ROTCE targets to reflect our confidence in retaining the majority of the benefits from recently enacted tax legislation. As Greg mentioned earlier, we are taking a closer look at our expense base in light of the ongoing lack of strength in loan growth and the muted fee environment more on that a little bit later. Moving to Slide 5, loan growth continues to be challenging in commercial lending. The all end impact of tax reform has been modestly positive for the quarter. Clients have largely maintained their wait-and-see approach and as a result both loan production and payoff activity was relatively temperate. But based on a very healthy pipeline in commercial lending especially in middle market, we anticipate that we will achieve our targets during the rest of the year. Average total loans were flat sequentially. Growth in C&I and other consumer loans was mostly offset by a continued reduction in our home equity, commercial real estate balances and the planned decline in our indirect auto loan portfolio. Average C&I loan balances were up 1% or approximately $340 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and were flat year-over-year. While production was relatively tepid during the quarter, we had tailwinds from line utilization and lower paydowns which led to a modest increase in balance. The sequential increase in average C&I balances was partially offset by a 1% decline in both CRE and commercial leases. We expect commercial leases to continue to decline another $400 million by the end of 2018 mainly in our indirect large ticket leasing portfolio given our focus on driving relationship oriented profitable growth. Similar to prior quarters, price competition in commercial lending is aggressive but we continue to remain competitive striking an appropriate balance between growth and prudent respect. Average commercial real estate loan balances declined 1% sequentially in the first quarter with mortgage down 3% and construction flat. We will continue to maintain a cautious approach in commercial real estate given where we are in the cycle. We currently expect our end of period total commercial portfolio to grow about 1% to 1.5% sequentially in the second quarter and about 4% in 2018 compared to end of year 2017 including the impact of the runoff of our national leasing business. Growth should predominantly come from C&I. Stated differently excluding the runoff in our leasing business, our growth rate is expected to exceed 5%. In consumer including the planned decline in the indirect auto loan portfolio, average loans were flat sequentially and year-over-year. Excluding auto, average consumer loans were up 2% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 7% year-over-year reflecting the ongoing impact of our decision to curtail indirect originations and redeployed capital. The rate of decline in the auto portfolio should slow as we currently expect the pace of originations to increase in 2018 from 2017 given current returns. We currently expect our total production be closer to $4 billion in 2018. Average residential mortgage loans were flat sequentially and up 2% year-over-year as we continue to retain jumbo mortgages and arms on our balance sheet. We acquired a $2 billion servicing portfolio during the quarter which will be onboarded in the second quarter. Since the beginning of last year, we have acquired approximately $12 million in servicing assets. We continue to assess MSR purchase opportunities to take advantage of our scale and enhance our return on capital. Our average credit card portfolio increased 1% from the fourth quarter supported by our enhanced analytical capabilities. We continue to expect card balance growth in the mid to high single digits for 2018. Our home equity loan originations were down 3% sequentially and 9% year-over-year as demand for home equity loans remained weak. Across the industry, applications are down over 10% year-over-year. We believe that this highlights evolving borrower preferences for speed and simplicity in consumer lending. This is the underlying premise behind our efforts to grow our unsecured consumer loan business. Other consumer loans which primarily consists of our personal lending portfolio including loans generated through GreenSky increased 17% sequentially to $1.6 billion. We continue to expect personal lending balances to grow to $2 billion by the fourth quarter of 2019 from approximately $1 billion at the end of the first quarter. Loan originations will remain focused on high-quality prime customers with GreenSky providing first loss coverage as we have discussed before. In the second quarter, we expect total end of period consumer loan balances to increase approximately 1% relative to the first quarter. For 2018, we expect end of period loan growth of 1% to 1.5% down from our previous guidance of 2% to 3% impacted by the continued headwinds in home equity. Excluding indirect auto loan balances, we expect consumer growth of about 3%. Our average investment portfolio increased 3% in the first quarter as market dynamics led to opportunistic purchases. We expect to maintain our portfolio balance at roughly the same level in the second quarter. We had solid deposit performance and household growth in the first quarter. Average core deposits were up 1% sequentially. The sequential increase in commercial interest checking deposit and commercial money market account balances was partially offset by lower commercial demand account balances. Typical of rise in rate environments, deposit markets remain competitive. We continue to make rational decisions between pricing appropriately for profitability and maintaining and growing relationship based LCR friendly deposits. Despite the environmental pressures, we believe we have an opportunity to steadily grow the consumer book leveraging our recent success in analytical driven direct marketing efforts. Our modified liquidity coverage ratio continued to be strong at 113% at the end of the quarter. Taxable equivalent net interest income of $999 million was up $36 million or 4% from the fourth quarter. The prior quarter was impacted by a $27 million leveraged lease remeasurement due to the change in corporate tax rates. Excluding the impact of the remeasurement, NII was up $9 million or 1% sequentially reflecting higher short-term market rates partially offset by a lower day count. Excluding a non-core, card remediation benefit from the first quarter of 2017 and NII in the current quarter increased $72 million or 8% on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily driven by the impact of higher short-term market rates, and an increase in the investment portfolio of balances. The NIM adjusted for the same items increased eight basis points from the fourth quarter to 3.18% exceeding the midpoint of our previous guidance by four basis points. The sequential improvement was driven by a six basis point benefit from higher short-term market rates, one basis point from growth in higher yielding consumer loans, and a three basis point benefit from day count. This was offset by a one basis point drag from the FTE adjustment given the tax law change, as well as one basis point from higher securities balances. The NIM in the second quarter of 2018 should be approximately three to five basis points higher compared to the first quarter. We expect full year 2018 NIM in the 3.22% to 3.24% range exceeding our January guidance including the impact of two more rate hikes this year, one in June and another one in December. The improvement in our outlook reflects the impact of the elevated LIBOR levels and strong pricing discipline in our lending business. Supporting this outlook, overall deposit pricing so far has remained relatively muted. Our cumulative beta leading up to the March 2018 Fed hike was 25% with consumer in the mid-20s and commercial in the mid-40s. The December hike resulted in a blended beta of approximately 40% and we expect the March rate increase who also reserve in a beta of around 40%. We are currently forecasting a low to mid 50% beta resulting from June rate increase. As we have said before, if we see betas at lower levels, our margin could exceed our guidance. We expect our second quarter net interest income to be up approximately 3% from the first quarter's net interest income to $1.025 billion to $1.03 billion which is largely a function of higher market rates and day counts, as well as expected loan growth in the commercial portfolio. For the full-year 2018 exceeding our previous guidance, we expect NII to grow by approximately 8% from the adjusted 2017 NII and range between $4.14 billion and $4.16 billion. The strategic actions we have taken during the last two years including the reduction in auto loan originations exits some low return commercial relationships and the reduction in indirect large ticket lease origination have led to a redeployment of capital away from loans with lower returns and help us achieve a very good NII and NIM profile. In addition, over the past few years we have created an interest rate risk profile that allows us to grow deposits at competitive rates while driving greater NIM expansion compared to our peers. Excluding the impact of the non-core items, noninterest income in the first quarter was $553 million compared to $587 million in the fourth quarter. The sequential change was impacted by $44 million in Worldpay TRA revenue, and a $25 million lease remarketing impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017. Underlying fee revenue decreased 3% sequentially due to lower equity method income during the quarter resulting from the closing of the Worldpay acquisition and their merger integration costs partially offset by an increase in wealth and asset management revenue. Mortgage banking net revenue of $56 million was up $2 million sequentially. Origination fees were down $8 million sequentially reflecting lower rate lock volumes and tighter spreads. Originations of $1.6 billion were 18% lower than the fourth quarter with a first quarter gain on sale margin of 189 basis points compared to 206 basis points in the fourth quarter. Gain on sale margins are tighter than we had expected and are likely to remain weak during the remainder of the year. During the quarter, 57% of our origination mix consisted of purchase volume. Just under two-thirds of our originations were sourced from the retail and direct channels and the remainder through the correspondent channel. Challenging market conditions weighed on overall corporate banking fees during the quarter. Fees of $88 million were down $14 million sequentially excluding the prior quarter impairment primarily driven by lower loan syndication and business lending fees. This was partially offset by increased corporate bond and M&A advisory fee. We currently expect corporate banking fees to rebound from the software first quarter driven by a solid pipeline of deals that were pushed out given market factors, as well as the impact of the strategic investments and acquisitions. We expect corporate banking fees to increase between 20% and 25% sequentially subject to market conditions. Deposit service charges remain relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter. Card and processing revenue was down 1% sequentially reflecting seasonally lower credit card spend volume compared with the fourth quarter. Full wealth and asset management revenue of $113 million was up 7% sequentially primarily driven by seasonally strong tax-related private client service revenue. Recurring revenues in this business have increased to approximately 85% of fees from the 79% last year. For the second quarter of 2018, we expect fees to be between $575 million and $585 million or up approximately 5% from our first quarter adjusted noninterest income. For the full year of 2018, we expect fees to be approximately $2.35 billion. Although this guidance is slightly below our January guidance excluding the ongoing weakness in the mortgage business, it still equates to a higher than 4% growth in other fees. We remain focused on disciplined expense management while continuing to invest for revenue growth. Reported noninterest expenses decreased 2% sequentially. Excluding the onetime items recognized both this quarter and in the fourth quarter of 2017, expenses were up 6% sequentially reflecting seasonally higher FICA payment and unemployment insurance, as well as increased amortization of affordable housing investments resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Our adjusted efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 67%. Recall that the amortization of our low income housing investments is recognized in expenses which most of our peers reflect in their tax line. This difference in accounting added over 3% to our efficiency ratio this quarter relative to other competitors. We expect our efficiency ratio to decline every quarter during the remainder of this year and for the year on an adjusted basis based on our outlook we should get to below 60%. Based on our current forecast, we still expect to achieve the upper end of our ROTCE target range of 15% to 16% at the end of 2019. Regardless, our intent is not to limit our progress to a given range and challenge ourselves to execute a continuous improvement program. As part of that progression and especially in light of ongoing environmental challenges, the low growth and revenue growth, we are taking a closer look at our expense base with a specific focus on nonrevenue producing parts of our organization. This review include a span of control study, as well as an evaluation of absolute staffing level. We will also be undertaking another review of potential opportunities in the procurement area with a renewed focus on demand management. We intend to share our expectations on this scale and timing of these deficiencies with you next quarter but we believe that these potential actions may get up closer to a 17% ROTCE level. In addition as Greg discussed, we continue to evaluate our strategies related to our retail branch network which also has implications for further expense efficiencies. At this time, we expect total expenses to be at the lower end of our January guidance of $4 billion to $4.1 billion in 2018. Some of the new expense initiatives may impact the results and we intend to update you as we make more progress in the announced. Second quarter expenses are expected to be down about 2% from the first quarter as we come off of seasonally higher first quarter level. We expect expenses to continue to fall throughout the remainder of the year. First quarter credit results continue to follow a positive trends reflecting low unemployment and the benign economic backdrop, as well as the positive impact of deliberate actions that we took to reduce high risk exposures during the past two years. One of the leading indicators with strong correlation with these decisions to criticize asset ratio continued to improve and at the end of the first quarter was down 100 basis points from the beginning of 2017. Net charge-offs were $81 million or 36 basis points, up three basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 and down four basis points from last year. Commercial charge-offs were 21 basis points down one basis point from the fourth quarter and down eight basis points year-over-year. Consume net charge-offs of 60 basis points were seasonally up nine basis points sequentially and were up four basis points year-over-year. Total portfolio nonperforming loans and leases were $452 million down 34% from last year and up 3% from the previous quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher C&I NPLs from our most recent SNC review which includes $28 million in RBL loans, current on interest and well collateralized. Our loss provision was $23 million in the quarter down $44 million sequentially reflecting continued low levels of net charge-offs and the improving credit profile of our loan. The reserve ratio declined six basis points to 1.24%. Our reserve coverage overall NPLs remains 250%. As we remind you every quarter, we remain in a relatively stable credit environment and the economic backdrop continues to support - continue to benign credit outlook. We nevertheless caution you that we could potentially experience some upward pressure in the future. Capital levels remain very strong during the fourth quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.8% of about 21 basis points sequentially. We initiated and settled at $318 million share repurchase which included a $35 million request above our original CCAR period. We currently have approximately $235 million in buyback capacity remaining for the second quarter to complete our CCAR 2017 repurchase. Recall that we also have another potential $0.02 dividend raise scheduled for June pending approval from our Board. Our tangible common equity ratio excluding unrealized gains and losses increased 20 basis points sequentially. As the end of the first quarter, common shares outstanding was down 9 million shares or 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and down 65 million shares or 9% compared to last year's first quarter. Book value and tangible book value were up 8% and 7% from last year respectively. Our capital levels are currently higher than what we prudently need given the risk profile and business composition of our company. In addition, we also have a 4.9% ownership in Worldpay and it\u2019s not fully recognized on our balance sheet. When combined with our ability to generate significant amount of capital organically our current position bodes well for strong level of capital returns to our shareholder. As Greg mentioned our CCAR submission reflected these levels and we will receive the Fed\u2019s response later this quarter. Barring any environmental changes our capital actions should continue to benefit from the combination of our balance sheet strength and strong earnings beyond 2018. Recent legislation being debated in Washington and proposals for new regulatory rulemaking should further increase our flexibility and capital management. We will share with you any changes to our capital management approach as we get more clarity on these potential actions that are in front of the Congress and the regulatory body. With respect to taxes our first quarter rate of 15.8% was impacted by the Worldpay step-up gain and other items disclosed in our release. Excluding these items our tax rate was approximately 14.1%. We expect our tax rate for the full year to be in the 16.25% to 16.75% range which is a little higher than our January except excluding the items that are specific to 2018. We would expect our long-term tax rate to be in the 15.5% range. Our revenue growth outlook the ability to achieve positive operating leverage while maintaining underwriting standards our strong balance sheet and our strategic positioning give us confidence in our ability to create additional shareholder value. With that let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A. Sameer Gokhale : Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Tamiya please open the call up for question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Anthony Elian : This is Anthony Elian for Peter. My first question - so with all the uncertainty regarding tariffs, are you guys seeing that this is keeping some borrowers on the sidelines until there is some more clarity or legislation out of Washington? Lars Anderson : We are hearing some kind of feedback on that, but I would say that number one thing that we're hearing from our clients is really digesting still the tax law changes along with our rising labor cost. I wouldn't say that tariffs are really the number one priority, but it's clearly an issue on their mind and certainly is causing them to - I think take a pause which is what we saw in the first quarter. Anthony Elian : And then Tayfun maybe one for you. If fee income for the year comes in a little bit stronger than expected, would you expect expenses will come at the low end of 4 billion to 4.1 billion range? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, I think, so I mean there may be slight increases in incentive comp related line items, but in general I would expect to be able to hold on to that guidance. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Christopher Marinac : When you look at the fintech investment that have outside of Worldpay, would any of these be harvested in the Q3 that would make our CCAR impact or have a meaningful change to that plans? Greg Carmichael : Not really. Once again our focus on the fintech space is really going to be an additive to all our businesses, business like GreenSky or recent investment in [income bond], the acquisitions we made sort of fintech will be additive to our fee lines and really shouldn\u2019t have an impact on our CCAR and capital distributions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : This is Rob in for Mike. If I could follow-up on that last one, you had a pretty decent jump in the growth rate and technology spend year-over-year. I sort of wondering if this is permanent step-up and where the spending is occurring and how you guys think about your tech budget overall? Greg Carmichael : First of all we think our tech spend is consistent we are seeing in other businesses. As we go through this digital transformation, it\u2019s important that we make our investments in smart place, it help us to be successful in our businesses. So we\u2019re not to be digital everywhere, we\u2019re not trying to grow everywhere, we\u2019re really focused on our core businesses and be additive to our core businesses. We have a great technology organization, we continue to enhance our current capabilities and our additive to our current capabilities with new products and solutions for our customers. So we feel comfortable with our tech spend, we think it\u2019s appropriate. We also are always considering opportunities once again to enhance our position. So our strategy around tech expend is basic buy first than partner and then build. I think the evidence is demonstrated here with our investments in fintech companies and some of the new things we rolled out like a momentum out are reflective of that strategy. Unidentified Analyst : And if I could just follow-up with a bigger picture question on efficiency. I think a few years ago you talked about in efficiency ratio in the mid-50s with a normalized rate environment. Is the thought still that you could get there or is it more maybe a focus on fees and fee growth that might be lower efficiency but higher return on equity? Greg Carmichael : As Tayfun mentioned in his prepared remarks, we expect by the year-end to be at below 60% on efficiency ratio but we also believe there is more opportunity there both on the revenue side and on the expense side which is why we've engaged a third-party continue to look at additional items that we could focus on as we move into rest of 2018 and into 2019. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : On your capital guidance at your Investor Day you talked about payouts of 120% to 140% and then your guidance this morning you talked over 100%. So the wording I think it\u2019s a little bit more general than what you had guided to at Investor Day. And so I\u2019m curious, is there any change in thinking in terms of your capital planning and in your capital strategy in light of tougher CCAR examine and the new guidelines of stress capital buffers is this just - if you want to be a little bit more generalizing in your commentary ahead of this year\u2019s CCAR? Tayfun Tuzun : There really isn't Saul. I think in general our targets remain intact clearly the stress scenario are in the current CCAR exercise was a little bit more stressed than we anticipated which may just slowdown our march towards that sort of mid-9s type of capital number. But we anticipate that we will get there and also there are some changes that the regulators are contemplated to make which may also have a positive impact, but in general our approach to where we think we can manage this balance sheet has not changed. I don\u2019t know Jamie if you want to add anything. Jamie Leonard : Sums it up, I guess though the topic I think to touch on this the stress capital buffer in terms of all work we've done that derisk our balance sheet. If you look at the proposed rule and you go back over the last three years of CCAR submissions fourth with third our capital destruction is well below the 2.5% SCB buffer that's being proposed. So from a derisking standpoint we would certainly be - we would manage our portfolio well below 7% therefore will be subject to the 7% limit. And then from there obviously the benefit of the proposed rules will just allow us more flexibility for our management team and our board to manage capital going forward. But for now for 2018 CCAR scenario was pretty stressful in terms of the scenario. And therefore want to wait and see what the results look like at the end of June but like Tayfun said, we certainly - we\u2019re targeting over 100% there. Saul Martinez : And can you just give us an update on how you're thinking about your M&A strategy of the use of capital both from the standpoint of the fee-based businesses and depositories? Tayfun Tuzun : M&A perspective our position hasn't changed. Our number one focus is on building out our core businesses, making those core businesses and better serving our customers in the markets that we operate in today. So that's job one. Lot of investments you've seen us make on non-bank M&A are geared towards supporting those businesses from a fee perspective. So we're to continue to look at those opportunities and to be additive to our fee and service products that we offer our customers, and that's job one for us. Other M&A opportunities that there may emerge we\u2019ll assess those, but once again it's a difficult challenge right now to figure out where those opportunities lie and our ability to capitalize on it. But job one is focusing on building out our core and non-core businesses, non-bank M&A opportunities to be additive to our business lines, if bank M&A materializes it will be because of the best interest of our shareholders. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: I just want to follow up on the expenses. If I am doing the math correct, it seems like you're taking in a pretty nice decline and causing the back half of the year versus the first half that is 7% drop on average. So we haven't seen that kind of quarterly progression in the past, I know there is some seasonality in 1Q and I guess I am just trying to get a better sense of, how confident you are in getting that and how much you are kind of bacon in some of these initiatives that you highlighted in your prepared remarks versus just normal seasonality and some upfront investment spend maybe you had this quarter? Greg Carmichael : There's some seasonality associated with it, Matt. There's also the additional benefit from the FDIC surcharge going away towards the end of the year. So, we are picking that up as well. We feel fairly comfortable with the guidance and there were also some severance expenses in our numbers this quarter. We're not forecasting those, we don't include those in our outlook for the remainder of the year. So I think, all in all we should be a fairly decent decline on a quarterly basis in total. Matt O'Connor: And then I guess more broadly speaking, heard like you've been working on expenses for a few years here, you got the project North Star. And I guess, I'm just wondering kind of what made you think that there is more opportunity to increase the urgency, take another look, hire an outsider and take a stab at this? Tayfun Tuzun : First off the Project North Star, so we have a lot of expense initiatives baked in the project North Star which I chose to embrace, but we've executed well against those initiatives as evidenced by the fact we were roughly flat year-over-year last year under our guidance for the first quarter this year and we just discussed what looks going forward. So we're very pleased with the initiatives that we put into the initial pipeline. But we're also mindful of this whatever things happening in our business in our industry that creates opportunities for further improvement that we're assessing. We're also watching what other businesses and banks are doing and we continue to believe in maybe opportunities for us to do a better job of managing our expenses going forward. So we're going to take a look at the next level what opportunities. Our \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d wide-out was harvested in the first phase of project North Star because it is going to be difficult as you move forward, but we do believe there is opportunities for further improvement. We don't have anything on the table. So bringing in third party who has done a lot of work in other areas, it could be as it how we\u2019re thinking about our business and want to take that opportunity to assess our position today whatever may look like in the future. Greg Carmichael : And Matt one clarification that I want to provide is these types of studies take a little time. So we are at the end of the first quarter here in 2018, and it will be some time before we can actually finalize our perspective. So, I don't want to - we gave you guidance for 2018 total expenses. The results of this study may have some impact at the very back end of 2018, but any changes will most likely come more in 2009. So our guidance for total expenses remains intact as stated our slides as well as in our script. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Ken Zerbe : Just going back to the NIM guidance, obviously has increased as positive. How much of that relates specifically to the higher LIBOR spreads? And I guess the question is LIBOR or spreads do decline or go back to where there were a couple months ago, does that pose a risk for your NIM guidance? Thanks. Jamie Leonard : On the LIBOR OAS spread what we've assumed in our outlook is that spared and for us it's really sensitive to one month LIBOR. So one month LIBOR to Fed funds, we assume a 13 basis point spread level. So that's obviously up from the 5 bps in the fourth quarter and the 12 bps in the first quarter, but a little bit below where we sit today. We have that at 13 basis points the rest of the year, but then we have it normalizing in December where we revert back to 5 basis points. So is there some risk in the number to the down? Yes, a little bit but the historical spread on one month to Fed funds, I think it's about 10 basis points. I think we're into a new normal, but we don't have that number expanding and there could be some upside if one month LIBOR were to expand. In terms of our balance sheet on a one month LIBOR basis about 30% of our interest earning assets are tied to one month and only about 1% of our liabilities are. So that certainly carries some benefit to a balance sheet likewise. Frank Forrest : I think, we also have been able to avoid the basis risk of some of our peers have seen negatively impacting their NIM. So that was a benefit. Ken Zerbe : And then just a follow up question, in terms of loan growth guidance, obviously starts off - seems like a starting off a little weaker this year. Can you just about the pull through rates because I know you mentioned like good pipelines in commercial they think that\u2019s going to drive higher loan balances to hit your targets later in the year. But like what - I mean how much of those pipelines actually do end up resulting historically in an actual loan growth? Tayfun Tuzun : There is variation obviously throughout the cycle. And part of it has to do with your competition out there, how much they're structuring in terms of pricing, in terms of structure, in terms of your pipeline pull through. I would say today though that largely while it's very, very aggressive we've seen structure and pricing somewhat stabilized. So if I look at our pipeline today versus 90 days ago for example, I think we get pretty fairly compare apples to apples. And we see a very robust growth both in our core middle market across almost all of our regions and across almost all of our corporate banking operations. What the ultimate pull-through will be in the timing will be largely affected by the economic conditions, the confidence level of our clients we're going to stay very close to them. But I can't give you an exact pull- through number. But I would tell you just throughout my 30 some years of banking, the pull-through, the pipeline tends to be somewhere in the 25% range but I'm not sure that that's meaningful. I think what's more meaningful is the fact that our pipeline is becoming much more robust and frankly, it's growing in the businesses in the geographies where we would want it to be. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Number one, do C&I yields if you could just talk about any recoveries in that number? Tayfun Tuzun : No. Vivek Juneja : Secondly, I'm trying to understand a little bit about your efficiency ratio on a core basis, trying to strip out all the non-core items and there's a bunch of them. And if I look at just total revenue growth and look at total expense growth and efficiency ratio, efficiency ratio was essentially flat year-on-year, despite all the stuff you've been doing on the North Star. And if I look at whole growth that also seems to be slightly above where - on a year on year basis. So any color on sort of what happened this quarter, why it stayed flat and we saw no improvement? Tayfun Tuzun : So a couple of comments to that, there are some - if you peel all the one timers, there are a couple of items that have impacted the year-over-year change. One of them is, the impact of the change in corporate tax regime on LIH amortization. There is a little bit of severance expense this quarter in our numbers. And also there is a reduction in fee income related to the closing of both the reduction in percentage ownership in Worldpay, as well as some of their quarterly noise. So if sort of peel those numbers out, I think there is a relatively decent directional improvement in our efficiency ratio. For the year, our guidance on NII clearly is now getting to from a pure 2017, 2018 comparison perspective to over 8%. And overall total revenues are getting near 6%. And so the combination of the very powerful - has a powerful - very powerful impact on core efficiency ratio. So, and if you peel down the low income amortization line item, that momentum takes us to below 60% and that is a pretty decent year-over-year total improvement. And we would expect that - going into 2019, we would expect- it's hard to give guidance for 2019, but we would expect that momentum to continue into next year as well. Vivek Juneja : Any color on sort of numbers around that LIH amortization expense, what are we talking about in terms of how much this year versus a year ago first quarter\u2026 Greg Carmichael : I think I mean - we don't necessarily give out - we give obviously annual guidance. This quarter the number was about $9 million or $10 million above the last... Vivek Juneja : And you think that's likely to continue at this sort of rate through the rest of the year\u2026 Unidentified Speaker : There is a temporary uptick in that line item because of the change in corporate tax rates but towards the end of I think next year that incremental impact that is borne by the change in the tax rate should start to disappear. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually [Brendon] from Scott's team. Just want to ask the question on the provision here, came in a good deal lower than we were looking for despite charges being pretty consistent with what they've been running at. Do you view this quarter step down and reserve ratio as kind of a onetime step down or do you think given the current credit environment there is the potential for another step-down in the reserve ratio? Greg Carmichael : So a question with potential two answers, I'm going to answer the quarterly change in the provision and then I'm going to turn it over to Frank to comment on credit. Clearly, it was a sizable step-down from 1.3% to 1.24%. But there were some significant decline on the parts of the portfolio that sort of supported a higher reserve coverage. So that was actually a very good development. There were some specific reserves that tend to impact coverage levels and changes in coverage levels quarter-over-quarter. But overall really that change was significantly due to an overall improvement in the risk profile of the loan portfolio. And having said all of this, we still remain in the top quartile of coverage levels when you look at our peers. So, Frank any comments on the credit. Frank Forrest : Not really, we were up guidance for the year still range down to what we've given guidance on - we made various low lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But our overall portfolio both in the commercial and the consumer side are they managed very well, our criticized assets are 4.8%, continue to come down quarter-after-quarter. There's not a whole lot of room probably left for that, just given where we are in the cycle. Our non-performing assets have been stable and our - and the upper quartiles relative to our peers we feel very good about that. And our charge-offs again you'll see for the most part a range in the 25 to 35 basis points over the course of the year. The work that we got over the last few years is paying off for us, we've taken out $5 billion of risk in our balance sheet, 1.7 of that is a leverage lending which had contributed in prior years to some more significant write-downs. So we've positioned the company as we said consistently to perform exceptionally well through cycles. We're seeing that. We're seeing that in the reserve. And you're going to see that I believe in our results going forward. Unidentified Analyst : And then one final question just on the tax rate guidance beyond 2018. Just curious as to the change from the prior guidance of 14% to 14.5% up to 15.5%. Is this just the result of kind of digging deeper into the specifics of the tax law change or is there something more specific you want to call out? Tayfun Tuzun : It's really is more due to the increase in expected income levels because those marginal increases come at all tax rate versus the credit impacted tax rate so. Operator : And we have time for one additional question. And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Steven Duong : This is actually Steven Duong in for Gerard. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on GreenSky, can you guys remind us what your first loss protection is on that portfolio? And does it change with the different loss levels? Jamie Leonard : The protection you get in the GreenSky arrangement is a 1% escrow balance for first loss and then after that there's a lost coverage that's generated from what we call the waterfall the cash flows off the portfolio. And in total that number we ballpark in the 5% range. So we feel quite good that given the fico in the 760 range and a little bit over a 5% gross yield along with a little bit over 5% loss coverage. So these will be good assets for our return. Steven Duong : And just curious on that, have you guys modeled out what your losses would be if we had another big recession say on employment 8% to 10%. Jamie Leonard : So we actually do that in CCAR submission and it really shakes out how we look at the portfolio fairly close to what some home equity products would have been, pre-crisis and in the crisis to that in a base environment, we model a lost range could be around 3%. And then in a stress environment you could get two to three times that in losses. Obviously comfortable with how that plays out last year. Steven Duong : And just a final question, your construction loan portfolio you had some good year-over-year growth. Can you give us some color on that? What's driving the growth you're underwriting, the property types, where you're seeing the strongest growth et cetera? Greg Carmichael : So a couple of things, first of all the growth that you did see was really primarily driven with fundings under legacy construction facilities, frankly are beginning this season were coming towards the end of a cycle. In our opinion, we're being much more say prudent about our assets selection, our client selection. As you may recall, we previously after the great recession really pulled together on expert underwriting group with some talent versus having underwriting done out in the regions that's producing some excellent results, the asset quality and portfolio continues to be very, very strong. But as you look out this year, I wouldn't expect to see significant growth out of that portfolio's as we've previously shared. But to the last part of your question, we have really pivoted to some other asset classes away from multi-family a year ago, probably half of our production would have been in multi-family, today it's less than a quarter, as we really focus on those assets that we believe will have more economic scale to them and make sure that we are appropriately exposed to the commercial real estate market in the event of a cycle turn. Operator : And I will now like to turn the call over to Sameer Gokhale for some final comments. Sameer Gokhale : Great, thank you Tamiya. And thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Banc. If you have any follow-up questions please contact the Investor Relations department and we will be happy to assist you. Thank you. Operator : Thank you.

This morning, I\u2019m joined on the call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer Frank Forrest, and Treasurer Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks Sameer, and thank all of you for joining this morning. Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2018 net income available to common shareholders of $563 million and earnings of $0.80 per share. Included in these results are several items noted on Slide 4 of the investor presentation. On a net basis, these items had a positive impact of $0.17 on our reported earnings per share. Excluding these items, our quarterly EPS was up approximately 11% on a sequential basis and up 37% year-over-year. Our financial results for the quarter were strong and reflect our continued focus on driving profitable revenue growth, managing expenses prudently, and disciplined underwriting. I am also pleased that we are realizing the benefits of several initiatives we implemented under Project North Star.  Before discussing the highlights of the quarter, I\u2019d like to make a few observations about the macroeconomic environment. Recent economic data has shown acceleration in GDP growth. Labor markets are strong and the unemployment rate is still very low, but the resulting skill labored shortage may constrain GDP growth. Recent discussions about tariffs have also created uncertainty. As many of you know, the U.S. economy is now in the second-longest period of economic expansion on record. It is unclear how long the positive momentum will continue. In the current economic environment, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious and to maintain our disciplined focus on credit quality and profitability. Moving on to our quarterly results, our financial performance for the second quarter was strong and continued to reflect the benefits of actions we undertook under Project North Star. Commercial loan originations were strong even though we remained focused on disciplined underwriting and client selection during the quarter. Commercial middle market originations were up over 25% year-over-year, the highest levels in years, while corporate banking originations increased by 28% year-over-year to a record high during the quarter. This strong growth partly reflects the benefit of our commercial client experience initiative, or CCEI, which we implemented earlier this year. You may recall that CCEI was an end-to-end process redesign initiative. Recent results show that we have reduced cycle times in middle market lending by 30 to 35%, exceeding our original expectations. The reduced cycle times have allowed our commercial relationship managers to become more productive, helping drive very strong, high quality growth in loan originations. Average credit card balances were up a very healthy 7% year-over-year while card purchase volume was up 10% year-over-year. One of our initiatives under Project North Star was to deploy advanced analytics in the credit card business in order to improve activation and usage rates. We have already started seeing the benefits as growth in our credit card purchase volume is significantly outpacing competitors in our footprint. This is a meaningful shift from a year ago when we lagged our peers. Fee income reflected very strong growth in public banking revenue and a strong deal pipeline as we entered the second quarter. Total corporate banking revenue grew 36% sequentially to $120 million. Over the quarter, we have begun to see the benefits of the implementation of Vision 2020, which is also part of North Star. Vision 2020 is the digital redesign of our financial risk management interface which allows our commercial clients to interact in a real time environment and make better decisions using market data. I believe that our continued focus on offering the right products, executing well, and delivering on strong customer experience is helping to drive these results. A great example is Coker Capital, a healthcare M&A advisory firm which we acquired in February. I\u2019m very pleased with our corporate banking results, and we expect to build on this momentum going forward. We recently completed the implementation of our new mortgage loan origination system across all of our channels. The new mortgage loan system significantly improves our capacity to originate mortgages and enhances the efficiencies of our processes. Although the mortgage business is currently under pressure due to a very tight gain on sale margins and low inventories, we expect to see the benefits of our new loan origination system over time.  During the quarter, we expanded our wealth and asset management pools with the launch of Optify, an automated investment advisory platform. Optify will enable Fifth Third to build upon our established advisor-led approach and offer an integrated digital experience. One of the areas we talked about at our investor day was the use of enhanced analytics across our bank, including deployment of geosciences capabilities to help optimize our branch network. In the second quarter, we leveraged these newly developed analytical capabilities to evaluate our physical branch network. This evaluation supports a three-year plan which results in the closure of approximately100 to 125 branches, mostly in legacy slow growth areas, while opening roughly the same number in higher growth locations with more attractive demographics. We believe this plan is the right long-term strategy to increase households and further support revenue and deposit growth. We continue to enhance our digital capabilities but believe the physical branch is still relevant and plays an important role in giving customers an integrated banking experience. As we strategically close branches, we will continue to invest in our digital capabilities.  We\u2019ve already seen positive results from our digital investments. On the consumer front, new checking account production volumes through digital channels were up approximately 50% year-over-year. Additionally, 54% of our total consumer deposits are made through our mobile and digital ATM channels, and nearly two-thirds of all customer transactions are now completed digitally. We are also seeing substantial benefits on the commercial side of the house. We recently launched a managed payable solution and an advanced electronic FX platform. In addition, we continue to see strong enrollment growth in our commercial portal. Although we have primarily focused our digital capabilities in footprint, our architecture is structured to give us the flexibility to expand outside our current footprint.  Our digital transformation efforts have received a significant amount of industry recognition. I was pleased that Tim Spence, who heads our Payments, Strategy and Digital Solutions team was recently named Digital Banker of the Year by the American Bankers Association. This award was well deserved for Tim\u2019s efforts in leading Fifth Third\u2019s digital transformation. As I touched on earlier, our focus on managing expenses continues while we invest for future growth. During the second quarter, we completed another phase of workforce reductions. These reductions were primarily concentrated in back office and support functions and we incurred a $19 million charge related to severance expense. We expect to reduce headcount to generate an additional $80 million in expense savings over the next 12 months. Although these reductions involve difficult decisions, we believe that they are the right decision for our bank as they not only reduce expenses but also result in more streamlined processes across our businesses. Turning to credit quality, our results continue to reflect the benefit of actions we took to reduce volatility of credit losses and to improve the resiliency of our balance sheet. In 2016 and 2017, we exited $5 billion of loans that did meet our risk or return requirements. We announced this in 2016 as part of our balance sheet optimization goal within North Star. As we have exited these loans and remained focused on disciplined client selection, we have continued to see an improvement in key forward indicators of credit quality. Our criticized asset ratio decreased significantly to 3.87% from 4.83% in the first quarter and 5.5% in the second quarter of 2017. We believe that our criticized ratio has moved from one of the highest in our peer group to one of the lowest over the last two years. This improvement should bode well for us, especially when the economic cycle turns.  As you can see from these highlights, our North Star initiatives are progressing very well and we are seeing the benefits in our results. We expect most of the remaining initiatives to be executed by the end of this year. This timeline is well in line with our plan to integrate MB Financial as the transaction closes.  In the second quarter, we received the results of our CCAR submission and were very pleased with the outcome. As expected, we received a non-objection to our capital plan, allowing us to increase our dividend by 33% and increase capital deployment for share repurchases by 42% compared to last year\u2019s CCAR submission. We view the non-objection as very positive and we are pleased that we were allowed to continue to return capital to shareholders without waiting for a response to our upcoming submission pro forma for MB Financial.  We continue to make good progress towards the close of MB and have assembled a talented and experienced team from both companies to move forward with our integration plan. Tayfun will provide additional details on our progress, but one of the key areas of focus is on employee and customer retention. As I mentioned when we announced the transaction, Mitch Feiger, the CEO of MB Financial will continue as Chairman and CEO of the combined franchise in Chicago. Several members of Mitch\u2019s current leadership team will lead the business going forward, complemented by members of the Fifth Third team in Chicago. We have identified specific roles for these individuals and the majority of them will report directly to Mitch.  We believe that retaining talented leaders from both organizations will serve to help both employee as well customer retention. We are maintaining regular communication with employees from both companies and are also conducting customer listening sessions on an ongoing basis. The listening sessions are meant to address any questions or concerns that customers may have. We are pleased that we have seen minimal employee or customer disruption since we announced the acquisition. With the organizational structure in place and the right team members to lead the integration efforts, we are confident that we\u2019ll be able to realize the cost savings we announced in May. At the time of the announcement, we intentionally excluded revenue synergies when discussing the financial impact of the acquisition. Based on our current analysis, which is still ongoing, we expect to achieve between $60 million and $75 million in pre-tax income from revenue synergies by year three. We intend to update you with additional details on these benefits between now and closing. The larger part of these revenue synergies is in our combined commercial banking business. We intend to realize these synergies by leveraging MB\u2019s capabilities in core middle market ABL and leasing across our footprint.  We also plan to expand business relationships with current MB commercial customers in Chicago while offering our more comprehensive set of capital markets and treasury management products and services. With additional revenue synergies, we expect the IRR from the transaction to increase an additional 150 to 200 basis points and tangible book value earn-back to decrease from 6.8 years to 5.9 years. We continue to believe that the economics of this transaction are very compelling and look forward to sharing our progress with you over the course of the year. I\u2019d like to once again thank our employees for their hard work, dedication, and for always keeping the customer at the center, which is evident in our financial results. We were pleased to have recently received validation of our efforts from two separate, independent third parties. First, Kiplinger just named Fifth Third the Best Regional Bank and runner-up for the Best Private Bank across the entire U.S. based on the strength of our offerings. We were the only bank mentioned in both categories. Our decision sciences team won the 2018 Special Achievement in Geosciences Award, which recognizes organizations across the globe for making significant advancements in the scientific field of geosciences. We received this award for the innovative work related to our branch network analytics.  I was pleased we were again able to deliver strong results, and we remain on track to achieve our North Star targets. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let\u2019s move to the financial summary on Slide 4 of the presentation. As Greg mentioned, during the quarter NIM expansion, strong commercial loan originations, diligent expense management and significant improvement in key credit quality indicators reflected the progress we have made to enhance our financial performance while maintaining the resiliency of our balance sheet. Reported results were positively impacted by the items noted on Page 1 of our release.  The most significant item was a $205 million pre-tax gain from the sale of the Worldpay shares. We believe the timing of the sale and the expected return of capital via buybacks in the coming quarters will be rewarding for our shareholders, given the recent trading range of our stock. The remaining unrealized gain in our Worldpay stake is approximately $400 million based on their current stock price. Our ownership percentage is about 3.3% and at this level, we continue to use the equity method of accounting. The sale also generated $120 million in incremental pre-tax TRA benefits to be recognized over the 15-plus years. The gain along with an $11 million positive pre-tax benefit from GreenSky\u2019s IPO was partially offset by a $30 million branch network optimization charge, $19 million in pre-tax compensation expense primarily related to a workforce reduction, a $10 million pre-tax charge related to the Visa total return swap, and a $10 million pre-tax contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation. Excluding these items, our underlying core ROA and ROTCE metrics continue to substantially improve. Core ROA of 1.33% improved 10 basis points sequentially with core ROTCE of 14.6% improving 1.3% from our adjusted first quarter results.  Moving to Slide 5, during the second quarter, average total portfolio loans were flat compared to the first quarter of 2018. Growth in C&I and personal loans was offset by decreases in home equity loans and commercial leases. Commercial loan growth of 1% was driven by strong origination activity in both middle market and large corporate loans. As Greg mentioned previously, our corporate banking originations this quarter were the highest ever and commercial middle market originations were the highest in years. However, pay-offs near the end of the quarter were elevated, which resulted in slightly slower than anticipated loan growth for the quarter. Much of the pay-down activity was the result of clients tapping the capital markets, and we were able to capture capital market fees associated with those pay-downs. Assuming the rhetoric around trade war subsides, we expect to achieve our previously discussed loan growth targets for the year. On the topic of tariffs, it is still too early to tell whether they will have much of an impact on our clients\u2019 businesses. Our discussions with them indicate that they intend to pass the higher costs onto their customers, but it is unclear whether they will be able to achieve a complete offset, which may affect their profitability and growth plans. We will continue to monitor the situation closely. Average C&I balances were up 1% or approximately $510 million compared to the first quarter of 2018, and were up 2% or approximately $690 million year-over-year. The sequential increase in average C&I balances was partially offset by a 3% decline in commercial leases. We expect commercial leases to continue to decline another $150 million through the end of the year. This reflects our goal to decrease our exposure to non-relationship based leases that have historically experienced significant fluctuations in asset values. Similar to prior quarters, price competition in commercial lending remains aggressive. We are continuing to focus on striking an appropriate balance among growth, risk management and profitability.  Average commercial real estate loan balances were flat sequentially in the second quarter with mortgage down 1% and construction up 2%. We will continue to maintain a cautious approach in commercial real estate lending, particularly in certain segments of multi-family given where we are in the cycle. We currently expect our end-of-period total commercial portfolio to grow by about 3% sequentially in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect the portfolio to grow by 4%, including the impact of the planned run-off of our national leasing business. In consumer, average loans were down 1% sequentially and flat year-over-year, but were up 2% year-over-year excluding auto. Auto loans were down 5% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing impact of our decision to curtail originations and redeploy capital elsewhere. The rate of decline in the auto portfolio should continue to slow as we expect originations to increase to about $4 billion in 2018 from $3.7 billion in 2017. Higher origination levels reflect the more attractive returns we\u2019ve been seeing so far this year. Average residential mortgage loans were flat sequentially and up 1% year-over-year with continued balance sheet retention of jumbo mortgages and arms. Separately, we acquired a $2 billion servicing portfolio to be on-boarded in the third quarter, bringing the total acquired servicing portfolio to $14 billion since the beginning of last year.  Our average credit card portfolio was flat sequentially, but balances grew by 7% year-over-year as we are starting to see the benefits of North Star. We expect card balance growth in the mid to high single digits for 2018. Personal and other consumer loans increased 8% sequentially to $1.7 billion. This quarter, we also launched a new digital lending enhancement that allows our customers to apply for a loan on our mobile app and receive funds almost instantly. We believe that we are one of the only banks to offer this. In the third quarter, we expect total end-of-period consumer loan balances to be relatively flat compared to the second quarter. For 2018, we expect end-of-period loan growth of approximately 1%, reflecting continued mortgage origination weakness. Excluding indirect auto loans, we expect consumer loan growth of about 2%. Our average investment portfolio increased 1% in the second quarter as market dynamics led to a few opportunistic purchases. We expect to maintain our portfolio balance at roughly the same level in the third quarter.  We had solid deposit performance and household growth in the second quarter. Average core deposits were up 1% sequentially. An increase in interest-bearing commercial and consumer account balances was partially offset by lower commercial demand account balances. As is typical in a rising rate environment, we continue to experience deposit migration from demand deposits to interest-bearing accounts. Overall, deposit markets have been very competitive, particularly for operational commercial deposits. Despite the environmental pressures, we believe we have an opportunity to steadily grow the consumer book, leveraging our recent success in analytical driven direct marketing. In addition, over the long term our decision to open new branches in high growth markets will enable our retail franchise to support a higher deposit growth rate. From a profitability perspective, these new branches will be more efficient as they will be highly automated, smaller in size, and require lower staffing levels than the branches we are planning to close.  Taxable equivalent net interest income of $1.024 billion was up $25 million or 3% from the first quarter, reflecting higher short-term market rates, a higher day count, and growth in middle market C&I loans. The NIM increased three basis points from the first quarter to 3.21% and has expanded 20 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The sequential improvement was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates and growth in higher yielding commercial loans, partially offset by a higher day count and incremental commercial deposit pricing pressure, as I mentioned earlier. Our cumulative beta leading up to the June 2018 Fed hike was 29%, with consumer in the low 20s and commercial in the high 40s. The March rate hike resulted in a beta of approximately 45%, and we expect the June rate increase to result in a beta of approximately 50%. We expect incremental increases in deposit betas with additional future rate hikes. The NIM in the third quarter of 2018 should be flat from the second quarter despite a two basis point negative impact of day count. We expect full year 2018 NIM to be between 3.2 and 3.22%, including the impact of a September rate hike. The slight change in our outlook from last quarter reflects the expectation of increased deposit betas. Embedded in our forecast is about a 10 basis point increase in interest-bearing deposit rates in each of the next two quarters. We expect our third quarter net interest income to be up approximately between 1 and 2% sequentially to $1.04 billion, which is largely a function of expected commercial loan growth and day count. For the full year of 2018, we currently expect NII to grow by 7% from the adjusted 2017 NII to approximately $4.12 billion.  Excluding the impact of the non-core items, non-interest income in the second quarter increased 3% sequentially. The improvement was driven by a record quarter in corporate banking revenue and solid growth in card and processing revenue, partially offset by a seasonal decrease in wealth and asset management revenues. Mortgage banking net revenue of $53 million was down $3 million sequentially. Originations of $2.1 billion were 35% higher than the first quarter, but the second quarter gain on sale margin at 166 basis points was tighter than we expected and 23 basis points lower compared to the first quarter. We expect margins to continue to be tight during the remainder of the year. During the quarter, approximately 75% of our origination mix consisted of purchase volume, with two-thirds of our originations sourced from retail and direct channels and the remainder through the correspondent channel.  Sequential growth in corporate banking revenue of $32 million or 36% exceeded our previous guidance of a 20 to 25% increase. The improvement was primarily driven by strong broad-based capital markets revenue growth led by corporate bond fees and loan syndication revenue. With the roll-out of the North Star initiatives, we believe we have the right long-term strategies in place to generate sustainably higher growth in corporate banking revenue in the future. Our solid pipeline of deals as well as the impact of the strategic investments in acquisitions should help us generate corporate banking fees between $110 million and $120 million in the third quarter, even as it tends to be a slower quarter in the capital markets, and of course subject to market conditions. Deposit service charges remained unchanged from the first quarter. Card and processing revenue was up 6% sequentially, reflecting seasonally higher credit and debit transaction volume partly offset by higher rewards expense. Results in our credit card business reflect the benefit of continued investments in card analytics driving faster growth compared to the industry.  Total wealth and asset management revenue of $108 million was down 4% sequentially, primarily driven by seasonally strong tax-related private client service revenue in the previous quarter. Year-over-year growth in wealth management was 5%.  For the third quarter of 2018, we expect fees to be about $600 million or up approximately 6% from adjusted non-interest income in the second quarter. For the full year of 2018, we continue to expect fees to be approximately $2.35 billion. We remain focused on disciplined expense management while continuing to invest for revenue growth. Reported non-interest expenses decreased 1% sequentially. Excluding the one-time items recognized in both quarters, expenses were down 3% and lower than our guidance for a 2% decline. Third quarter expenses are expected to be down another 1% from the reported second quarter level even though we expect to invest more in marketing to support household growth. Our direct marketing efforts have been very successful and have driven year-over-year household growth of 4%, generating IRR significantly higher than even our most optimistic assumptions. Leveraging this success, particularly in our high growth southeastern markets, we will continue to invest in additional marketing efforts. Close to 1% of our expense growth in 2018 is expected to come from the increase in our marketing budget. In addition to higher marketing expense, we also expect to have higher incentive compensation expense directly tied to performance and elevated business activity. This increase in marketing expense should be partly offset by reduced compensation expenses related to the headcount reduction. This dynamic reflects our desire to achieve expense saves to invest in revenue growth opportunities in all business lines. The reduction in compensation expenses will start impacting our run rate in the third quarter, with a greater impact in the fourth quarter and beyond. At this time, our expense guidance range for 2018 remains the same as last quarter, adjusting for the non-core items disclosed in our earnings release. Our adjusted efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 63%. Excluding the low income housing amortization expense which all peers reflect in their tax line, our efficiency ratio was 60%. We expect our efficiency ratio to continue to decline in the second half of this year. For the full year of 2018, we expect it to be slightly above 60% excluding the impact of low income housing amortization expense. Of course in 2020 and beyond, the combination of the North Star outlook and the MB Financial acquisition significantly changes the direction of our efficiency ratio. Wrapping up the expense and revenue discussions, I want to reiterate that we expect to achieve positive operating leverage for the year as well as for the last two quarters of the year. Second quarter credit results continued to follow a positive trend, reflecting the impact of deliberate actions that we executed to reduce high risk exposures during the past two years and an ongoing emphasis on disciplined client selection as a credit risk management tool. The criticized assets ratio, a key leading indicator of credit quality, continued to improve. At the end of the second quarter, criticized assets declined $562 million sequentially, with the criticized asset ratio decreasing to 3.87% from 4.83% last quarter, its lowest level in almost 20 years.  Net charge-offs were $94 million or 41 basis points, up five basis points from the first quarter of 2018 and up 13 basis points from last year. Commercial charge-offs were 34 basis points, up 13 basis points from the first quarter and up 17 basis points year-over-year. Consumer net charge-offs of 52 basis points were down 8 basis points sequentially and were up 6 basis points year-over-year. Total portfolio non-performing loans and leases were $437 million, down 28% from last year and down 3% from the previous quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a 35% decline in C&I NPLs. As a result of the historically low criticized assets and low level of NPLs, the reserve ratio declined 7 basis points to 1.17%.  As we remind you every quarter, the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook. We nevertheless caution that we could potentially experience some upward pressure in the future as we are generally in a very benign credit environment. Having said that, for the second half of the year, we expect both our charge-off ratios and dollar charge-offs to be below the first half numbers. Capital levels remained very strong during the second quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.9%, up 9 basis points sequentially, reflecting the partial sale of our remaining Worldpay stake. Our tangible common equity ratio excluding unrealized gains and losses increased 19 basis points from last quarter to 9.33%. During the quarter, we initiated and settled a $235 million share repurchase which concluded our 2017 CCAR plan. We also raised our common dividend by $0.02 during the quarter to $0.18 per share. As Greg mentioned, we are very pleased with the CCAR 2018 results, including our ability to continue to return capital to shareholders under our original CCAR submission while we resubmit our capital plan to include MB\u2019s results. At this time, we are waiting to hear from the Fed regarding the details associated with the resubmission process. Our near term and long term capital targets remain the same as before.  At the end of the second quarter, common shares outstanding were down almost 7 million shares, or 1% compared to the first quarter, and down 61 million shares or 8% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. Book value and tangible book value were up 8% and 7% from last year respectively. With respect to taxes, our second quarter rate of 15.5% was impacted by the Worldpay gain and other items disclosed in our release. Excluding these items, our tax rate was approximately 13.3%. We expect our tax rate for the full year to be in the 16 to 16.5% range. Excluding the items that are specific to 2018, we would expect our long term tax rate to be in the 15.5 to 16% range. Slide 13 provides an update on the primary North Star focus areas we discussed at investor day, our progress in implementing those initiatives and the remaining work we have left to do between now and the end of 2018. As Greg discussed previously, we expect to be substantially complete with the work prior to the acquisition closing and conversion. In fact, as you heard from him earlier, we have already begun to see substantial benefits from implementing several of these initiatives across middle market loans, capital markets, credit card analytics, and credit quality improvements.  Recall that last quarter, we revised our fourth quarter of 2019 ROA and ROTCE targets to reflect our confidence in retaining the vast majority of the benefits from the 2018 tax legislation. During our announcement of the MB acquisition, we further raised our fourth quarter of 2019 target to reflect the expected impact of the additional cost reduction initiatives we announced on our last earnings call. The completion of the remaining North Star implementation work this year aligns well with the timing of the MB Financial integration. One of our key strengths as an organization is the ability to execute against our goals, as we have demonstrated over the last two and a half years. Given the number of items in our line of sight that are expected to positively impact our results over the next two years, including the MB acquisition, we simplified our financial targets to provide guidance for the full year of 2020. We believe this will provide the most appropriate and informative view of our expected outcomes from all activities. Based on our current forecast and given the assumption that the MB merger closes in the early part of 2019, we expect to achieve an ROTCE of 18%-plus and ROE between 1.55 and 1.65%, and an efficiency ratio in the low 50s range excluding the LIH expense for the full year of 2020.  Slide 14 provides more detail on the expected financial benefits of additional actions I touched on briefly. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, we are implementing a comprehensive plan to redesign our retail branch network by reallocating our resources to higher growth markets. Utilizing the results of our proprietary technology to assess the health of our branch network across thousands of dimensions, we plan to open 100 to 125 branches predominantly in the southeast and close 100 to 125 branches within our midwest footprint, excluding MB, over the next 36 months. We expect that these actions will enable us to preserve the profitability of our retail franchise in the north and invest in the southeast for higher household revenue and deposit growth. During the quarter, we reduced headcount primarily in the back office and staff areas. We expect these actions to result in an approximately $80 million pre-tax reduction in annualized compensation expenses. We are also evaluating additional expense saves in the procurement area and are using a third party consulting firm to help during this process. We hope to share the results with you later this quarter. Combining the reduction in compensation and the work in procurement, as well as other ongoing efforts, we expect to achieve expense efficiencies of between $100 million to $125 million on an annualized basis when fully implemented. As I mentioned earlier, we intend to reinvest a portion of these savings in marketing to boost our household and revenue growth opportunities. We expect our forward-looking guidance on revenues to reflect these benefits. The impact of all of these actions are all incorporated into our 2019 and 2020 performance targets. As expected, the composition of expense savings and new investments change with the market conditions and new capabilities as we develop them, but we intend to keep all of our targets at the levels we previously forecasted or better going forward. Now that we\u2019ve discussed our update on North Star, I want to spend a few minutes reviewing our recently announced acquisition of MB Financial with a focus on updates since the call in May. As Greg mentioned, this transaction adds significant value to our shareholders. We remain very confident in our ability to reduce expenses by $255 million, reflecting the in-market nature of the acquisition. When we announced the transaction, we discussed several expected financial metrics without assuming any revenue synergies. With revenue synergies included, the economics of the transaction become even more compelling. We estimate that by the third year of the acquisition, we can drive incremental annual pre-tax income of $60 million to $75 million based on these synergies. We plan to leverage MB\u2019s expertise in national asset-based lending and leasing through our footprint with a focus on middle market companies. We believe we can also generate additional benefits from utilizing our larger balance sheet and leveraging our capital market capabilities across MB\u2019s customer base. The impact of these additional opportunities on deal economics is substantial, as Greg mentioned previously. Post-announcement, we have continued to make steady progress towards completing the transaction. We have focused on finalizing the structure of the management team and organization post-close, developing integration teams and retaining employees and customers. We believe we have very complementary capabilities and plan to adopt a blended approach with best practices from both organizations. In summary, I would like to reiterate a few points. We reported strong financial results for the quarter and the benefits of North Star are becoming more apparent in our performance. We shared our progress on North Star and remain on track to substantially complete the initiatives by the end of this year. This timeline aligns well with the start of the MB integration work after the transaction closes. The economics of the MB acquisition are compelling even without revenue synergies, but we shared expectations for revenue synergies with you today to provide a more complete picture of the economic benefits of the deal. In addition, we took additional measures to reduce costs and generate significant annual savings. Today, we also announced another step towards optimizing our branch network.  Over the last two and a half years, we have communicated what we intended to achieve, set a timeline for implementation, and executed very effectively on those plans. We expect to continue to do so and are confident in achieving our financial and strategic objectives.  With that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A. Sameer Gokhale : Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question and answer session, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator.  Caitlin, please open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It kind of feels as if there are a couple of changes on the outlook, the reference to expenses being at the low end of the 4.0 to 4.1 is gone, then the net interest income outlook is a bit lower. I know you touched on some of that in the prepared remarks, but can you just summarize in a nutshell what\u2019s behind those changes, what\u2019 s changed since the last time you spoke on this? Tayfun Tuzun : Sure, let me start with the expenses, Geoffrey. As we have disclosed, we\u2019ve taken a couple of actions this quarter on headcount reduction. I think you will probably see the full impact of that in the fourth quarter, and obviously we said it has an $80 million impact on a full year run rate basis, and we will see that obviously in 2019. But at the same time, we have increased our investments in marketing. We are seeing very good results in our retail business. We are also allocating a little bit more money into credit cards and marketing. These are direct marketing actions that we\u2019ve been developing internally with heavy analytical content, and it\u2019s impacting our household growth relative to the industry, fairly significantly, so we decided to push that button a little bit harder for future revenue growth.  The procurement savings are--the study is going on. That probably is also going to have a broader impact in 2019, and then relative to our performance, the activity levels, as you\u2019ve heard from us, in loan production and capital markets is quite high, and the compensation expense for this year is a little bit higher than before, so that all resulted in us keeping the same range. But you know we are very focused on expense management and will continue to make sure that the progress there is in line with revenue growth elsewhere. In terms of NII, obviously we\u2019ve changed our outlook slightly, and most of that is due to the competition in deposit markets, the little bit higher rate, the commercial deposit markets, the migration from DDA to the interest-bearing accounts as well as just in terms of the rates paid is a little stronger, so we reflected that in our outlook and that impacted NII. Mortgage continues to be a tough one, the portfolio growth numbers there, so that impacted the numbers as well. Is there anything else, Jamie, that you want to add? Jamie Leonard : Maybe the only other factor, Geoffrey, is that the forecast does include some of the funding activity for the MB acquisition now post-announcement, which was May 21, so there are some funding costs in there. Tayfun Tuzun : Also related to MB, they\u2019re not much, but there are some trickling costs associated with the MB transaction, whether it\u2019s in legal, etc., so that\u2019s also impacting the expenses a little bit this year. Geoffrey Elliott : Thanks. Just following up on the NII side, you\u2019ve got 3% commercial loan growth baked in for 3Q18. That feels like quite a bit pick-up in pace. What gives you confidence that you\u2019re able to deliver there and not kind of struggle on the NII side because you\u2019re not getting the commercial loan growth you were hoping for? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, so one technical comment and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Lars for him to comment on activity. Our loan growth towards the end of the quarter was a bit weaker because we had pay-offs that really happened at the end of the quarter, so obviously the growth in Q3 will be on that weaker ending balance for Q2. But besides that, obviously, we\u2019re seeing good activity. Lars, you want to comment on the state of business there? Lars Anderson : Yes, to your point, the end of period was substantially impacted by two things. One, we had a very active and constructive capital markets that allowed us to leverage the investments we\u2019ve made in our platform in investment banking and, frankly, monetize that, and that\u2019s part of what helped us lead to a really exceptional capital markets quarter But let me remind you, we had a record quarter of production in corporate banking, we had a record quarter of growth in middle market outstandings, one of the highest production quarters that we\u2019ve had in years in middle market banking. Our pipelines continue to be very strong. I think a lot of the economic environment, the tax reform and other geopolitical issues are very positive and have positioned us very well.  As I look at the third quarter as well as the second half of the year, I think we\u2019re very well positioned. We selected industries, geographies, we\u2019ve recruited talent and, frankly, have positioned ourselves, I think to accelerate our growth into the third quarter and beyond. I have a high level of confidence that we will be able to deliver, albeit the macroeconomic environment will need to cooperate. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, good morning guys. Tayfun, can you share with us, you look at your demand deposits, and this is similar to your peers, it\u2019s not just you folks seeing lower demand deposits on a year-over-year basis. Today they represent about 31.6% of total deposits. Why do you think--if we get to a normalized rate environment, say by the end of \u201919 Fed funds is 3%, where do demand deposits go as a percentage of total deposits? Where do they bottom out? Tayfun Tuzun : Hard to tell, Gerard, because a lot of that also depends on your activity on the treasury management side and your ability to take market share in treasury management, which some of our newly introduced products will help us to achieve. There will probably be still continued migration on the commercial side more so, obviously, from demand to interest checking. Jamie, any comments there? Jamie Leonard : Yes Gerard, I would say that the DDA migration we experienced in the second quarter was perhaps more elevated than what we\u2019ll see the rest of this year, in part because we did increase our earnings credits rates during the quarter, so the beta on the ECR was about 45%, so that allowed and created excess liquidity for our customers that permitted them to pursue alternative investment options to help generate better income for those companies. That was predominantly in the large corporate and mid-corporate space, and with that adjustment in our managed rates during the quarter, we feel really good about where our ECs are positioned competitively, so I would expect the migration to slow a bit as the Fed continues to raise rates. But to Tayfun\u2019s point, if the Fed continues to raise rates and we get to a 3% terminal Fed funds rate, then certainly the DDA as a percent of the total will continue to go down, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see that type of compression that we\u2019ve experienced in the past year. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Then in the expansion into the new markets with the 100 to 125 branches over the next 36 months, can you guys talk to us on the proprietary technology you mentioned? What gives you the advantage over--obviously you\u2019re going into markets that are going to be very competitive with other banks. What edge do you think you\u2019ll have to be able to maybe garner some market share at the expense of others? Greg Carmichael : Gerard, this is Greg. First off, on the geosciences front, some of the advancements that we\u2019ve made in that area that we were recognized for, they do a great job of really assessing the market opportunities, where best to locate that branch based on business opportunities, consumer growth, directional trends, competition and so forth. It\u2019s a very advanced model, so that gives us a high level of comfort when we go into these markets where to put those physical branches. The other thing I\u2019ll mention is the branches we\u2019re putting in are very different from the branches we\u2019re closing - much more efficient branches, smaller real estate footprints, smaller square footage of the branch itself, lower staffing levels, and very highly automated when we go into these markets. But if you think about what we\u2019ve accomplished, we solved the Chicago density issue with the MB Financial acquisition. We think a smart way to expand in the southeast is to build on the franchise that we currently have there through a de novo process, so repositioning 100 to 125 branches from higher density legacy markets where we can continue to serve our customers with less branches and reposition them into the southeast. We\u2019re very comfortable we can continue growing households. Tayfun mentioned the marketing spend, increasing market spend. We\u2019ve seen some great results on our investments in marketing. When you look at household growth over the last six quarters, we\u2019ve added net 118,000 new households. Consumer deposits over the last six quarters, I think are up close to $3 billion, so we\u2019ve been very successful. Our preferred banking platform is growing significantly, so we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re able to accomplish. It\u2019s really about repositioning and giving our southeast markets more opportunity to better serve their communities. Gerard Cassidy : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian, Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. I also wanted to get some clarity in terms of your guidance relative to the deal when I compare the slides from the deal presentation and the updated slides today. When I look back at the MBFI deal presentation, you noted 4Q19 North Star targets of 16% ROTCE and ROA of 125 to 135, and you mentioned that you thought that the deal would be 200 basis points enhancing to ROTCE and 12 basis points enhancing to ROA. I\u2019m a little bit confused on a couple of fronts. One, you\u2019re telling us that North Star will be substantially complete by this year and that implies consensus with an ROTCE of 13.8 to an ROA of 1.25. But you did retain your ROTCE target for the combined company and you even increased the ROA range, so I guess I\u2019m wondering what the moving pieces are there. Is the deal going to be really the substantive catalyst to get to this range, and what happened to those 2019 enhanced North Star targets? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, so there is absolutely no change in the way we described the deal, the impact of the deal on our North Star targets. When we made the comment about the North Star initiatives coming to a conclusion here at the end of 2018, that comment was really related to the internal work that is going on to be able to introduce the products and services and also the expense initiatives, but we will see the impact of that effort throughout 2019, basically leading into our end of 2019 North Star target. Assuming that the transaction closes in the early part of 2019, then the full year of 2020 clearly has all the expenses that have been associated with the transaction itself, so that\u2019s it. We\u2019re not changing the impact of the North Star initiatives in terms of their timing, all we\u2019re saying is that the effort to finish the work internally, whether it\u2019s IT, whether it\u2019s organizational design or whatever, are coming to a conclusion. That was the comment. It was not meant to be a comment on financial metrics. Erika Najarian : Got it. As a follow-up question to that, your 2020 targets look better than what we saw during the deal presentation, but the stock is down 5% at the moment. I\u2019m wondering, going back to Geoffrey\u2019s question on the NII guide, it does look like a modest step down in terms of the NII guide, but I think some investor observed that you added a September rate hike. Is the market reading it correctly that you did add a rate hike in there but did downgrade the NII outlook, and therefore the step-down on an apples-to-apples basis is a little bit more severe, and if that\u2019s the case, is that really because of all the pricing dynamics you mentioned during the prepared remarks? Jamie Leonard : Erika, it\u2019s Jamie. We did pull forward in line with market expectation a rate hike that was previously expected in December to September in our current guide, and we did reduce the NII outlook predominantly driven by the commercial deposit migration and cost, but also inclusive of some wholesale funding activities related to the MB acquisition. But yes, you are reading that correctly. The one item I would clarify on our forecast, however, is that we do assume in the third quarter one month LIBOR to Fed funds, or OIS spread, compresses from the 16 or so basis points we experienced in the second quarter down to 8 basis points or so in the third quarter, and that\u2019s a significant assumption that we would obviously do significantly better, given asset sensitivity and the C&I composition of the portfolio being heavily tied to one-month LIBOR. But each basis point of spread there is about a million dollars per quarter, so that is a significant assumption that is also in the outlook. Erika Najarian : Got it. If I could just slip one more in, Jamie, you keep mentioning the wholesale funding impact. Could you give us a sense of what the full-year wholesale funding impact would be as we think about the moving parts of the guidance? Jamie Leonard : I would say of the $30 million or so change in our outlook on NII, I would call it $25 million related to commercial deposits and $5 million related to wholesale funding activities. Erika Najarian : Got it, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning guys. A couple just near-term questions for you. First of all, Tayfun, you talked about the third quarter on the fees, $600 million despite continued weakness in mortgage, and I think you said earlier that\u2019s with an expectation that corporate banking would hang in this $110 million to $120 million zone. Off of a 567, can you just help us understand what the nice lift will be to get you from the second to the third and that $600 million number? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, there is a couple of other line items in corporate. We are forecasting potentially a little bit in private equity gains here in a couple of transactions that we have, and obviously the improvements in--the current success in capital markets will continue, so that\u2019s sort of--there\u2019s a few other items, nothing big significant. We\u2019re expecting pretty decent growth relative to the seasonal changes, so there\u2019s nothing more than that. Ken Usdin : Got it, okay. Then on the expense side also, you mentioned that for the third quarter, just from a starting point perspective, that you\u2019re expecting down 1% from the reported 1037. Are you expecting there to be continued restructuring costs in there and even MBFI-related costs? I would have thought that the core expense number would be coming down more than just 1% off of a GAAP number that you just reported at 1037. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, the MB Financial-related expenses are just trickling down. That is going to probably continue through the remainder of the year. There\u2019s a little bit of an increase in technology expenses into the second half of the year, similar to our guidance before, and then we\u2019re also expecting continued good business activity driving--you know, these strong capital markets and strong origination levels typically result in higher performance comp-related expenses, so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it. We\u2019re expecting since this headcount reduction is going to drive a more run rate number for the fourth quarter, we\u2019re expecting that to be a little bit more stronger in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, and then as I mentioned before, the marketing expenses clearly are going to drive the quarter-over-quarter change. We will be seeing a fairly sizeable increase in our third quarter marketing expense relative to the second quarter marketing expense. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. One last one, just on the incremental $100 million or so of savings. You mentioned spending part of it on all these initiatives that you continue to have. Can you help us understand, is that this continuous improvement type of thing, where you save another 100, you spend another 100? How are you expecting the Fifth Third legacy expense base to traject past 2018, I guess? Tayfun Tuzun : We clearly are intending to achieve efficiencies through those cost savings. We\u2019re not going to use those entire savings in order to invest in the business. Our guidance of an efficiency ratio in the lower 50s in 2020 clearly shows that we intend to maintain a good chunk of those expense saves as our bottom line. Even excluding the MB transaction, we are expecting a pretty decent move in our efficiency ratio, which leads to the conclusion that we intend to keep a good amount of these savings. The other thing that I think needs to be realized is these investments in marketing are going to have an impact on revenue growth going forward, which obviously also positively impacts our efficiency ratio. Ken Usdin : Yes, that\u2019s fair. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I wanted to follow up on just the last line of conversation. As we think about expense growth in 2019 and 2020 for Fifth Third standalone, I realize we won\u2019t see the numbers because of the deal, but obviously there is some upfronting of the investment this year, there is some cost saves coming in. You are coming off of what will be a pretty high expense growth this year, so I was hoping maybe you could shed some light on what you think the standalone trajectory of expense growth will be at Fifth Third over the next year or two. Tayfun Tuzun : I think you are right that when you look at the expenses this year with all the investment back into the company, we have seen a little bit higher expenses. We anticipate that our 2019 expense growth will be definitely below the levels that you\u2019re seeing in 2018, and we would hope that it would be meaningfully so. The year-over-year change in total compensation expense of $80 million is close to a 2% number on our total expense base off of this year, so those types of actions are intended to slow down expense growth moving into 2019 and 2020, even before you take into account the expense saves associated with MB Financial.  It is a little bit too early to provide guidance for expenses in 2019, but as a management team, we are extremely focused in achieving a significantly lower expense growth in 2019. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, because if you take the 4 to 5% expense growth you\u2019re looking for this year, layer in the synergies or cost saves that you\u2019ve talked about, it kind of will get you into maybe that 2, 3% if they all fall to the bottom line, which I think would be both more reasonable and well received, so any further color on that down the road, I think would be helpful. Separately, you laid down some revenue synergies related to leveraging the MBFI franchise. What about potential loan run-off? I mean, they\u2019re quite large in commercial real estate, has some multi-family, has some indirect consumer that you guys haven\u2019t really done in the past. I guess you could argue either that could be synergies to you guys or there might be some right-sizing of that acquired book to align to your underwriting and strategy. Jamie Leonard : Matt, it\u2019s Jamie. I think a good way to think of the revenue synergies is that it\u2019s inclusive of customer attrition, just normal branch closure type of activity. When it comes to the actual loan book coming over, through due diligence and through the last two months of efforts since the deal\u2019s been announced, we\u2019re comfortable with the indirect portfolio that they have coming over and maintaining, but our revenue synergies don\u2019t assume any significant changes to that book of business. The revenue synergies that are outlined on Slide 15, the first two categories really highlight what MB brings to the table in terms of our ability to link and leverage their products and experience, predominantly in the business banking and ABL and leasing, whereas the next three categories are more of what Fifth Third brings to the table. We just wanted to frame up where we see the opportunities on the combined business, and we\u2019re confident in our ability to drive those synergies. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding the MBFI deal, I know you indicated so far a minimal disruption in the deal. Regarding the banker lock-ups, I know it was asked about on the deal call and Mitch Feiger was--you know, it was unclear if Mitch was indicating that there was definite lock-ups or not. Were key bankers locked up, and can you give us a little bit of detail around that? Thank you. Greg Carmichael : This is Greg. I\u2019m really pleased--as we get further into this transaction and discussions with MB Financial, we were extremely pleased with the talent that they have and our ability to bring together the best in class in our Chicago market, so part of the retention of these bankers starts with the leadership and our model in the Chicago market and how we\u2019re going to run that business, starting with Mitch as the CEO of that business going forward. The senior commercial middle market banker from MB Financial will lead that market for us, so it starts from a retention perspective to find the leadership team, which we\u2019ve done, and communicate out how we\u2019re going to operate in that market. Also, the combined opportunities when we bring these two franchises together that can be leveraged across the market and the advanced capabilities we have in capital markets and so forth with our customer base, the capabilities to leverage their ABL and equipment financing in our core middle market on a national level, those things when you put it together are extremely attractive, I believe to the MB Financial team and to the Fifth Third team. So the environment that we\u2019re creating in best in class to better serve our customers there and give our sales people and our teams more resources to offer into the marketplace, so that\u2019s going very well. In addition to that, in key situations we have provided lock downs for those individuals through the transition and beyond to make sure that we have the right talent in place to lead the organization. But once again, I want to stress the key thing is our business model and combined best of breed talent in that marketplace, as I mentioned, a significant portion of the current MB Financial team will be in place from the combined perspective when we close this deal in a leadership role, so I think net-net we feel real comfortable. We haven\u2019t really seen any concerns in that area yet. We\u2019ve worked hard to get that right, we\u2019ve worked to communicate effectively to all the MB Financial employees, as well as our own Chicago employees, which is extremely important, and we\u2019ve done a nice job, I think. Mitch and his team have done a fantastic job of really putting their arms around the customer base. John Pancari : Okay, got it. Thanks Greg. Then on the large corporate side, you mentioned the record corporate banking activity and originations that you\u2019re seeing. What are the yields that you\u2019re seeing, new money yields on your corporate paper that you\u2019re bringing onto the balance sheet, and then separately, what\u2019s the total size of your shared national credit balance as of June 30? Thanks. Lars Anderson : Yes, a couple things there. First of all, what we\u2019re seeing in the corporate banking space is extremely aggressive - there\u2019s no question about it, so we\u2019re needing to be very selective. We shared with you our industry verticals, the new industry verticals which we have introduced where we tend to get outsized returns. We\u2019re not just looking at it from a credit perspective, we look at it from a total relationship perspective - that\u2019s our strategy, but I would tell you that largely the commercial originations that we\u2019re seeing today, while they are under some pressure, largely reflect our overall portfolio that we have at our company. What we are being able to execute on, again getting back to relationship, is we told you we were going to make North Star investments in capital markets and other capabilities. We\u2019re leveraging those successfully into that corporate banking space specifically. That\u2019s helping to drive a record level, not just corporate lending activities but also capital market activities for our company. Tayfun Tuzun : In terms of the coupon, John, it\u2019s sort of between 4 and 4.5% in terms of production, so they are fairly close to where the portfolio yields are. Lars Anderson : Correct. Jamie Leonard : John, the other question you had was the shared national credit balance. Our balance is actually down a couple billion over the last several quarters. It\u2019s roughly $26 billion to date, and again as Lars said, the vast preponderance of those credits are tied to deep relationships and not credit only. We feel very good about it. From an asset quality perspective, the shared national credit portfolio has less than 3% criticized assets and continues to perform exceptionally well, and it diversifies our portfolio across the enterprise. Lars Anderson : Yes, one thing I would just add to that is the single largest driver of our commercial loan growth this quarter was core middle market, it was not corporate banking growth. John Pancari : Got it, okay. And that SNC balance, that\u2019s based on the newer definition, correct? Jamie Leonard : Correct. John Pancari : Got it. All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. One quick question on just the profitability program you guys detailed this morning. Tayfun, I think you guys had said total $100 million to 125 million in cost savings, although Greg you had mentioned some of the procurement stuff you guys would detail through the quarter. That latter procurement stuff, that\u2019s already included in the $100 million to $125 million, right? Tayfun Tuzun : That\u2019s correct, yes. Scott Siefers : Okay, so there\u2019s no new dollar amount coming out in the next 90 days or anything? Tayfun Tuzun : No, that\u2019s correct. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Then I just want to get back to the new 2020 targets for a second, I just want to make sure I\u2019m clear, because I think I still don\u2019t understand exactly what has changed from the enhanced targets back when you announced the MBFI transaction. I guess as I look at it, the standalone outlook is a bit weaker, but we have the additional profitability program you guys detailed this morning, and then you guys had also detailed the revenue enhancements from MBFI. Are those the three changes that have taken place since-- Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, with respect to the current year numbers, Scott, some of these are obviously a little bit elevated on an annual basis for 2018, so some of the incentive comp numbers, etc., are a little bit elevated beyond what the normal run rates would be. These are not all negatives as we look into 2019 and 2020. It\u2019s important to consider that. Also in terms of year-over-year expense growth, when I was answering a previous question, the expense growth expectations into 2019 are clearly going to be below what we have here in 2018, and then revenue growth associated with both North Star initiatives and other investments, those are all baking into our performance targets for the end of next year and into 2020. Scott Siefers : Okay. Tayfun Tuzun : So all of these are--I mean, I think we\u2019ve been consistently raising these targets as we see our performance moving up, whether it\u2019s due to some environmental factors such as tax rates or higher expectations on other efforts, and then now plus MB we are moving onto that 18-plus range in return on tangible capital, and then we\u2019re raising our ROA guidance along those expectations. Scott Siefers : Yes, okay. All right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. Could you elaborate more on the increase in marketing? I think you said it related to credit cards, but why now and which markets, and does that tie into your expansion strategy in the southeast? Can you just confirm your expansion strategy in the southeast is more commercial than consumer, or maybe it\u2019s consumer too? Just shed more light on that if you could. Tayfun Tuzun : One comment on the marketing - a large majority of the marketing spend, Mike, is related to the retail deposit household growth. There is a portion that goes into credit cards, but a significant amount of those dollars actually are intended to generate retail consumer deposits and household growth. Greg Carmichael : The only thing I would add to Tayfun\u2019s comment there is we\u2019ve been very successful, Mike, as we alluded to, growing households and it\u2019s really across not just our legacy footprint but also in our high growth markets in the southeast. We\u2019ve been very successful. We measure everything here, as you know, and when you look at the advanced analytics we\u2019ve put in place and learning how best to market our opportunities and where we\u2019ll get the best returns, we\u2019ve tested that over the last year plus. It\u2019s worked extremely well, and there\u2019s a bigger ask there because there\u2019s a bigger outcome there and opportunity for us. So we\u2019ve decided to invest some resources, additional resources than planned to continue marketing at a higher level, given the success rate that we\u2019ve already had, and you\u2019re seeing that in our consumer deposit growth we\u2019ve had over the last six quarters, as I mentioned earlier, and our household growth and especially our preferred banking platform, in the customer acceptance of that platform and what we\u2019re seeing there from a growth perspective, so that\u2019s positive. When we talk about repositioning in the southeast, obviously we\u2019re going to continue to invest in our commercial business, especially core middle market. It\u2019s extremely important to us, and we\u2019re seeing, as Tayfun mentioned and then Lars reiterated, we\u2019re seeing record performance in loan originations across our footprint, but especially in those markets also. But the investments we\u2019re going to make to reposition our branch network is just thoughtful thinking about how best to serve our customers and grow our business, and as you know, coming out of the crisis we hadn\u2019t invested heavily into those higher growth southeast markets coming off of some acquisitions. We think the smart way of growing that is being additive to those markets, using some of the advanced analytics that we have to place those branches, a much smaller footprint of branch, a higher automated branch, a lower cost branch in those markets to better serve the consumer-based customers there, and the business banking customers. Mike Mayo : When you say those markets in the southeast, which specific markets? Greg Carmichael : Obviously the Carolinas, the Georgia, Atlanta area, northern wedge. You\u2019ve got to look at Tennessee and Nashville in particular, parts of Florida are where the opportunities sit for us. Mike Mayo : So this is de novo branch expansion in states where you don\u2019t have currently branches, except for Florida? Greg Carmichael : No, we have branches in all those areas I mentioned before, we\u2019re just once again not the level of density that we need, I think to better serve that market and create more leverage of our products and services and marketing spend in those markets. So it just goes back to markets like Nashville, there\u2019s additional branches necessary in Nashville. If you look at Atlanta, once again the northern wedge of Atlanta, we\u2019ve got 38, 40 branches there. There\u2019s more needed to support those communities, so it\u2019s just being thoughtful how best to grow in those markets from a retail perspective and a business baking perspective is what we\u2019re looking at. Mike Mayo : Last question on that. Longer term, over three to five years, how much larger would you like consumer to be in the southeast? Greg Carmichael : Well I\u2019d tell you, from a growth perspective--how are you measuring that growth, Mike? When you say how much larger, from a deposit perspective? Mike Mayo : Consumer revenues, consumer deposits. I mean, are we thinking about doubling the share there, reallocating capital to grow-- Greg Carmichael : We would like to grow significantly. I think we can grow significantly in those markets and take market share in the southeast markets, based on the teams we have in place, our capabilities, and what we\u2019ve seen with some of the advancements that we\u2019ve made, our marketing capabilities, and the products and services that we offer. So we think we can take share, we can even grow the deposit base at a disproportionate level than our legacy markets, and we think we\u2019re well positioned to do that. We\u2019ve just got to be smart about how we add to it, but it\u2019s really going to be a balanced mix. Lars Anderson : Maybe, Mike, one data point to help frame up the size of the opportunity in the southeast. We have roughly 300 financial centers in the southeast today that average about $35 million per branch in consumer deposits. The rest of our franchise, or if you look at the midwest, we have almost 900 branches and they average about $53 million in average deposits per branch, so it highlights the weakness of the network, the overall network in the southeast and what that opportunity might look like when you\u2019re finished building out the network and what that consumer deposit book could grow to. Tayfun Tuzun : In terms of the sort of--if you look at it from a branch growth perspective, you\u2019re looking at growing the branches in the key south markets by approximately 35 to 40%, so that\u2019s the next two, three years worth of expansion. Mike Mayo : Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Your line is open. Christopher Marinac : Thanks, good morning. As you expand in the southeast with the new branches, to what extent does that influence the deposit beta? Do you have rate specials embedded as you execute these? Tayfun Tuzun : Chris, you have to realize that we\u2019re talking about a two to three-year expansion, so at this point I think the expansion itself is not going to have an impact in this rate environment. We will update that for you as this continues, because obviously unlike branch closings, branch openings take a little bit longer, so let us wait and see how that process goes before we show you an impact on deposits. Christopher Marinac : Sounds good, Tayfun. Thank you. Do you expect any change on LCR as these next couple quarters unfold? Jamie Leonard : Are you asking from a regulatory standpoint or from Fifth Third specifically? Christopher Marinac : Well really both, but I guess regulatory first would be great. Tayfun Tuzun : Well, Randy Quarles\u2019 comments yesterday obviously have received some attention. We\u2019re just going to have to wait and see whether there are any changes associated with LCR. Within his comments, he appeared to refer to liquidity measures. We\u2019re just going to have to wait and see. Jamie Leonard : And for Fifth Third specifically, the one item that you saw in the quarter is the LCR did increase as we begin to position the portfolio to greater allocation to level 1s as we prepare for MB\u2019s balance sheet to come over, which at the deal announcement we said there would be some LCR dilution from the composition of their investment securities portfolio, so we will continue to migrate ours a little bit higher in advance of a first quarter close. Christopher Marinac : Sounds great, Jamie. Thank you very much, guys, appreciate it. Sameer Gokhale : Okay, well thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department, and we would be happy to assist you. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Please also review the cautionary language contained in our earnings release and related presentations concerning important additional information regarding this merger and where to find it. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference during today\u2019s conference call are included in our earnings release and related presentation, along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures.  This morning, I\u2019m joined on our call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer Frank Forrest, and Treasurer Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2018 net income available to common shareholders of $418 million and earnings of $0.61 per share. Included in these results are two items which had a negative impact of $0.03 on reported EPS. Excluding these items, core earnings were $0.64 per share in the third quarter. Our financial results for the quarter were strong and reflected our focus on generating profitable growth, strengthening our balance sheet, and maintaining our expense discipline. I am pleased that we are continuing to realize the benefits of several initiatives we implemented under Project North Star. Before I revisit our key strategic priorities and highlights for the quarter, I\u2019d like to make a few observations about the macroeconomic environment.  The economic backdrop remains generally strong. Consumers are benefiting from a strong labor market with the lowest unemployment rate in almost 50 years and healthy wage growth. These factors have helped drive increased consumer spending and positive consumer sentiment; in fact, consumer confidence among lower income Americans is at the highest level since 2000. In our core commercial business, our clients continue to see the benefits of lower taxes and deregulation, but the imposition of tariffs and escalating rhetoric with China has created uncertainty for our commercial customers. We are optimistic that the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada will help alleviate some of this geopolitical uncertainty.  In addition to the developments in international trade, we are closely monitoring corporate debt levels. Higher leverage borrowers outside the traditional banking sector may experience difficulties as the Fed continues to raise interest rates. These issues could have a spillover effect that may negatively impact economic growth. While the overall economic backdrop remains supportive of future growth, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious. We will continue to maintain our disciplined focus on credit quality and profitability. Moving on to our strategic priorities, at Fifth Third we are focused on three key priorities. They are designed to enhance revenue growth as well as achieve expense efficiencies. Executing on these initiatives will enable us to achieve our financial and strategic objectives as we have previously communicated. First, we are focused on completing the implementation of our remaining North Star initiatives. We announced North Star in late 2016 along with the financial targets that we expect to achieve after completing the program. As we have said previously, the vast majority of the projects will be completed by the end of this year with results fully realized by year-end 2019. There are a few areas of work remaining to be completed this year but we are very pleased with our overall progress. We believe that our strong results again this quarter indicate that we are on track to achieve our objectives under Project North Star. Our next party is to successfully complete the MB Financial transaction. With the North Star implementation work behind us in 2018, we can focus on ensuring that the integration of MB proceeds smoothly. We remain confident in our ability to realize the expected expense and revenue synergies which we have previously communicated. We were pleased that the MB common shareholders recently voted to approve the transaction. We continue to expect to be able to close in the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we recently re-submitted our CCAR plan to our regulators with the pro forma impact of the acquisition. We expect to receive feedback by the end of the year. In the meantime, our capital distribution activities should remain consistent with the plan originally submitted in April of 2018.  The completion of the MB transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. As Tayfun will mention in his remarks, everything is progressing as expected. Our third party is to pursue profitable organic growth opportunities in our key businesses. In addition to our branch network optimization initiative to drive improved household deposit and revenue growth across our retail footprint, we are also prioritizing organic growth opportunities across all areas of the franchise. For instance, we continue to assess opportunities in high growth markets where we can combine strong talent with local market knowledge and our enhanced product capabilities to successfully grow the portfolio. Additionally, we are continuing to add to our sales force in wealth and asset management, treasury management, and the capital markets business. Moving on to the key highlights for the third quarter, I would like to review some key aspects of the results and then Tayfun will discuss the quarter in greater detail. First, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. As you may recall, one of our key objectives in Project North Star was to appropriately balance risk and return in order to outperform through the credit cycle. We are very pleased with the progress we have made. Our key forward looking credit metrics continue to improve as criticized loans were at the lowest level in nearly 20 years and non-performing assets are at the lowest level since before the crisis. We have also focused on originating loans more selectively, again enhancing resiliency of our balance sheet. While we have maintained strong underwriting standards, our loan yield and net interest margin have continued to expand. We believe our strong credit profile will allow us to outperform our peers through cycles and return more capital to shareholders over time. Also, we continue to successfully generate profitable relationship growth. Despite challenging market conditions, we generated solid loan, deposit and household growth during the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, we grew C&I loans by 4%, deposits by 3%, and households by 4%. Additionally, our wealth and asset management group has successfully generated positive inflows every quarter this year, on track for a record year both in terms of AUM and total revenue.  Furthermore, we continue to diligently manage our expenses. Our expenses declined 3% from the prior quarter with headcount down 4%. I want to reiterate our expectations for core expense growth of only 1% in 2019 as we continue to drive positive operating leverage. Our focus on growing profitable relationships and diligently managing our expenses has led to a 9% increase in our forward PPNR compared to the third quarter of last year.  Our results show we remain on track to achieve our enhanced North Star financial targets. In the third quarter, we generated a core return on tangible common equity of 14%, a core return on assets of 1.26%, and a core efficiency ratio excluding the impact of low income housing expense of 59%. I would like to once again thank our employees for their hard work and dedication and for always keeping the customer at the center, which is evident in our financial results.  I would also like to thank our employees, the Cincinnati Police Department, first responders and many others for their efforts during and after the tragic event at our headquarters in early September. It has been remarkably humbling to witness how our company has come together over the past month and a half to deal with this tragedy.  With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let\u2019s move to the financial highlights on Slide 4 of the presentation. As Greg mentioned, our third quarter results were strong. Market dynamics were constructive overall, although there were certain pockets where the environment was more challenging. We strengthened our balance sheet, focused on profitable relationship growth, and maintained expense discipline.  Reported results were negatively impacted by the items noted on Page 2 of our release, including a $17 million pre-tax charge related to the Visa total return swap and an $8 million pre-tax charge reflecting the mark-to-market on our Green Sky equity stake. Excluding these items, pre-provision net revenue increased 7% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. Strong revenue growth and well contained expenses are starting to lower our efficiency ratio, which improved substantially compared to the prior and the year-ago quarter. Excluding low income housing expense, our core efficiency ratio of 59% reached its lowest level since 2015.  Our credit performance continued to be solid. While we reported the strongest forward-looking credit metrics in nearly 20 years, we added to our loan loss reserves as a result of strong loan growth.  In his opening comments, Greg reiterated our top three priorities for long term success. These priorities are the guiding principles that we are using as a baseline for our 2019 plan expectations. Our goal is to carry the revenue momentum forward while maintaining tight expense control. We will continue to manage balance sheet risk by remaining mindful of the environment factors impacting our business. We expect to continue to benefit from rising rates, which gives us room to start managing for the maturing credit interest rate cycle. We also expect good credit performance as the economy continues to expand but believe that our strong credit profile positions us well for the eventual turn in the cycle. Lastly, we continue to manage our capital prudently with the ultimate goal of rewarding our shareholders today and in the future. Moving to Slide 6, as we have been indicating over the past few months, the combined impact of the commercial exits and reduced auto originations is mostly behind us. The benefits of North Star are also coming to fruition. As a result, we expect to achieve higher overall loan growth going forward compared to the past couple of years. The amount of quarterly growth of course will vary depending on environmental factors. This quarter, average total portfolio loans were up 1% compared to the prior quarter, mostly reflecting growth in C&I loans. We achieved the same growth rate in total loans on a year-over-year basis. End of period commercial loan growth was 2.5% compared to the prior quarter and was consistent with our previous guidance. Our success in generating profitable growth in both corporate and middle market lending reflects the emerging results of our North Star initiatives.  End of period commercial real estate balances increased 2% compared to last quarter. Although CRE growth was strong sequentially, balances increased less than 1% compared to the year ago quarter. We believe our CRE balances are likely to remain well below our peers\u2019 as a percentage of capital. CRE balances as a percentage of total risk-based capital were approximately 60%. This was the lowest in our peer group and significantly below the next lowest peer. We will continue to maintain a cautious approach to commercial real estate lending at this point in the cycle. We currently expect our end of period total commercial portfolio to grow modestly on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter.  Average consumer loans were up 1% both sequentially and compared to the year ago quarter. End of period consumer loans were flat compared to the prior quarter, in line with our previous guidance. It is worth noting that we are at an inflection point in our indirect auto loan portfolio as balances were essentially flat in the third quarter. This is happening somewhat earlier than we anticipated as originations have started to outpace runoff, albeit at a more modest pace. The decline in home equity loans continues to reflect runoff in our legacy book and is consistent with industry trends. Similar to the first two quarters, our credit card and other unsecured consumer loans continue to grow this quarter. Growth rates in these portfolios are in line with industry trends and are above our historical growth rates, reflecting the North Star initiatives.  In the fourth quarter, we expect total end of period consumer loan balances to be relatively flat compared to the third quarter. This will mostly reflect a seasonal decline in the mortgage portfolio and continued runoff in home equity loans. Our auto and credit card portfolio growth rates should be similar to the third quarter.  Total core deposits were up 3% on a year-over-year basis and stable compared to the prior quarter. Our goal is to fund incremental loan growth with core deposits. To help achieve that, we will continue to focus on generating above peer average household growth. We also plan to grow commercial deposits with the support of corporate treasury management engagements, again reflecting a number of North Star initiatives. Moving on to Slide 7, net interest income was up $70 million or 7% from the year ago quarter. The NIM increased 16 basis points from the third quarter of 2017. Compared to the prior quarter, NII increased 2% or $23 million and the NIM expanded two basis points, both of which exceeded our previous guidance. The average rates on interest bearing core deposits increased 9 basis points during the quarter, well below the 13 basis point increase in the second quarter.  The most impactful factor on our NIM continues to be deposit betas. Our cumulative beta leading up to the September 2018 Fed hike was approximately 30% with consumer in the low 20s and commercial in the low 50s. The June rate hike resulted in a consumer beta of approximately 30% and commercial beta of about 70%, resulting in an overall beta of 45%, and we expect the September rate increase to result in a combined beta of approximately 50%. We expect incremental increases in deposit betas with additional future rate hikes.  We expect fourth quarter NIM to increase two to three basis points from the third quarter, which assumes a December Fed funds rate increase. Accordingly, we expect our fourth quarter NII to be up approximately 2% sequentially, which is largely a function of the expected balance sheet growth and the benefit from the September and December rate hikes. This translates to 8% NII growth for the full year 2018. Moving on to Slide 8, excluding the impact of the non-core items, non-interest income increased 3% compared both to the year ago and prior quarter. The overall trends in fee income reflect strength in wealth and asset management and corporate banking, and steady increases in payments processing and consumer deposit revenues. We expect these trends to continue with some quarterly fluctuations. The outlier in fee performance is clearly mortgage banking, which is very much reflective of the industry trends. The weakness is mortgage is clearly impacting our total fee income growth year over year. Our year-to-date fee income is up approximately 2% on a core basis, but excluding mortgage core fees are up about 4%. This quarter, origination volume was $1.9 billion and the gain on sale margin remained low at 163 basis points. We added $3 billion to our servicing portfolio to be on-boarded in the fourth quarter, bringing the total acquired servicing portfolio to approximately $17 billion since the beginning of last year. Our corporate banking fees remain solid and we are optimistic that we will finish the year strong. Our strong pipeline should help us generate corporate banking fees between $120 million and $130 million in the fourth quarter, subject to market conditions. Deposit service charges increased 1% compared to both the year ago quarter and the prior quarter. Growth in consumer deposit fees has been encouraging and is tied to our strong household growth numbers. In treasury management, we have been able to grow our top line fees at a mid single digit rate this year, which helped us neutralize the impact of higher earnings credit rates. Card and processing revenue increased 4% compared to the year ago quarter due to higher credit and debit transaction volume, partially offset by higher rewards. Sequential performance reflected increased rewards. For the fourth quarter, we expect non-interest income to increase approximately 2% from adjusted third quarter non-interest income of $586 million. The 3% decline in reported non-interest expenses this quarter was better than our prior guidance. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to invest in high priority areas such as IT and marketing, but we are finding efficiencies elsewhere to limit the impact on overall expense growth. Our adjusted efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 61.7% or 59.3% excluding the low income housing amortization expense, which all peers reflect in their tax line. We have achieved positive operating leverage this quarter both on a quarter over quarter and year over year basis, and expect to continue to improve in the foreseeable future.  Fourth quarter expenses, excluding any MB acquisition related expenses and assuming the FDIC surcharge remains in effect, are expected to be up only about 1% from the third quarter. If the FDIC premium is lowered, our expenses should remain flat from the third quarter. Although we are not prepared to review the details of our 2019 plan today, as we shared with you in September, we expect our core expenses to be up approximately 1% year over year in 2019.  Turning to credit results on Slide 10, third quarter credit results continued to follow a positive trend in line with our expectations and reflecting the impact of actions that we executed over the last three years. The criticized assets ratio continued to improve, decreasing to 3.45%, near a 20-year low, from 3.87% last quarter and 5.5% last year. Net charge-offs were $72 million or 30 basis points, down 11 basis points from the prior quarter. The commercial charge-off rate of 19 basis points was the lowest since before the crisis. The consumer net charge-off ratio of 50 basis points improved 2 basis points sequentially. Total non-accrual portfolio loans and leases were $403 million, down 20% from last year and down 8% from the previous quarter. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $86 million in the current quarter compared to $67 million in the year ago quarter and $33 million in the prior quarter. The coverage ratio remained at 1.17%. As we remind you every quarter, the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential quarterly fluctuations, given current low absolute levels of charge-offs.  Turning to Slide 11, capital levels remained very strong during the quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.7% and our tangible common equity ratio excluding unrealized gains and losses was 9.12%. During the quarter, we initiated and settled $500 million in share repurchases. As Greg mentioned, we recently re-submitted our CCAR 2018 results revised for the pro forma impact of the combined Fifth Third and MB Financial Company. Our near term and long term capital targets remain the same as before and we will resume our capital management actions this quarter in line with our 2018 CCAR plan.  At the end of the third quarter, common shares outstanding were down almost 17 million shares or 2% compared to the second quarter of 2018, and down 44 million shares or 6% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. Moving to Slide 12, we expect our tax rate for the fourth quarter to be in the range of 16.75% to 17.25%. Excluding the items that are specific to 2018, we would expect our long term tax rate to be in the 15.25% to 15.75% range. Now to Slide 13 with an update on the MB Financial integration. We remain on track to close the MB transaction in the first quarter of 2019 subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. All regulatory applications have been filed. We continue to be encouraged by the highly successful talent and client retention results since the announcement. We also remain very confident in our ability to generate the expense and revenue synergies we have discussed previously. In summary, I would like to reiterate a few points. We reported strong financial results for the third quarter and remain focused on our three strategic priorities. We are nearing the completion of the Project North Star work and expect the financial results of these initiatives to become more apparent throughout 2019. We also remain focused on seamlessly integrating the MB acquisition and successfully generating the financial benefits as discussed previously. Lastly, we continue to position the company to enhance our financial returns through organic growth opportunities. To that end, we are optimizing our branch network to improve households, deposits and revenue growth. We also continue to add to our sales force in other businesses where we expect these resources to enhance our return metrics and where we believe we can achieve higher revenue growth, including middle market lending and capital markets. We are focused on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to achieve our enhanced financial targets. With that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A. Sameer Gokhale : Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question and answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator.  Kyle, please open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Winter from Wedbush. Your line is open. Peter Winter : Good morning. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning, Peter. Peter Winter : I wanted to follow up on that expense guidance for next year. Can you just talk about what some of the drivers are to keep expenses low and does it assume that the FDIC surcharge goes away, and how much is that? Tayfun Tuzun : It does assume that the FDIC surcharge goes away basically beginning in 2019, and it\u2019s about $45 million to $50 million a year. We assume that we will have a normalized merit increase for our base employees somewhere around 2.5 to 3%, that we will continue to maintain our information technology investments and maintain the growth in our sales force, both in retail as well as in our commercial groups. There is no change really in the business portions, but we clearly will benefit from the second quarter efficiency actions that we executed this year, and we will continue with increased savings in our real estate management area and also have a few procurement related expense savings. We are pretty confident that we will be able to achieve that in 2019. Peter Winter : Then just a follow-up, corporate banking this quarter was a little bit lower than that guidance that you gave coming out of 2Q earnings, and then you are looking for a nice increase in the fourth quarter. Were there just some deals that got delayed and pushed into the fourth quarter? Lars Anderson : Peter, this is Lars. I think consistent with what you\u2019ve seen in the regional banks, debt capital markets activity was obviously muted. We are expecting, and I would say that we see early signs as we look at the fourth quarter, of a really nice pipeline in M&A and debt capital markets. It was lower than we had expected for the third quarter. I would tell you that we did have some benefit from that clearly in lower pay-downs. It wasn\u2019t the key driver, clearly, of our--you know, if you look at our C&I loan growth, which was up on a quarter over quarter basis end of period 3%, it clearly benefited us in terms of our loan outstandings, but we would expect that the fourth quarter would be a good, solid one subject to market conditions. We\u2019ve made a lot of investments there in investment banking, as you know, and have expanded our capabilities, aligned those with our industry verticals and well positioned. Peter Winter : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First, just a little clarification. The slides talk about expecting to resume capital distribution activities consistent with the originally submitted plan. Is that just referring to resumption after a blackout period going into the quarter, or is there some sort of pause in the buyback while the Fed is reviewing the CCAR re-submission? Tayfun Tuzun : There is no pause, Geoffrey. We will just resume the quarterly activity with the release of this earnings. It opens up our ability to execute the previously disclosed 2018 results. Geoffrey Elliott : Got it, understood. On the expense side, it feels like the outlook has been kind of bouncing around a bit - you had the $4.0 billion to $4.1 billion range and then you said the low end of that, and then you dropped the guide to coming in at the low end, and then taking what you\u2019ve said this quarter, it kind of points back to the low end of the $4.0 billion to $4.1 billion. Can you talk through what\u2019s been changing over the course of the year there, and specifically what\u2019s changed since the second quarter call that seems to make you a little bit more optimistic on potential to squeeze out some expense saves? Tayfun Tuzun : Clearly expenses continue to be a very good story for us. In terms of the third quarter, we did a little bit better than we expected relative to how we discussed our expectations in July, so the third quarter number came in below our expectations. The only change for the full year is really the FDIC surcharge assumption. In July, our outlook actually assumed that that surcharge would go away in the fourth quarter of this year, so that adds another, let\u2019s say, $11 million, $12 million number into our fourth quarter expectations. Back in July, we would have expected relative to where we ended up Q3 at flat expense growth into Q4, but we just took it up 1% because of that.  But look - I mean, in the second quarter we discussed some of our marketing activities with you, obviously continued spend on IT. None of that has changed. We are seeing good results from our marketing investments, but we are finding more efficiencies elsewhere in our organization to be able to afford those investments without necessarily taking total expenses up, and that story continues into 2019 with our 1% guidance. Geoffrey Elliott : Can you elaborate a bit more on the efficiencies? I guess you\u2019ve told us where you\u2019re still investing in technology and the sales force and merit increases, but could you give a bit more detail on where the biggest saves are going to be coming from? Tayfun Tuzun : I think the second quarter action that we took in streamlining some of our middle office and back office functions alters the base comp direction, so on a full year basis that\u2019s about $72 million, $80 million. On a year over year basis, it\u2019s a little bit less than that because we\u2019ve benefited this year for about a quarter, quarter and a half. We are seeing good efficiency actions coming from our continued focus on third party vendor management. Real estate clearly continues to be a source of saving for us. We have lowered a number of our third party spending, including consulting spend, so I think when we set out to achieve our efficiency ratio target of below 57% on a standalone basis by the end of 2019, we knew that these actions were slowly going to come online, and they are now coming online. With also good revenue growth, that tight expense management is enabling us to achieve the return targets. Geoffrey Elliott : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the competitive dynamics for commercial lending. There\u2019s been a lot of conversation about the non-banks this quarter, and I\u2019m wondering if from your seat, if you could give us a sense of how that\u2019s impacting growth prospects for you guys and what the competition is looking like in terms of structure and/or rate. Frank Forrest : This is Frank. Let me start from a credit perspective and then I\u2019ll flip it over to Lars to talk about outlook from a competitive vantage point. From where we sit, and we\u2019ve talked about it before, we have reduced our highest risk exposure in our company by $5 million over the last three years, and a large part of that has been on the leveraged lending side. The recipients of a lot of our take-outs, a lot of these were credits that we didn\u2019t have an appetite for came from the non-bank banks. From where I sit, we\u2019ve actually seen a benefit in being able to strategically reduce some of the higher risks we had in the leveraged portfolio by those that have a different appetite level than we do. Where we do see them, and you\u2019ve heard this on other earnings calls, clearly we see their influence from a structure perspective and a pricing perspective today. That\u2019s something we have to evaluate. We see them in the real estate markets, we see them in the leveraged markets, and we\u2019re seeing increasing exposure from them in middle market because a lot of PE firms now have ownership interest in middle market companies and they have--they tend to have broader relationships outside of traditional banks, and so we see it there as well. I expect as we go forward we\u2019ll see it more in the syndicated loan market. We are seeing more syndicated loan participants today that are non-bank banks, and as a result of that, that could get interesting if we end up with an economy that slips a bit and you have people that have a different appetite for risk than what we have. Anyway, that\u2019s from a credit perspective of where we\u2019ve been influenced. Lars Anderson : Yes Erika, I think Frank hit it nicely. That\u2019s the environment. I would just tell you very quickly we\u2019re seeing continued success, now two quarters, in middle markets, which was a core part of our North Star investments. Our capabilities, our ability to deliver, I\u2019d say a more flexible, empathetic, relationship-based approach to the market, there is a part of the market out there that\u2019s looking for that versus institutional type lending and debt. We\u2019re harvesting those opportunities - that\u2019s consistent with our strategy. We\u2019re doing the same thing even into corporate banking, that lower end of corporate banking. We\u2019re really coming in with some expertise that\u2019s unique. So there is opportunities, but I will tell you that structure and pricing is getting stretched, but we\u2019re going to stay very focused on our credit discipline, on our pricing returns, relationship pricing returns, but there is clearly a shifting in the macroeconomic environment. Erika Najarian : Got it. As my follow-up question to that, Frank, thank you for reminding us how much you have reduced risk. I\u2019m wondering if you could share with us what your current exposure stands today in terms of residual leveraged lending exposure and term facilities for sponsor-backed transactions. Frank Forrest : Erika, overall we do not have a significant exposure today within our commercial book. Again, that\u2019s because of the fact that we\u2019ve taken over a 50% reduction in that exposure over the past 36 months. I can tell you we operate within board-approved risk appetite limits of that book. We\u2019re still actively involved in the leverage business, and Lars has an outstanding team that focuses on that. We treat leverage as a specialized credit product at Fifth Third, we don\u2019t treat it as a separate line of business, so it\u2019s there to support existing clients primarily that we know well and have operated for a number of years in an leveraged environment and performed very well.  Our credit underwriting standards, we believe are prudent. We\u2019re not changing those standards. I\u2019ll also add that even though there\u2019s been a lot of articles recently about higher risk leveraged books being highly concentrated in cov-lite structures, virtually no covenants, it\u2019s only 10% of our leveraged book, so we continue to structure and underwrite I think in a prudent fashion, again with clients that we feel very good about. I\u2019ll see if Lars has any additional comments. Lars Anderson : No, I think you hit it well, Frank - very disciplined approach to that market and a very small part of our overall strategy and book. Erika Najarian : Clear, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. Can you give a little more color on MB Financial? Does that close the first day of the new year, or the last day of this year? Versus your original expectations, we can see your targets on the page, but just qualitatively, what looks a little bit better than what you expected and where do you think it will be a little bit more of a challenge, and specifically if you could address expense growth and loan growth and some other areas. Greg Carmichael : Mike, this is Greg. I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll throw it over to Jamie, who\u2019s leading that integration effort for us that we discussed before. First off, our intent right now hopefully is to receive regulatory approval this year and close the transaction first quarter of next year. Once we close the transaction, we\u2019ll work had to get that integrated as quickly as possible, but right now that\u2019s been our original plan and that has not changed. As Tayfun alluded to, we\u2019ve filed all appropriate regulatory filings and so forth and applications, so we\u2019re just waiting to get that response back and then we\u2019ll move forward with closing that first of the year. We will not close that transaction this year.  With respect to our focus on achieving the expense expectations of $255 million, we\u2019re very confident, Mike, in our ability to accomplish that task, even more so than we were when we first put that target out there. With all the due diligence that has been done since then and the efforts of the team, we feel really comfortable we can deliver on that commitment that we made there. In addition to that, we think there\u2019s really opportunities on the revenue side. We put a number out there of $60 million to $75 million. We feel very comfortable based on where we\u2019re bringing the business together and what we see as those opportunities in our partnership with MB Financial. It\u2019s a very talented group, and we feel very comfortable we can achieve those objectives over the years after we complete that transaction.  Jamie, do you have anything you want to add? Jamie Leonard : Yes, I\u2019d say thanks for the question, Mike. As Greg mentioned, we\u2019re definitely confident in the modeling we did and our ability to hit our targets; but back to your question on maybe one of the most surprising or impressive things, it\u2019s just really been the quality of the people at MB, the business that they operate, the very high touch, white glove treatment that their customers get that we\u2019re very focused on ensuring that that continues post-integration. Mike Mayo : As far as the expense growth target for the firm next year, up 1%, how does that reflect MB Financial? Jamie Leonard : That\u2019s on a standalone basis, Mike. Obviously we\u2019re pretty public about our expense expectations regarding MB. Mike Mayo : Then the last follow-up, with the increased competition from the non-banks and the impact of higher interest rates, the impact on loan growth at MB Financial specifically, do you feel that that could be a little bit more of a challenge in this environment? Do you feel fine, or how do you think about that? Jamie Leonard : Mike, good point. I\u2019d really point out three things that are really important as I look at our revenue synergies and our ability to get attractive returns. One, they are outstanding in that lower middle market space that is so important to us. They get attractive returns, build deeper client relationships, clients have very, very high client satisfaction scores, so that\u2019s really positive. They also bring to us a piece of asset-based lending that we have significantly increased over the last couple of years. We hit number 18 on the lead tables this past year as a standalone company. Having MB join us, it only complements our national asset-based lending capabilities again with their lower middle market strategy. Same thing with equipment finance - they have a lot of expertise in that area. We\u2019re excited about what that\u2019s going to do for us. I\u2019d just say on those three key fronts, and there is more, there\u2019s lots of opportunities for us to, I think, drive attractive returns and relationships. Greg Carmichael : Mike, the only other thing I would add - this is Greg - is we talked about the quality of the people, and once again we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the talent and the interactions that we\u2019ve had with that business. We\u2019ve also done a really nice job, and I credit Mitch Feiger, the CEO and that team, of retaining the talent that we have in place and retaining the customer base. We haven\u2019t seen any real material change in talent o the customer base we have seen, which is what we thought we would execute against, but we\u2019re seeing that come to fruition as we continue to move towards integration. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on MB Financial. I\u2019m not sure how much you can talk to their third quarter results specifically, but they did have a sizeable uptick in loan loss provisions and NCOs - I think it\u2019s related to one specific credit. But you have seen some of the smaller banks have some credit hiccups this quarter, you guys yourselves have raised some concerns about corporate leverage more broadly, but is there anything that\u2019s changed on the margin in terms of how you see the risk profile of their credit book, or is this just an idiosyncratic dynamic that just happens from time to time? Frank Forrest : This is Frank. They operate as a separate company from us. What you see is what we know. We can\u2019t comment on their specific performance. What I can tell you is that we did extensive due diligence in credit on MB, and we remain confident of the work that we did. Jamie Leonard : Just by the nature of the announcement, Saul, just one credit appears to more of an isolated idiosyncratic event, which does not taint the rest of the portfolio. Saul Martinez : Okay, fair enough. If I could change over to the fee outlook, 2% growth sequentially, is that a conservative estimate, because the corporate banking alone, 120 to 130 from 100, that\u2019s over 4% sequentially. You do have the TRA, I believe, with $20 million - correct me if I\u2019m wrong. You\u2019ll lose maybe not so much in terms of private equity gains next quarter, but just kind of sifting through a lot of the moving parts, can you just help us understand what\u2019s sort of underlying that guidance more on a line-by-line basis, because on the surface it seems like perhaps it\u2019s a little bit conservative, but I may be missing something. Tayfun Tuzun : No, I think in general we would hope to do better in corporate banking. Fourth quarter tends to be a strong quarter, but I think we\u2019re also guiding to a fairly strong growth in corporate banking. There were some private equity gains this quarter that fell to our bottom line and those are periodic. It\u2019s difficult to forecast those gains, so that has some impact. Continued weakness in mortgage banking, clearly both obviously on a quarter over quarter as well as year over year basis, that\u2019s been really our Achilles heel here this year, just based on the market dynamics; but in general in other areas, including deposit fees we should do well, there is some seasonality associated with it, but overall I think we feel good about 2%. We would hope to achieve better, but also we\u2019re cognizant of some of the challenges in the market with respect to fee growth. Saul Martinez : Just one quick follow-up - is the TRA cash flow of $20 million embedded in the guidance as well? Tayfun Tuzun : It is, yes. Correct. Saul Martinez : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about just how you\u2019re approaching share buybacks through the CCAR cycle. Obviously you use a lot of your submission in the third quarter. You talked about submitting your plan or re-submitting your plan to include the acquisition from the Fed. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a possibility of going back again since you still have strong capital levels and SOX obviously off quite a bit from the high part of the market, maybe part a surprise from the deal. I guess the question is thoughts on maybe going back to top off the ask from the Fed, and then of course you\u2019ve got a big stake in Worldpay, which stock has done quite well this year, and are you incrementally incented to try and monetize that, given where your stock is? Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks Matt, good question. In the near term, we clearly have to wait for the Fed\u2019s response to our resubmission. Until that, we will continue to execute our CCAR 2018 plan, which is by itself a fairly strong plan in terms of both buybacks as well as dividend raises. Beyond the resubmission decision, we\u2019re going to have to take a look at the combined company as we execute to integrate two companies, look at the underlying revenue growth, etc. I agree with you that the current market presents some interesting opportunities for us both in terms of our own capital growth as well as how we use Worldpay. We obviously are watching the same dynamics. We\u2019ve been pretty successful in the past in executing the exit from Worldpay and buying back our own stock. That continues to be on our plate, we have a little over 2%, so we are looking at considering the same factors, we just need to get over this near term decision point with the Fed and then re-evaluate what\u2019s left for us in the remainder of this 2018 plan period. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just remind us what the dollar amount of your ownership stake in Worldpay is, what\u2019s the cost basis, and I think you\u2019ve said in the past that it\u2019s important but something that might be exited over time, so just update us on going from slightly above 3 to potentially zero. Jamie Leonard : Matt, it\u2019s Jamie. We own about 10.3 million shares of Worldpay with roughly a $400 million cost base, so the unrealized gain--I haven\u2019t checked lately, but it\u2019s roughly $600 million. Given the value, should be around $950 million or so. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, sorry. I think you guys have talked about while it\u2019s important, that you\u2019d be open to selling that all down over time. Just if we could revisit the strategic importance versus the financial opportunity to sell that down in its entirety over time, and that\u2019s it for me. Thanks. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, there is no strategic value in owning a small percent of a public company. We will liquidate that stock, we just need to find the right time to do that. Greg Carmichael : Matt, we\u2019ve been very, very thoughtful about how we\u2019ve monetized our shares, as you\u2019ve seen over the years. Our equity position [indiscernible], as Tayfun said, we\u2019ve been very public that our intent is not to hold this. You could expect where we\u2019re at right now, that we\u2019ll act on that appropriately, and obviously given where our equity is trading today, there\u2019s some opportunities there that I think might make sense for us as we assess our options. Matt O\u2019Connor: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe : Thank you, good morning. Just had a question on the non-interest bearing deposits, they\u2019ve obviously been running off over the last couple quarters, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in a number of other banks of course. Could you just talk about some of the strategies you\u2019re putting in place to try to minimize or mitigate some of that DDA runoff? Thanks. Jamie Leonard : Ken, it\u2019s Jamie. The third quarter performance in non-interest bearing deposits was a little different than what we saw in the second quarter. If you recall in the second quarter, commercial DDAs were soft - that was driven by the increase in the earnings credit rate, and that was roughly a 45% beta as we adjusted our rates up in the second quarter. Then in the third quarter, commercial DDAs were actually relatively stable - they were down 1%, and so during the third quarter we increased the earnings credit rate by about a 15% beta, and that\u2019s what we expect as well heading into the fourth quarter. I do believe the second quarter will be the highest amount of commercial DDA runoff just as we\u2019ve been adjusting those earning credit rates.  On the consumer side, the DDAs were down 4% sequentially, and that\u2019s really just driven by a seasonally soft quarter, so we would expect both DDAs and deposits to be up in the fourth quarter driven by a lot of our initiatives on the consumer side. We spent a lot of time talking about our household growth - we\u2019ve grown households 4%. We\u2019ve increased branch staffing on the mass affluent, outbound calling and client management, along with the marketing efforts and the promotional and cash offers, and then building for 2019 and beyond, the southeast branch expansion that Tayfun mentioned. I feel like the drivers on the consumer side are there and the results are there, it\u2019s just the third quarter was seasonally soft from a consumer perspective, and on the commercial side the DDA mitigant to the interest rate headwind is really going to be driven by our ability to drive new client acquisition and further improve treasury management sales. To the extent that we\u2019re able to do that, you will continue to see a rebound in deposits beyond just the seasonal benefit we\u2019ll see in the fourth quarter. Ken Zerbe : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi. A couple of questions. Firstly just on the non-interest expense side, how has your headcount done this quarter - was it down versus second quarter, any color on that? Greg Carmichael : It was approximately down 4% from third quarter over second quarter, [indiscernible]. Vivek Juneja : Okay, and how much was the incentive comp reduction? Was there any reversal in this quarter or just accrual, what was it? Tayfun Tuzun : Incentive comp plans, clearly one of them is just directly tied to activity levels and revenue levels, and there\u2019s been no change to that. In terms of variable comp, we continue to look at it on a quarterly basis. For the year relative to last year, we are going to be up in our total variable comp payout, and then the accrual of that changes from one quarter to another, both based on headcount as well as based on just the overall performance activity. I would say for the first three quarters of this year, we are up compared to the first three quarters of last year, and for the full year I expect us to be up as well. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. Thanks on that. Going back to the MBFI, the charge-off that was incurred on one commercial relationship, their charge-off rate was 82 basis points. You had assumed a mark when you had--or at least you talked about a mark that you planned to take when you closed the transaction, this was upfront when you announced the deal. Was this loan part of that or was this a surprise, because obviously commercial is one of those where you don\u2019t have 25 or 50 loans going bad, it is only a couple of episodic loans that cause the losses. When you look at the charge-off rate for C&I, if this came from C&I, that implies a 2% charge-off rate on C&I but CRE is 2.6%, so those are fairly high loss rates given where they were. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, agreed. I mean, I think again--I\u2019ll just go back to Frank\u2019s statement, that they still are a separate company and we don\u2019t necessarily have access to the information that they have yet. In terms of the mark that we discussed when we announced the transaction, at this point we\u2019re not updating that mark and thus a one loan charge is not going to necessarily move our number. At this point, what they charge off this quarter is not expected to impact the mark that we will take when we close the transaction. Vivek Juneja : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac from FIG Partners. Your line is open. Christopher Marinac : Thanks, good morning. I may have missed it on the earlier remarks. The loss on Green Sky, is that the final piece of the investment or are there additional minor things that can occur in the future? Tayfun Tuzun : No, as you remember Chris, we invested $50 million when we started working with Green Sky, and then obviously they went public in the second quarter. We own about 2.5 million shares there and this is the impact of their share price during the quarter. Christopher Marinac : Got you. Your relationship with them continues to grow. What\u2019s the approximate balance that you have with them? Tayfun Tuzun : It\u2019s a little over a billion dollars as of quarter end. Christopher Marinac : Okay, very well. Thank you, Tayfun. Tayfun Tuzun : You\u2019re welcome. Sameer Gokhale : Okay, I think if you don\u2019t have any further questions, thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department and we will be happy to assist you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Chris Doll, you may begin your conference. Chris Doll : Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we will be discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018. Please review the cautionary statement in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information related to the proposed merger with MB Financial, reconciliations to non-GAAP measures along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures and forward-looking statements about Fifth Third\u2019s performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statement after the date of this call. This morning, I\u2019m joined on our call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks Chris and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported full year net income available to common shareholders of $2.1 billion or $3.06 per share. Full year adjusted net income of $1.8 billion was a record for the Bank as we continue making significant progress to improve profitability and better position Fifth Third for success. In addition to the record net income, we generated our best full year adjusted ROA, ROE, ROTCE and efficiency ratio in over a decade. We returned nearly 100% of earnings to shareholders through repurchases and two dividend increases as we raised the dividend nearly 40% in 2018. Additionally, we significantly improved our key credit quality metrics throughout the year. Fourth quarter 2018 net income available to common shareholders was $432 million and earnings per share of $0.64. Included in these results are three notable items, which had a negative impact of $0.05 on reported EPS. Excluding these items, adjusted earnings were $0.69 per share in the fourth quarter. Our financial results were very strong. During the quarter, we generated record loan originations and fee revenue in our commercial business, continued to properly grow the balance sheet and diligently manage our expense while continuing to invest for future growth. Since the fourth quarter of 2017, we have significantly improved all of our key financial metrics on an adjusted basis with ROA increasing 30 basis points, ROTCE increasing 440 basis points and the efficiency ratio declining more than 300 basis points. As we approach the third and final year of our NorthStar project, the fourth quarter of 2018 results should provide a great deal of confidence in our ability to achieve our enhanced targets. Before discussing our key strategic priorities and highlights for the quarter, I\u2019d like to share some observation on a macroeconomic environment. Year-over-year U.S. economic backdrop continues to be generally positive. While global growth pressures exit and geopolitical risks remain elevated, we expect this business cycle to expand in 2019, as underlying economical fundamentals remain solid. While we\u2019re cognizant of the rising probability of the downturn in next couple of years, we feel good about how we have positioned our balance sheet and our sales force to take advantage of growth opportunities while prudently managing our exposures. We will continue to maintain our disciplined focus on credit quality and profitability. Moving on to our strategic priorities. At Fifth Third, we are positioned to drive improved profitability well-beyond Project NorthStar horizon, which concludes at the end of this year. First, we are committed shooting our targeted financial results by the end of 2019, as outlined in our previous discussions. The continued improvement throughout 2018 reinforces our confidence in our ability to achieve our goals. In fact, our fourth quarter adjusted ROTCE of 15.4% is the highest since before the financial crisis. Second, we\u2019re focused on successfully integrating MB Financial. We\u2019re well-prepared for the integration of MB\u2019s operations into Fifth Third. We\u2019re working diligently to deliver the financial results associated with the acquisition and to make sure we get it right for our customers. We have completed all required fillings and are now simply waiting for the necessary approvals. We continue to expect to close the transaction by the end of this quarter. We\u2019re also pleased that the regulators did not object to our resubmitted capital plan including the pro forma impact of MB Financial. Also, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve our post-merger financial targets. It is clear that we are acquiring a high-performing franchise. As shown in their fourth quarter earnings published this morning, MB generated strong returns with solid NIM expansion and solid credit results with improvements in both NPAs and credit losses. We\u2019re excited to combine the talent and complementary capabilities of our two organizations. Third, we continue to invest in organic growth opportunities, including the previously communicated Branch network optimization. Our plans are staged over multiple years and include a rollout of the state-of-the-art branch redesign. Our next-generation branches will be 40% smaller than our legacy network and will be highly automated. In 2018, optimization efforts led to the opening of 12 branches and the closing of 45 branches. We expect to decrease our network in another 10 branches in 2019. Beginning 2020, we expect branch builds in our growth markets to exceed our closures. In addition, we\u2019re expanding our middle market business in select high-growth markets where we can combine strong talent with local market knowledge and our enhanced product capabilities to successfully grow the portfolio.  Following the very successful launch of our California middle market team, over the next 12 months we\u2019ll be expanding to the Denver, Dallas and Houston markets. We already have existing teams of commercial bankers in our national corporate banking business in these markets. Our track record of hiring strong talent and successfully growing our middle market franchise gives us a high degree of confidence, executing on our current expansion plans. We also plan to continue add to our sales force in our existing footprint. We\u2019re particularly focused on strategic acquisitions that would generally higher fee revenue to drive additional ROE growth. In fact, we are already seeing the financial benefits of our investments in talent over the last two years, especially in our capital markets and the advisory and wealth and asset management businesses. Fourth, we remain focused on accelerating our digital transformation and delivering innovative solutions for our customers. We\u2019ve invested heavily over the last several years, both through our in-house technology capabilities and with select fin-tech partnerships. These investments are focused on delivering a more personalized relationship banking experience. Our goal is to ensure interactions with the customers are simple, seamless and of course secure. Our efforts continue to be recognized. Bank [indiscernible] recently rated us as the number one bank for overall technology strategy, highlighting our ability to deliver innovative product as well as our organization-wide technology expertise. Our clearly-defined set of strategic priorities are designed to enhance revenue growth as well as generate expense efficiencies in order to meet our financial and strategic objectives. We have achieved significant expense efficiencies over the last two years as reflected in our improved efficiency ratio. As we have discussed previously, our goal is to consistently achieve positive operating leverage. Moving on to our highlights for the quarter, I'll review some key aspects of results and then Tayfun will discuss the quarter in greater detail. First, we continue to benefit from our improved balance sheet resiliency. Our key forward-looking credit metrics continued to improve as criticized loans declined for the seventh quarter to a lowest level in nearly 20 years. Our non-performing assets have declined nearly 50% over the past two years and today stand at the lowest level since 2000. We maintained the same disciplined approach to client selection, underwriting standards and credit risk appetite during the quarter while growing the loan portfolio. And in fact, we [technical difficulty] originations, both in middle market and corporate banking at the highest credit quality in several quarters. While we have maintained strong underwriting standards, our loan yields and net interest margin have continued to expand. We believe our strong credit profile should allow us to outperform through business cycles. We generated profitable relationship growth in both our commercial and retail businesses. We continue to focus on expanding our relationships with our clients on both sides of the balance sheet. Loan growth was fully funded by core deposits during the quarter and the year. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, we grew commercial loans by 4% including C&I growth of 6%. Even with very strong loan growth, our total household growth of over 3% and deposit growth of 4% resulted in the lowest loan to core deposit ratio in the past 15 years. Furthermore, we managed our expenses and outperformed relative to our guidance. Excluding merger-related items, our expensed declined 2% from the prior quarter. As a result, we were able to continue to generate positive operating leverage for the quarter and the full year. I want to reiterate our expectations for standalone adjusted expense growth of only 1% in 2019. Our results show that we remain on track to achieve our enhanced NorthStar financial targets. During the fourth quarter, we generated an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 15.4% and adjusted return on assets of 1.34%, and adjusted efficiency ratio of 56.8%, which is already better than our standalone fourth quarter of 2019 target. We remain very confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets and outperform through this cycle. We remain committed to holding ourselves accountable for delivering strong financial results under prevailing macroeconomic, interest rate, regulatory and legislative environment. I'd like to once again thank all of our employees for their hard work, dedication and for always keeping the customer at the center. I was pleased that we were again able to deliver strong financial results in our NorthStar initiatives or delivering the outcomes as planned. With that I'll it over to Tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial highlights on slide four of the presentation. Our fourth quarter results were very strong. This momentum bodes well for our 2019 performance and should help us achieve our yearend goal. As Greg mentioned, the pre-closing integration work related to MB is progressing very well on both ends. We are very optimistic that the transaction will close this quarter. And as you can see from the earnings disclosures, some of the expenses related to the integration have started to impact our financials. These expenses are part of the total merger-related expenses that we discussed with you when we announced the transaction. At this time, there is no change to the financial outlook we shared with you previously with respect to the combined company. We remain very confident that the acquisition will improve ROTCE by 2%, ROA by approximately 12 basis points, and the efficiency ratio by about 4% in year two. Since we have not disclosed the transaction yet, our current 2019 guidance will only reflect the standalone Fifth Third performance expectations. Once we close the transaction, we will update you on the combined outlook in more detail, but hopefully our guidance on the performance metrics gives you a very good perspective on the outlook for the combined company. Before discussing results for the quarter, I would like to highlight as we have noted throughout our earnings materials that our current and historical financial results presented today reflect the change in accounting policy related to investments in affordable housing. Adopting this new accounting policy allows our financials to be more comparable to peers. We have also provided a summary reconciliation of the change on page 30 of the release. This change had no meaningful impact on our fourth quarter EPS. Reported results were negatively impacted by the notable items on page two of our release, including $21 million after-tax in merger-related expenses incurred in advance of our pending acquisition of MB Financial and a $17 million after-tax charge, reflecting the mark to market on our GreenSky equity stake, partially offset by a $6 million after-tax benefit from the Visa total return swap. Excluding these items, pre-provision net revenue increased 9% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. All of our adjusted return metrics were higher while loan growth and deposit growth exceeded our guidance. Strong revenue growth and disciplined expense management have continued to lower our efficiency ratio and generated positive operating leverage on a sequential and year-over-year basis, which we expect will continue in 2019. Our credit performance was solid. We reported the strongest forward-looking credit metrics in nearly 20 years. Our provision for loan losses exceeded charge-offs as a result of the strong loan growth. In his opening comments, Greg reiterated our priorities for long-term success. Our goal is to carry the revenue momentum forward while maintaining tight expense control. We will continue to manage balance sheet risk by remaining cognizant of the environmental factors impacting our business and maintain a prudent approach to capital management with the ultimate goal of rewarding our shareholders today and in the future. Moving to slide six. Our recent loan growth strength is beginning to provide a clear picture of our longer term growth potential. We remain very confident in our ability to achieve higher overall loan growth going forward compared to the past couple of years. This quarter, average total portfolio loans were up 2% compared to the prior quarter, mostly reflecting growth in C&I loans. We grew total loans 3% on a year-over-year basis, again reflecting strength in commercial. End-of-period commercial loan growth was 3% sequentially, which significantly exceeded previous guidance of modest growth. Our success in generating profitable growth in both, national, corporate and regional middle market lending reflects both the impact of our investment in our sales force, as well as the increased efficiency in our mid office and back office functions. Total commercial loan production was up 27% relative to last quarter and up 17% relative to last year's fourth quarter. Production levels in both regional middle market, as well as national corporate businesses were higher relative to both previous quarters. Total commercial line utilization was up a little less than 1%. Despite a very strong quarter for commercial loan growth, our leverage loan balances continue to decline in the fourth quarter. Total leverage loan exposure declined 5% sequentially. End-of-period commercial real estate balances including construction loans were flat compared to last quarter. CRE balances as a percentage of total risk-based capital were at a peer group low of approximately 63%, significantly below the next lowest peer. We will continue to maintain a cautious approach to commercial real estate at this point in the cycle. We currently expect average total commercial loans to grow by about a percent on a sequential basis in the first quarter with continued strength in C&I partially offset by declines in commercial construction and large ticket non-relationship commercial lease portfolios. For the full-year, we expect average total commercial loans to increase approximately 5% compared to 2018. Average and end-of-period consumer loans were flat, both sequentially and compared to the year-ago quarter as growth in our credit card portfolio and unsecured personal loans was offset by declines in home equity lending and residential mortgages. As we discussed last quarter, our indirect auto loan balances are no longer declining as origination levels are now outpacing lower amortization in the portfolio. We are deliberately choosing not to portfolio fixed rate conforming mortgage loans in the current rate environment. In the first quarter, similar to the fourth quarter, we expect total average consumer loan balances to be relatively flat with the same portfolio dynamics that I discussed for the fourth quarter. For the full-year, we expect average total consumer loans to increase approximately 1% compared to 2018. Combining the commercial and consumer portfolios, we currently expect full-year 2019 average total loans to grow 3% to 3.5% compared to 2018. Total core deposits were up 4% on a year-over-year basis and up 3% compared to the prior quarter. We are very pleased with these results. Our loan to core deposit ratio has declined to the best level in 15 plus years. Our ability to fund incremental loan growth with core deposits is and will continue to be a very powerful factor supporting our growing overall profitability. In the current environment, there is a fine balance between growing core deposits and managing interest expense. We believe that our model strikes the right balance as we are not exposing the balance sheet to rates paid on hot money accounts as we emphasize relation debt when making pricing decisions, which tend to create more balance and price stability. Moving on to slide seven. Compared to the prior quarter, NII increased 4% or $38 million and the NIM expanded 6 basis points, both of which exceeded our previous guidance. About 2 basis points of the NIM expansion reflected a few items that was seasonal in nature. Average yield on our loan portfolio expanded 20 basis points, which outpaced a 14 basis-point increase in interest-bearing core deposits during the quarter. Compared to the year-ago quarter, net interest income increased $122 million or 13%. The results from the year-ago quarter included a $27 million negative impact related to the change in tax law. Adjusting for this item, NII increased $95 million or 10% with NIM expanding 19 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017, a very strong performance relative to peers. As you know, based on our previous disclosures, while achieving these results, we continued to hedge our downside risk, taking advantage of very attractive entry points last fall. Our long-term interest rate risk philosophy is not to tilt our exposure too far in either direction. We believe this is a prudent approach at this point in the cycle. Our cumulative beta leading up to the December 2018 Fed hike was approximately 35%, with consumer in the low 20s and commercial in the high 50s. The September rate hike resulted in a beta of 58%. We expect deposit beta from the December rate hike to be consistent with the impact from the September hike over the next six months, which would result in a cumulative deposit beta below 40%. Today\u2019s guidance does not assume any additional Fed rate increases in 2019. We expect the full-year 2019 NII to grow approximately 3% over 2018 without any rate hikes. We expect our first quarter NII to decline about 1.5% to 2% sequentially based on day counts and the impact of non-recurring fourth quarter seasonal items, partially offset by the benefit from the December rate hike and loan growth. Our estimate is about 6.5% above first quarter of last year\u2019s NII. We expect the NIM on a full-year basis to expand 2 to 3 basis points in 2019 despite the assumption of no additional rate increases. If the Fed were to raise rates, given our balance sheet position, we would expect the NIIM to benefit 1 to 2 basis points in 2019 per rate hike. Moving on to slide eight. Excluding the impact of the listed items, non-interest income increased 2% compared to both year-ago and the prior quarter. Record corporate banking revenue was driven by highest ever M&A advisory fees as well as increased syndication revenues. Our corporate banking fees were up 69% compared to the year-ago quarter and were up 30% compared to the prior quarter. We currently expect our corporate banking revenue to grow about 25% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. Our near-term performance and our 2019 expectations demonstrate our success in implementing our NorthStar initiatives over the past three years. Card and processing revenue increased 5% compared to the year ago quarter and increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, due to higher transaction volumes, partially offset by higher rewards. Year-over-year performance also reflected strength in wealth and asset management, although we had lower revenues in the fourth quarter due to lower asset valuations. Mortgage banking revenue was up 10% in the fourth quarter, origination volume was $1.6 billion, gain on sale margin was 159 basis points, the lowest seen in the business. Deposit service charges decreased 2% compared to year ago quarter and decreased 3% compared to the prior quarter, predominantly due to higher earnings credit rates in corporate treasury management. For the first quarter, we expect total noninterest income to be stable relative to the adjusted first quarter of 2018 and for the full-year we expect total noninterest income to increase approximately 2% from the adjusted 2018 noninterest income. Moving on to slide nine, the 1% increase in reported noninterest expenses this quarter reflected a $27 million pretax impact from merger-related expenses. Excluding the merger-item, expenses decreased $20 million or 2% sequentially. Results reflected the benefit of the elimination of the FDIC surcharge which was about $12 million and the actions we have taken to manage our expense base. We are very-pleased with these results and will maintain the same focus on expense management in 2019 while continuing to invest in our company. Our adjusted efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 56.8%. We have achieved positive operating leverage this quarter, both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, and expect to continue to improve in the foreseeable future. First quarter expenses, excluding any MB acquisition related expenses are expected to be up about 1.5% to 2% from the first quarter of 2018. The largest item driving the year-over-year growth is a $15 million change in our unfunded commitment provision expense, which reflects growth in commitments associated with strong loan growth. Included in this guidance is also the impact of our acquisitions in 2018 in wealth and asset management and capital market, which is about 0.5% of our total expense base. Excluding these items, year-over-year expenses in the first quarter are actually expected to be lower than last year's first quarter including the impact of the change in FDIC deposit insurance expenses. It is also worth noting that our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonality associated with the timing of compositional warrants and payroll taxes. We continue to expect our standalone expenses, excluding the notable items disclosed in our earnings materials to be up approximately 1% year-over-year in 2019. Turning to credit results on slide 10. Fourth quarter credit results continued to be benign in line with our expectations and reflect the impact of actions that we executed over the last three years. The criticized assets ratio continued to improve, decreasing to 3.34%, near a 20-year low, from 3.45% last quarter. Net charge-offs were $83 million or 35 basis points, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. The commercial charge-off rate of 19 basis points continues to be the lowest since before the crisis. The consumer net charge-off ratio of 61 basis points, increased slightly compared to last quarter and reflected larger than usual recoveries in the prior quarter. NPLs of $348 million decreased 20% from last year and are down 14% from the previous quarter. As a result, our NPLs and NPA ratios continue to decline to levels not seen before the crisis. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $95 million in the current quarter compared to $67 million in the year-ago quarter and $86 million in the prior quarter. The resulting coverage ratio was 1.16% with allowance in excess of NPLs of nearly 320%. As we remind you every quarter, the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential quarterly fluctuations, given current low absolute levels of charge-offs. Turning to slide 11. Capital levels remained very strong during the fourth quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.2% and our tangible common equity ratio excluding unrealized gains and losses was 8.71%. The cumulative impact of our accounting change resulted in an 11 basis-point reduction to our current CET1 ratio, which merely reflects the timing difference from accounting related to recognition of losses. During the quarter, we completed $400 million in share repurchases. At the end of the fourth quarter, common shares outstanding were down almost 15 million shares or 2% compared to the third quarter of 2018 and down 47 million shares or 7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Following the Fed\u2019s non-objection to our CCAR resubmission, we will be able to repurchase another -- an additional $900 million in share buybacks through June 2019 and increase our dividend another $0.02 in the second quarter of 2019. This is in addition to the $0.04 increase we just declared in the fourth quarter. Our near-term and long-term capital targets remain the same as before as we continue to target CET1 ratio of between 9% and 9.5%. Slide 12 provides a summary of our current outlook on a standalone basis, as well as our financial expectations from the MB Financial acquisition. We expect our standalone full-year 2019 tax rate to be in the 21% to 22% range. The higher than previously disclosed tax rate guidance simply reflects the change in accounting policy I mentioned earlier. In summary, I would like to reiterate a few points. We reported very strong financial results for the fourth quarter and remain focused on our key strategic priorities to drive the Company forward and to outperform through various business cycles. We\u2019re focused on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to achieve our enhanced financial targets. We remain focused on seamlessly integrating the MB acquisition and successfully generating the financial benefits, as discussed previously. We continue to position the Company to enhance our financial returns through organic profit opportunities. And lastly, we are accelerating the digital transformation or future outperformance all within our stated goal of generating positive operating leverage. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Chelsea, please open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First, just quickly to clarify. Did you say something on corporate banking fees and your expectation for 1Q? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. I think we said it\u2019s going to be up 25% relative to last year's first quarter, Geoffrey. Geoffrey Elliott : Thanks. So, I guess the question would be corporate banking is up 25% relative to last year, you\u2019ve got some benefit from the acquisitions coming in as well. What is it that kind of holds back the overall picture to keep it much closer to stable, given that strength in corporate banking? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Clearly, corporate banking continues to be very strong. It was very strong in \u201818; it will be again, we expect to be strong in \u201819. We\u2019re being cautious in the mortgage banking business as we are not expecting a significant improvement in the environment. Clearly, if the environment improves, then we would expect to exceed the contribution from mortgage banking. Similarly, although from a fundamental activity perspective we are seeing great success in our wealth and asset management business, we\u2019re are not necessarily forecasting a significant change in market levels. In addition to that, as you know, we last year -- early last year, announced that we were going to reduce our outstandings in the large ticket leasing business, which has an impact on operating lease income. So, that is driving some of the headwinds. And then also, last year in 2018, we had some private equity gains. Those are difficult to predict as we sit here today at the beginning of the year. So, those are some of the headwinds. But, relative to other fee line items, including corporate banking, clearly, we\u2019re not only benefiting from the acquired revenues but also from just organic growth opportunities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, Tayfun, can you help us understand some of the actions that you took in the quarter? You mentioned in the appendix a bunch of the changes in the swap portfolio. First of all, I guess, could you help us understand, if there was any benefits from that in the fourth quarter? And then, also, just how does that work through and impact the NIM and NII going forward? Thanks. Jamie Leonard : Hey, Ken. It\u2019s Jamie. What we did in the quarter from a swap perspective was we added let\u2019s say $4 billion of spot starting swaps in October and early November; and then, mid-November we added a forward -- one-year forward starting swap for a total of $5 billion of swaps and then we added floors at a 225 strike that were also one-year forward starting. Net of all of that was about a $4 million benefit or 1-bp benefit to NIM in the fourth quarter. And then, given the rate outlook for more stable one-month LIBOR, we would expect that benefit to continue. The other action we took related to swaps was then later in the quarter after the bond market rally, we did terminate 3.1 billion of swaps that were set to mature in 2019, which that termination loss just becomes crystallized and locked in over the course of 2019. So, not a real impact to NIM, other than if rates were to sell off we would not be impacted by that related to those 3 billion in swaps. Ken Usdin : So, I guess as a follow-up, I\u2019m just trying to understand, you are talking about 3% standalone NII growth with really good balance sheet growth, especially towards the end of the year. So, you can maybe kind of help us understand, is it the impact of that that would hold you back only 3% or just how does the NII traject I guess as you look past the first quarter? Jamie Leonard : I think, Ken, I mean, we are obviously -- we've had great growth in the fourth quarter, and our guidance reflects a 1% type increase in commercial loans -- average commercial loans in the first quarter. We are maintaining a relatively cautious approach as we look into 2019. We are not trying to increase our expectations based on obviously our success in the fourth quarter. But, if we achieve better than our current cautious expectations, that will have an impact on NII on the positive side. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : I just wanted a little bit color on what drove the large increase in the commercial. It looks like commercial interest checking deposits in the quarter pretty substantial leg up, and just how sustainable that would be as you look out? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Thanks for the question. What we\u2019ve seen on the commercial front has been continued migration from a client preference standpoint from DDA to IBT. So, that certainly drives a little bit of that. But more importantly for us, we\u2019ve had a very successful fourth quarter in both new client acquisition on the commercial side as well as getting the better share of wallet of the deposit, both from our existing customers. So, we were really pleased with the deposit growth in our commercial book. And it was very widespread across our regions as well as in several of our verticals including the retail vertical, TMT and entertainment and lodging. So, overall, very good outcome, and we expect that to continue into 2019. Greg Carmichael : Yes. In a changing, John, environment like we are going through with rising rates, one of the benefits of our model and the kind of the relationships we have with our clients is, we are able to get in deep relationships, bring them liquidity solutions, and some of those liquidity solutions have added to the migration over to -- from DDA to interest-bearing transaction accounts. These are still relationship based. But, we are really pleased with the execution of our strategy that we\u2019ve put out there. And frankly, we are able to fully fund the commercial bank\u2019s loan growth for the year. And we would expect that we would continue as we head into 2019 as we\u2019re going to stay very close to our clients in a changing environment. John Pancari : Okay, all right. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then, separately, on the expense side, I just want to confirm what your guidance implies in terms of full-year \u201819 total expenses, including MBFI. If you look at your guidance for standalone, it implies about $3.9 billion, assuming 1% organic growth. And then, if we add in consensus numbers for MB expenses and then adjust for 50% of the cost saves of 255, I come out to about $4.35 billion. I want to see if that's fair to assume. Tayfun Tuzun : Well, at this point, I really don\u2019t want to comment on the MB acquisition. Obviously timing of the closing will play a role, but our assumptions have not changed in terms of our cost saving assumptions. By the end of year one, we assume that all 100% of cost savings will be realized such that we go into the year two with full benefit of those. In terms of ours, we\u2019re pretty clear on what we expect from the adjusted base. So, that approximately 1% type expense that we discussed last fall still holds in terms of what we expect from the standalone. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : I wanted to ask you about this middle market expansion into California and Denver and Dallas. I mean, these are all areas where there are already existing competitors and people providing these services. But, what are we adding into this process that gives us the competitive advantage as we expand our core markets into these areas? Lars Anderson : So, Marty, first of all, I think we already have a competitive advantage within the markets in which we\u2019re operating and I think that we\u2019re proving that out. Number of the NorthStar investments that we've made, the acceleration that you\u2019ve seen in our middle-market business this year. We\u2019ve had three linked quarters of acceleration there of over a $1 billion of middle-market growth in 2018 and we continue to complement that with additional capital markets treasury management capabilities. Those capabilities along with our value proposition, we found that we've been very successful in California and expanding into those markets. We know those markets well already. However, one of the key parts to executing I think effectively here is to have very high quality, talented, experienced leadership and bankers in those markets. We\u2019re able to accumulate, I will tell you, a really first-class team in California and we\u2019re already seeing some very positive momentum there. We already have a leader for Texas that will be coming onboard here shortly. We expect to duplicate that same process and execute there. I do have a history in Taxes and know that market pretty well. We will be able to leverage that. And the Denver market, we also operate in today. Again, we have insights and we will replicate that in those markets. I don\u2019t have any reason to believe we can\u2019t deliver our middle-market value proposition, like we have in 2018 in these expansion markets. Greg Carmichael : This is Greg. The only thing I would add also is we also expanded into Greenville, South Carolina which is out of footprint; in addition to that we have a St. Louis middle market operation. Both of those have done extremely well. And it\u2019s really -- of course some of that is finding the right talent that knows the market, couple that with our go-to-market strategy, our product capabilities and so forth, and it's worked extremely well for us. But, we're very selective on which market, what the opportunity looks like, and once again, it depends on finding the right leadership and talent in that market before you make that move. So, I think Lars and team have done a fantastic job. We've had a lot of success. We'll continue to be very prudent in how we approach those opportunities. But, I think to-date, we're very pleased with the outcomes. Lars Anderson : One last thing I'd tag on, if you looked at our California middle market portfolio today, this is not about buying into participations. This is about true lead relationships where we have close relationships with management. Marty Mosby : And I guess as a follow-up, there is a two-pronged thing. One, are we getting the talent from kind of bigger money centered banks in these areas or super regional banks that are having this process? And as you're kind of getting out of this mark -- out of your markets, I mean, that's where we've kind of stumbled in the past, how do we ensure that that's not the selection bias that the growth is -- creating incremental growth but we\u2019re getting the growth that's going to eventually be the one that falls once we get into the stress period? Greg Carmichael : So, first of all, we're not taking our eye off the ball of our core franchise. We have a lot of focus; we put a very seasoned leader into a position leading middle market for our Company, he spends a lot of time on our core franchise. I couldn't feel better about our positioning there. And we're seeing the outcomes of these successes in our core franchise. You can see it in our credit metrics, you can see it in the growth, and you can see it in the talent. As I speak to California and beyond, the talent tends to come from your larger regional banks, but as we continue to expand into Texas, I would expect that we would continue to build out that same type profile, individuals that have experience in middle-market, individuals that understand not transactional but really core relationship banking and how to leverage the capabilities that we've invested in, in NorthStar and beyond. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Peter Winter : In the opening remarks you mentioned that the leverage loans were down 5%. I was wondering can you just give an update on the size of the lending -- leverage lending exposure and how you go about managing that risk? Frank Forrest : Good morning. This is Frank. Our balances actually are down 55% over the last three years and our commitments are down 46%. And as we\u2019ve stated before, we took an early, I think a very appropriate look at reducing risk in that portfolio. I also will add that our criticized assets in the leverage book are down 25% over the last three years. Our credit exposure today is just over $3 billion. We control that with a number of metrics, and we feel pretty good about it. I also will caution you, when trying to compare leverage portfolios, it's very difficult to do that because there's no standard definition. So, everybody has their own definition. But, we believe ours is a conservative definition. It has a pretty small overall concentration relative to our total book. So, we\u2019ve been very assertive over a longer period of time in producing the exposure given what we anticipated with potential rising rates and where we\u2019re in the cycle, and we think that\u2019ll pay of us if we hit a downturn here over the next 12 to 24 months. Tayfun Tuzun : And I think, Peter, the change compared to last quarter as well as last year also gives you some indication going forward as we would expect our origination elsewhere will exceed originations obviously in leverage lending. Peter Winter : Great. And then just a follow-up, Greg you mentioned also in your opening remarks that you\u2019d be interested in some fee income acquisitions. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that. Greg Carmichael : We\u2019ve had a lot of success recently in our wealth and asset management business and obviously our capital markets capabilities of looking at strategically franchise opportunities that would benefit our client base that could -- that would feed into our book of business. And we\u2019ve got a lot of success there. So, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate those opportunities as they materialize. Once again, you just have to find the right opportunity that fits into our model in a geography that we\u2019re banking. If we find that combination and we think it\u2019s a good fit for Fifth, we\u2019ll consider those opportunities moving forward. But I\u2019ll also restate, job grows [ph] as MB Financial, getting that done. So, we won\u2019t do anything that distracts us from being able to accomplish that successfully. So, we\u2019re being very mindful of what\u2019s on our plate and how we move forward. Lars Anderson : Yes. Peter, I think, the reference to MB is important, because MB Financial clearly expands our commercial reach. We\u2019re adding relationships significantly with MB to existing relationships. So, if there are any opportunities there with respect to certain products and services that would benefit that expanded commercial client base, we would take a look at it. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Ken Zerbe : Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, you guys seem very positive about the commercial growth in the expansion markets. When you think about the commercial growth specifically in 2019, how much of the -- I think it was 5% growth, comes from these expansion markets and the new lenders they\u2019re hiring, versus the existing maybe in footprint portfolio? Lars Anderson : Yes. So, Ken, without giving specifics about the contributions of each of these groups, I would tell you this. First of all, we\u2019re getting substantial growth out of our existing franchise. That\u2019s the key driver for our Company in 2018 and will be for 2019. If you look at the Midwest, Indiana continues to be a standout but the southeastern states continue to grow at a very attractive rate. We really feel good about our ability to continue that momentum into 2019 and for the expansion initiatives for us to be additive to that strength in 2019 and beyond. Ken Zerbe : Got you, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a clarification question. In terms of the net interest margin, I just want to make sure I got my numbers right here. So, for the full year, it was 3.22; guidance is up 2 to 3 basis points, but you ended at 3.29. Now, I understand there is 2 basis points of seasonal items in that NIM; it sounds like maybe little bit from the swap portfolio as well. But, it seems to imply that, there is still downward pressure on NIM, so that we could see NIM contraction over the course of 2019. Is that correct? Jamie Leonard : It\u2019s Jamie. How I would think of it is, if you adjust the fourth quarter for the seasonally elevated items, we have a nice performance of 3.27 from a NIM perspective. Our outlook -- and just to be transparent on the underpinnings of the outlook, we have, I would say, perhaps a little conservative outlook on the NIM, given that we have no rate hikes. Obviously, as Tayfun said, the June hike would add a bp or 2 to NIM. We do assume one month LIBOR to Fed funds spread declines from the 7 basis points in the fourth quarter to 2 basis points in the first quarter. Again, if that were not to happen that would be added a bp or 2. And we use the yield curve as of January 2nd, so if rates and the curve were to steepen back out, that would add another bp or 2 to NIM. And then, perhaps one item that\u2019s overlooked because this forecast is a standalone forecast for Fifth Third but we are taking action in advance of the MB acquisition on our balance sheet that does have a NIM depressing impact on Fifth Third but not on the combined organization. So, the securities we've added to be LCR compliant, the debt issuances that we completed and have in the forecast to complete in 2019 on the Fifth Third side, what that translates to is that the MB NIM performance back at acquisition we have talked about that being 5 basis points to 7 basis points of NIM additive, now, given how this forecast lines up, it will be at the higher end of the range because the Fifth Third balance sheet is bearing the cost of those items. So, if that helps to explain our NIM outlook. But, our balance sheet in the absence of rate moves should be relatively stable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Thank you for the clarification on the margin outlook. And I'm wondering as we think about the expansion into new markets as well as MBFI being dilutive to the loans and deposit ratio, could you give us a little bit more color beyond what you\u2019ve told us in the prepared remarks about how the deposit strategy could look like with these expansion plans and the combined company, especially in light of Fed -- a prolonged Fed pause? Tayfun Tuzun : Look, I think it is clear that with respect to the expansions, those initial years tend to be loan heavy, no question about that. But, at the same time, we are looking at the momentum that we currently have in place with expect to, both consumer as well as commercial deposits in our existing footprint, in our existing businesses. We are encouraged that we can continue to fund loan growth including the expansion markets with our existing ability to grow deposits. And then, after a year or two, those markets actually tend to catch up fairly quickly because as Lars mentioned, the approach in these expansion markets is not go through participations but establish direct customer relationships, so without necessarily creating imbalance between asset growth and deposit growth. And then obviously, in this market we are trying to be more selective in terms of relationships that carry higher deposit. In addition to that, we are also looking to expand our deposit gathering activity nationally with a more focused approach within the commercial business specific sales force dedicated to growing deposit. Deposits in either down environment or up environment with respect to rates will continue to be a priority for us because we do believe that as I said earlier that core profitability depends upon our ability to fund asset growth through core deposits. So, regardless of what the Fed environment may look like, our focus on deposit growth will not change. Erika Najarian : Got it. And if Fifth Third is no longer subject to CCAR LCR, how does that change how you manage capital? And also Jamie, with the 120 LCR, if you would remind us if any meaningful impact from MB, how differently you would manage your liquidity if you no longer had to adhere to modified LCR? Tayfun Tuzun : So, let me make the capital comment, and then I will turn it over to Jamie to comment on liquidity side. Our near to medium-term goal, obviously, is to get down to the 9% to 9.5% capital. At this point, Erika, we\u2019re not quite sure exactly what the regulatory environment will look like, but that goal is independent from what happened on the regulatory side. Clearly, there may be some process changes, et cetera, but we will continue to maintain a focus on managing our exposure to downturns in riskier environment. And at this point we believe that 9 to 9.5% is the right level, regardless of what they happen on the regulatory side. Jamie on the liquidity side? Jamie Leonard : Erika, on year-end LCR for Fifth Third, you can see the strength in the 128% number, which is elevated beyond our targeted operating range of 110 to 115 is where we would like to operate the Company. But we have had to add level one HQLA in advance of the MB acquisition because their portfolio simply is not invested in level one, given that they are not subject to the LCR. So, post MB until the LCR were to go away, we will operate in that 110 to 115 range. But as a result of the build-up in our securities book, we\u2019re at roughly 23% securities of total assets; post acquisition that number will decline probably to the 21% of total asset range as a result of the build-up on our side, therefore freeing up some liquidity post combination. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us -- obviously credit quality is spectacular for you guys and many of your peers; as you mentioned, you\u2019re going to go back 20 years to see similar numbers. And back then, Fifth Third was always considered a very strong underwriter. What\u2019s making it so good today? It\u2019s obviously I know your underwriting standards but what else is contributing that you guys see to make credit so good today for your folks that again you kind of go back 20 years to find comparable numbers? Frank Forrest : This is Frank. Let me take that. Again, we\u2019ve been very deliberate over the last three to four years to reposition our portfolio. And as Greg took over as CEO, our objective is to make sure that we are very, very good through cycles. If you look from a historical perspective going back prior to the downturn, that wasn\u2019t necessarily the case. So, we know how important it is to be consistent and be very good. And so, a lot of it is repositioning and make sure that we\u2019ve got the proper balance between, both the consumer and the commercial side and also to make sure that those areas where they tend to spike up due to cyclicality from downturns and we are better positioned. Commercial real estate for example, as we have talked about before, we have less commercial real estate by any measurement than all of our peers; and leverage we\u2019ve been working that down to I think of the rate appropriate level over the last three years. And Lars is doing a really good job of growing the middle market book which provides more granularity against the corporate book that\u2019s performing exceptionally well, primarily investment grade. So, very intently focus by the entire management team here to make sure that we are delivering through consistent cycles with one probably coming up in the next couple of years and we have done that again by I think with the very-disciplined approach and managing the portfolio through concentration limits and KRIs [ph] and better distribution of risk. Greg Carmichael : The only thing I would add is as we went into 2016, we made a conscious decision to be good through the cycle. Now, we had to take next important decision, so we pushed out over $5 billion commercial loan. A lot of that was leveraged loans, commodity lending and so forth that we exited that didn\u2019t meet our risk return profile. So, you start to see the outcomes of that not only just in our credit but also in our yields in the relations that we\u2019re banking today. So, it\u2019s very different than we were doing in the past. Higher quality -- higher sustainability more consistent performance through the cycle. Frank Forrest : One other thing I would add on that, one of the benefits of that balance sheet optimization was freeing up resources so that we could become more productive. And we are seeing that in improved operating leverage. In fact, our relationship managers productivity is up about 15% in 2018 over \u201817; that's the third year in a row where we've been able to reallocate resources, as we continue to see asset quality strengthen and we can put more on the line with our clients while still staying very-disciplined on client selection, managing that portfolio. Gerard Cassidy : And as a follow-up on credit, what kind of influence do you think the CCAR process has had on you, not so much your peers because you obviously can't comment on them, but going through the CCAR, has that contributed to the strength as well in your guys thinking? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, absolutely. This is Tayfun. I'll answer that very, very confidently. It has been a positive influence because we\u2019ve been able to look at different portfolios and the contribution of those portfolios, the future losses and the impact on capital. We have made some good decisions to exit certain businesses because from what we've seen in terms of what it would mean to capital ratio. So, that all hangs together, and I have to tell you that that's the reason why we would not abandon our stress analysis even in the absence that if the regulators decide to change the current process. Gerard Cassidy : And then, just as a second question. Obviously, speaking of 20 years ago, profitability for the industry you guys\u2019 was much higher. We all recognize that return on equity levels due to the extra capital you and your peers have to carry, post the financial crisis, will probably not be reached at the levels that we saw back in the late 1990s. The ROAs back then for you folks at one point you got into the 2s. What do you think peak ROA could be for you guys? I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be in the high 1s, but is there still movement upside into the mid-1s for profitability number? Tayfun Tuzun : Well, our expectation is that we would reach mid-1s. Right? So, when you look at it including the MB acquisition, unless the environment significantly changes, we would expect to reach the mid1s. Beyond that, it becomes difficult because then you get into the point in cycle with respect to credit and interest rates. But, we will take it year-end time and we will try to achieve our targets but we clearly are on the upward side. Greg Carmichael : Gerard, the only thing I would add, we\u2019ve communicated earlier that the combined franchise with MB Financial, as we look at that in 2020, the ROA range we\u2019ve put out there is 1.55% to 1.65% to give you some indication where we think we\u2019re heading. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Christopher Marinac : Thanks. I also had a credit quality question, just to follow up on our Gerard\u2019s comments here. Do you think that the economic outlook this year allows classified and criticized to fall or is it more of a stable year with just modest changes as time progresses? Frank Forrest : It\u2019s hard to imagine that it\u2019s going to get much better than it is. When you get to a below 4% criticized base, based on my long history, that\u2019s about as good as it\u2019s probably going to look. If we get well below that, then you\u2019re probably not classifying your loans correctly. So, the outlook right now for 2019 for us is steady state. We might see a slight uptick depending on where rates are and where the economy goes, but we\u2019re in a much better place than we were. I mean two and half, three years ago, we were running at close to 7.5% criticized, which was one of the highest than almost all of our peers today. Our number of 3.3% is one of the very best of all of our peers. So, again, I think it speaks highly of the deliberate pace that we\u2019ve had to make sure that we reduce the risk in our portfolio and we feel good about it. But below 4% is hard to imagine that we get much better that from an industry perspective. Greg Carmichael : And Chris, I also want to highlight, we do actually quote this almost every opportunity we find, but we have the lowest CRE exposure amount in the peer group. So, when you think about where we are in the cycle and the asset classes that would be subject to deterioration depending upon how that cycle moves forward. That is not getting enough attention from our perspective. That significantly alters the behavior of our balance sheet today relative to our experience going into and past the crisis. Lars Anderson : The point I\u2019ll make on CRE, as we\u2019ve talked before, it\u2019s primarily a portfolio of both national and large developers who have very diversified large balance sheets. So, we're very confident based on client selection that we\u2019ve focused on, large -- the things focused on in the last two to three years that we\u2019ve banking with right people and that we\u2019re successful through cycles. We do have exposure at local levels but we don't have significant exposure to smaller developers, who could have liquidity issues in a very quick period of time. So, we feel very good about, one, the quality of both; and two, we\u2019re very deliberate that we're comfortable with where we are relative to the total exposure today. Frank Forrest : And I would say, Chris, if you look at our construction portfolio, you saw that that was stable on a linked quarter basis. Our commercial mortgage was up slightly, but that is not an area that we would see contributing significantly in the future, in \u201819 to the growth of the commercial bank. In fact you could see that begin to decline as a number of asset classes such as urban luxury living, big portion, going back a number of years ago will continue to mature, payoff move to the permanent market and that construction portfolio will begin to decelerate. Operator : Your last question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : Just to follow up on credit one more time. I noticed that you mentioned that there was no real change or outlook on your credit mark for MBFI last quarter. But this quarter, we\u2019re starting to see pickup in nonperforming and problem loans and MBFI, in fact they were up roughly 25% quarter-over-quarter, or up excluding purchase account accretion about 50% since the deal was announced. Could you give a little bit of comment on your expectations for the credit mark, if that has changed or the credit outlook at MBFI? Greg Carmichael : Not at this point, not until we close the transaction, I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate to do it. But, what I will say is that again this portfolio, it\u2019s a fairly small and it\u2019s a very diversified portfolio compared to ours; it\u2019s one-seventh the size of our book. They\u2019re mostly small balance, lower in business banking and middle market loans, so very granular. It\u2019s something that we still feel very comfortable with and we could manage it and hold it into our credit disciplines as we go forward, but really do not want to comment on another public company until we close relative to the specifics of your question. Operator : Your last question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: I know you guys have been trying to grow the credit card and kind of all other consumer book. Can you just remind us the targeted customer base there and how big these portfolios get? They are obviously quite small, but they do kick off a higher yield and little bit higher charge-off. Just remind us the strategy there and any kind of concentration limit that you might put in place? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Matt, our target audience continues to be prime, super prime type of range, so that there is no change with respect to the credit exposure profile. With respect to targets, concentration targets, as you said that these levels are very low, and as a matter of fact, as you know, our total consumer book has been declining and now we've been trying to achieve a better balance between consumer and commercial exposures. Credit cards have a significant room to grow. We are little over $2 billion; unsecured loans do as well. We do have as you may remember, something, $2 billion type of target with respect to the GreenSky loans but these levels do not create any concerns with respect to exposure limits in unsecured consumer lending, given especially the profile of the borrowers. Matt O\u2019Connor: Could you just remind us how big is the GreenSky book, and of the $2.2 billion, other consumer, what else is in there? Tayfun Tuzun : $1.22 billion was the balance at the end of the quarter, increased guide. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then, if\u2026 Tayfun Tuzun : And the other stuff, we have basically collection of unsecured exposures that have been organically created exposures in our private banking with respect to borrowers from that side as well. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And obviously that mix shift is one of the drivers of the NIM that we\u2019ve been seeing, as you\u2019ve been running off some of the consumer and growing those portfolios? Tayfun Tuzun : Remember that that\u2019s been deliberate, right? Because when we decided to reduce auto loan exposures from where we were in 2015, the concern was that we were not getting paid in that business appropriately. And we\u2019re also -- as we reiterated, we\u2019re not portfolio in conforming mortgage loans. So, all of that clearly plays a positive role with respect to NIM expansion. So, yes, we agree with that. Chris Doll : Thank you everyone for your interest in Fifth Third. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to contact the IR department, and we\u2019ll be happy to assist you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen. This is your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Chris Doll : Thank you, Laurie. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we\u2019ll be discussing our financial results for the first quarter of 2019. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third\u2019s performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I\u2019m joined by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported first quarter 2019 net income available to common shareholders of $760 million or $1.12 per share. Our reported EPS included a positive $0.49 impact from several items shown on Page 3 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted first quarter earnings were $0.63 per share. Tayfun will discuss unique items in great detail in his prepared remarks. But the most notable items impacting our core results were merger-related items associated with the acquisition of MB Financial and the gain from the sale of remaining stake in Worldpay. The sale of our final Worldpay stake during the first quarter marks the end of a chapter for Fifth Third. Since a joint venture in 2009 we have realized approximately $7 billion in pre-tax income for our shareholders with an additional $900 million remaining in TRA cash flows. At the end, a new chapter for us was our successful closing of the MB Financial acquisition this quarter. On March 22, the acquisition added nearly $20 billion in assets, 86 full service banking centers and over 185,000 new clients and 2,600 new team members with Fifth Third. We\u2019re excited to leverage the enhanced capabilities of our company to better serve our clients. In addition, to draw the customer and banking capabilities, this acquisition generates significant scale in Chicago, a market we entered nearly 20 years ago and know very well. And in fact, Chicago has been our largest retail market for the last 12 years in terms of total deposits prior to this transaction. With the addition of MB\u2019s balance sheet, we will rank number two in middle market relationships and number three in the retail banking in the Chicago market. We look forward to successfully converting the majority of all the systems and processes in early May. After the May conversion, MB customers will have access to Fifth Third\u2019s expanded products and services including our advanced visual capabilities, sophisticated commercial and wealth plan solutions and access to our expanded network of over 50,000 fee-free ATMs. After the previously announced branch consolidations, our retail customers will have access to nearly 200 branches on the largest networks in the Chicago area. We believe that Fifth Third Chicago is now in a significant position of strength that will allow us to generate strong deposit, household and revenue growth moving forward. As we have mentioned previously, the vast majority of the core systems are migrating to Fifth Third technology which reduces the complexity of the conversion. We have run three very successful mock conversions over the past several months of only more than 600 people from both companies. We are confident that the conversion process will continue to proceed smoothly. As previously committed, we expect the fully realized $255 million in expense synergies by the end of the first quarter of 2020 will provide quarterly updates on our progress for achieving our expense targets. We have a tremendous opportunity to leverage the complementary products and capabilities of the two franchises. We will leverage MB\u2019s expertise of lower middle market lending, asset-based funding and leasing while offering our new clients from MB more sophisticated Fifth Third digital banking, treasury management, capital markets and advisory products and services. We remain very confident in the growth prospects of the combined company. To-date, we have experienced no material attrition of key leaders, relationship managers or clients. Furthermore, 7 of the 13 key leaders in our Chicago region are former MB employees leading areas such as commercial middle market, equipment finance and asset-based lending. We also continue to expect to generate meaningful revenue synergies from the acquisition going to approximately $65 million in annual pre-tax income net of expenses in 2022. While we have devoted significant amount of energy on the MB acquisition to make sure we deliver for our clients and for shareholders, we have also remained very focused on executing on our key strategic parties to produce strong financial results. Our first quarter financial performance was strong. For the quarter, loan growth, D growth and NII exceeded our previous guidance on a standalone basis. Expenses were also favorable to our prior guidance excluding the impacts of the MB Financial transaction. We generated year-over-year core positive operating leverage every quarter in 2018 and we have continued that momentum in the first quarter of 2019 again achieving year-over-year positive operating leverage. Credit quality metrics also remained solid. Net charge-offs were 32 basis points including just 11 basis points in our commercial portfolio which is at the lowest level in 20 years. In the NPL, NPA and criticized asset ratios all remained near the multiyear low levels. Economic conditions remained generally stable but consistent with other banks our clients continue to be cautious with respect to their growth plans. We remain steadfast in our disciplined approach to client selection. We will not chase loan growth for the sake of growing but rather maintain our focus on balancing credit quality and profitability. Now moving on to our strategic priorities. At Fifth Third, we are positioned to drive improved profitability while continuing to manage our risk exposures currently. First, we continue to leverage technology including our data analytics capabilities to accelerate our digital transformation while continuing to monetize our systems and infrastructure. We are committed to delivering a digital banking experience that is simple, seamless and secure. We are investing in digital technologies that will deliver innovative and convenient solutions that will enhance our customers\u2019 ability to meet their financial goals. Our new Dobot app is one example of this which helps users set goals and save through small automated transfers. Since the launch at the beginning of the year we have had over 37,000 downloads of the app across 40 states with user setting saving goals of over $150 million. In addition, we are investing so that the majority of our core products can be originated digitally within the next 24 months. Leveraging our buy, partner, build approach we will continue to deliver digital solutions that will enhance our customers\u2019 financial lives. Second, we continue to invest in our business to drive profitable organic growth. We have made several recent investments in technology and talent to support our growth plans. These investments include key additions to our sales teams in strategic areas of the company such as middle market lending, we have added high quality audience [ph] in our new geographies including Southern California and Texas. In fact, we now generate approximately 50% of our middle market originations outside of our 10-state retail footprint. Wealth and asset management which had a record year last year, corporate banking with revenues increasing 27% from the first quarter of 2018 including growth in capital markets which was up 19% from a year ago quarter. And in our retail franchise, we continue to generate solid household and deposit growth at 2x the market average. All of these provide evidence that we are delivering on our commitments to diversify revenue and accelerate growth. Our third priority is to expand our market share in key geographies. With the acquisition of MB providing the necessary scale in the Chicago market, we are continuing to optimize our branch network to support our faster growing Southeast markets while also rationalizing our legacy footprint. Lastly, we are focused on maintaining our disciplined approach to credit expense to capital management throughout the company for our discipline remains as important now as ever. We are focused on maximizing our returns to the full cycle rather than generating lower quality loan growth. We continue to expect a generally stable environment throughout the rest of 2019 and not wavering in our approach to managing our exposures. We have demonstrated our ability to diligently managing our expenses while investing in areas of strategic importance. We remain focused on generating positive operating leverage in all environments. We continue to stay disciplined on capital allocation. We believe our current capital levels are elevated relative to our risk profile and we prioritize capital deployment strategies based on what we believe will achieve a highest long-term return to our shareholders. Our clearly defined strategic priorities are designed to enhance revenue growth as well as generate expense efficiencies in order to meet our financial and strategic objectives. We have achieved significant expense efficiencies over the last two years as reflected in our ability to consistently generate positive operating leverage. We continue to generate strong financial results in the first quarter with adjusted PPNR of 19% since the first quarter of 2018 and adjusted efficiency ratio of 61% increasing over 3.5% year-over-year and continuous stability in our credit quality metrics. We remain very confident in our ability to achieve our financial targets and outperform through this cycle. I\u2019d like to once again thank all of our employees for their hard work, dedication and for always keeping the customer at the center. I was pleased that we were again able to deliver strong financial results and we\u2019re delivering the outcomes as planned. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss the first quarter results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let\u2019s move to the Page 3 of the earnings presentation. As Greg mentioned, we closed the MB Financial acquisition on March 22. Under the terms of the merger agreement, MB stockholders received 1.45 shares of Fifth Third common stock and $5.54 in cash for each share of MB common stock. Total consideration for the transaction was $3.6 billion including $469 million of cash and $3.16 billion of common shares. Upon completion of the merger, Fifth Third issued 122.8 million shares at a closing price of $25.48 per share on March 21. In our earnings materials we have included additional information about the MB acquisition including a summary balance sheet on the acquisition date. The first quarter impact of MB\u2019s business activities for the six business days from closing to quarter end had a negligible impact to our overall profitability metrics but has impacted our balance sheet comparisons for the quarter. As you can see in our disclosures, this quarter has many moving parts due to the nature of the timing of the MB closing and a number of other one-time items. We have given our best effort to clarify the impact so you can also see the underlying trends in our business and compare them to our previous guidance. Fifth Third\u2019s adjusted standalone performance this quarter has exceeded our January guidance with respect to all balance sheet and income statement items. Going forward we continue to expect the impact of MB Financial to provide a meaningful uplift in our financial performance and our guidance incorporates those trends. Also before discussing our financial results, I would like to highlight as we have indicated in our earnings materials that we have two accounting policy conformity changes for the quarter. First, we reclassified the components of lending-related provision into a single measure on our income statement including the provision for unfunded commitments, which was previously reported a non-interest expense. We believe this change will provide a better comparison relative to the vast majority of our peers. Our current quarter efficiency ratio was not affected by this change. Second, the operating lease income in expense related to MB\u2019s leasing business will be shown on a gross basis consistent with Fifth Third\u2019s accounting policy compared to the net basis that MB utilized. This change has no impact on net income. Now turning to the financial highlights of the quarter on Slide 3. Our first quarter results were very strong. As I mentioned, we exceeded our January guidance for loan growth, NII, expenses and fees on an adjusted basis excluding any benefits from the MB Financial acquisition at the end of the quarter. Reported results were positively impacted by the notable items on Page 4 of the presentation, including a $433 million after-tax gain on the sale of our final stake in Worldpay and a $7 million after-tax benefit from our GreenSky equity stake partially offset by a negative $84 million after-tax impact from merger-related items and a $24 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap. Subsequent to quarter end, we sold our remaining GreenSky shares which should result in an immaterial gain for the quarter. We have now exited our equity stakes in all publicly traded companies. Excluding these items, pre-provision net revenue increased 19% year-over-year while the efficiency ratio declined more than 3.5%. All of our adjusted return metrics were strong during the first quarter. Strong revenue growth and disciplined expense management have continued to improve our efficiency ratio and resulted in positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Our credit performance remains solid. Our forward-looking credit metrics remain at nearly 20-year lows as net charge-offs continue to decline during the quarter. Moving to Slide 5. Average sequential loan growth of 3% was partially impacted by the late quarter addition of the MB portfolio. Excluding the impact of MB, total average loans grew 2% sequentially and approximately 4.5% year-over-year led by C&I growth of 8.5%. As we have mentioned recently, our loan performance over the last few quarters is beginning to provide a clearer picture of our longer-term growth potential. Total average commercial loan growth was 4% sequentially or 2% excluding MB exceeding our previous guidance of 1% growth. Originations were up 12% from the prior year with strength in middle market lending as well as in corporate banking. In our commercial business, we continue to benefit from investments in our sales force and the redesign of our mid and back office functions that has helped to increase the time allocated to sales for our existing relationship managers. Total commercial line utilization was relatively flat sequentially on a standalone basis and up 2% with MB. Lower payoffs and paydowns throughout the first quarter also supported net commercial loan growth. Average commercial real estate balances were up 4% compared to last quarter and were flat excluding MB. CRE balances as a percentage of total risk based capital remains very low and in the bottom quartile relative to peers. We currently expect average total commercial loans to grow by approximately 17% on a sequential basis in the second quarter. Given MB\u2019s impact on first quarter average balances, end of period loan growth may give the best representation of our go-forward expectations which we expect to be approximately 1% in the second quarter driven by continued strength in C&I partially offset by declines in commercial construction and large ticket non-relationship commercial lease portfolios. For the full year, we expect average total commercial loans to increase approximately 20% compared to 2018, again impacted by the MB acquisition. This guidance implies that our standalone Fifth Third commercial loan growth outlook for the full year exceeds our previous guidance and preserves the first quarter outperformance for the full year. Average consumer loans, excluding MB, were up about 0.5% sequentially. As we highlighted in our earnings materials, we have combined the MB indirect consumer loan portfolio with our auto loan category. Growth in auto, card and unsecured personal loans were partially offset by declines in home equity and residential mortgage. Similar to prior quarters, this quarter we have elected not to retain fixed rate performing mortgage loans in the current rate environment. Including the impact of MB, average consumer loans increased 1% sequentially. In the second quarter given the impact of the acquired portfolio, we expect total average consumer loan balances to increase approximately 7% sequentially with the same portfolio dynamics that I discussed for the first quarter. The end of period portfolio in the second quarter should increase 1.5% to 2% from the first quarter. For the full year, we expect average total consumer loans to increase 7% to 8% compared to 2018. Similar to commercial loans, this implies a stronger outlook on a standalone basis. We currently expect full year 2019 average total loans to increase approximately 15% to 16% compared to 2018. Average core deposits were up 5% on a year-over-year basis and up 1% compared to the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of MB, average core deposits increased 3% compared to the year-ago quarter and were flat sequentially in a seasonally soft quarter. Performance continued to reflect migration from demand deposits into interest-bearing accounts. Moving on to Slide 6. Compared to the prior quarter, NII increased $1 million including the six-day impact from MB which was $16 million. Our standalone results exceeded our January guidance largely reflecting the stronger loan growth. As we discussed during our earnings call in January, our fourth quarter NIM included a 2 basis point benefit from seasonal items. Adjusting for this impact, the NIM of 3.28% in the current quarter was up 1 basis point from the fourth quarter. Purchasing accounting accretion had a negligible impact in the first quarter. The increase in our NIM would have been higher except for the accelerated long-term debt assurance during the quarter. Compared to the year-ago quarter, net interest income increased $87 million or 9% and the NIM expanded 10 basis points. Adjusting for the six-day impact from MB resulting in a standalone year-over-year NII growth was 7%. Cost of interest-bearing deposits rose 11 basis points quarter-over-quarter below the peer average. On a combined basis, our cumulative deposit beta is in the mid-30s with consumer in the mid-20s and commercial in the high 50s. The December rate hike resulted in a first quarter beta of 39%. While our current outlook does not assume any future rate hikes, we expect a modest continuation in consumer and commercial deposit repricing throughout 2019 with the 39% deposit beta increasing to 53% by the end of the second quarter. We expect the full year 2019 NII to grow 15% to 16% over 2018 without any additional rate hikes and excluding purchase accounting accretion. Our outlook reflects the impact of MB as well as additional loan growth. We expect our second quarter NII to increase about 12% to 13% sequentially reflecting the benefits of our larger earning asset base in day counts partially offset by continued deposit pricing pressures. Our second quarter NIM, excluding purchase accounting accretion, should be up about 4 basis points compared to the first quarter. We expect the NIM on a full year basis to expand about 10 basis points in 2019 excluding the purchase accounting benefit to NIM. We expect purchase accounting accretion to have about a 4 basis point impact on the NIM this quarter and 3 basis points on the full year NIM. Excluding the impact of the listed items, non-interest income increased 3% compared to the year-ago quarter and decreased 6% compared to the prior quarter which included the impact of the Worldpay TRA. The six-day impact of MB on non-interest income was $12 million. Adjusting for the MB impact, our standalone result exceeded our guidance. Corporate banking fees were up 27% compared to the year-ago quarter which exceeded our guidance. Performance compared to the year-ago quarter reflected strong capital markets revenue and increased business lending fees. We currently expect our corporate banking revenue to grow about 20% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter reflecting both the larger client base post MB and improved performance from the initiatives we have previously discussed. Card and processing revenue was flat compared to the year-ago quarter and decreased 6% compared to the prior quarter primarily reflecting seasonality in transaction volumes. Wealth and asset management was up 3% from the prior quarter due to seasonally strong tax-related private client service revenue. Mortgage banking revenue was up 4% sequentially in the first quarter. Origination volume of $1.6 billion was up 5% from last quarter. Gain on sale margin was 176 basis points during the quarter, up 17 basis points sequentially and down 13 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Deposit service charges decreased 4% compared to the year ago quarter and decreased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Performance from the year-ago quarter reflected lower net commercial deposit fees resulting from increased earnings growth. Sequential performance was driven by seasonally lower consumer fees. For the second quarter, we expect total non-interest income to be up 17% to 18% from the adjusted first quarter of 2019 and for the full year we expect total non-interest income to increase approximately 16% from the adjusted 2018 non-interest income. Just as a reminder, these expectations include the grossed up operating lease revenues which is about $90 million in 2019. I would like to highlight that we no longer expect to receive the Worldpay TRA payment in 2019 given the impact of the merger-related expenses from the Vantiv-Worldpay merger completed in January 2018 on the company\u2019s final taxable income. This is just a change in timing. Despite the shift in the timing of expected revenue recognition, we continue to expect to receive over $900 million in TRA cash flows which includes increased cash flows from the final sale of our Worldpay stake. As a reminder, Fifth Third recognizes income during the fourth quarter of the year following the year in which Worldpay recognizes the benefit of the tax deductions and in any tax year where Worldpay does not have sufficient taxable income to utilize the tax attributes, the deductions carry forward. Our previous estimates were based on the assumption that Worldpay would likely have sufficient taxable income in 2018 to utilize the deductions. Once we have a better understanding of the impact of the recently announced FIS-Worldpay transaction, we will update our TRA forecast for 2020 and beyond. First quarter reported expenses included merger-related items from the MB transaction totaling $76 million pre-tax. Excluding these items, expenses were up just 1% from the adjusted first quarter of 2018 including the $20 million in expenses resulting from the six business days of MB carry. Due to the normal seasonal increase in compensation-related expenses in the first quarter, the year-over-year comparisons are more meaningful. The implied standalone Fifth Third run rate expenses actually declined from the year-ago quarter and diligent expense management throughout the bank and the reduction in the FDIC surcharge more than offset the impacts from continued investments in technology and higher compensation from last year\u2019s non-bank acquisition activities. The sequential increase in expenses during the first quarter was primarily attributable to seasonally elevated employee-based expenses which were affected by the timing of compensation awards, the company\u2019s 401(k) match and payroll tax expenses. Furthermore, during the quarter there were a few other expense items that we did not call out specifically that were unique one-time items including deferred compensation mark-to-market and customer derivative valuation adjustments. Therefore, the run rate trends were even better. We will maintain the same focus on expense management throughout 2019 while continuing to invest in our company. Our adjusted efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 61%. The current quarter efficiency ratio is impacted by the seasonal compensation and benefit items I mentioned therefore should improve over the next three quarters. We have established a very clear track record for delivering positive operating leverage and intend to continue for the foreseeable future. We currently expect second quarter expenses to increase about 10% to 12% sequentially from the adjusted first quarter of 2019, excluding the merger-related expenses and CDI amortization expense due entirely to the impact of MB. Our NII, fee and expense outlook for the second quarter should result in an efficiency ratio below 60%. Also, we expect full year 2019 expense growth of approximately 13% from an adjusted 2018 expense base of $3.865 billion, again excluding merger-related expenses and the intangible amortization. As a reminder, due to the change in accounting the incremental MB-related operating expense base is about $75 million higher compared to their historic levels due to the grossed up for operating leases which has no impact on bottom line since the revenue side is also grossed up. Our previous outlook for MB-related expense savings and timing of those savings remain intact. We expect to achieve $255 million in savings by the end of the first quarter in 2020. In addition, we expect our total after-tax merger charges inclusive of actual merger-related charges recognized in current and past periods and projected future charges to be about $250 million after tax. Turning to credit results on Slide 9. First quarter credit results continued to be benign. The criticized asset ratio increased sequentially to 4.35% with Fifth Third standalone ratio essentially flat and remaining at multiyear lows. The increase was caused primarily by the MB portfolio which consists of a greater percentage of a granular well collateralized middle market and business banking exposures. The MB portfolio is tended to carry a higher percentage of criticized assets with lower loss content given prudent advanced rates on tangible assets which we believe will be the result in low net credit losses even under stress consistent with their historical performance. Net charge-offs were $77 million or 32 basis points, down 3 basis points from the prior quarter. The commercial charge-off rate of 11 basis points is at the lowest level in 20 years. The consumer net charge-off ratio of 68 basis points increased slightly compared to the last quarter. Both the NPL ratio of 41 basis points and the NPA ratio of 45 basis points continued to hover near historically low levels. The ALLL ratio declined sequentially to 1.02% impacted by the purchase accounting impacts from the MB acquisition. Excluding these impacts, the ALLL ratio would have been unchanged compared to the prior quarter as the provision for loan losses of $89 million exceeded net charge-offs by $12 million during the quarter driven by strong standalone loan growth. As we remind you every quarter, the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential quarterly fluctuations given current low absolute levels of charge-offs. Turning to Slide 10. Capital levels remained very strong during the first quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 9.7% and our tangible common equity ratio excluding unrealized gains and losses was 8.21%. In addition to the impact of the cash and stock components of the MB acquisition to our capital levels, we also initiated a $913 million accelerated share repurchase near the end of the quarter. As a result of the MB acquisition, issuance net of our buyback activity at the end of the first quarter, common shares outstanding increased almost 93 million shares or 14% compared to the prior quarter. We have provided more information on the share count progression for the first quarter in our appendix slides. As a Category IV bank, Fifth Third was given the option to distribute capital based on a predefined template calculation or undergo the full CCAR 2019 process. As a result of our analysis, the amount of capital that could be returned using the predefined template would likely not have a material difference compared to undergoing the full stress test. As a result, in early April, we submitted our planned capital actions to the Federal Reserve utilizing the template approach. We continue to expect to increase our common dividend in June to $0.24 pursuant to final CCAR 2018 authorization subject to board approval and market conditions and we expect to provide an update to our capital distribution plans once we receive the formal response from the Fed. Additionally, we plan to buyback any amount up to the $433 million after-tax gain generated from our final Worldpay sale. Slide 11 provides a summary of our current outlook. We kept the 2018 references for non-interest income and expense the same as the original guidance to avoid any confusion related to MB\u2019s incremental impact for the partial year. The right-hand side of our outlook highlights our expectations for our three key financial metrics in the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the TRA and the operating lease policy impacts, this guidance is largely unchanged from the outlook we gave in March at our Investor conference prior to the closing of the MB transaction. The slight increase on our full year tax rate is to the higher state tax impact from MB. As a result, we currently expect a ROTCE of 17% or greater and ROA of approximately 1.4% and an efficiency ratio below 56% by the fourth quarter of 2019. In summary, I would like to reiterate a few points. We reported very strong financial results for the first quarter and remain focused on our key strategic priorities to drive the company forward and to outperform through various business cycles. We are focused on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to achieve our financial targets. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open up the call for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Laurie, please open the call up for questions. Operator : All right. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please ask your question. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : I guess, Tayfun, just wanted to ask a little on the fee income guidance for the second quarter and the full year, just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding it correctly given the moving parts of just core Fifth Third and the additional of MBFI and then the accounting change related to the MBFI leases as well. So when you look at the second quarter, I guess given that you\u2019re changing to a gross up or to a gross methodology for the operating lease stuff from MBFI, might have expected it to be a little higher. So I guess I might have expected the guide overall to be a bit higher. I guess if you could just walk through sort of what you see is the main puts and takes as we go into the second quarter please? And then if you can flow that through to the full year as well please? Tayfun Tuzun : Sure. So we really in terms of the standalone Fifth Third performance whether it\u2019s advice to the second quarter or the full year we don\u2019t see a change from our previous guidance and that\u2019s why we wanted to keep if you look at Page 11, we still are using our 2018 base as the same as before. So drivers obviously with respect to our Fifth Third standalone fee growth are largely corporate banking revenues led by capital markets piece. I think wealth is going to likely have a good quarter. And in general once you cross the seasonality with respect to deposit fees going into a stronger quarter for mortgages, those all support a better second quarter performance as we are guiding you here up 12%, 13%. With respect to MB, again, the big change relative to their run rate is going to be the added operating lease revenues, they were recording I think maybe a little over $20 million to $25 million in net performance and that number now for the year is going to about $90 million. So you can probably distribute that amount evenly across the quarters. We do believe that post closing and as well as sort of post conversion which we expect to be in early May, the MB fee income trends to pick up for the rest of the year as their pipelines will now post conversion start building strongly. In terms of the rest of the year for the company, we still expect an economy that is in line with the current level. We expect again corporate revenues to be leader in terms of moving our non-interest income numbers for the year. The big change really when you think about it is the removal of the $29 million of TRA payment in the fourth quarter and it\u2019s just a change in timing. But we believe that there will be some strength in the remaining numbers between now and the fourth quarter, so we expect to make up a good amount of that lost fee income in the second and third quarters. In the fourth quarter though we are going to see lower total fees, which also I\u2019m going to highlight this because it\u2019s important. As you know, the efficiency ratio that we\u2019re guiding to is a little bit different than the efficiency ratio we guided to previously which was under 55%. That $29 million TRA payment and together with the impact of the grossed up operating lease revenues and leases, they have an impact on the efficiency ratio. So in general, our fee guidance continues to remain very close and maybe a little bit higher than what we guided back in January. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Tayfun Tuzun : Sorry about the long response but there\u2019s so many moving parts I just wanted to clarify that. Scott Siefers : No, I understand and appreciate it for those specific reasons. And then if I can sneak in one more. This one\u2019s more sophomoric [ph] but again given all the moving parts. So you\u2019ve got the \u2013 I guess there will be a full quarter addition of the shares from MBFI, then you had the accelerated program and now you\u2019ll be repurchasing presumably the 433 million or so gain with the gain from Worldpay. If you\u2019re comfortable what\u2019s a good approximation of the share count we should be using as we go into the second quarter just given all those moving parts and the different timing of how some of those \u2013 the nuance fits with those things? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, just one comment on the ASR timing of the Worldpay gain buyback. Because of some of the ASR technicalities and dynamics, we will probably be increasing our buybacks with the Worldpay gains more so in sort of the third quarter rather than the second quarter of the year. Jamie, do you want to give a bit more clarity on the share count? Jamie Leonard : Sure. So, Scott, we included on Page 16 in the presentation what we expected this question to be which was just how the shares would work going forward. So we end the quarter at 739 million shares outstanding. The remaining portion of the ASR will retire an incremental 5 million shares in the second quarter. And then to Tayfun\u2019s point should the Worldpay pre-purchases occur in the back half of the year that would have no impact on the second quarter. And then the diluted impact from equity awards typically ranges in the 12 million share range. So if you\u2019re working on the EPS calculation, I bet that should give you enough to narrow in on the outstandings. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay, great. Sorry for a kind of basic one there, but I appreciate it. So thank you guys very much for the color. Greg Carmichael : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Please ask your question. John Pancari : Good morning. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, John. Tayfun Tuzun : Hi, John. John Pancari : On the loan growth side just wanted to see if you can give a little bit more color around the trends you saw in the quarter, they appear to be a little bit stronger than we\u2019re looking for and wanted to get some color on where you\u2019re seeing some of the strength and conversely where you might be seeing a little bit of pullback as you go through the year? Thanks. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. So, John, we were really pleased with the growth that we saw in the first quarter. It exceeded our expectations. Obviously there\u2019s a few moving parts there. Our production was at higher levels than we have seen in most first quarters which is typically seasonally lower. That really benefitted us. Also the disruptions in the capital markets in the fourth quarter that slipped into the first quarter really impacted some of the institutional loan markets. So that muted some of the paydowns that we otherwise may have realized. Our commercial real estate portfolio successfully pivoted as I\u2019ve been sharing with you over the last year or two. We actually saw a little bit of growth in the overall commercial real estate line, but I would underscore we saw a decline in our construction loan portfolio as that gets later in the cycle and we selectively added term, mortgage opportunities that really fit into our late cycle strategy there. So really putting all of that together with a lot of the investments we\u2019ve made in frankly talent, our processes, our redesign, our middle market focus, all those really are coming together and frankly are producing the outcomes that we had hoped for in not just the first quarter but 2019 and beyond. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then separately just wonder if you can give us a little thoughts on any balance sheet actions planned post the MB integration here in terms of any deemphasizes around any of the lending areas as well as on the deposit side the actions there in terms of refining the deposit mix? Thanks. Tayfun Tuzun : Not really. There\u2019s really no discrete items I think we had positioned for the investment portfolio ahead of the closing on our side and with liquidation of most of their investment portfolio. In terms of the loan portfolios, clearly all commercial portfolios are going to be subject to in cooperation and drive business, so we expect to grow their business along with ours. We are obviously entering a couple of new indirect consumer businesses; RV, motorcycles and recreational. There are no immediate changes. We are going to evaluate that business over the next number of quarters. And unless we see any changes from what they have seen, our goal is to maintain those businesses as well. So no big changes. On the deposit side, I do believe that the combined company will perform stronger in Chicago. On the consumer end obviously we\u2019re bringing a lot more products and the digital access that should benefit the overall consumer base in Chicago. And on the commercial side I think we also bring over better corporate treasury management capabilities. So we would expect for commercial and consumer deposit growth to benefit from this. John Pancari : Got it, okay. Thanks, Tayfun. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: I was just wondering if you can elaborate a bit on the criticized assets from MB. I think if you back into the math it seems like it\u2019s about 9% of the commercial book and I\u2019m wondering how that compared to a year ago? And is there any impact from closing the deal that would have impacted those numbers? Frank Forrest : Hi, Matt. It\u2019s Frank. First, all banks have slightly different risk rating scales. None are exactly the same. And so what we\u2019ve done through due diligence in the first month after closing is we\u2019ve effectively mapped over their ratings to our scale. So a lot of it\u2019s definitional. As Tayfun mentioned before though, keep in mind the bulk of their portfolio is small business and it\u2019s smaller in the middle market and those tend to have a higher or more critical risk profile. But the difference here when you look beyond the criticized asset levels is that if you looked historically at MB over the last 40 years with one outlier quarter in the third quarter of last year which was really just one large leverage loan which is not who they are [indiscernible] transaction that we don\u2019t anticipate going forward, their overall loss rates are very low. They\u2019ve managed the book really well and they support that with a really strong asset-based lending team and a leasing team. And so they\u2019ve got a really very, very good collateral expertise. The loans were well secured. Their managed appropriately. And at the end of the day, so again it\u2019s a small business middle market book. Their loss rates are very well in line with our expectations. We\u2019re not changing our credit loss outlook at all for the year. We\u2019re very comfortable with where we are. The mapping exercises are over. And when you look at the combined company, we\u2019re still \u2013 our 4.5% roughly criticized assets are well in line with our peers and we expect that to be stable as we go forward. So we\u2019re really pleased with them. They\u2019ve got a very impressive group of relationship managers who are dedicated to the company and their client base is \u2013 I\u2019ve been with them for a long time and they overall manage it very well. So we right-sized what we needed to do. That\u2019s no unexpected in any acquisition and hopefully you\u2019ll see those changes as we go forward. We look to the future with a lot of confidence and we\u2019re excited about our new teammates and what they bring to Fifth Third. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I think in the opening comments there was some mention about continued emphases or expansion in the Southeast and just wonder if you could elaborate on that? Is it still a de novo strategy or are you open to some filling or larger deals in the Southeast? Thank you. Greg Carmichael : This is Greg. Right now what we\u2019re really focused on is just being additive to the markets that we\u2019re in the Southeast already today that we don\u2019t have the distribution level we\u2019ve needed to best serve that market. We\u2019re growing deposits in the Southeast market by 7%. That\u2019s 2x where we\u2019re growing our legacy markets. So what we\u2019re really going to do is optimize \u2013 continue to optimize our legacy branches and transition about 100 plus branches into our Southeast markets, but that\u2019s going to be on a de novo basis. Right now it\u2019s really focused on filling in where we have opportunities through a de novo strategy, not through an acquisition strategy and we\u2019re very comfortable with that plan and we\u2019re off to a good start this year of identifying those opportunities, getting the land acquired and moving forward with our build plans. Those branches as I mentioned before will be much smaller, higher self-serve, lower staffing levels, small footprints, lower cost to operate [indiscernible] but a very efficient branch where we need geography in the Southeast and markets we\u2019re already in, it will be a de novo strategy moving forward. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Ken Usdin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. A question on credit and credit loss expectations. You really only mentioned about provisioning with growth. So just with the pro forma, your loss ratio has been in like the 30-ish \u2013 low 30s basis points range. How do we think about the loss trajectory now with MBFI onboard? Should we be thinking about it on the same with pro forma, does it go lower, how do you expect NCOs to traject I guess would be the base question? Tayfun Tuzun : Ken, we don\u2019t project losses, we\u2019ve never done that. But in general, MB does not have an incremental add to our loss ratio. To project the trends, they obviously dilute the portfolio a little bit with sort of the denominator. The trends should mainly reflect Fifth Third\u2019s loss rates. And as you said, the last sort of three quarters we\u2019ve been between 30 and 35 basis points. Right now we have no information to believe that that trend should be changing. So that 30 to 35 basis points current range is probably a good range for the rest of the year. Ken Usdin : Right. But that\u2019s for the Fifth Third because the denominator -- Tayfun Tuzun : In total. It could be a little closer to the lower end of it, I don\u2019t know exactly incrementally. Ken Usdin : Okay. Second question, I know you alluded to it but we didn\u2019t see it in the slides. The 2020 outlook and the metrics that you provided I know that there\u2019s some changes because of the accounting stuff, but can you just talk about the tracking towards that, especially the ROE guide that you had for 2020 and it\u2019s a big gap from where you are today and where you\u2019re expecting to end the year and just the confidence that you have in terms of getting to that outlook as you look for full year '20? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, it\u2019s a little too early to give specific to 2020 guidance. But our expectations with respect to the year have not changed. There\u2019s just a little bit of a change here in the fourth quarter with TRA. But with respect to the contribution that we\u2019re getting from MB and standalone performance trends, I think everything is pretty much in place. So we\u2019re still guiding to the same trends. As the year progresses, we will be able to give you a little bit better guidance. Obviously it\u2019s only been a couple of weeks since we closed this transaction. So I\u2019d like to get a little bit time under our belt in order to give you more specific guidance. But nothing has changed compared to what we thought previous to the close of the transaction. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : I just wanted to make sure we were thinking about the capital return correctly. If we filled in the numbers and the template correctly, we\u2019re getting to template capital return of about 2.65 billion, 2.7 billion and I wanted to understand if that\u2019s a ballpark number relative to how you filled out the template? And then wanted to confirm that the 433 million would be on top of that capacity? Jamie Leonard : Erika, it\u2019s Jamie. Most folks that I\u2019ve seen have calculated a template payback capacity for Fifth Third in the $2 billion range excluding Worldpay. And so that\u2019s the ballpark I would \u2013 I think you should \u2013 your number appears to be a little bit on the high side ex Worldpay. Erika Najarian : Okay, got it. And just my follow-up question on the margin. I just wanted to make sure that we were thinking about a base of 322 for 2018, then 10 points of natural accretion from that plus 3 basis points of purchase accounting. And just underneath there could we get a little bit more color on how you expect deposit costs to trend? Heard you loud and clear Tayfun on the prepared remarks. And also Jamie how you\u2019re managing the securities portfolio from here given ever-changing expectations for the yield curve? Jamie Leonard : Sure. I\u2019ll take a stab, but I think there were three or four questions in there and if I miss any, let me know. In terms of deposit costs, we would expect as Tayfun mentioned in the first quarter we had an 11 basis point increase in interest-bearing core deposit costs during the quarter, up from 88 basis points in the fourth quarter to 99. And then the MB portfolio was priced relatively in line with ours. They were about 91 basis points on interest-bearing core deposit costs at the end of the year. So given the beta that Tayfun mentioned, the upper 11 we felt good about the performance in the deposit book. And then as we turn towards the second quarter with a little bit of the tail on deposit rates, we would expect that interest-bearing core deposit costs to be up 3 to 4 basis points in the second quarter. And so when you look at the NIM outlook, as you mentioned, we\u2019re going from 328 to 332 exclusive of the purchase accounting benefit and then the 332 should be fairly stable throughout the back half of the year which gives you your full year average. In terms of the securities portfolio, we repositioned a lot ahead of closing the transaction, as Tayfun mentioned. There\u2019s a little bit of treasury bills still remaining, about $800 million or so that\u2019s been used to collateralize municipal deposits at MB that we will most likely have runoff in the second quarter. So the portfolio on an average basis will be up a little bit but not as much as you might be modeling such that our interest earning asset forecast for the second quarter would be up 10% to 11%, so loan growth obviously ahead of that and then the securities portfolio relatively flat during the quarter. And then as the year progresses we will look to be opportunistic either to add additional hedges or add a little bit investment portfolio leverage if the opportunities present themselves. But if not, we\u2019re very comfortable with our 325 to 329 yield on the investment portfolio and fairly stable balances from here on out. Maybe this is also a good time since if the question doesn\u2019t get asked, I want to get this out. In terms of the PAA accretion versus the CDI amortization, we expect those two line items to neutralize each other. So out of the two we don\u2019t see much of an impact on the bottom line so that you guys can also model that appropriately. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. That was helpful. Thanks again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Please ask your question. Saul Martinez : Hi. Good morning. A couple merger accounting questions because those are so much fun. I just want to get my numbers straight, Tayfun. The PAA adds about 4 bips to 2Q NIM and 3Q to the full year. By my math that\u2019s about something like 14 million, 15 million in incremental NII per quarter and 40 million to 50 million for the full year. Is that a ballpark? Tayfun Tuzun : That\u2019s right. Very close, yes. Saul Martinez : Okay. And I couldn\u2019t find what the final credit mark was. I think when you announced it, it was 1.7% and I couldn\u2019t reconcile it with the tangible book roll forward in the appendix. But is that more or less what ended up being sort of the final credit mark on the MB book? Jamie Leonard : Saul, it\u2019s Jamie. The goodwill impact in the roll forward that you see reflects the preliminary credit and rate marks, about 360 million and about 100 million of that is allocated to the PCI non-accretable yield portfolio. And so then the residuals is then the rate and credit mark on the accretable yield portion and that\u2019s where when you look at the contractual maturity of MB\u2019s loan book of 5.5 years that\u2019s where it drives your 15 million a quarter PAA. Saul Martinez : Okay. Jamie Leonard : So the one caveat since we\u2019re in the bowels of merger accounting is that all of these numbers are preliminary and are based on the contractual maturities obviously actual portfolio cash flows and any final goodwill adjustments over the range of the year will move it around a little bit. But I think you\u2019re using the 15 million a quarter as a good baseline for now. Saul Martinez : Okay. Jamie Leonard : And CDI was about $180 million. Saul Martinez : And the CDI\u2019s about $180 million, okay. All right. And I think you may have answered this in the prior question but I think your initial guide for CDI was over 10 years. That\u2019s still kind of the [indiscernible] following that? Jamie Leonard : So the one change that is made from our original estimates, we had assumed a 10-year some of your digits. After going through the portfolio, we ended up selecting a 7.5-year life to the CDI. It\u2019s 183 million CDI over 7.5 years which translates to about $40 million impact this year and that\u2019s driven by their business banking and lower middle market focus has a higher turnover rate in the deposit book than what our book does, which is understandable given that our book is heavier weighted to consumer as well as upper end of middle market and large corporate. So that was the one change from the model last year was going from 10 years to 7.5 years. Saul Martinez : Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. I appreciate it. And then just really quickly a final question on credit. The card NCO, I know it\u2019s a small part of your book but the card NCO rate really ticked up and I think it was 33 million in absolute numbers which is nicely higher to like 40% to 45% of your overall NCOs. Is there anything there that we should be thinking about or that you could just comment on what\u2019s transpiring in the card portfolio? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, just a couple of things. Obviously it came in a little bit higher than we expected. And when we looked at the details, there are two portfolios which is about 15% of the total loans that resulted in about 30% of the charge-offs. The testing pools that we started out, as you know we\u2019ve been working on the legal platforms starting in 2017 and fine-tuning our Fed. So there were a few tests that we ran back in '17. And the second portfolio that contributed a little bit heavier were the early online originations. So if you were to exclude those I think the charge-off trends have been very much in line with the rest of the industry in the last sort of two years or so since the beginning of '17, charge-offs have come up about 40 basis points excluding those. And we expect as those two portfolios continue to amortize, we expect the charge-offs continue to come down during the rest of the year. Saul Martinez : Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please ask your question. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning. I apologize if you guys addressed this already since I got on the call a little later. Can you give us some color on what you\u2019re seeing in the underwriting trends for credit, particularly in the commercial side? And then, Tayfun, just to follow up on your last comment regarding the online credit card portfolio having some higher charge-offs. Can that be extrapolated into other types of online lending or have you guys seen any trends there as well? Tayfun Tuzun : No. We don\u2019t have enough of online originations in other products for us to comment on the extrapolation, Gerard. So I don\u2019t have any details on that or more information to help you out with that one. In terms of commercial trends, Frank or Lars? Frank Forrest : It\u2019s a good question and it\u2019s a challenging environment. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard that on most of the calls. But as we said before and as Greg said in his opening comments, we continue to be I think very disciplined. We\u2019re entirely focused on clients that we know very well. Client selection is the key to everything you do. And we\u2019ve I think maintain very prudent structures on our credit. We have covenants on our credits and the vast majority unlike where some of the trends are going. So I would tell you our underwriting hadn\u2019t really changed. It shouldn\u2019t change. It\u2019s consistent. And that\u2019s how we continue to be confident that we\u2019ll be very successful through changing economic cycles. I don\u2019t know if Lars has anything to add. Lars Anderson : Gerard, I have not seen any changes frankly in the market. It\u2019s obviously very, very competitive. We do have obviously a broader set of industry verticals where we bring more expertise, our asset-based funding. What MB is bringing to us is just going to strengthen our position to manage risk, but to Frank\u2019s point we feel very comfortable with our client selection underwriting and we haven\u2019t seen any substantial shifts. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up question, obviously there\u2019s been some talk recently by different Presidents within the Federal Reserve about the possibility that they may start cutting rates this year similar to what Greenspan did in 1994, '95 following that tightening cycle. If inflation is, let\u2019s say, 1% or 1.5%, if we were to see a Fed funds rate cut in the fourth quarter, let\u2019s say, of this year, can you guys share with us what that would do to some of your net interest revenue assumptions? Jamie Leonard : Yes, Gerard, it\u2019s Jamie. We forecast the rate cuts would be 2 basis points of NIM erosion. And obviously in the fourth quarter of 2018 we took some pretty good steps to hedge our down rate risk. But as you see in our disclosures it\u2019s still certainly a top risk that we\u2019re mindful of and obviously would have goals this year to further increase the hedging program if the opportunities present themselves. But if those opportunities aren\u2019t there and the Fed were to cut rates, we currently model a 43% beta in the down rate. Perhaps we could do a little bit better than that, but we would expect a 2 basis point hit to NIM as a result. Gerard Cassidy : Right. And it sounded like you \u2013 the deposit betas may come down maybe more quickly in a rate cutting environment. Jamie Leonard : Yes, the last couple of moves up have been as Tayfun said in his opening remarks in the 50 to 60 range the past two cuts up. So if we were able to mimic that on the way down, we would certainly do better than what our asset sensitivity disclosures reflect which is a linear 43% on the way down. Gerard Cassidy : Great. I appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran from Autonomous. Your line is now open. Brian Foran : Hi. How are you doing? Greg Carmichael : Good. Brian Foran : So I guess one of the challenges is just kind of getting people thinking about the earnings power on a consistent basis. As you look at Slide 11 and the way you\u2019ve laid this out excluding PAA, excluding merger and TRA and CDI, is this kind of how you\u2019re going to be thinking about adjusted EPS going forward? And if we\u2019re trying to think about it on a comparable basis, is this kind of a template in your mind, setting aside the actual numbers just like the definitions with the line items? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, I think that\u2019s right. In terms of where we anchor these targets we\u2019ve said for the last three years that our goal is to perform at the higher end of the peer group distribution. When you actually setup the structure of your financial guidance and provide quantitative support for those, they are somewhat environment dependent. These are not meant to give perspective during a recession, et cetera. But in all environments in terms of relative performance, these quantitative targets should be good targets for the long term. Brian Foran : And then if I just think about the ROA for 4/2/19, so the 1.4 now versus the 1.5 before that squiggly line, so it\u2019s kind of maybe just rounding up basis points. So we\u2019ve got the 5 basis point impact from the TRA change. What else changed between the 1.5 in March and the 1.4 now? Tayfun Tuzun : The balance sheet is a little bit larger in terms of the size. That\u2019s probably the biggest impact behind that along with the TRA payment. Brian Foran : Okay. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll hand it back over to Chris Doll for closing remarks. Chris Doll : Thank you, Laurie, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR department and we\u2019ll be happy to assist you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you everyone for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp\u2019s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s program over to Mr. Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Chris Doll : Thank you, Jay. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Today, we\u2019ll be discussing our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third\u2019s performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I\u2019m joined by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2019 net income available to common shareholders of $427 million or $0.57 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.14 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release. [Technical Difficulty] mostly due to merger-related expenses associated with MB Financial. Excluding these items, our adjusted second quarter earnings were $0.71 per share. Our financial results were very strong, exceeded our previous guidance, and reflect the progress we are making on our four strategic priorities : leverage technology to accelerate digital transformation, invest to drive organic growth and profitability, expand market share in key geographies, and maintain credit, expense, and capital discipline. The strong performance also reflects our continued focus on driving profitable revenue growth, prudently managing our expenses, and the improved profitability resulting from MB Financial. During the quarter, we completed the MB Financial customer conversion [ph], which represents a significant milestone. We remain very optimistic about our post acquisition growth prospects both in our retail and commercial franchises. Additionally, net interest income, fee income, and expenses all performed better than our April expectations. As a result, our adjusted efficiency ratio improved more than 250 basis points from a year-ago quarter to 58.5%. Our net interest margin, which include the expected positive impact from MB Financial, expanded 9 basis points and was in line with our previous guidance despite the challenging interest rate environment. Net charge offs of 29 basis points improved sequentially and year-over-year reflecting the ongoing benign credit environment in previous balance sheet actions. Our adjusted ROTCE, excluding the impact of AOCI, due to the significant unrealized investment portfolio in cash flow hedge gains was 15.8% in the second quarter.  Before providing an update on the progress related to MB Financial and our key strategic priorities, I\u2019d like to make a few observations about the macroeconomic environment. As I mentioned at a recent investor conference, we continue to see a generally healthy economic backdrop. Consumers continue to benefit from a combination of a strong labor market and limited inflationary pressures resulting in a strong wage growth. In commercial, banks are being more cautious and have expressed concerns about both current and potentially more punitive future tariffs affecting their growth plans. Due to the higher end-of-quarter paydowns, our loan origination volume was somewhat tempered relative to our previous expectations. However, we continue to have a robust pipeline, particularly in middle market lending, which position us well for the second half of the year. However, we will not chase loan growth for the sake of growing. We will be remaining disciplined in our approach to client selection by focusing on the balance between credit quality and profitability. For instance, we continue to reduce our exposure to non-relationship commercial leases and are maintaining a cautious approach to commercial real estate lending at this point in cycle.  Our balance sheet management philosophy of focusing on improved performance through the full economic cycle positions us well for the future. For the rest of 2019, we continue to expect generally stable credit quality with potentially poor fluctuations given the current low absolute levels of charge-offs. Now, an update on MB Financial acquisition. In early May, we completed the MB customer conversion. We successfully converted the majority of systems less than two months after closing the merger. As with any conversion, we continue to follow-up with customers and employees to ensure a smooth transition. We have already completed 46 of the Chicago area branch closures, which consisted of a mix of Fifth Third and MB locations. We will close the last branch related to the transaction by the end of this month. Our best-of-breed approach throughout the acquisition has been the key for the successful outcomes we have achieved so far. As a result, we have experienced no material employee attrition. 91% of the legacy MB employees who were offered position with Fifth Third are still here today. We have also not experienced any material customer or client attrition. In fact, the commercial client attrition rate since the conversion has been lower than the MB legacy attrition rate during the past 24 months leading up to the acquisition and has continued to improve over the past two months. During the second quarter, we have generated end-of-period loan growth in the Chicago region of more than $100 million, and deposit growth of more than $200 million, both increasing approximately 1% from the prior quarter. We continue to receive positive overall feedback from our new MB retail customers. They now have access to nearly 200 branches, the third largest network in the Chicago area in addition to advanced digital capabilities, sophisticated wealth, client solutions, and access towards expanded network of over 50,000 fee-free ATMs. We are focused on maintaining the positive momentum in the Chicago market. We recently unveiled a new Chicago marketing campaign that pays homage to both MB\u2019s legacy and our dedication to serving our commercial clients and has been very well received. In addition, we have begun utilizing our next generation branch design in select Chicago locations. We believe we can offer greater convenience and even better customer experience that\u2019s more efficient and more automated. We remain very pleased with our progress we have made and are confident in our ability to deliver the financial synergies as previously communicated. We continue to expect to realize the $255 million in annual expense synergies by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and have already completed many of the key expense actions. We will achieve approximately 80% of the run-rate savings by year-end. We also continue to expect to generate meaningful revenue synergies from the acquisition. We have been pleased with the initial success turning additional revenue opportunities since the customer conversion.  In our national asset-based lending business, we have already generated a robust pipeline of new client relationships to accelerate future growth. Furthermore, we have seen early signs of success leveraging MB\u2019s leasing capabilities, provide value-added client solutions across our markets. We continue to expect revenue synergies to generate approximately $60 million to $75 million in annual pretax income net of expenses by 2022. In addition to the combined power of our enhanced ABL leasing capabilities, we also expect synergies to come from the complementary focus on middle-market lending and from deploying Fifth Third\u2019s capital markets, digital banking, and treasury management solutions capabilities. We believe that Fifth Third Chicago is now in a significant position of strength that will allow us to generate stronger deposits, household, and revenue growth going forward. While we have devoted a significant amount of energy on the MB acquisition to deliver for our clients, employees, and shareholders, we have also remained focused on executing on our key strategic priorities to produce strong financial results. First, we continue to leverage technology such as our data analytics capabilities to accelerate our digital transformation while continuing to modernize our systems and infrastructure. We are prioritizing investments then improve the customer experience, grow households, and drive further operational efficiencies. We\u2019ve also made considerable investments over the past several years to modernize, simplify, and rationalize our infrastructure. This allows for faster and more data driven insights. We\u2019re also investing in advanced fraud and cybersecurity technologies. As a top area of concern, our investments include providing alerts and real time monitoring to detect and respond to threats quickly. These investments have resulted in a year-over-year decline in fraud losses. Second, we continue to invest in our business to drive profitable organic growth. We have made several recent investments in technology and talent to support our growth plans, including key additions to our sales teams and strategic areas for the company. For instance, in middle market banking, we have added key talent in our new geographies, including California and Texas. Also, in our corporate [Technical Difficulty] outcomes from our ongoing investments in both our sales force and technology and we expect significant growth in our commercial fee-based businesses going forward. In wealth and management, we are focused on leveraging partnerships across other lines of business, as well as in market RIA and town acquisitions to maximize revenue opportunities. We have been very successful generating new business and have experienced positive AUM inflows for six consecutive quarters. In retail, we are successfully leveraging our target of marketing campaigns and our preferred banking program to grow households in the mass affluent segment. As a result of our strategic investments across our retail franchise, we have generated total customer deposit growth of more than 6% over the past year, excluding the benefits from MB, which is significantly greater than almost all our peers. We leverage our one-bank operating model to collaborate across all of our businesses in order to provide holistic client solutions. We will continue to invest in our businesses diversified revenue and accelerate growth. Our third priority is to expand our market share in key existing markets. I know we have the necessary skill in the Chicago market, we will continue to optimize our branch network in our legacy footprint in order to support our faster growing South East markets. By the end of this year, we will have completed approximately two-thirds of the plan 100 legacy branch consolidations and open 25% of the 100 planned openings in the South East markets. Lastly, we are focused on maintaining our disciplined approach to credit, expense, and capital management throughout the company. As I mentioned earlier, credit discipline remains as important now as ever. We are focused on maximizing through-the-cycle returns rather than generating lower quality loan growth. We have demonstrated our ability to diligently manage our expenses, while investing in areas of strategic importance. We remain focused on continuing to generate positive operating leverage. We also continue to allocate and manage our capital prudently. We deploy capital based on what we believe would generate the highest long-term return for our shareholders. Tayfun will share more details regarding our current capital return expectations. Our clearly defined setup strategic priorities were designed to enhance revenue growth, as well as general expense efficiencies in order to meet our financial and strategic objectives.  I like to once thank all of our employers for their hard work, dedication, and for always keeping the customer at the center. It\u2019s because of our employees that we were honored to be named Best Regional Bank by Kiplinger for the second year in a row. They also recognized our next generation branch design knowing that it creates a more modern and friendly atmosphere. I was pleased that we were again able to deliver strong financial results. We remained very confident in our ability to outperform to the cycle and create significant value for our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter results in more detail and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let\u2019s move to the financial highlights on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. Reported results for the quarter were negatively impacted by two notable items, an $84 million after-tax impact from MB merger-related charges and a $17 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total returns swap. Excluding these items and other items from prior periods as shown in our reconciliation tables, including MB-related merger charges and prior period Worldpay gains, pre-provision net revenue increased 29% on a year-over-year basis, and increased 24% from the prior quarter. Our financial performance also reflected the full quarter benefits associated with the acquisition of MB. Our adjusted results for the second quarter were very strong with net interest income, non-interest income, and expenses all performing better than our April guidance.  The area where we are significantly outpacing the peer group is our NII and NIM performance. We have been very deliberate and comprehensive in our actions over the past 12 months and longer in managing our interest rate risk, including our strategies in managing the investment portfolio, our preference not to grow our residential mortgage portfolio, and a timing of the hedge transactions that we have executed ahead of the rate downturn. These were well thought out and well executed decisions with a longer horizon view that put our performance ahead of others. Looking at the disclosed information prior to today, our net interest margin, excluding purchase accounting accretion is above the median of the peer group facts. Our adjusted return metrics were also strong during the second quarter with an adjusted ROA of 1.33%, an increase of 12 basis points from last quarter. Also, we achieved a return on tangible common equity of 15.1%. It is important to note that given the current rate environment and our prior actions to shield the portfolio from higher prepayment speeds, the unrealized investment portfolio gain, as well as the hedge portfolio being have increased significantly. Consequently, our ROTCE was impacted by elevated AOCI levels. Given the interest rate outlook, we expect these items to continue to affect our reported return on tangible capital. In the second quarter, our AOCI as a percent of total shareholders\u2019 equity was 5.7%. By comparison, the median for the peer banks that announced prior to today was a negative 1.5%, which makes a very meaningful difference when comparing return metrics. Therefore, we are providing you with our ROTCE, excluding AOCI of 15.8% in the second quarter. During the quarter, we successfully completed the MB customer conversion. Therefore, our future reported growth rate should provide a clearer depiction of our firm wide core growth performance. Our second quarter results also indicate that we are tracking slightly ahead of our expense savings pace associated with MB Financial. In line with our previous guidance, we expect to achieve approximately 80% of the run rate expense savings by year-end and realize our annual expense goal of $255 million beginning the second quarter of 2020. Our second quarter credit performance continues to reflect the benign macroeconomic environment. The net charge-off ratio of 29 basis points decreased 12 basis points from last year and decreased 3 basis points from last quarter. Commercial losses remained near historically low levels and the consumer loss rate improved 9 basis points sequentially. We remain focused on maintaining credit discipline at this point in the economic cycle. Moving to Slide 5. All of our balance sheet captions were impacted by the MB Financial acquisition on a year-over-year and sequential basis. In our commercial business, the growth patterns and portfolios we are prioritizing look very encouraging. In the second quarter, we have seen good growth in our middle market banking business. National large corporate loans and our verticals also grew albeit it at a slower pace and we have seen declining balances in commercial real estate reflective of the cycle and risk environment, as well as in large ticket indirect leasing where we halted new originations in early 2018. End of period commercial real estate loans were flat from last quarter. Our balances, as a percentage of total risk-based capital, remain very low at less than 80%, which keeps our commercial real estate exposure relative to capital near the bottom of our peer group. Average commercial loans and leases increased 25% from the year ago quarter and 16% from the prior quarter. Commercial loan production increased 3% sequentially, driven by strong middle market lending originations. Second quarter middle market loan production outpaced the previous quarter in 8 of our 13 markets. In our Chicago region, total end of period loans increased more than 1% sequentially. Payoffs and paydowns at the very end of the quarter had a larger impact on our national corporate banking portfolio. Total commercial line utilization decreased 1% sequentially, but increased 2% year-over-year. Our pipelines throughout the business remain solid. With a good start to the quarter, we expect to generate strong C&I loan growth in the second quarter, partially offset by declines in CRE and commercial lease businesses. Average total commercial loans should be stable on a sequential basis in the third quarter, compared to the second quarter. We are mindful of the risks associated with the current environment and believe that we need to continue our prudent client selection and underwriting process as loans with aggressive pricing [instructors] at this point in the cycle may not necessarily be in the best interest of our shareholders. Having said that, we are confident that we will continue to prudently grow our portfolio within our current risk and profitability profile. Excluding the positive impact of MP, on a year-over-year basis, we have grown our C&I loans at 7.1% above the peer median. For the full-year, we continue to expect average total commercial loans to increase approximately 20%, compared to 2018, again impacted by the MB acquisition. Average consumer loans grew 9% from the same quarter last year. Apart from MB, our core growth rate was strong driven by auto loan production of $1.4 billion during the quarter. We are seeing continued decline in home equities, growth in line with the industry and credit card, growth in indirect auto, and a flat residential mortgage portfolio in-line with our view of the current rate cycle. In the third quarter, we expect total average consumer loan balances to increase approximately 2% sequentially. For the full-year, we expect average total consumer loans to increase approximately 8%, compared to 2018. Combining the commercial and consumer portfolios, we currently expect full-year 2019 average total loans to increase approximately 15% to 16%, compared to 2018, which is unchanged, compared to our previous guidance. Moving on to Slide 6. Compared to the prior quarter, NII increased $164 million or 15%. Adjusting for purchase accounting accretion from the non-PCI MB loan portfolio, NII increased $149 million sequentially or 14%. Our second quarter NII benefited from a $16 million of PAA or 5 basis points of NIM. The adjusted second quarter NIM of 3.32% increased 4 basis points from the first quarter, consistent with our April guidance. As I mentioned before, we are very pleased with the outcomes from the actions that we have taken with respect to our prudent and long-term oriented interest rate risk management. With these actions, we have been able to protect our rate exposure to lower short-term rates and particularly with our investment portfolio positioning to a flatter long end of the curve. We have not executed any new hedges in the second quarter and a portion of the swaps that we executed last year have effective dates this quarter and the first quarter of 2020 with five-year terms at an average fixed rate of 3.14%. In addition, the 2.25% one-month LIBOR floors that we executed in late 2018 become effective December of this year, again with a five-year term. We have included additional information related to our interest rate risk profile and investment portfolio positioning in the presentation appendix. Interest-bearing core deposit costs increased 4 basis points sequentially, which was below the peer average and was consistent with our previous guidance. Our performance reflects our success in generating stable consumer deposit growth. Our overall interest-bearing liability costs continue to be very well maintained up only 1 basis points during the quarter. Our outlook assumes [three 25 basis point] rate cuts throughout the remainder of 2019; in July, September, and December. In that environment, we assume that deposit betas will be in the high 30s to 40 range. As a result of these assumptions, we currently expect our third quarter NII, excluding PAA to be up approximately 1% sequentially, reflecting the benefits of our larger earning asset base and day count, partially offset by continued market pressures from lower rate. Our third quarter NIM, also excluding PAA, should be down approximately 3 basis points, compared to the adjusted second quarter NIM of 3.32%, due to the impact of lower short-term rates. We expect the third quarter benefit from PAA to decline to 4 basis points. As a result of the expected 3 basis points decline in core NIM and a 1 basis point drag from lower accretion reported NIM should decline approximately 4 basis points, compared to the reported second quarter NIM of 3.37%. We have provided more detailed information in our presentation appendix related to our expectations for purchase accounting accretion, excluding the potential impact from prepayments, as well as expected core deposit intangible amortization expense. We expect full-year 2019 NII growth of approximately 15% to 16%, compared to 2018, excluding PAA and including the impacts from lower rates. Should the Fed cut rates 75 basis points in the second half of 2019, we expect the NIM, excluding PAA on a full-year basis to expand approximately 7 basis points in 2019, compared to our prior guidance of 10 basis points, which assumed static interest rates. Moving on to Slide 7, corporate banking fees were up 14%, compared to the year ago quarter and up 22% from the prior quarter reflecting the impact of leasing revenue from MB financial, as well as solid core performance. In capital markets, we experience a less favorable environment during the quarter, which pressured revenues in debt capital markets and loan syndications. For the third quarter, we currently expect our corporate banking revenue to increase approximately 7%, compared to the second quarter, reflecting both the larger client base post MB and improved performance from the initiatives we have previously discussed. Card and processing revenue was up 10%, compared to the year ago quarter and increased 16%, compared to the prior quarter, primarily reflecting increases in credit and debit transaction volumes, partially offset by higher rewards. Wealth and asset management revenue was up 13% from the year ago quarter, and 9% from the prior quarter due to higher personal asset management revenue and institutional trust fees. The sequential increase was partially offset by seasonally strong tax-related private client service revenue in the prior quarter. We are very optimistic about the AUM growth in the second half of the year, which also bodes well for growth in 2020. Mortgage banking revenue was up 19% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Origination volume of $2.9 billion was up 76% from the last quarter and 36% from the same quarter last year. The gain on sale margin from our retail channel increased from 235 basis points in the first quarter to 244 basis points in the second quarter. Our total gain on sale margin of 166 basis points was down 10 basis points sequentially due to channel mix and was flat from the year ago quarter. Deposit service charges increased 4%, compared to the year ago quarter and increased 9%, compared to the prior quarter. Performance from both the year ago quarter and prior quarter reflected higher commercial deposit fees, driven by the benefit of the MB client base along with continued client acquisition in the core Fifth Third franchise. The growth in commercial deposit fees was partially offset by lower consumer deposit fees as we continue to focus on improving our product and service offerings. For the third quarter, we expect total noninterest income to increase approximately 2% from the adjusted second quarter of 2019. And for the full year, we expect total noninterest income to increase 15% to 16% from the adjusted 2018 noninterest income. Moving on to Slide 8. Second quarter reported expenses included merger-related items from the MB transaction of $109 million, as well as intangible amortization expense of $14 million. Non-interest expense adjusted for these items and prior period items shown in our materials increased $102 million or 10% from the year ago quarter. The expense growth for the quarter came in below the low end of previous guidance demonstrating our continued commitment to maintaining expense discipline and achieving positive operating leverage; excluding the previously mentioned merger related items, the year-over-year increase in expenses reflected higher compensation expenses and continued investments in technology.  The growth in expenses was partially offset by lower incentive-based payment and the elimination of FDIC surcharge. We currently expect third quarter expenses to be flat sequentially from the adjusted second quarter 2019. Also, we expect full-year 2019 expense growth of approximately of 13% from an adjusted 2018 expense base of $3.865 billion. All expense projections exclude merger-related expenses and the impact of intangible amortization. Our NII fee and expense outlook for the third quarter should continue to lower efficiency ratio by another 50 basis points or so. We are cognizant of potential challenges to the overall revenue growth expectations in-light of the rate environment and recognize expense management as a tool to counter the impact of a weaker growth outlook. We remain on track to deliver on the previously provided outlook for MB-related expense savings. We continue to expect to achieve $255 million in savings by the end of the first quarter 2020. Our second quarter results reflect approximately 40% of the total run-rate expense savings target. Based on our current expectations, at the end of the year, we are on target to capture 80% of the savings on a run-rate basis. Additionally, we continue to expect our total after-tax merger charges inclusive of the merger-related charges recognized in current and past periods as well as future projected charges to be approximately $250 million after tax. Turing to credit results on Slide 9, second quarter credit results continue to reflect the generally benign environment. Our key credit methods have remained stable and remain at or near historical lows. The second quarter net charge-off ratio of 29 basis points decreased 12 basis points from the year ago quarter, and 3 basis points from last quarter. The commercial charge off ratio of 13 basis points increased slightly compared to last quarter and decreased 21 basis points from last year, while the consumer net charge off ratio of 59 basis points decreased 9 basis points compared to last quarter. The NPA ratio of 51 basis points declined 1 basis point compared to last year. The ALLL ratio was flat sequentially at 1.02% with provision expense offsetting net charge-offs due to slightly lower end of period loan balance. Again, I would like to remind you that the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential quarterly fluctuations given the current low absolute levels of charge-offs. Turning to Slide 10, capital levels remain very strong during the second quarter, our common equity Tier I ratio was estimated at 9.6%, and our tangible common equity ratio, excluding unrealized gains and losses was 8.27%. Our tangible book value per share was $20.03 this quarter, up 11% year-over-year and 7% from the first quarter. During the quarter, we initiated and settled $200 million in buybacks, which reduced common shares outstanding by approximately 7.2 million shares. Additionally, at the end of the quarter, we settled the $913 million share repurchase initiated in the first quarter of 2019, which lowered share count another 2 million shares. We also raised our common dividend $0.02 in June to $0.24 per share. Through the first half of the year, we\u2019ve returned nearly 120% of earnings to shareholders through buybacks and common dividends. At the end of June, we announced our capital distribution capacity of approximately $2 billion for the period of July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. This includes the ability to execute share repurchases, as well as increased common stock dividends and exclude potential repurchases related to the remaining after-tax gains from the previous sale of Worldpay stock. As always, our capital actions are subject to board approval and market conditions. We continue to remain focused on disciplined capital management. We will continue to calibrate our capital ratios to the risk profile of our balance sheet and business composition, which points to a lower level of capital than we currently have. As always, we will continue to take into account the prevailing macro-economic conditions and peer group of capital levels in our overall capital management approach. Our medium-term CET1 target is 9% to 9.5%. Slide 11 provides a summary of our current outlook. Based on our third quarter and full-year 2019 outlook, you can see we currently expect a strong finish to 2019. The combination of our strong performance in the second quarter and a stable outlook in this challenging rate environment is encouraging even under probably the most conservative rate outlook one can apply. Reflecting the market expectation that the Fed will most likely lower rates by 75 basis points by the end of 2019, we expect to generate a core ROTCE of approximately 16.5% in the fourth quarter of 2019, excluding the impact of AOCI. Furthermore, we expect our fourth quarter ROI to be in the 1.35% range with an efficiency ratio below 57%. This is consistent with our previous guidance for the fourth quarter of 2019 with the exception of the impact of lower rates than what we previously expected. We plan to provide more information regarding our revised 2020 return targets as late \u2013 later this year as the future path interest rates hopefully becomes clear. In summary, I would like to irritate a few items. Our second quarter results were strong and continues to demonstrate the progress we've made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. Our execution on the MB acquisition is on track to meet our target and guidance on both expense and revenue synergies. Also, we are on track to reposition our branch network to improve our market share in the Southeast. As always, we remain intensely focused on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to achieve our financial targets. With that, let me turn over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Jay, please open the call up for questions. Operator : Thank you, Chris. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Sir, your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, Scott. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Hi. Tayfun, I just want to make sure I understand the guidance correctly, and I appreciate all the granularity. Just as I look specifically at the fee guidance for the full year, just given that we have half a year in the bag, and then, we\u2019ve got the third-quarter guide, it looks like the fourth quarter ramp would be just very, very strong. I want to make sure I understand what all the puts and takes are as you see them, and I guess, both for the third quarter you know it sounds like corporate banking is going to be, you know, pretty strong, but then into the fourth quarter what would drive that really big ramp? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. So, Scott, the underlying third quarter to fourth quarter growth is truly in corporate banking and a combination of overall capital markets as well as treasury management. As we look at our corporate treasury management pipelines and the expected on-boarding of some of those client revenues, as well as in general our expectations with respect to just corporate banking fee activity, you know, that builds the basis for our outlook. Scott Siefers : Okay. So, it should indeed be, you know, well above the $700 million I guess in fees in the fourth quarter if I\u2019m reading it correctly. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Mathematically that should be over $700 million. That\u2019s correct. Scott Siefers : Yes. So, okay, good. Alright, thank you. I appreciate that. Tayfun Tuzun : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe : Great, thanks. Just a question in terms of the margin, I know the MB does, say, helps you guys out a fair amount, is there any way to separate out the benefit that you got on a core NIM basis? So ex-the PAA from MB versus what Fifth Third would have done this quarter ex-MB? Jamie Leonard : Yes. Ken, it\u2019s Jamie. I would look at it, you know, as we left the first quarter, our guide was we were going to grow from a 3.28 core NIM to a 3.32 core NIM, which is exactly what we posted. When you decompose the NIM benefits, I think we said on the last call, you know, we would expect the MB loan and deposit portfolios to be additive to NIM and the challenge with unmixing the paint this quarter on the benefit is that we made a lot of investment portfolio and funding actions in advance of the MB acquisition. But in total, I would decompose the NIM that a combination of the balance sheet positioning, funding actions, investment portfolio, plus MB\u2019s loan and deposit portfolio benefit was 8 basis points, and then our core deposit growth on a core basis at Fifth Third was up 2% and that added a basis point. So, we had 9 basis points of benefit, and then that benefit was partially offset by a basis point headwind from day count, a basis point impact from the $1.3 billion on balance sheet auto securitization we did in April, and then 3 basis point erosion from market rates, which as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, is primarily related to the one-month LIBOR to Fed funds spread, which cost us a little over $1 million per quarter per basis point, and that contracted to 6 basis points during the quarter. So, when you take all of that together, that posted the core NIM of 4 bps, but it is getting harder and harder to break out, you know, what MB did exclusive of the other actions we took on the balance sheet. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, this may be one last time that we\u2019re doing this, but it\u2019s going to be very difficult going forward from here on. Ken Zerbe : Got it, understood. Now that actually \u2013 the answer was actually very helpful. And then, just a really quick follow-up, are you guys \u2013 in terms of the hedging strategy, I know you\u2019d been adding more hedges this quarter, are you guys now fully done, comfortable where you\u2019re at with the hedging \u2013 your hedging portfolio? Tayfun Tuzun : So, we\u2019re definitely pleased with what we were able to execute. I would tell you, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we did the $11 billion of total hedges, $3 billion in floors, $8 billion in receive-fixed swaps, as Tayfun mentioned. $3 billion of those received-fixed swaps were forward starting. $1 billion began in June, and another $1 billion will begin in the third quarter and the final $1 billion leg of that is in January. I would love to do more, but not at these entry points. So, what we did this quarter and actually over the last six months as opposed to adding more hedges because we didn't like the entry points, we effectively repositioned the investment portfolio to the equivalent interest rate protection of about $10 billion in notional swap. So, we included an extra page in the slide deck, it\u2019s page 20. It\u2019s just to highlight the additional positioning we've done with the investment portfolio to highlight the protection that it will provide. And so, that obviously helped during the second quarter and helps protect the outlook as we go forward. So, a long answer to a simple question, but at the end of the day, there are a lot of tools we have at our disposal, and we've been I think very effective at utilizing them whether it\u2019s swaps, investment portfolio, the fact that our CD portfolio is -- 76% of it matures in under 12 months, so that should reprice fairly fast, the fact that we put on additional fixed rate auto, so the auto production was $1.4 billion for the quarter and should be about $5.8 billion for the year. So, we've done a lot behind the scenes to help protect to the low rates and that\u2019s starting to shine through in the results. Ken Zerbe : Alright, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Greg Carmichael : Hi, Matt. Tayfun Tuzun : Hi, Matt. Matt O'Connor: You mentioned the 4Q19 targets assuming CET1 migrating down to about 9%, compared to the 9.6% that you are at right now. Is that implying some front ending of the buybacks of the $2 billion that you\u2019re targeting for the next four quarters? Tayfun Tuzun : No, we should be \u2013 I mean we will be. We\u2019re not necessarily providing how we\u2019re going to execute those, but more or less, you know, I think it's going to be even \u2013 we also, as you know, have a portion of the Worldpay gains still waiting to be converted to buybacks potentially. Matt O'Connor: Okay, alright. And then, just separately, on the early stage delinquencies, they were up both Q2, and then especially, year-over-year. Is that being distorted at all from MB deal? Jamie Leonard : There\u2019s a little bit of noise there. Some of those are matured facilities that we\u2019re in the process of getting through the pipe. They\u2019re small facilities overall. We expect that to subside in the next quarter or so. There\u2019s nothing there that portends deterioration that in credit leading to losses or anything like that. It\u2019s just working through some of backlog we need with the adjustment, primarily on MB, and again, not delinquent, but also maturated facilities that we\u2019ve had a plan in place to work through and we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. So, you\u2019ll see that come down in the next couple of quarters. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. One question on just the loan growth commentary, Greg, you made in your intro. So, that caution I guess on the commercial side, is that just talking points or is that something that you're seeing? You mentioned still the strong pipelines in the back half, so can you talk about whether that's anecdotal or actually coming through in terms of a change in the amount of pipeline that you guys are seeing? Greg Carmichael : You know, Ken, we haven\u2019t seen that show up in our pipelines yet, and actually we feel very confident about our ability to deliver on our commitments we just made on asset growth for the second half of the year. But the conversations are less optimistic, you know, obviously with the noise that\u2019s out there right now, you know, the slowing economy, the rate environment, what\u2019s happening with the tariffs and so forth. It\u2019s just a cautionary discussion. We\u2019re ticking that up, but once you get that kind of ebbs and flows, but right now, we have [nothing to show up] in our pipelines. Actually, production was held up very well in the second quarter, and as we talked about, and we expect that to materialize again and continue forward into the third and the fourth quarter this year. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And my second question just on the deposit cost side, it\u2019s tough to see kind of the underlying core, Jamie you mentioned a little bit in terms of the MBFI effect. But you had 4 basis points interest-bearing costs increase below peers probably because in part of the averaging, just how do you think about the trajectory of that deposit \u2013 interest-bearing deposit costs from here in terms of ability to start, you know, controlling that if not showing a rate of decline at some point? Jamie Leonard : So, the deposit cost in the quarter, MB\u2019s book at the end of the year and you can look at their fourth quarter release, their deposit costs were roughly in line with our deposit costs, not far off at all. So, our [up 4] was as we got it to the last quarter, we thought it would be [up 4] and we were [up 4] and that\u2019s like, you know, really the Fifth Third books. So, we think it's been \u2013 rate costs have been well maintained on the deposit side.  For our forecast, if we were to not have a Fed cut at the end of July, I think a normal amount of deposit rate increase for us would be up 1 basis points or 2 basis points just given mix and promotional rates and new acquisitions because we continue to have good deposit growth. But given that we have a July cut and a September cut in the forecast, those numbers, I think, will be down a bip or 2 from the levels that you see in the second quarter. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thanks, Jamie. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi, this question might go in the category of no good deed goes unpunished, right. Why not guide for lower expenses in the third quarter versus the second? I mean, it\u2019s not like you're done with the merger savings and also at what point would you increase the expected savings from the merger? Greg Carmichael : Well, Mike, we still continue to invest in our company. We are very much interested in maintaining a healthy revenue growth. We are interested in making all the necessary technology investments that we need to make. So, as much as we like the way we manage expenses, we also want to make sure that we continue to support the franchise. In terms of, you know, the overall expense savings, I mean we will share those with you, but I think we\u2019ve proven over the past two, three years that we are, you know, good stewards of expense and we will continue to execute on those terms. Mike Mayo : And just a separate question. In terms of the hedges that you put on last October and November, I mean, that was ahead of the industry, what are you doing now and what caused you to put on those hedges before so many others? Tayfun Tuzun : Mike, Jamie gave a good discussion on the way we are managing the investment portfolio. I think lately, since sort of the end of last year into this year, we've executed a few actions to position the investment portfolio. We thought that it was a better choice between executing through the transactions and moving the portfolio.  And, we look at the environment and market expectations every day, and as there are certain windows open, we may choose to add more direct hedge protection. But at this point, we have been favoring moves on the investment portfolio to protect the downside. But that may change, it's a very fluid process and we are very careful. And I think over the years, we had we have a great team. They've provided a great perspective on economic growth, as well as central bank actions. And it's that same team will continue to monitor the situation as closely as they happen over the years. Mike Mayo : Alright, thank you. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, guys. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, Gerard. Tayfun Tuzun : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Can you share with us, maybe, Greg, the outlook when you look out over the next 12 months; certainly, the MB Financial transaction from the numbers that we're hearing today seems to have started out very well. I know at the time of the announcement, your stock suffered because of the deal, some of the metrics that were included in the deal, but what is your view going forward on consolidation and acquisitions? Greg Carmichael : Yes, first all, we're extremely pleased with the MB acquisition and partnership, and I do want to thank all the MB employees for their great leadership for this transition. So, we're very pleased with that. We're very pleased also with the quality of that business and our forgoing expectations to achieve our expense synergies and our revenue synergies. We feel very, very confident and as Tayfun mentioned in his comments, we're slightly ahead of the expense side house and we're very bullish on the revenue side of the house as we start to look at some of those pipelines starting to come together. It all starts with the people and we've got great people at MB and partnership with Fifth Third team in Chicago to serve that market. With that said, job one is to get this done right and deliver on the commitments that we made, whether it be the 400 basis points in improving our efficiency ratio, which we're on the way to do that, the 200-basis points improvement in ROTCE, the 12-basis points of ROA improvement. We want to deliver on those commitments as we said we would to our investors, and that's going to be job one. We want to get that done right and demonstrate that going forward. So, our focus is on that. Our focus is on continuing to build and expand our businesses organically where we'd be growing in new markets like California, Texas or investments in the Southeast, products, services and people and we're going to continue to do that. And that's really the focus is, MB and then organic growth. There's nothing out there on horizon right now that we're focused on beyond that. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then Tayfun, maybe can you give us an update on CECL, what you think the day one impact might be from first quarter of next year? Tayfun Tuzun : Gerard, we're not quite ready yet to share. Obviously, there's a lot of work that's still going on. There's still a lot of work ahead of us between now and year end. We are in the middle of these parallel runs. My expectation is the earliest we will probably potentially give an update will be our third quarter earnings. But we're working very diligently to finish all the work. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun : Sure. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez of UBS. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning, guys. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, Saul. Saul Martinez : So, I'm sorry, if this is a really simple question. I just want to make sure I understand the fourth quarter financial targets and how to read that. So, you know that the 75 basis points of cuts have a 70-basis point impact on ROTCE and 5 basis points ROA, yet you basically maintained your full-year guidance for all of the items, including net interest income. So, I mean, should we basically assume that your expected run rate for NII, maybe a little bit lower than what you had previously, but the full-year number doesn't really change in part because you basically outperformed in the second quarter. So, I just want to make sure I understand what the fourth quarter targets imply for run rate? Jamie Leonard : Yes, I think, in general, Saul, if you remember the guidance that we provided back in April, these numbers do line up very well, including the impact of lower interest rates. Now, on ROTCE, the additional impact is coming through the AOCI and that's why we wanted to exclude that and gave you the 16.5% excluding the AOCI. Overall, if you take our NII guidance up about 1% from the adjusted Q2, you will see that we're not necessarily expecting a growth into the Q4 based on that third rate cut assumption. And, I mean, it's not like a big fall or anything like that, but you're not going to expect another 1% growth over that. In terms of fee income, I answered one of the earlier questions, we are expecting a good amount of growth from the third quarter into the fourth quarter in terms of fee income. And in terms of the expense outlook, it's not different. These numbers are large percentages because of the MB comparisons and therefore you're not seeing the underlying movements. But our expectation is that we had great performance in the second quarter with respect to NII, we still expect very good performance in light of a lower rate environment. And we just kept our overall return targets pretty much intact despite the weaker rate environment and because we just outperformed quite a bit in the second quarter. I mean, that's really \u2013 that has also a lot to do with our ability to maintain our overall return targets. Saul Martinez : Okay. Got it. That makes sense. Just a follow up then on the deposit cost and the deposit beta assumptions. I think you mentioned that we could expect with your rate assumptions a couple basis points decline in the third quarter. You also mentioned that deposit betas you're assuming are high-30s, I think high-30s or low-40s. If I recall, how does that high-30s, low-40s, over what time period does that play out? So, you're assuming 50 basis points of cuts, for example, in the third quarter, should we assume that deposit cost then in the fourth quarter will reflect that beta assumption or does that deposit beta play out over a multi-quarter type of time horizon? Jamie Leonard : Yes, it's a very good question. And unfortunately, the answer is somewhat complicated because you have about 12% of our deposit book is indexed to Fed funds. So, when the Fed moves, 12% is going to reprice immediately at a 100% beta. But then we have various offers that are out there that those deposit rates will come down over time. So, it's really a blend that will deliver it and as Tayfun mentioned, over the three rate movements, we're modeling a 38% beta, which is exactly what our cycle to date beta was on the 225 basis points of Fed funds increases. Saul Martinez : And if I could ask maybe one final one on that, those index deposits, where they baked in? Are those in the other time deposits? Jamie Leonard : It's across the board. Yes, I'd say it's fairly evenly distributed. Greg Carmichael : It's probably less in other deposits and actually... Jamie Leonard : It's in more savings and IBT. Saul Martinez : Sorry, what was that? Jamie Leonard : It's more in savings and IBT, as opposed to other. Saul Martinez : Got it. And are they mainly commercial deposits or\u2026? Jamie Leonard : Yes. Saul Martinez : Got it. Alright. Thank you so much. Jamie Leonard : Yes. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is open. Marty Mosby : Thanks. First, let me \u2013 maybe give you a little more credence than you give yourself, because I listen to a lot of the different calls every quarter and your approach to net interest income of being neutral when everybody else was still enamored with being asset sensitive gives you the flexibility to take advantage of those events when you solve them, because your goal at the end is trying to be as neutral as you can what you see on the interest rate sensitivity numbers. So, I think that perspective gives you a lot of flexibility versus trying to play what's happening even if it seems like the momentum is going to continue in the right direction. So, always like listen to your calls, Tayfun and Jamie, you've done a great job of getting ahead by keeping that perspective. In that vein, one of the things that you've done, I think is being able to keep these cash flow securities out in the sense of as you are kind of moving from mortgage back into these locked-out types of securities your premium amortization this quarter was pretty minimal. So, I just wanted to \u2013 when you mentioned your margin, you didn't mention any premium amortization or mortgage-backed securities. So, is it true that this quarter underneath all these numbers that would be a pretty minimum impact as you have been shifting the portfolio? Jamie Leonard : Yes. And I didn't give that data point, but that's exactly what the repositioning accomplished. I think we ran last year net premium amortization of $6 million a quarter, I think this quarter we were around $2 million, so that benefit definitely showed up in the quarter. Marty Mosby : And when you compare that to other banks that went from like 6 last year to probably 4 times that this this quarter with all the prepayment speeds, accelerating, that was a big kicker in the sense of how you outperformed so dramatically on your NII because it took that risk out of the equation. The other thing that I wanted, which is, Tayfun a very easy question [Technical Difficulty] in the income statement and expenses, can you give us a little feel for what it was this quarter and what it's been in prior quarters? Jamie Leonard : So, the approximate \u2013 I'll give you the number on the revenue side, increase is probably about $20 million-ish quarter-over-quarter Q1 to Q2. Marty Mosby : And what's the base this quarter, how much was it in total? Jamie Leonard : About $40 million, $45 million, Marty. Marty Mosby : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre of KSP Research. Sir, your line is open. Kevin St. Pierre: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Tayfun, you mentioned that, one thing that has benefited the NIM and your NII performance was the decision not to grow the first mortgage portfolio. You did guide to third quarter increase in consumer loans of about 2%. As you're thinking with the prospect of lower rates as you're thinking change there or are you expecting growth in other loan categories? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, we're not \u2013 our outlook, at least for the second half of this year, sort of matches the production patterns with respect to the refi environment. I don't think that by the time we get to year-end, our residential portfolio outstandings will be much different from where we are today. Kevin St. Pierre: Got you. And maybe one final, noticed pretty stable demand deposits period end quarter-to-quarter on the linked quarter. Can you speak to deposit attrition at MB and how things are going there? Jamie Leonard : Yes. The deposit attrition at MB is going fine. It's slightly less than the attrition they experienced for the 28 months leading up to the acquisition. So, it's right in line to slightly better. Kevin St. Pierre: Great. Thanks very much. Greg Carmichael : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Chris, you may continue. Chris Doll : Thank you, Jay, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR Department and we will be happy to assist you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

At this time, all participants\u2019 lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand a conference over to your first speaker today, Chris Doll. Please go ahead, sir. Chris Doll : Thank you, Prince. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. Please review the cautionary statements on materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Chris. And thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2019 net income available to common shareholders of $530 million or $0.71 per share. Our reported EPS include a negative $0.04 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release, mostly from merger-related expenses associated with MB Financial. Excluding these items, adjusted third quarter earnings were $0.75 per share. Our financial results were very strong and reflect our ongoing discipline throughout the bank as well as the strength of our diversified revenue streams. We generated strong fee revenue, including a record in capital markets while tightly managing our expenses. Our revenue and expense results exceeded our July expectations. During the quarter, we also returned 96% of our earnings to shareholders in the form of common dividends and share repurchases. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue increased 28% from a year ago to quarter. The strong performance reflects our ability to generate strong core revenue growth, diligently manage our expenses and deliver on our financial commitments from the MB Financial acquisition. We also generated strong core deposit growth compared to the prior quarter while proactively lowering interest-bearing deposit cost. All of our key return and profitability metrics improved significantly in the third quarter as we achieved our year-end financial targets by generating an ROTCE excluding AOCI of 16.5%, an ROA of 1.35% and an efficiency ratio below 57% on an adjusted basis. Our ROTCE has increased 280 basis points. Our ROA has increased 7 basis points. And our efficiency ratio has decreased 260 basis points from the year-ago quarter. End-of-period loans were flat sequentially. Our commercial loan production continued to be strong during the quarter but was muted by elevated payoffs. Consistent with our prior guidance, we generated average consumer loan growth of 2% sequentially. We remain focused on maximizing our returns through the full cycle rather than generating a lower-quality loan growth. Credit quality once again remained relatively benign during the quarter. Non-performing assets and the NPA ratio both declined from the prior quarter, and many of our credit metrics remain at or near historical low levels. Before I turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our financial results and fourth quarter outlook, I'll review our four key strategic priorities to improve our long-term performance. First, we continue to leverage technology such as our data analytics capabilities to accelerate our digital transformation. Our investments are focused in areas that reduce the friction inherent in traditional banking channels while also investing in areas that drive operational efficiencies. We have made considerable investments over the past several years to modernize, simplify and rationalize our infrastructure. In addition, we're investing in advanced fraud and cybersecurity technologies to detect and respond to threats quickly. In total, our annual technology spend exceeds $650 million. While we will continue to invest in technology next year and beyond, we expect our investments will lead to improved efficiencies throughout the bank. Second, we continue to invest to drive future organic growth in some areas of the bank. The ultimate goal of our investments is to improve both the employee and customer experience in order to support sustainable, profitable growth. We believe it is critical to provide our employees with the right tools to maximize productivity, particularly those who directly interact with our clients. To that end, we recently announced an increase in minimum wage for our employees to $18 an hour effective at the end of this month, which will primarily impact those located in branches in our operations center. We fully expect that this increase will lead to lower employee turnover, with better customer experience and, as a result, improved revenue growth. We have also added talent and capabilities to our Texas and California geographies. We remain pleased with our ability to successfully generate strong relationship growth while maintaining a credit standard consistent with our in-footprint, middle-market banking business. In addition, we've already seen positive financial outcomes from our renewable energy M&A advisory team, which complements our investment banking capabilities to deliver strategic client solutions throughout our national commercial franchise. Third, we continue to expand our presence in select key geographies, including Chicago. As I have mentioned previously, our strategy is to generate a higher market share in large and high-growth markets. Our employees remain energized about the combined potential for Chicago. Our overall employee attrition continues to track our original deal expectations. Most importantly, we have not experienced any material client attrition. We remain very pleased with the middle market loan production in our Chicago region, which was by far, the strongest region during the quarter. Although we are not finished working to ensure a sustainable success, we remain pleased with the progress we have made so far. We are confident in our ability to deliver the financial synergies from the MB Financial acquisition, as previously communicated. We continue to expect to realize the $255 million in annual expense synergies by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and have already completed many of the key expense actions. We also continue to expect revenue synergies to generate approximately $60 million to $75 million in annual pretax income by 2022. Our commercial teams have done a great job in laying a foundation to leverage our capabilities and strength across our entire franchise. We already see success generating incremental revenue opportunities. For instance, we are successfully leveraging our enhancements and capabilities to provide value-add client solutions to all our middle-market and corporate banking clients. We continue to believe that Fifth Third Chicago is in a position of strength that allows us to generate stronger deposit, household and revenue growth moving forward. With the MB acquisition significantly improving our position in Chicago MSA, we are continuing to invest in our Southeast markets. With their deposit growth trends, I expect the population growth and greater market vitality. Lastly, we are focused on maintaining our disciplined approach throughout the company. While we continue to expect generally stable credit quality, we are cognizant of the evolving economic and interest rate environment. From a balance sheet perspective, we have successfully generated strong deposit growth while maintaining pricing discipline. We expect to continue our strong deposit growth at minimum going forward. Our average loan-to-core deposit ratio of 91% is the lowest in over 15 years, reflecting our ability to generate strong core deposit growth and an unwillingness to stretch for loan growth. We expect that this ratio will remain in the low 90s for the foreseeable future. Our balance sheet management philosophy of focusing on improved performance to the full economic cycle positions us well for the future. Given our capital management priorities, our focus on returning capital through dividends and repurchases, in addition to the organic growth strategies I mentioned, bank acquisitions are not a priority. We have continued to demonstrate our discipline in managing our expenses diligently and investing in areas of strategic importance. Though expense declined $3 million sequentially, excluding merger-related items, we generated year-over-year positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for this quarter. Tayfun will share about more about expense expectations for the fourth quarter. Our clearly defined strategic priorities and our proactive balance sheet management and our continued discipline throughout the bank position us well into the next year and beyond. We remain cognizant of the dynamic economic and interest rate environment. We continue to focus on through-the-cycle outperformance to create long-term shareholder value. I'm pleased to report that we were again able to deliver strong financial results. I'd like to once again thank all of our employees for their hard work, dedication and for always keeping the customer at this time with everything we do. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let's move to the financial highlights on to Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. During the quarter, we achieved strong revenue growth with flat expenses and continued benign credit results. With a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase in adjusted total revenue and a slight decline in expenses, our annualized core PPNR as a percent of earning assets of 2.3% in the third quarter of 2019 reached the highest level since 2013. Reported results for this quarter were negatively impacted by two notable items, a $22 million after-tax impact from MB merger-related charges and an $8 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap. Adjusting for those items, pre-provision net revenue increased 7% from the prior quarter, and our efficiency ratio improved 180 basis points to 56.7% as strong firm-wide fee growth more than offset lower net interest income during the quarter. As Greg mentioned in his opening remarks, our adjusted return metrics were also very strong in the third quarter. We achieved an adjusted ROA of 1.35% and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 16.5% excluding AOCI despite the market dynamics and stable capital levels during the quarter. Our adjusted ROTCE is now over 280 basis points higher compared to a year ago and our adjusted ROA is up 7 basis points for the same period as most of our peers have experienced declines in those metrics. At our original CET1 target, which was closer to 9%, our ROTCE excluding AOCI would have been approximately 17.5% in the third quarter. Our performance this quarter also helped us achieve our previously stated year-end return targets one quarter sooner than we anticipated. Clearly, environmental factors especially interest rates will have an impact on these returns going forward. Our third quarter credit performance continue to reflect the generally benign macroeconomic environment with both the NPL and NPA ratios declining quarter-over-quarter. Moving to Slide 5, total average loans declined less than 1% sequentially. Our focus continues to be on generating high quality loan growth to maximize our returns through the full cycle. In our commercial business, strong origination volumes in C&I were more than offset by elevated payoffs and paydowns. Total commercial line utilization decreased over 1% sequentially, reflecting the broad market uncertainties. I would also like to point out that the third quarter average loan growth metrics were impacted by higher payoffs and paydowns at the end of June. We also continue to see declining balances in large ticket in direct leasing where we halted new originations in early 2018. Average commercial real estate loans were flat from last quarter. Our CRE balances as a percentage of total risk-based capital remain very low at less than 80%, which keeps our exposure relative to capital near the bottom of our peer group. We expect that near-term loan growth will continue to reflect the software environment for corporate capital investments. With our expanded capabilities, our new originations continue to remain strong. However, payoffs and paydowns have resulted in muted net loan growth so far this year. Assuming a similar environment in the fourth quarter, we expect average commercial loans to be relatively stable compared to the third quarter. As always, our focus is on client selection and prudent underwriting as we plan to grow our balance sheet in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. Average total consumer loans grew 2% from last quarter. Overall, consumer loan demand remains at healthy levels within our risk appetite. This quarter, growth was driven by strong auto loan production of $1.8 billion during the quarter. Auto production strengths were the highest in nearly a decade again with the same strong risk profile that we have targeted for the past number of years. Home equity production was 5% higher this quarter compared to last quarter, but due to pay downs and payoffs, our balances declined. Our credit card growth was in line with the industry. The residential mortgage portfolio was flat and in line with our balance sheet management preferences in the current rate environment. In the fourth quarter, we expect total average consumer loan balances to increase 1% to 2% sequentially. Moving on to Slide 6. Reported net interest income was stable compared to the prior quarter. Adjusting for purchase accounting accretion, NII decreased $14 million sequentially or 1%. The purchase accounting adjustment benefited our third quarter NII by $28 million and our net interest margin by 7 basis points. The adjusted third quarter NIM of 3.25% decreased 7 basis points from the second quarter. Third quarter margin compression was slightly elevated relative to our July expectations due to a larger decline in LIBOR and the shift in the yield curve, as well as elevated cash balances resulting from strong deposit growth. Our overall interest bearing liability costs continued to be very well maintained down 6 basis points during the quarter. Interest bearing core deposit costs decreased 2 basis points sequentially as we expected. We expect interest bearing core deposit costs in the fourth quarter to decline approximately another 15 to 18 basis points from the third quarter assuming an October fed rate cuts. During the quarter, the yield on the loan portfolio declined 9 basis points and as we expected, our investment portfolio yield maintained a relatively stable level with the decline of only 4 basis points. Total premium amortization was less than $3 million. On a core basis, we expect fourth quarter NIM to decline 4 to 5 basis points from the core third quarter NIM of 3.25%. Our guidance incorporates 25 basis points fed rate cut in October and results in a core NIM for the full year 2019 of approximately 3.26%, a 4 basis points increase compared to 2018. We currently expect our fourth quarter net interest income, excluding PAA to be down approximately 1% sequentially, reflecting the NIM impact and the relatively stable loan growth outlook. As we look ahead to next year, the hedge positions will start contributing meaningfully and at an increasing level to the overall NII based on our current rate outlook. We expect our core NIM in the first quarter of 2020 to expand a couple of basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019, given the benefit of $4 billion of previously executed forward starting hedges that will begin in December and January. At this time, we expect full year 2020 core NIM to be in the range of approximately 3.2% to 3.25% depending on the size and timing of Federal Reserve actions. We would expect to be at the upper end of the range assuming no fed rate cuts in 2020 and expect to be at the lower end of the range assuming two additional 25 basis points rate cuts in March and September of 2020. We assume that deposit betas will be in the 40s. In summary, we expect our NIM to widen a few basis points for the full year 2020 relative to the expected Q4 level, if there are no rate cuts and remain fairly stable, if there are two more rate cuts. Moving on to Slide 7. We had a stronger quarter in fee income than we guided to in July. Adjusted non-interest income increased 11% sequentially led by strong performances in both corporate banking and mortgage banking. As you recall, in July, we guided to a strong second half fee performance and we realized the larger portion of our anticipated growth in the third quarter. During the last two years, we deliberately channeled our investments in a number of diverse fee generating businesses to maintain our ability to grow total revenues in different environments and our year-to-date non-interest income results demonstrate the increasing benefit of having a platform with a wider scope of product and service capabilities. Corporate banking fees were up 23% from the prior quarter, significantly exceeding our prior guidance driven by strong growth and debt capital markets, M&A advisory and lease related revenue, all reflecting our diversified and enhanced capabilities to better serve our clients. Our capital markets teams generated record revenues this quarter, partially impacted by clients accessing the debt markets for financing. Additionally, the renewable energy M&A team that we hired two months ago already closed to transactions during the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect corporate banking revenues of approximately $150 million or up 15% from the year ago quarter, but down from this record third quarter. Mortgage banking revenue of $95 million increased 51% sequentially. Origination volume of $3.4 billion was up 17% from the prior quarter. Our gain on sale margin of 232 basis points was up 66 basis points sequentially and 69 basis points from the same quarter last year, driven by expanding primary, secondary spreads, which we anticipate will remain elevated in the fourth quarter given industry wide capacity constraints. Our mortgage platform is stronger today than three years ago based on our investment in our loan origination system. The cyclical nature of this business is providing good revenue support in this environment. Wealth and asset management revenue increased 2% from the prior quarter due to higher personal asset management revenue. Deposit service charges were flat compared to the prior quarter as higher consumer deposit fees were offset by lower commercial deposit fees. Our strong performance this quarter elevated our second half total fee outlook raising our full year 2019 fee income growth to 17% to 18% from our July guidance of 15% to 16%, once again highlighting the diversification benefit and strength in fee income generation. Because of the record high numbers in the third quarter, we expect our fourth quarter total non-interest income to decrease approximately 4% from the adjusted third quarter of 2019. This outlook is reflective of seasonality in mortgage banking. We also expect higher wealth management revenues during the quarter. Moving on to Slide 8. Third quarter reported expenses included merger related items of $28 million, as well as intangible amortization expense of $14 million. Adjusted for these items and prior period items shown in our materials, non-interest expense decreased $3 million from the prior quarter. We remain on track to deliver on the previously provided outlook for MB related expense savings. We continue to expect to achieve $255 million in savings by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and to capture approximately 80% of the savings on a run rate basis by year end. Additionally, we continue to expect our total after tax merger charges, inclusive of the merger related charges recognized in current and past periods as well as projected future charges to be approximately $250 million after tax. We expect current \u2013 we expect fourth quarter expenses to continue drift slightly lower from the adjusted third quarter level, including the impact of the $3 raise in our minimum wage from $15 to $18 effective at the end of this month. As we look ahead to 2020, we are mindful of the challenging outlook for revenue growth related to slower loan growth and lower interest rates and plan to manage the trends in our core expenses appropriately. While we maintain our focus on investing in our businesses for long-term growth, we will not disregard the near term realities associated with the market environment and the impact on operating leverage. We will share our 2020 expectations with you in January. Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Third quarter credit results continued to reflect the generally benign economic environment. Our key credit metrics remain at or near historical lows. The third quarter NPA ratio of 47 basis points declined 4 basis points sequentially, while the NPL ratio decreased sequentially to 44 basis points from 48 basis points. Compared to last quarter, commercial net charge offs increased 5 basis points and consumer net charge offs were up 9 basis points, reflecting seasonal factors. The ALLL ratio increased slightly sequentially to 1.04% of portfolio loans and leases. We currently expect fourth quarter charge offs to generally track the third quarter\u2019s performance. Again, I would like to remind you that the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential quarterly fluctuations, given the current low absolute levels of charge offs. We expect to the \u2013 with respect to the upcoming CECL adoption, our expected ranges appear to be in line with other banks that have already disclosed their information. In our legacy portfolio, we expect the impact of CECL to result in a 30% to 40% increase in reserves. Due to differences between the accounting treatment of MB\u2019s loans under the acquisition accounting methodology and the treatment under CECL, the increase in CECL reserves for our combined loan portfolio will be in the range of 40% to 55%. This incremental impact is predominantly due to the fact that under the CECL methodology, there is no mechanism that converts the non-PCI discount that we established at the time of acquisition to loan reserves. Turning to Slide 10. Capital levels remained very strong during the third quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.6% and our tangible common equity ratio excluding AOCI was 8.21%. Our medium-term CET1 target remains at 9.5%. Our tangible book value per share was $21.6 this quarter, up 17% year-over-year and up 5% from the second quarter. During the quarter, we completed $350 million in buybacks, which reduced our share count by approximately 13.4 million shares or about 2% of our common shares outstanding compared to the second quarter. We expect to execute the remaining approximately $900 million of repurchases over the remaining three quarters in the CCAR cycle, in addition to raising our dividend by $0.03, which is subject to board approval. Slide 11 provides a summary of our current outlook. We plan to provide more information regarding our 2020 outlook in January consistent with our normal timing. In summary, I would like to reiterate a few items. Our third quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress that we\u2019ve made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. Our execution on the MB acquisition is on track to meet our targets on both expense and revenue synergies. As always, we remain intensely focus on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to outperform through various economic cycles. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have a lot at this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Prince, please open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Greg Carmichael : Good morning. Matt O\u2019Connor: Thanks for all the clarity on the guidance for the fourth quarter and I appreciate you don\u2019t want to give anything explicit on 2020 relating to costs, but you did say you\u2019re mindful of kind of the tougher revenue environment. And I was hoping if you could just talk about some of the puts and takes as we think about 2020. And I\u2019ll put a couple out there, the easy ones out of the other way. And like you obviously got the full year benefit of the MB cost saves, which will drag for minimum wage. But remind us kind of where you are in some of the investment cycle, whether it\u2019s related to technology or some of your expansion efforts, how those might compare next year versus this year. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Thanks, Matt, for your question. Just the MB comparison also need to take into account the fact that we will have four quarters with MB expense base versus three quarters in 2019. So I just want to point that out. And obviously, the MB picture is intact and we will deliver those cost savings. In terms of the drivers of the expense page that we are now looking at as we are building our 2020 plan, the tech investments clearly are underway. I think we\u2019ve done quite a bit to improve our infrastructure and focus on customer-facing tools this year that will continue into next year. Our expansion plans, whether it\u2019s related to retail expansion in the Southeast, which is mostly financed by closing branches in the North as well as prudent geographic expansion in commercial, we are still keen on moving on because those are our long-term growth drivers and we\u2019ve had good success in the efforts over the past two years. Having said that, I think those decisions, the incremental investment decisions will be made with the environment in the background. And we also look to improve the productivity of the existing expense base. When you think about it, we had about a $4.4 billion total expense base on an annual basis. About $2.3 billion of that is in headcount-related expenses. That\u2019s salaries, benefits and other headcount expenses. So we need to make sure that we get the productivity out of that expense base appropriately, and that should continue to provide some ability to fund those incremental expansions from savings on the expense [indiscernible] $0.5 billion of that $4.4 billion total expense base is in equipment and occupancy, and we continue to focus on efficiencies there. And about $400 million of that is in pure IT cost, away from headcount-related IT cost. So these areas still will give us the opportunity to look for efficiencies as we continue to prudently and selectively invest in the company. But the revenue growth is strong, and we believe that despite the fact that we will have challenges associated with the rate environment, the fee-based and the diversified product and service offerings will continue to support that revenue growth into 2020. So that\u2019s the color that I can give you today. But again, we\u2019ve been very focused on positive operating leverage over the past two, three years. And that\u2019s still in our minds as we are building the 2020 plan. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, that\u2019s helpful very detail. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is now open. John Pancari : Good morning. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, John. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning. John Pancari : Just on the acquisition on MB. I know there\u2019s been some press about departures, banker departures going to competing banks. And I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about what you have seen on the bank upfront because I know some of the reports were including other departures that were unrelated. And have those departures been consistent with your expectations or have they exceeded? Thanks. Greg Carmichael : John, as I mentioned \u2013 this is Greg. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the execution against the expense synergies is going as planned. The large part of that expense synergy obviously was personnel. So you absolutely expect some of that personnel to move to other banks. We fully expected that. I would say, right now, 90% of all the high performers that we targeted retaining from a banker perspective are still with the bank today. So we have not lost those. And it\u2019s very much in line with our expectations that we\u2019ve modeled in. And there\u2019s probably a little more to come as we continue to work towards our expense synergy numbers, but you would expect that both in the back office and some of our sales force. So we bring the two companies together, look at our gearing ratios and what we need in that market while those bankers basically didn\u2019t have opportunities with Fifth Third and end up with another bank. So you\u2019re going to have banks want to tap that a little bit, but that\u2019s to be expected and within our modeling for this transaction. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then just separately, I appreciate all the guidance you gave on the loan side and everything. So really, I just want to ask about demand, what you\u2019re seeing in your markets right now, if you are seeing any erosion in confidence on the commercial borrowers\u2019 side. I mean we have seen some macro data that would support the view that there could be some moderation, whether it\u2019s ISM or CapEx or whatnot. So if you can give us a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing, that would be helpful. Lars Anderson : Yes. So this is Lars. Frankly, I\u2019ve been in the market a lot recently. And I have not seen any improvement, I don\u2019t believe, in terms of the perspective of our clients relative to the economic environment. I\u2019d say that we can continue to see a very heightened level of concerns and uncertainty with tariffs, global slowing, a lot of growing uncertainty now in Washington around public policy. These are all laying heavily on our clients\u2019 minds. And certainly, we\u2019re taking that into consideration as we look at the market environment, which we do with the \u2013 operating in the fourth quarter and in 2020. So with that said, we\u2019re very pleased with the investments that we\u2019ve made. We had a very, very strong \u2013 in fact, the strongest quarter a commercial loan growth in the third quarter. We did have offsetting that, utilization rates back off about 140 basis points. That\u2019s about $1 billion swing in terms of our outstanding. A good portion of that, however, were positioned very well. As you know, we\u2019ve invested in our capital markets platform, in particular, in FRM, our bond underwriting and distributing. And frankly, we are well positioned to capture a lot of that. That is a portion of the record level of capital markets fees that we recognized in the third quarter. So it\u2019s not always just about the balance sheet in outstanding loans. It\u2019s about helping your clients. Depending upon the current economic environment and with our broadened capabilities, we well positioned ourselves to do that. So frankly, I feel very confident about the future for our company given the investments that we\u2019ve made and look forward to continue to execute against our opportunities. John Pancari : Thanks, Lars. Appreciate it. Operator : Next question is from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Ken Usdin : Thanks, guys. Good morning. Tayfun, I was just wondering \u2013 thanks for giving the color on where the NIM could settle out. How can \u2013 how is it going to work with the purchase accounting from here just given your current schedule? And then how CECL might change the expected contribution from that us to think about next year? Thanks. Jamie Leonard : Hey Ken, it\u2019s Jamie. That\u2019s actually a very complicated question. The first part is very easy. Purchase accounting, we were at $15 million in the second quarter and increased to $28 million in the third quarter just given the higher CPRs. We\u2019re forecasting again that assuming zero prepayments, that number will be about $15 million fourth quarter. And in the first quarter, there\u2019s roughly $150 million of PAA left to go. So that part is fairly straightforward. The more complicated part in terms of how the seasonal impact all of this, the PAA really shouldn\u2019t be impacted. However, the impact on income recognition from PCI loans is still being evaluated. The big four accounting firms are still having discussions with the FASB in terms of whether that should be \u2013 continue to be recognized on an effective yield basis or recognized more on a cash flow for those that would need to go to non-accruals. So quite complicated with no official answer yet. So we\u2019ll provide more guidance once we hear back. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And then just follow up just on the deposit side. I believe you guys talked about 15 basis points to 18 basis points interest-bearing cost decline in the fourth. It\u2019s a healthy beta on the way down. Can you just talk about what\u2019s happening on the deposit front in terms of product pricing and your confidence in getting that type of response across the deposit base? Thanks. Jamie Leonard : Yes. We think and are confident in our ability to deliver a 40% beta on the three moves, July, September and October. That full beta will actually be realized through the end of the first quarter. And what we\u2019ve done from a rate perspective is, midway through the third quarter, we reduced our go-to-market rates on the retail side. From a 1.5% offer, we pulled it down to 1% because, as we\u2019ve said before, we really aren\u2019t interested in competing with online banks or attracting hot money. And so no not all of our peers move their promo rates during the quarter. And that\u2019s why we were able to deliver the reduction that you see in the third quarter of 2 basis points but are confident that will continue into the fourth quarter. And then on the \u2013 from the CD side, we talked about this last quarter. We\u2019ve got about $1.9 billion of CDs to mature at a 2% rate in the fourth quarter. And our go-to-market rate right now is roughly 1.2% and there\u2019s another $2 billion in the first quarter. So from a retail perspective, we feel very good about the steps we\u2019ve taken and that those numbers will materialize. And then on the commercial side, large portion of that deposit is indexed. So as those rate cuts occur, we\u2019ll realize that. So again, we think our strong market share in the majority of our markets allows us the opportunity to move a little bit earlier than perhaps some of our peers can deliver those deposit reductions. Ken Usdin : Great. Thank you, Jamie. Operator : Gerard Cassidy from RBC, your line is now open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning. Greg Carmichael : Hey Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Tayfun, can you share with us \u2013 one of the things I think investors and the analysts are trying to get their arms around is next year\u2019s CECL, so called day two number. The day one number which you gave us, the amount of capital or the amount of reserve, that will go up when you guys change to CECL. And you pointed out on the legacy portfolio, 30% to 40% increase. Is that a rough idea of what we can think of provisioning going forward in day two, that provisions under CECL could be as high as 30% to 40% higher than what they would have been if CECL was not implemented? Or is that just way off base? Tayfun Tuzun : Well, Gerard, it\u2019s a difficult question to answer because clearly, there is going to be dependence upon what the economic scenarios are and how each portfolio is growing because as many banks have said and we\u2019re seeing the same thing, clearly, the pressure on the commercial side is much less compared to the mortgage side and the consumer side. And also there are different \u2013 as you consider the full life of that product, there are different phases that are governed by the economic scenario outlook for the first few years and then there is a regression back to normal and then back to normal historically. So it is difficult to answer. We are still working on finalizing the models. And I\u2019ll be able to give obviously a lot more clarity as we move into the first quarter. But I think there is a decent chance that provisions will go up based upon where that growth is coming from relative to today. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, thank you. Greg, you pointed out in your opening comments that acquisitions are not a priority right now. And you look at the big merger we saw this year between BB&T and Suntrust and you look at the stock performance of those companies the day prior to the announcement today and they\u2019ve outperformed the bank index. Would you guys consider a merger of equals? Or what would make you think about something like that in the future? Greg Carmichael : First of all, Gerard, we\u2019re \u2013 from a responsibility perspective, we have an obligation to our shareholders and our Board to assess any opportunity that makes good business sense for our shareholders. So if an opportunity of that nature emerge, we will discuss it. We will look at it. We\u2019ll make the right decision for long-term benefit of our shareholders. At this point right now, we have a lot on our plate, completing MB Financial, the organic growth strategy we have. We\u2019re very pleased with the performance of the franchise. We don\u2019t think we need to do anything but continue to invest in our business and grow our business and deliver on the results that we\u2019re talking about today. But once again, if something did emerge of that nature, we would consider it as we would be required to. But at this point right now, we are not interested in an acquisition. We\u2019re focused on driving the outcomes we\u2019re looking for through an organic perspective of our business. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : Next, Peter Winter from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Peter Winter : Good morning. Greg Carmichael : Hey, Peter. Peter Winter : Can you give an update on credit? Obviously, nice decline in non-performing assets. But I was just looking at the increase in net charge-offs quarter-to-quarter, which should be fairly stable in the fourth quarter and then this reserve build and then finally just what\u2019s happening with criticized loans. Jamie Leonard : Yes. Let me make just a short comment and I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank for more color. I mean we\u2019ve always said that at these very low levels of charge-offs, there is going to be small variations. But we\u2019re still in the teams in terms of commercial charge-offs and very much in line on the consumer side. The other thing that I want to point out is the consumer charge-offs, if you\u2019re looking at the year-over-year comparisons, we had a charge-off portfolio sale last year. So that lowered the absolute rate last year. In terms of the provision bills, really, I mean for any given portfolio when you think about it, if you sort of compare the economic environment at the end of June to the economic environment at the end of September, the background is different then. So the 2 basis point increase in reserve coverage is really more reflective of that. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank for any color on the actual sort of portfolio trends here. Frank Forrest : Yes. Hey Peter, yes, good question. Just some perspective. When you think about reserve builds, one thing to keep in mind. This quarter, as you look at it, we had a $35 million build. Of the $35 million, $28 million was unfunded on the funded portfolio and $7 million is on increases in reserve for unfunded commercial commitments. When you go back and you think about 2018, for example, we had reserve releases of $122 million. We said at that time and we said over subsequent quarters that we were at an inflection point. Tayfun has mentioned that several times this morning. We have been at an inflection point. Our numbers have been historically low across the board. We\u2019re really sort of still at an inflection point. Our non-performing assets are below 50 basis points. That number if you compare it to the median reported peer numbers is better than the peer. We expect that to stay stable. That\u2019s an important number. Our charge-offs are well within our risk appetite. We expect that to remain there. We haven\u2019t changed our guidance at all. When you think about criticized assets, we\u2019re watching criticized assets closely. The third quarter included the results of the shared national credit exams for banks. We included that in our numbers. We did have a blip up in criticized assets. One particular large corporate credit was involved in that. We don\u2019t see any loss and that credit has been restructured. Where we saw an increase in criticized assets has really been in sort of core middle market. And so when you look at core middle market, those ones tend to be secured loans and backed by guarantors. And so we don\u2019t see any particular trends or patterns related to geography or more risk type that\u2019s totally concerning to us. If you think about our large corporate book and you think about commercial real estate, those are books that typically have a lot of volatility in a market. Our criticized assets are below 3%. Both those portfolios are very well underwritten, very stable portfolios. Our leverage book is performing well. We\u2019ve reduced it by 50% in the last three years. So all the work that we\u2019ve done to change the mix of this portfolio is still reflected in our results today. And so yes, we did have a build in the third quarter. We did that because we wanted to take a very conservative view of where we are, that the market has changed a bit in the third quarter and we do live in a world that Lars was talking about where our borrowers are more on edge now than they have been before. Tariffs are taking an impact on the weekend customers, are not really having an impact on strong customers. So as I step back and think about it, 2018, we had a significant release. In 2019, for the most part, it\u2019s been stable. We took a look in the third quarter and we bumped it up a bit. We think it was the prudent thing to do. We manage this book conservatively, and I think it\u2019s been reflected clearly in our results over the past two to three years. And our outlook has not changed. So I\u2019m still very comfortable with where we are. And I\u2019m very comfortable with the positions we\u2019ve taken to change the outlook of this company going forward relative to repositioning the portfolio in a much different manner than we did in the past. Peter Winter : That\u2019s great. Very helpful, really helpful. Tayfun, on expenses, I know you\u2019re not ready to give 2020 guidance. I\u2019m just wondering with the full quarter \u2013 I guess fully realizing the expense saves by the first quarter next year, could you say expenses in the first quarter, you would expect to be down from 4Q? Tayfun Tuzun : Today, it\u2019s very early to be able to give you that perspective, Peter. The difference between the run rate just with respect to the MB portfolio from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is about $20 million. So on a run rate basis \u2013 because on a run rate, about $65 million \u2013 255 million divided by 4 gives you about a $65 million to $70 million type of number. And then we\u2019re going from 80% realization to 100% realization. And then our first quarter is always the high quarter because we have the VC numbers and the FICO numbers, all that stuff. So let us wait a little longer to give you that color. But as I said, we are very focused on making sure that we deliver the right expense numbers for next year given the background on the revenue side. Peter Winter : Thanks, Tayfun. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Operator : Next question is from Brian Foran from Autonomous. Your line is now open. Brian Foran : Hi, good morning, everyone. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning, Brian. Greg Carmichael : Hey, Brian. Brian Foran : So \u2013 and one follow-up on CECL. I\u2019m almost reluctant to ask because my understanding is tenuous at best. But my understanding was to reflect a double-count benefit where CECL had lifetime reserves and then the old PCI accounting had marks on these acquired loans. And then \u2013 so you\u2019re effectively reserved twice. And then that reverses through the P&L as the loans mature. So is your comment that it\u2019s unclear how that double-count benefit will work? Or is the comment that double-count benefit might not actually be there? Tayfun Tuzun : Well, we will have to wait for more clarity throughout the quarter. And I\u2019m hesitant to give you more guidance at this time. But what I pointed out to was that from a pure CECL impact perspective, the current methodology does not provide a mechanism to convert a non-PCI discount into the CECL reserve number. That really is more of the impact on a day one basis. But let\u2019s wait until the first quarter so that we can give you a bit more clarity on that. Brian Foran : Fair enough. One small follow-up. I still get a fair amount of questions on GreenSky from investors. I mean it\u2019s such a small piece of your book. I sometimes wonder if there are Fifth Third investors or GreenSky investors who are asking it. But could you maybe give us an update, where does the loan book stand now and any thoughts on the growth trajectory going forward? Tayfun Tuzun : So the loan book stands at about $1.4 billion. Clearly, incremental growth this year came in lower than we expected because the prepayments in the portfolio are overwhelming a preset level of originations. If you remember going two years ago, when we first announced the partnership, we thought by now we would be at $2 billion, which was the back-end goal. And so in terms of the portfolio metrics, credit is behaving as we expected and the margins are behaving as we expected and the margins are behaving as we expected. And the company clearly announced a period of time in which they will be evaluating different strategies and we are waiting for that. And depending upon in what direction they choose to go, we will make our own decisions based on how we see those loans benefiting our balance sheet. So I think there\u2019s still probably some questions that need to be answered because \u2013 before we can give you a clearer direction on GreenSky levels. Brian Foran : Thank you for that. Operator : Next question is from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning. Erika Najarian : So despite a solid quarter, the stock got down at the open, and I\u2019m wondering if some of that is the hope the market had that you\u2019d provide a little bit more directional, if not specific clarity, in expenses. So I guess I\u2019m going to try one more time. If I take out the impact of a March 22 close and I just look at consensus numbers or expectations for revenues starting in the second quarter of 2020, it seems like consensus is expecting flat year-over-year revenue growth from the second quarter of 2020 onwards. And I\u2019m wondering that given your message for positive operating leverage, if after the seasonal increase in the first quarter, the message really here is that if that is really the revenue outlook that will transpire in 2020, that the expense base would have to go down from that $1.117 billion in the fourth quarter. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. So I think the trajectory of the revenue outlook we gave you some perspective on our margin expectations in 2020, a 5 basis point difference depending upon when and how much the Fed decides to cut, if they decide to cut. But we still expect a decent level of fee income growth. We\u2019ve seen good income growth this year in fees, and the investment should continue to provide support for better fee income growth going forward than our \u2013 in the last couple of years. And I\u2019m very hesitant to give you more clarity than that in terms of the revenue side, and we will manage the expenses accordingly. And I think we are very focused on making sure that the expense base does not move away from us as we look at that revenue trend. And our teams are very focused, and we have about six weeks to eight weeks in front of us here to finalize our plan, and we are optimistic that we will be able to provide good guidance to you guys in January. In terms of what the market was expecting, the \u2013 what we guided in July, it\u2019s playing out for the second half of the year, very much in line with our guidance. The NIM, it came down a little bit more than we expected based on the rate movements. But in terms of the revenues, we had a great third quarter obviously, and that is capturing pretty much what we expected from the second half. And with the mortgage seasonality upon us moving from third quarter to fourth quarter, it is difficult to build upon this very strong third quarter in fee income and project even higher fee income in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re mindful of that, and a couple of transactions on the capital markets side and advisory side came in, in the third quarter. But in general, our outlook was strong for the second half of the year, and we are now actually showing a very strong second half performance. Erika Najarian : Okay. And so the follow-up question is \u2013 thank you for giving a clarity in terms of your net interest margin expectations for next year. And Jamie, I\u2019m wondering \u2013 I wanted to clarify, that range of 3.2% to 3.25%, that includes two rate cuts from here. And if that\u2019s the case, then the contribution from the $4 billion in hedges should be a positive $40 million annualized, with LIBOR at $150 million is included in that size. Jamie Leonard : So the guide we have is the cut in October plus two more in 2020, March and September. And in order to help \u2013 let\u2019s just look at all of the hedges that we have in place from a cash flow perspective. So our cash flow hedges in the first three quarters of 2019 made about $2 million. Over the next five quarters, if those rate cuts play out, those $11 billion of hedges are going to make $155 million. So that\u2019s $15 million in the fourth quarter, and then the rest spread out across 2020. So that\u2019s really the backdrop for our confidence in the NIM overall, not compressing going forward the way you saw it in the third quarter. We just unfortunately did one-year forward-starting swaps, and we probably should have done seven-month forward-starting swaps to protect the third quarter. But when you look at first quarter of 2019 versus first quarter of 2020, our guide is that NIM would be down 5 or 6 bps with those July, September and October cuts, and I got to believe that\u2019s going to be best-in-class performance over that period of time. Erika Najarian : Got it. Tayfun Tuzun : Our NIM results, actually, Erika, when you look at the cumulative change in NIM this year, we are ahead of our peers. I mean it\u2019s been a very, actually, very good performance for the first three quarters of this year when you look at it on a cumulative basis. Also when you look at it, as people are guiding now for the fourth quarter and the way we are guiding for the fourth quarter, in 2019, NIM performance is very strong. Erika Najarian : Understood. I think that the market maybe thinking that industries generally top ticking on fees. I don\u2019t think the skepticism is over, actually, your net interest income. I think it\u2019s a combination of just the industry top ticking on fees and then sort of what the expense management fallout will be from there. But I very much appreciate all the detail on NII. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Saul Martinez. Your line is now open. Saul Martinez : Hey guys. I\u2019ll ask another question on CECL, just a pretty popular topic on this call. Your reserve rate shows about, I think it was 104 basis points this quarter. With the CECL reserves 40% to 55%, that will take you more or less I think to about 150 basis points, ALLL ratio. Do you expect your growth going forward, the balance \u2013 your growth in balance \u2013 loan balance is to \u2013 on average, under the CECL methodology, come from products that have higher or lower than 150 basis points lifetime losses. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Good question. So when you think about the portfolios that are driving a higher percentage of CECL reserves, Residential Mortgage, we have, at this time and probably in the near to medium term, have no plans to grow the Residential Mortgage book. Home equity loans have been in decline now for a number of years. That\u2019s another portfolio that is carrying a high percentage. And then sort of other consumer loans, inclusive of GreenSky loans, also carries a higher percentage. So those \u2013 all those three portfolios will probably display a relatively lower growth rate compared to other loans on our books. And commercial, clearly being our largest portfolio, getting back to a more normalized level of commercial loan growth would indicate that perhaps that day one percentage would be overstating the incremental impact on reserves. Saul Martinez : Yes, got it. So I mean, under the CECL methodology, your commercial, especially your C&I, I would think would be \u2013 I don\u2019t know if materially, but it should be much lower than 1.5%. And just the normal \u2013 ALLL ratio should gravitate down at that as\u2026 Tayfun Tuzun : Everything else being equal, including the economic scenarios that are being applied to that is a reasonable assumption. Saul Martinez : Yes, okay. Got it. Thank you. On \u2013 and I guess I want to go back to NII and specifically on deposit betas and deposit prices. It seems like you have good visibility in terms of the betas on the rate cuts for July, September, October. But if I look into next year, if we do get a margin in the September cut, I mean, how confident are you with those 40% betas on future cuts? Because \u2013 and I asked because if your guidance comes to fruition, I calculate that your deposit costs \u2013 interest-bearing deposit costs are going to be probably in the 80 basis point range, probably lower \u2013 obviously lower, all in. It just doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a lot of room for deposit costs to come down from these levels given the low jump-off point, and deposit costs are already low relative to short-term rates from a historical standpoint. So I guess the question is if rates do continue \u2013 short rates do continue to come in, maybe even more than what you\u2019re expecting, how does the deposit beta outlook change? Jamie Leonard : Yes. This is Jamie, Saul. You\u2019re right in that our fourth quarter forecast, our interest-bearing core deposits is in the, Saul, mid-80s basis points of cost. And then that number coming off of the other rate actions we would take, plus a March cut, we\u2019d be into the 70s of that point in time. We still think there\u2019s opportunity to operate at a 40% beta on the next couple of cuts. But certainly, once you\u2019re beyond those cuts and if you had more in 2021, you would start to bump up against some of your deposit floors and some of your products. So we model all of that in our interest rate sensitivity tables, and that\u2019s where you see that when the Fed starts cutting 100 or 150 basis points that the outcomes aren\u2019t as productive as on the first couple. But I think for the foreseeable future, the next three or four cuts, the 40% beta is a good number for us. Saul Martinez : And are those cuts \u2013 are those betas coming pretty \u2013 are they pretty balanced between retail and commercial? Or are they\u2026 Jamie Leonard : No, it\u2019s very barbelled, where retail right now, we think from July, September, October, will be in the 25% to 30% range, and commercial will be \u2013 and our Wealth & Asset Management group would be in the 60% range. And that\u2019s similar with what we saw on the way up the 225 basis points of fed hikes. Saul Martinez : Right. Okay, got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question is from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Security. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : Hi, can you hear me. Greg Carmichael : Hey, Mike. How you doing? Mike Mayo : So three things which we can observe : your expenses are controlled; the MB Financial closings took place; and tech is a priority. So we can see that. So can you just give us some more understanding of what\u2019s happening under the hood as it relates to technology? Like do you close three of the four MB Financial data centers? So how many data centers did you have at the peak? How many do you have now? And where do you think that can go? And then maybe how many apps did you have at the peak? And what happened pre and post-merger with MB Financial? And anything else on technology, such as the cloud and what percent of the apps you might want to move to a public cloud? Greg Carmichael : And Michael, I\u2019ll try to answer that question in the order in which you asked it. First off, from a technology perspective, obviously, we\u2019ve invested in technology as other banks have done that. But we really like the returns we got from those investments. If you go back in 2007, just look at our central operations, and you look at 2007 to 2019, we grew that expense base 1% over that 12-year period of time. And we\u2019re $30 million bigger in assets, and this will be more in transactions. We focus a lot of our technology investments in operational efficiencies, back-office capabilities, artificial intelligence capabilities to better serve our clients. We\u2019re getting paid well for those type of investments. We\u2019ll continue to do that as well as our customer-facing opportunities, where we continue to leverage technology to improve the way we serve our customers and reach our customers and the effectiveness from a cost perspective of how we talk to those customers. In addition to that, we\u2019re investing in cybersecurity as you would imagine, with fraud. If you look at our fraud losses, we\u2019re down year-over-year. I would tell you, very few of our peers like are down year-over-year. Because of the investments we made in technology, we get paid well for that. So we\u2019ll continue to do that at the right pace in how we think about it. As far as data centers go, we run with two data centers. We\u2019ll run in the future with two data centers. Those data centers, I think, are about 200 miles apart as a requirement from a conduit perspective. And right now, with MB Financial, there\u2019s two additional data centers that we\u2019ll close down and consolidate into our operations. Most of their applications will consolidate onto our applications, and most of their applications were eliminated, except for those applications that were supporting their asset base lending platforms and their leasing platforms. Everything else, for the most part, is consolidated into Fifth Third, and the majority of that is complete. So we got work to do on the cleanup of the data centers, as you would expect, but that\u2019s all part of the plan and part of the numbers we explained to you, and we\u2019ll absolutely execute well on getting that done. With respect to the cloud, listen, we don\u2019t just move applications from our legacy to the cloud in current state. If we have the opportunity to reengineer an application and it\u2019s suited for the public or private cloud, we\u2019ll then move it to public or private cloud. We do use a public cloud. We do use private clouds. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s really based on the application. We\u2019re very mindful of the risk, so we\u2019re very mindful with the applications. Do we allow it to be in that cloud environment. So we\u2019re really diligent about how we think about our infrastructure. A lot of our investments are also around remonetization of our technology infrastructure, our legacy platforms, to make them more agile so we can move more quickly in this digital age. So we\u2019ll continue to do that. And the cloud\u2019s part of how we do that, but we\u2019re less concerned about how many apps we have in certain areas. But if you just move a current application up into the cloud, it\u2019s probably going to cost you more money to operate. Okay? Mike Mayo : Yes. I guess just that last comment was interesting. And as far as data centers though, where were you at peak? And just to be clear, you have two data centers. You have two more with MB Financial. You have four or\u2026 Greg Carmichael : We got four data centers, Mike, and we\u2019ll go back down to two. Mike Mayo : Okay. So you will have four total data centers when you\u2019re done. Greg Carmichael : Yes. Mike Mayo : And how does that compared\u2026 Greg Carmichael : Mike, we\u2019ll have two data centers when we\u2019re done. We had two going into the merger. MB had two. We\u2019ll consolidate their two onto our two, so we\u2019ll have two at the end of day. Mike Mayo : Okay, great. So two data centers. Greg Carmichael : Right. Mike Mayo : And how does that compare \u2013 and look, you have the tech background. You know this stuff. I mean, how does two data centers for a bank your size compare to peer? Or how many total data centers does the industry have? And why do so many banks not give this information when we ask? So I appreciate you giving this to us. Greg Carmichael : Yes. I mean first off, two has always been, in any business where there was prior days, in the manufacturing sector, two data centers is the more optimal way of running it. You have to have the space to prep the leaser off different grids and so forth from a telecom perspective, but two is the optimal way for us to run our business, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve \u2013 how we\u2019ve operated it. That\u2019s where we\u2019re most efficient, we get the best leverage of our talent and our resources and our use of our capabilities. So more than that would not make sense for Fifth Third or most companies, I believe, but that\u2019s how we see things. And we\u2019ll consolidate, once again, the two MB onto our current two legacy of Fifth Third data centers. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is now open. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Good morning. I have three quick questions, and then I want to kind of dive into my little deeper subject. But if you get into first three, your capital and your buybacks, you bought about $350 million this quarter. You\u2019re kind of foreshadowing $300 million per quarter. I thought there was kind of an overhang of past gains that you could have a catch-up this quarter. So I was curious why it went a little bit higher in the share repurchase in this particular quarter. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Good question, Marty. The $300 million per quarter is probably a good directional guidance. What we did was, as you remember, at the beginning of this year, we were thinking that we would probably be going towards a 9%-type capital number, but we chose to actually be at the upper end of our target, at more like 9.5%. So we had the Worldpay gains that still remain, that we executed in the first quarter. We decided not to execute the buybacks related to that. That\u2019s about $200 million or so in gains that we\u2019ve kept on the balance sheet. That\u2019s the difference that you\u2019re seeing. Marty Mosby : Okay. And that\u2019s \u2013 keeping that going forward, you want to keep that higher capital ratio, so that\u2019s there? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. For now, in the near term, that\u2019s probably a good target. Marty Mosby : Okay. And then you showed a schedule on preferred dividends kind of oscillating between 33 and 17. Is that going to be the pattern going up and down each quarter given the semiannual payments on Series H? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. More or less, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, and then it would change as any of the preferreds reach their fixed period and move to floating, but those are a few years off. So for the foreseeable future, that\u2019s a good pattern. Marty Mosby : Okay. And then I just wanted to bring up a point on purchase accounting. You have the uptick this quarter from 15 to 28, and then you have the reserve build of 50. So when you look at those two things, the reserve build more than offset this uptick in purchase accounting accretion. And those are kind of tied because as you\u2019re taking those loans out as they\u2019re prepaying and then coming back in as a normal loan, you\u2019re having to kind of rebuild reserves on loans that were in purchase accounting accretion. So there\u2019s an actual \u2013 not a real benefit this quarter from this transaction or this kind of process. There\u2019s actually a negative weighing on the quarter that kind of releases as you go into next quarter. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Marty, I don\u2019t think those two are necessarily connected to each other. Clearly, the higher prepayments have resulted in a higher purchase accounting accretion number for the quarter, but the build is not necessarily on MB loans. So it is a broader environmental factor that takes into account many other variables in our ALLL methodology. So I would not connect those two together. Marty Mosby : If they\u2019re not connected, there\u2019s some offsetting going between the reserve build that\u2019s negative and positive in the purchase accounting accretion. Tayfun Tuzun : I would still say that they are not connected to each other. Marty Mosby : Right, got it. Now going into CECL again. One, I wanted to answer Gerard\u2019s question. I think we\u2019re missing a little bit of math, so let me kind of give you what my thought is and then get your response. The thought that you increased your allowance by 30% or 40% and that your day two provisioning costs are going to be 30% to 40% higher, does it work out that way for this reason? If you look at your allowance over the last five quarters, you had provisioning of $475 million; you had net charge-offs of $409 million, which represented 85% of your loan loss provisioning. So that doesn\u2019t change day two. You\u2019re still going to have to cover your losses. What you\u2019re going to have increased is, the 15% of what you paid over the last year in loan growth goes up by 30%. So you could go from 15% to 20% of your allowance that\u2019s related to loan growth, which would be at that higher ratio because you\u2019re going to have the higher reserve level that you\u2019re going to have to maintain. So it\u2019s only the incremental part on loan growth that goes up by 30%, 40%. That\u2019s not your total amount of loan loss provision that you have every quarter because that\u2019s really mainly related to the losses, not the allowance ratio. Does that make sense? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, it does. And I think there \u2013 the second question, I think, was Peter or somebody else asked the question in terms of what that incremental number is based on the growth dynamics that we would see in our portfolios. So what you\u2019re saying is correct. And on top of it, which portfolio growth also has an impact on that provision, that is purely related on incremental loans. Marty Mosby : Yes. So if you had the exact same mix of loans, you would keep the 150 ratio. So instead of providing at 105, you\u2019re going to be providing at 150. So just on the incremental loan growth doesn\u2019t go up 30%. Your whole loan loss provision doesn\u2019t go up 30%. Losses are the majority reason for loan loss provisions, so the net charge off ratio still will be the main driver for your loan loss provision. Tayfun Tuzun : That is correct. I interpreted Gerard\u2019s question in the same unit in terms of just applying it to incremental loan growth. So\u2026 Marty Mosby : Yes. But Gerard was kind of get lost in that and assume \u2013 they kind of think although that means our loan loss provisioning has to go above that amount, it really doesn\u2019t have to. And the only thing I was going to leave as a guidance and just for everybody in the industry to kind of think about is because of day two, don\u2019t think of day one as a real good chance to round up our allowances because we never get this back. This isn\u2019t an allowance like we had in the past, where you kind of can build it given your economic belief of what\u2019s going to happen and then eventually kind of recapture that. This is a true to life, through the cycle kind of provisioning. So rounding up on the CECL is just going to more volatility and higher provisioning that really never gets realized until you actually liquidate your bank. So actually being conservative in a sense of rounding up. In our mentality, we\u2019ve been trained to do that for so long. It\u2019s not a good answer given the way the accounting is going to be different day two as we move forward. So I\u2019ll just encourage everybody to not just think of this as \u2013 I\u2019ve heard so many people say, \"This is our chance to round up allowance to prepare for the recession.\" This thing won\u2019t give you any benefit as you into that recession. So it\u2019s not a reserve you\u2019re getting benefit from. So anyway\u2026 Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks for that fact. I think that\u2019s very helpful, Marty. Greg Carmichael : Thank you, Marty. Marty Mosby : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Vivek Juneja from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Greg Carmichael : Hey, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Sorry, I\u2019m going to get a little more prosaic. Just a corporate banking line item. You mentioned lease remarketing. Can you tell us what the gain is on that for this quarter? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. That lease item, Vivek, includes more than just remarketing. Because remember, we now have two new leasing businesses under our hood, LaSalle leasing and Celtic leasing. So it\u2019s a broader number. There were just some leverage leases that paid off during the quarter. And I think that number was, I don\u2019t know, in the single digit, upper single-digit number, something like that. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Okay. Great. And that number, given that you\u2019re doing more in leases, it was likely to be more volatile going forward as a result, Tayfun? Tayfun Tuzun : There is some volatility associated with the underlying business, especially on the technology side, which is dependent upon the timing of the technology contracts that are coming due. But in general, I think the trends will be positive. I think we expect that line item, as we are also now investing more in that business, to continue to grow. We may see some seasonality going forward. And \u2013 but in general, I think the trends will be up. Greg Carmichael : Yes. And I will just add, as we continue to build out our equipment finance kind of [indiscernible] frankly in the regional banking market with MB joining us, our strength in syndicating these transactions has grown significantly. We\u2019ve got some great talent there, and we would expect that, that will continue to grow in the future. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Great. Second question, just wanted to clarify the numbers that I think Frank may have put out. Criticized assets, Frank, was it 3% criticized assets to loans? Or was it \u2013 did I get that not correct? Or was it up 3%? And how did \u2013 what was the change linked quarter? Frank Forrest : Let me talk in terms of classified assets, which is probably better than criticized assets. Classified assets are loans that are rated substandard. Criticized assets include loan that have potential problems, but they\u2019re not well-defined weaknesses at this point in time. Our classified assets were up 5% of the quarter. And again, as said before, they fluctuate quarter-to-quarter up and down, still well within our risk appetite, within our tolerance. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And has that increased, as you said, mostly from the shared national credit exam results? Frank Forrest : No. It actually was more in the quarter \u2013 on the classified, it was actually just more on our quarter middle market. That\u2019s a granular portfolio, and as said before, it\u2019s a portfolio that is the well secured. So while the level of the problem loans goes up, it doesn\u2019t change our outlook relative to nonperforming or the loss in a material way. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. I think the SNC portfolio levels, and I don\u2019t have the actual numbers in front of me, but they\u2019re almost like 50% in terms of these credit metrics, where theirs is classified criticized, they are well below the broader portfolio credit metrics. So\u2026 Frank Forrest : Yes. I mean that\u2019s right. And what I did mention before and maybe what you reflected on, our large corporate book, which is the Shared National Credit portfolio, for the most part, a level of criticized assets in that entire book is under 3%, and that\u2019s maybe what you were referencing. That\u2019s a fair number. And the same goes for our commercial real estate portfolio, was under 3%, which is where the banks have had the preponderance of their problems over the past decade or so. So those are books we manage very carefully. We feel very, very comfortable with the overall asset quality. So I think that was in response to your question. Vivek Juneja : Yes. Okay, thank you. Frank Forrest : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open. Christopher Marinac : Hey, thanks. Just wanted to ask about the talent pool in Chicago and the turnover that has happened with MB. Is most of that behind you? And are you confident with kind of what\u2019s happened on backfill with your staff. Greg Carmichael : First off, as we said earlier, the true rate that we\u2019ve seen so far is exactly what we modeled in. 90% of all of the outperfomers that we intended to keep we offered position to work still at the bank. This is normal with respect to an acquisition in the market by a larger bank. There\u2019s individuals that we didn\u2019t offer positions to that are going to shop to other banks. A lot of that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing right now. We\u2019re getting close to the end of that tail, all right, and we feel very comfortable about the talent that we have to serve that market, the talent that we retain. As I\u2019ve mentioned in our prepared remarks, we had very little client attrition associated with this transition. And Chicago was one of our strongest production markets in core middle market across all of our regions this quarter. So we feel really good about the talent that we have. And once again, to get $255 million of expenses on your job, a lot of that is people-related expenses. So you would expect those individuals to shop for other banks. And I know other banks have [indiscernible] is having success recruiting against entity. But that\u2019s just part of this process of consolidating two financial institutions. You\u2019re going to get some of that attrition, which is to be expected and planned for. Christopher Marinac : Great, Greg. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much. Operator : There are no further questions. I\u2019m turning the call over to Chris Doll. Chris Doll : Thank you, Prince, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR department, and we will be happy to assist you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand today's conference over to Mr. Doll. Please go ahead. Chris Doll : Thank you, [Dkitria]. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call for questions. Let me turn over the call now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported record full year 2019 net income of $2.5 billion or $3.33 per share. Full year adjusted net income of $2.1 billion was also a record for the Bank. As I reflect on the past year, I'm very pleased with the significant progress we made positioning Fifth Third for long-term success.  In addition to the record net income, we generated our best full year core return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI in over a decade, up 120 basis points from last year. We produced our lowest efficiency ratio in over a decade, which decreased 160 basis points from last year. We generated peer-leading household and deposit growth, all while reducing deposit cost during the year. Also, during the year, we successfully integrated MB Financial. We added significant scale in the Chicago market and expect to generate even stronger deposit, household and revenue growth going forward. We successfully navigated the evolving interest rate environment as our full year 2019 core net interest margin expanded 5 basis points after expanding 18 basis points in the year before, which is at the higher end of our peer group. We generated record fee income, including corporate banking, as our capital markets business generated double-digit revenue growth for the second consecutive year. We also generated record revenue in wealth and asset management, while generating positive inflows every quarter during the year. Net charge-offs and other key credit metrics remained at or near historically low levels throughout the year. We generated nearly half a billion dollars of excess capital through Worldpay transactions in 2019, which is yet to be deployed. And we returned over 110% of adjusted earnings to shareholders in 2019 through a 27% increase in our dividend and through share repurchases. In summary, we are extremely pleased with the progress we have made and expect to build on our strong performance in 2020 and beyond. For the fourth quarter, net income available to common shareholders was $701 million or $0.96 per share. Reported results included a positive $0.28, primarily from the successful Worldpay tax receivable agreement transactions completed during the quarter. Since the spin-off of our processing business 10 years ago, we have generated over $7 billion in pre-tax value for our shareholders, with another $195 million remaining in TRA income, which will be fully realized over the next five years. Tayfun will discuss the fourth quarter TRA transaction in more detail. Our fourth quarter financial results were very strong, reflecting our prior North Star investments to further diversify our revenue streams, prudent balance sheet management, continued expense discipline and our success in achieving the targeted financial outcomes from the MB Financial acquisition. We generated very strong fee revenue, including a new record in capital markets. Our net interest income results once again reflect our ability to successfully manage the balance sheet despite the lower rate environment, which led to strong NIM performance in the quarter. We continue to manage our expenses diligently. This reflects our continued focus on [indiscernible] the Bank, while still investing in high-priority areas to support revenue growth. We remain on track to achieve the $255 million in annual savings from the MB acquisition by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and are excited about the revenue synergies that are emerging. Loan growth during the quarter was consistent with our previous guidance, reflecting the generally subdued macroeconomic environment. Total commercial loans were stable and consumer loans were up 1%, sequentially. Following our trend, we successfully generated strong core deposit growth, while proactively reducing deposit cost more than our previous guidance. Our average loan to core deposit ratio of 90% is the lowest in over 15 years. Credit results during the quarter were partially impacted by our conversion to a national charter. Excluding this impact, net charge-offs were up just 1 basis point sequentially, with consumer flat and commercial up 2 basis points. Provision was primarily impacted by growth in specific reserves related to a couple of commercial loans. Before I turn over to Tayfun to discuss our results and outlook, I'd like to once again emphasize our strategic priorities to outperform through the cycle and generate long-term shareholder value. As I mentioned, we have been very successful in executing our priorities throughout 2019 and have delivered on our targeted outcomes as expected. We will continue to focus on these priorities going forward, including: leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation; investing in talent, capabilities and process improvements to generate relationship growth and improve profitability; continue to expand our presence in select geographies, focusing on high-growth markets. We are investing in the Southeast footprint with better deposit growth trends, higher expected population growth and greater market vitality. And lastly, we are focused on maintaining our disciplined approach throughout the company. To that end, our capital allocation priorities are : organic balance sheet growth, fee-generating non-bank acquisitions, paying a strong dividend, and share repurchases. Bank acquisitions are not a priority. Our medium term CET1 capital target remains at approximately 9.5%. We plan to increase our dividend another $0.03 this quarter. Subject to Board approval, we expect to execute our remaining buybacks from CCAR 2019. Our clearly defined strategic growth priorities, our proactive balance sheet management, and our ongoing discipline throughout the Bank position us well for the future. We continue to focus on striking the appropriate balance in order to generate positive operating leverage this year, while continuing to invest for long-term performance. I'm pleased to report that we were again able to deliver strong financial results. Our strong performance this quarter was a direct result of our employees' hard work and dedication to keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let's move to the financial highlights on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. We are pleased with our overall financial performance and strong finish to a strong year. Similar to the trends all year, during the fourth quarter, our net interest income, net interest margin, non-interest income and non-interest expenses, all performed in line or better than our October guidance. Reported results for this quarter were positively impacted by $0.28 per share from several notable items. The most significant was a $265 million after-tax gain from the Worldpay TRA transaction, which added approximately 20 basis points to our CET1 ratio. Similar to all of the strategic decisions related to our legacy processing business over the past 10 years, the TRA transaction creates significant value for our shareholders by monetizing gross cash flows that previously expected to occur, primarily from 2025 until 2035. Consequently, we are also no longer exposed to FIS' taxable income capacity in the future related to those cash flows, and we still have multiple years of annual benefits impacting our fee income in the future. We provide more information on the transaction in our presentation appendix. In addition to the TRA transaction, reported results were also affected by a $34 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap, a $15 million after-tax contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation and a $7 million after-tax impact from MB merger-related charges. Additionally, our quarterly results were negatively impacted by a $7 million after-tax impact to provision for credit losses, resulting from our conversion to a national charter. Our earnings materials provide more information on the various credit metrics that are affected by this conversion. Adjusting for those items and the purchase accounting impact shown in our earnings materials, fourth quarter pre-provision net revenue increased 14% from the prior year. Our core return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI also increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 14.8%, while our tangible book value per share increased 10% from last year. Our goal is to carry the revenue momentum forward, while maintaining tight expense control. We will continue to manage balance sheet risk by remaining cognizant of the environmental factors and maintain a prudent approach to capital management with the ultimate goal of rewarding our shareholders today and in the future. Moving to Slide 5, total average loans were flat sequentially as consumer grew 1% and commercial was stable from the prior quarter. Our focus continues to be on generating higher-quality loan growth to maximize our returns through the full cycle. In our commercial business, similar to last quarter, strong production levels in both regional middle market and corporate banking were offset by elevated payoffs. We have experienced higher-than-usual payoffs this quarter in our leveraged lending and structured finance portfolios, as well as in our construction portfolio. New loan production in regional middle market banking has increased every quarter since the first quarter of 2019. Our new loan originations, particularly in Cincinnati, Chicago and Florida, were strong in the fourth quarter. Total commercial line utilization was stable. In commercial leasing, our balances continued to decline due to our 2018 decision to hold new originations in our large ticket indirect segment and focus on driving relationship-oriented growth. We expect to see lease balances decline by approximately $300 million by the end of 2020 as a result. Beyond 2020, this impact should be lower. Average commercial real estate loans were up 1% from last quarter, primarily reflecting draws on prior-period commitments. Our CRE balances as a percentage of total risk-based capital remained very low at less than 80%. Commercial loan growth will likely remain relatively muted in the near term, reflecting the subdued environment for corporate capital investments. We will continue to maintain our focus on client selection and prudent underwriting in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. Average total consumer loans grew 1% from last quarter, predominantly driven by strong auto loan production of $1.7 billion within the same risk return profile that we have targeted for the past number of years. The decline in home equity balances continues to reflect high levels of payoffs and paydowns. Our credit card growth continues to track in line with the industry. The residential mortgage portfolio was flat sequentially. We expect this portfolio to remain flat for the foreseeable future, barring any significant changes in the interest rate environment. In the first quarter, we expect total average loan balances to remain relatively stable sequentially. For the full year 2020, we expect average loans to increase approximately 4% relative to last year with growth in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Moving on to Slide 6, reported net interest income declined 1%, compared to the prior quarter. The purchase accounting adjustments benefited our fourth quarter NII by $18 million and our net interest margin by 5 basis points, compared to $28 million and 7 basis points in the third quarter. Adjusting for purchase accounting accretion, NII was relatively flat with just a $4 million decrease sequentially. Interest income benefited a couple of million dollars from seasonal dividends. The adjusted fourth quarter NIM of 3.22% decreased 3 basis points from the third quarter adjusted NIM, which was better than our October guidance of down 4 basis points to 5 basis points. Our relative NIM performance throughout this rate cycle has been outstanding. Our focus on reducing our overall interest-bearing liability costs to offset the impact of lower market rates remains very high. Interest-bearing core deposit rates were down 19 basis points during the quarter, better than our previous guidance range of 15 basis points to 18 basis points. We expect interest-bearing core deposit costs in the first quarter to decline approximately another 8 basis points to 10 basis points from the fourth quarter, assuming the Fed remains on hold. Combining our first quarter forecast with the results of the past three quarters, we will achieve a cumulative 30 basis point decline in interest-bearing core deposit costs since the Fed started lowering interest rates last year, resulting in a 40% beta. On a core basis, we expect first quarter NIM to expand 1 basis points to 2 basis points from the fourth quarter core NIM of 3.22%, reflecting the increasing benefit from the forward-starting hedge positions that became effective over the past few months. For the full year 2020, we continue to expect core NIM to be 3.25%, consistent with our October guidance and down just 2 basis points from our core 2019 NIM, assuming no Fed rate cuts this year. For the full year, we currently expect net interest income, excluding purchase accounting adjustments to increase approximately 2%. We expect our first quarter net interest income, excluding purchase accounting adjustments to decline approximately 2% sequentially, impacted by day count and the relatively stable loan growth outlook. Our first quarter outlook also assumes partial reinvestment of the investment portfolio cash flows, which may change depending on the environment. Moving on to Slide 7, we had a stronger quarter in fee income than we guided to in October. Adjusted non-interest income decreased only 2% sequentially as deposit fees and corporate banking fees performed better than expected, offsetting a portion of the seasonal decline in mortgage revenues. Continuing its recent trends, corporate banking fees exceeded our guidance. Our capital market teams generated record revenues this quarter, up 10% from the third quarter. For the full year, our capital markets fees were up 12%, following 15% year-over-year growth in 2018. We are very pleased with the second half revenue strength in capital markets, especially the growth from our regional banking client activities. Our focus on client selection and deepening those relationships is working well to diversify our revenue streams.  The power of our One Bank model, which engages all business lines in meeting our clients' needs, is very visible in our financial results. We generated very strong 30% growth in corporate banking revenue in 2019 relative to 2018, reflecting the investments we have made in our North Star project in talent and in advanced capabilities to better serve our clients. As we anticipated, the return to those investments will continue to reward our shareholders. Mortgage banking revenue decreased 23% to $73 million sequentially and increased 35% relative to the fourth quarter of 2018. Origination volume of $3.8 billion was up 13% from the prior quarter. Our gain on sale margin was 156 basis points in the quarter, impacted by seasonally lower application volumes in the quarter and tightening primary-secondary spreads. Wealth and asset management revenue increased 4% from the prior quarter, due to higher personal asset management fees. We finished the year very strong in new AUM flows and expect this trend to continue in 2020. Deposit service charges were up this quarter with higher fees in consumer, as well as commercial. We expect a stronger year in 2020 in our consumer and commercial deposit service charges, based on the trends that we are seeing. Our 2019 non-interest income results demonstrate the increasing benefit of having a platform with a wide scope of product and service capabilities. For the full year 2020, we expect core non-interest income growth of approximately 8% relative to the adjusted 2019 level of $2.711 billion, including the expected Worldpay TRA benefit in the fourth quarter. We expect first quarter non-interest income to decline approximately 3%, reflecting seasonally lower mortgage and interchange revenue. Our first quarter forecast also does not include any investment gains. In total, as a result of NII growth and strong increase in fees, we expect to achieve a very strong 4% total revenue growth in 2020. Moving on to Slide 8, fourth quarter reported pre-tax expenses included merger-related items totaling $9 million, intangible amortization expense of $14 million and a contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation of $20 million. Adjusted for these items and prior-period items shown in our materials, non-interest expense was flat sequentially. We remain on track to deliver on the previously provided outlook for MB-related expense savings. We continue to expect to achieve $255 million in savings by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, we expect our total after-tax merger charges, inclusive of the merger-related charges recognized in current and past periods, as well as projected future charges, to be approximately $245 million after tax, which is $5 million lower than our deal estimate. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, we would expect our total expenses in the first quarter to be down approximately 1% sequentially. Total first quarter expenses, including the seasonal items are expected to be up approximately 5% from the adjusted fourth quarter, which also includes the full impact of the $3 raise in our minimum wage to $18 an hour. Although in the short term, the increase in minimum wage is dilutive, in the long run, we expect to achieve a stronger financial outcome through lower turnover, improved workforce quality, lower recruiting expenses and more effective training. For the full year, there are a number of discrete one-time changes, including the impact of the minimum wage increase and the increase in direct regulatory fees related to the OCC charter conversion. In addition, we are planning to continue to rationalize and modernize our technology infrastructure, which will result in additional in-year expense growth relative to our recent trends. These three unique items are expected to increase our total expenses by approximately 1%. We are anticipating a minimal increase in discretionary expenses outside of these items. Excluding these unique items affecting 2020, total expenses should increase less than 2%. In total, including these items, we expect total adjusted expenses to increase between 2% and 3%, compared to adjusted 2019 non-interest expenses of $4.372 billion, which reflects growth in expense items tied to strong revenue performance that I mentioned. Regardless of our 12-month outlook, which calls for positive operating leverage resulting from strong revenue and disciplined expense growth, in this uncertain macroeconomic environment, we intend to maintain flexibility to achieve positive operating leverage under potentially less favorable economic conditions.  We recognize that as we navigate through the environment, investments in projects with lower returns may be de-emphasized or delayed in order to focus our capital investments in the highest areas of importance within the four strategic corporate priorities. Turning to credit results on Slide 9, due to our national charter conversion, fourth quarter credit results were impacted by accounting policy changes to conform to OCC guidance regarding certain assets, which resulted in an increase in TDR and OREO balances. These changes increased consumer NPLs by $83 million and NPAs by $113 million, which added 7 basis points to the NPL ratio and 10 basis points to the NPA ratio. The same change resulted in a one-time $10 million increase in charge-offs, all within our consumer portfolio. Excluding the one-time OCC impact, net charge-offs remained at historically low levels during the quarter. The consumer net charge-off ratio was flat and commercial was up 2 basis points sequentially. The adjusted NPA and NPL ratios continue to be benign and in line with the levels that we have seen all year. The ALLL ratio increased slightly to 1.1% of portfolio loans and leases, driven largely by two factors. The larger portion of the increase was due to higher specific reserves for two middle market commercial loans in two different industries. We expect these loans to go through our resolution process in the first or second quarter. We also increased the allowance in our credit card portfolio as the incurred loss methodology captured the uptick in historical loss rates. As we discussed before, the higher credit card loss rates are related to growth in certain promotional test portfolios, which are expected to run off and result in more normalized charge-offs toward the end of the year. Card charge-offs were actually down 20 basis points this quarter, compared to third quarter. With respect to the CECL adoption, which is in effect as of January 1, the day-one adjustments will result in an increase of approximately 48% to 50% or between $645 million and $675 million to our allowance for credit losses, which includes reserves for unfunded commitments, and is below the upper end of the range that we provided in October. As a reminder, this increase includes the impact of the MB acquisition accounting methodology pertaining to our non-PCI loan portfolio and the CECL treatment of reserves, which adds more than 10% to the increase that I mentioned. As discussed previously, excluding the impact of MB, we expect reserves for commercial loans to decrease and consumer and mortgage loans to increase relative to the incurred loss methodology. We plan to include a full description and transition details in our upcoming 10-K disclosure. Consistent with peer banks who have recently commented on the impact of CECL, given the number and potential volatility associated with the underlying variables supporting the CECL methodology, we expect more volatility in our quarterly provision expense. Our calculations for the allowance for credit losses rely on various models and estimation techniques, utilizing historical losses, borrower characteristics, economic conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast, as well as other relevant factors. For expected losses in our reasonable and supportable forecast period of three years, we will use three macroeconomic scenarios. From there, we assume losses revert to historical levels over a period of two years on a straight-line basis. Given the multiple variables impacting provision expense under CECL, we will be providing forecast for net charge-offs for the foreseeable future. Overall, we expect our full year 2020 charge-offs to remain near historically low levels and be in the 35 basis point to 40 basis point range, which is up just a few basis points, compared to the 36 basis point to 37 basis point charge-off rates that we have seen in the last couple of quarters. Again, I would like to remind you that the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential fluctuations in losses on a quarter-to-quarter basis, given the current low absolute levels of charge-offs. Turning to Slide 10, capital levels ended the year very strong. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 9.7% and our tangible common equity ratio, excluding AOCI, was 8.4%. Our tangible book value per share was $21.13 this quarter, up 10% year-over-year. During the quarter, we completed $300 million in buybacks, which reduced our share count by approximately 10 million shares or about 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, compared to the third quarter. We expect to execute the remaining approximately $600 million of repurchases over the remaining two quarters in this CCAR cycle. Between the Worldpay sale gains in the first quarter of 2019 and the impact of the recent TRA transaction, we have nearly $0.5 billion of additional capital above our initial expectations as we proceed into the 2020 CCAR exercise. As we discussed last quarter, the pacing of our preferred dividends has recently changed in light of our September issuance and the conversion of existing preferred stock to floating rates with quarterly payments. We expect our preferred expense to alternate between $17 million and $33 million every quarter going forward, assuming no issuances or change in LIBOR. Slide 11 provides a summary of our current outlook. In summary, I would like to reiterate a few items. Our fourth quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we've made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. Our execution on the MB acquisition is on track to meet our targets on both expense and revenue synergies. As always, we remain intensely focused on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to outperform through various economic cycles. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask you to limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. [Dkitria], please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Greg Carmichael : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Hi, Tayfun, I just wanted to ask about the fourth quarter provision and give some detail on the items impacting it, in addition to just the move to the national charter, but you had, it sounds like, a couple of commercial credits and then the impact from the credit card portfolio as well. Just as you think about things sort of on a go-forward basis, how much of that proves transitory and how much, if any, is sort of a new run rate? In other words, if it was higher than expected this quarter due to some of those, kind of revert back down, or what's the best way to think about it? Tayfun Tuzun : Sure. Scott, I will make a few comments and I'll turn it over to Frank for the credit piece. We believe that clearly these couple of credits that just happened in one quarter impacted the provision numbers, which we believe to be transitionary. If you look at our guidance for next year, we are clearly expecting continued stability in benign credit performance away from sort of the accounting-related changes in our credit metrics. This truly was just one of these quarters where a few credit loans came up, but, Frank, do you want to comment on that? Frank Forrest : Tayfun, I will. And Scott, we've talked about before, the commercial business \u2013 and we've done this a long time \u2013 is lumpy. The nature of the business is lumpy. One quarter didn\u2019t make us trend in either directions in the commercial business, and it's something that you manage over an extended period of time. These two credits are non-related to each other. They're both kind of core middle market companies. The company has actually banked for a long period of time. One is a retailer. One is in the hospitality sector. They're just \u2013 they're going through a workout and they happen to hit at the same time. But if you revert back to the year and if you look at our overall, again, results for the year, we're actually very pleased with the asset quality for the year. As we said before, our criticized assets came within our expectations for the year. Our outlook for 2020 has really not changed other than maybe a [2 or 3 basis points] increase, just given the economy. And overall, our nonperforming assets for the quarter were centered on these two items, the $50 million net flow at the end of the day. When we think back to the work, we've done in the company intentionally over the last four years, we've repositioned this company to be strong through operating cycles. So, we're highly confident \u2013 I'm highly confident we've done that. These are middle market credits. The increases we've actually seen for the year in our problem credits have been tied to kind of the lower-end middle market. A lot of that's reflective of repositioning the rating system from MB. Some of it's in our systems as well. Those credits tend to be very well secured and historically have a loan loss rate, and it's a very granular portfolio, which is what we like to see. When you think about the portfolios, at least in my experience, where we \u2013 you should be concerned, as you think about the economy, when an [economy slips], it's commercial real estate, it would be your large corporate book and it would be leveraged. And when you think about our commercial real estate book, we have the lowest concentration of commercial real estate loans than any of our peers. And that portfolio has performed exceptionally well. And we position it with companies today that are basically national and large regional developers that are essentially investment grade or near investment grade, lot of liquidity. Our large corporate books performed exceptionally well, our shared national credit book; very low level of criticized assets, and it's very diverse. We manage the risk exposures there, I think, very prudently. And when you think about leverage, leverage in our case, we've been focused on reducing that for now for four years. We've reduced over $5 billion in leveraged loans in the last four years, which is a 48% decrease, but we feel very good about the remaining leverage that we have today. We have specialized groups that lend to that sector both in the line of business, and they're tied together with specialists that we have in risk. And we manage it prudently, we monitor it prudently. So our overall thesis, I suppose, is that when you think about the portfolio and what Fifth Third has done over the last four years, we've completely repositioned this portfolio for success, and we're highly confident that that work will project itself as we move forward in 2020 and beyond under any economic scenario. Scott Siefers : Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then separately, Tayfun, I was curious on the gain that you got from the change in the TRA agreement, do you guys have the same flexibility to repurchase shares with that gain as you do under kind of a more traditional \u2013 if you were to just sell shares and get an after-tax gain in that way? Tayfun Tuzun : Not with the gain that we book. We typically go to the Fed with a specific request, but clearly, the first quarter 2019 gain on share sales, we are able to buy back shares with that. But obviously, this gain that we booked in the fourth quarter goes into our overall capital ratios, which gives us a better starting point for the 2020 CCAR exercise. Scott Siefers : Yes. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Chris Doll : Dkitria, are you there? Operator : Yes. Next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning guys. Can I ask a question on the right side of the balance sheet, you talked about loans growing 4% this year? I'm wondering if you could put the deposits into context in terms of the mix of deposits and what type of growth you're expecting on the deposit side overall? Thanks. Tayfun Tuzun : I suspect that I'll turn it over to Jamie with details as well. We obviously have had a very good year both in consumer, as well as commercial deposits in 2019. We expect that our stable growth in consumer accompanied by good growth in household will continue. We do expect a stronger year in commercial deposit growth as well because we have a good amount of focus on the partnership in our treasury management group and our commercial deposit. Jamie, anything you want add? Jamie Leonard : Ken, this is Jamie. One of our goals this year is that we do match loan growth with deposit growth. And so, for us, we would expect core deposits to be growing similarly to the loan side at 4%. Tayfun mentioned our focus is really improving the share of wallet that we get on the commercial side of the aisle because historically, retail, as you know, has been a very strong provider of deposits and funding for the company over the years. So, our focus is getting commercial up to those levels. So, we would expect commercial to outperform those numbers, and then on the retail side, to be a little bit less than that 4% number, in part because we\u2019re intentionally running down our CD portfolio and repricing a lot of those higher-cost CDs around 2% or so, right now, repricing them down in the 1.25% range. So, we are driving those deposits out the door, which results in a little bit lower retail deposit growth number. However, you see that benefit show up in our deposit costs, both in the fourth quarter, as well as a big support to what we expect in the first and the second quarter of the year. Ken Usdin : Got it, Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, on the first quarter outlook, you talk about down 2%, but you did indicate that you expect the core NIM to be up and loan stable. So, can you help us flush out what the other deltas would be in terms of \u2013 you mentioned the seasonality of securities and some of the deposits. Like what else \u2013 it seems like that there wouldn't be so much of a drag on fourth to first. Jamie Leonard : Yes. From an NII dollars perspective, the fourth to the first is really driven by day count of $10 million, then higher wholesale funding costs and the impact of seasonal runoff in DDAs. That's about $5 million. And then the investment portfolio, we expect to be down about $10 million from the elevated fourth quarter levels.  The fourth quarter levels include a lot of the year-end one-time mutual fund dividend amounts, and that was $6 million. And so, the other portion of the investment portfolio reduction is that we did not reinvest cash flows in the fourth quarter. And as Tayfun mentioned, given where rates are right now, we don't expect to reinvest all of our portfolio cash flows in the first quarter. So, we'll be opportunistic. If things change, we certainly have the capacity to reinvest, but right now, we're running the portfolio at about 21% of total assets. And that's \u2013 will probably be in that 21% to 22% range over the course of the year. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. And maybe this is a good point for us also to add that for the year, our NII guidance for the year basically assumes a fairly flat, even maybe a slightly down average portfolio balance. So, for those of you who are modeling investment portfolio numbers for 2020, our decisions on the investment portfolio tend to be very opportunistic, but for now, as we sit here at the beginning of the year, we're not anticipating an increase to investment portfolio balances. If we do see opportunities, if the environment changes, that clearly will have an impact on the actual performance when we get to the end of the year. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. On the CECL front, if you could help us think about how provision on a day-two basis could shape up in terms of either on a quarterly basis as we go into 2020 or how we could think about it on a full year basis on how it's impacted by the adoption? Thanks. Tayfun Tuzun : Sure. Yes, I think the progress in our reserves and the impact on the provision number is probably very similar to others, except for when you look at what's driving the higher reserve rates, it really is the longer dated loans and some of the consumer credit outstandings. We, as you know, have been very clear on our expectations with respect to the residential mortgage portfolio. We do not intend to grow that portfolio, not necessarily because of CECL, but just because in the current interest rate environment, I don't think that we're getting paid to grow that. And home equities have been declining. That's another portfolio that has a relatively large increase in \u2013 under CECL compared to the incurred methodology. So, those two portfolios should not contribute much in terms of increases in reserve coverage. The one portfolio that we continue to grow is auto. Now, auto CECL is also higher than auto incurred loss. So, that should have a slight sort of increase, but if we continue to grow our commercial book, as we have done so in the past, that's our biggest book, and we will continue to grow that. I suspect that our coverage ratio ultimately will not change much from where we are standing, but we're all going to have to wait and see how this plays out. It is without having not even a quarter under our belt, it is very difficult to establish good, reliable trends, given the impact of these various macroeconomic scenarios that we will be applying. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Thanks Tayfun. And then, separately on the MB side, just wanted to see if you can give us an update on banker retention. I know there was some concerns about that a few months back on some headlines that everything you had indicated that you're retaining a majority of your targeted employees as part of the deal. You mentioned that last quarter. Just want to get an update on that front and how that's been progressing? Thanks. Greg Carmichael : Hi, John. Thanks for the question. This is Greg. First of all, we feel really good about the talent that we have in the Chicago market, as evidenced by the strong production numbers that we're seeing from Chicago. As you would expect, we have a target of $255 million of expense reduction. So, a lot of that reduction shows up in the form of individuals to late expenses and so forth that did not have jobs offered to them. So, a lot of attrition, you would expect to see that. I would tell you in general, 80 plus percent individuals we offer positions to or with the company remain. We feel really good about that. And our ability to hit our expense targets that we modeled in this attrition is exactly where we'd expect it to be. So, there's no surprises here. We've also taken a best-of-breed approach. So, when you think about leadership in that market, alright, and as far as a CEO, we've retained the best of breed we thought to run that company. There's redundancy. There's optimization that's going to occur. You would expect certain individuals to look for other opportunities as we modeled in. So, it's very much in line with what we expected. There was no surprises here. And we'll achieve the objectives we've mentioned, but more importantly, the outcomes in Chicago, when you look at our retail franchise, our wealth business and our strong, strong core middle market production, we're really excited about what we're seeing there, and also the revenue synergies as they start to come together as we integrate that business into the rest of our business, whether it be asset-based lending, leasing, capital markets, into the old MB book, we feel really good about what we're seeing there. And we're very bullish on the ability to accomplish our objectives that we set forth in that market, but there\u2019s no surprises here. John Pancari : Got it. Thanks Greg. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Ken Zerbe : Great, thanks. And just in terms of corporate banking, obviously, you've had really good success over the last couple of years with that business. And I know your fee growth is obviously higher for 2020 in general, but could you just talk specifically about corporate banking in terms of what you're expecting from that line? Is that \u2013 like how far forward can we continue to expect sort of those double-digit gains? I'm just trying to understand what's sort of transitory versus more of a sustainable growth rate.? Greg Carmichael : Ken, I'll add to this and then I'll turn it over to Lars for a little more color on this. First off, when you go back and think about our North Star commitments, a lot of those investments were in corporate banking, capital markets area. And those investments we said will start to materialize from a revenue perspective in 2019, you're seeing that. Strength in 2018, continued strength in 2019. We continue to invest in that area because once again, it provides the products and services we need to better support our clients. And we\u2019ve a great team assembled and we continue to make great progress in that area. So, we would expect that performance to continue on as we look into 2020 and beyond. So, Lars, let me give you the [that]. Lars Anderson : Yes, Ken, we're really pleased with how the North Star investments foundation have really played out. We shared with you in particular the re-platforming of our FRM business. We're already seeing the benefits of that. You can actually see that in our foreign exchange performance this quarter. FRM business is really coming back. It's strong, but in addition to that, a real focus on our advisory model, our relationship banking model and aligning our businesses to both our middle market focus as a company, as well as our industry verticals to be an advisor, a consultant, which that meant that we really needed to go after the investment banking piece of capital markets, and that is paying big, big dividends for us today. So, an example of that would be Coker Capital that we acquired, and that perfectly aligns with our advisory approach to the healthcare industry. Most recently, you saw the fact that we recruited 12 investment bankers in San Francisco. It aligns with our renewables and solar business. So that's the theme here is to continue to build out a broad platform to serve the industries, geographies, and segments that we plan to win in. Now look, we may not be able to control the ultimate loan growth quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year because there are macroeconomic impacts on that, but one thing we can do is, bring them advice, solutions, and those are often tied toward our fee products and services. And you're seeing that come through in our corporate banking success. I'm really proud of the talent that we have. Ken Zerbe : Alright. That's great. And then, just maybe one follow-up question for Tayfun. You mentioned that you have higher regulatory expenses related to the charter change in 2020 as part of that 1% extra expense growth next year. Is there any seasonality related to that? I'm trying to figure out what's \u2013 again, what sort of unusual first half kind of driven expenses versus this just permanently increases your expense base. Thanks. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, there is no \u2013 Ken, there is about $11 million, $12 million just the direct fee that we pay to the OCC. It's just \u2013 that's the marginal increase in direct costs, but there is no seasonality. Ken Zerbe : And it's just an ongoing expense going forward? Tayfun Tuzun : That's correct. The change is a unique change year-over-year, but it will be in our expense rate going forward. Ken Zerbe : Perfect. Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to reiterate maybe the point that you made earlier. If the NII or the non-interest income revenue outlook fell short, there is room to pull the expense lever and potentially we do better than the 2% to 3% range to achieve positive operating leverage for 2020? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, so we clearly \u2013 we have always intended to \u2013 in the past number of years to achieve it. We achieved it every year. And we continue to keep the same target. And when you look at the contents of the remaining expenses beyond that 1% sort of unique change, Erika, clearly our largest expense is in compensation. And there is an underlying inflation built into that, and that consumes over 0.5 point of that expense increase. And in addition, there is also another 0.5 point or so in expense increase related directly to revenue growth. So, if the revenues sort of tend to come in slower than we expect, we believe that it will be reflected on expense growth as well. And then, we're going to have to make some choices as to where to invest and where not to invest to wait out a slower revenue growth environment. Erika Najarian : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about just commercial borrower sentiment. You did mention that the payoffs were quite high in 4Q and had a somewhat muted outlook for commercial lending. I think it was the first quarter, but it seems like maybe commercial and corporate sentiment is improving. Maybe it's just literally the last few weeks here, but that's one of the themes that we've been hearing from some other banks and maybe some of the things in the credit markets point to that as well. So, are you seeing some early signs of that? Or is it a little bit of a different customer base for you guys than maybe we're seeing elsewhere? Lars Anderson : Yes, Matt. So, first of all, just to address the first quarter, there's seasonality issues in that. So, I would really be looking to Tayfun's guidance for the year. That's what we're focused on is executing in 2020. There has been a heightened sense of caution as we have moved through the second half of 2019 with some of the global tensions, tariffs, those kinds of things, but some of the resolution of that, we're beginning to hear some positive things. We're seeing some activity levels that are reflected in the pipelines, not just from a lending, but also from a fee solutions perspective. That is giving me a little bit more confidence as we look at 2020 and a potential pickup in activity levels there. So, frankly, I'm not looking at 2020 with a lot of concern. I feel like that we can go out there and execute, given where we have positioned our resources in the Southeast in middle market banking, in industry verticals, but in summary, there is still a sense of caution, but I would describe it as positively migrating. As you see, a number of things start to play out in the global marketplace and with some of the trade tariff activities recently completed. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, that's helpful. And then, just separately, you reiterated sort of your interest in additional fee deals. You've talked about this in the past. Just remind us kind of which areas you\u2019re mostly looking to complement, and are they sizable enough that you kind of pull back a little bit of your capital versus your target? Or they're just not going to be meaningful enough to really impact the kind of capital and buyback story? Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. The capital decisions are independent from that, Matt, because they \u2013 the timing of these availabilities are random. We have in the past \u2013 we're very clear. Lars mentioned the confidence that we have in our advisory businesses, in commercial. We clearly, if we come across opportunities to even grow our advisory M&A services etc., we will be looking for those. Long time ago, we started talking about potentially adding more capital markets capabilities in commercial real estate. As they may become available, we will be focusing on those. We have invested in our asset management business. There are opportunities that are financially feasible and rewarding. We will be looking at those. So, it is going to be more business commercial-oriented fee-oriented opportunities, but at this point, what we do with the capital that we have is somewhat independent of the opportunities. If we see the opportunities, we will execute them regardless of whether we're sitting on $0.5 billion of capital or not. Matt O\u2019Connor: Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning, guys. First, I wanted to clarify a couple of points on credit. First, you obviously \u2013 on the commercial side, you obviously mentioned the specific allowances for two commercial credits. You also had a big increase in NPL formation in commercial, I think $165 million, on Page 21. I think, Frank, you mentioned that was also related to the \u2013 those two specific credits. I just wanted to confirm that was the case. And also, on CECL, Tayfun, just again a clarification. And I have to sharpen my pencil on this, but I think your allowance takes your ACL ratio to like 160 bps, 170 bps. I guess what you're saying is that obviously, there is volatility, there's more things driving quarterly provision, but your best guess at this point would be that it sort of stays in that range and we should be modeling provisions with charge-offs and growth. Is that sort of the right way to think about it? So, a couple of questions with more a clarification question on... Tayfun Tuzun : I'll take the CECL one and then I'll turn it over to Frank. I think your numbers are right in the ballpark, Saul. And yes, sitting here looking at the balance sheet progress, without necessarily having a perfect knowledge of macro scenarios, I can only assume that it's probably going to stay around those levels, but obviously, after a couple of quarters under our belt, we will be able to give you a more precise answer on this one. Frank, on the credit side? Frank Forrest : Yes, on the $165 million, your question was is it inclusive of the $50 million. And the answer is, yes, it was. And just as a reminder, in the workout business, things are lumpy. It's \u2013 you don't package things up in any package and you have even inflows and outflows. We want to \u2013 we analyze inflows every quarter in detail and look to see if there's any particular trends that are bothersome to us. So, we didn't see anything there in particular that's spread out. I will say the flip side of that is, we had a really strong quarter on collections. So, our net at the end of the day was $50 million, which I think about as sort of those two credits that were there before. So, that's the story there. And again, it doesn't \u2013 I don't think portend anything different in our outlook for 2020. We feel very good about 2020 based on where we sit today. Saul Martinez : Great. That's really helpful. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery. Christopher Marinac : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on Tayfun's comment early in the call about the accelerated paydowns of leveraged loans in other commercial. Is that attrition going to continue do you think? Or would you look to replace those loans this year? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. Our intent is not necessarily to grow the leveraged portfolio to make up for the faster payoffs. We will make loan decisions independent of the payouts, but Lars, any comments on that? Lars Anderson : Yes. No, so actually going back to a previous question, just so that you understand, the build that you see, and we have seen both in middle market and corporate banking, increasing volumes of loan production throughout the year, and that is really encouraging, which I had mentioned about 2020, some of my optimism. On the flip side, and part of the muted impact in the ultimate balance sheet, a softness in the industry that we're seeing has been in paydowns, elevated paydowns. However, the complexion of that changed in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, rather than just deleveraging of some of our portfolio, what we saw with the two biggest drivers was number one, higher risk assets in the leveraged lending portfolio where we actually saw a decline there. And that's a positive thing. It's strengthening our balance sheet. And it's not that we will not extend credit into the leveraged lending market, but we're being very disciplined and selective in that market. The second piece of it goes back to what Frank said earlier. We saw pretty significant paydowns in our construction lending line of business, which I shared previously in prior calls that we expected that that would begin to occur. This was a sign of a healthy commercial real estate portfolio late in the cycle. So, maybe a little bit more than you asked, but to kind of frame it, we do not see that leverage lending will be a growth area for us for a period of time this late in the cycle. Christopher Marinac : Great Lars. That's really helpful background. Thank you both for the comments. Operator : Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : Hi, guys, Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to ask on your GreenSky relationship. I know you guys had renewed that relationship. Just at a top level, any changes to how you're thinking about appetites for those types of credits? And then, I guess more specifically, were there any changes in the terms as a result of that renewal? Tayfun Tuzun : I can't necessary \u2013 yes, we renewed the relationship, and we renewed the relationship of having had the experience with GreenSky over the past couple of years and having seen a fairly stable credit performance. Having said that, we believe that the renewal actually benefits us the way it was done, the way it was structured from a credit support perspective, as well as pricing perspective. That's all I'm going to comment, given the fact that they're the counterparty to the agreement, but we feel pretty good as to where we ended during the renewal discussion. Scott Siefers : Alright. That sounds great. Thank you. Tayfun Tuzun : Okay. Chris Doll : Well, there is no further questions. Thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR Department and we'll be happy to assist you. Operator : Thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Mr. Chris Doll. Sir, the floor is yours. Christopher Doll : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the first quarter of 2020. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.  This morning, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Risk Officer, Jamie Leonard; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Gregory Carmichael : Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Given the unprecedented nature of the environment, I will focus most of my commentary on the proactive steps we are taking to navigate this crisis due to the pandemic. And then Tayfun will provide more details related to the quarterly financial results in his remarks.  As all of you are aware, the events over the past couple of months related to the COVID-19 health crisis and resulting economic fallout has led us to reprioritize our focus. We are taking significant and ongoing actions to serve our customers, protect our employees and assist our communities. We believe these proactive steps will ultimately deliver long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders.  Starting in early February, the executive team and the Board began actively planning and prioritizing the organization's response efforts. We quickly mobilized our workforce to accommodate remote access for a large number of employees. Currently, more than 50% of our workforce is working remotely across the company. And for many groups, that number is over 95%. For employees who are not able to do their job remotely, we have established social distancing and enhanced cleaning measures based on CDC guidelines. Throughout these uncertain times, we have been proactively communicating with our customers and employees. We have issued more than a dozen press releases, several fact sheets and numerous proactive outreaches to our customers in addition to ongoing updates on our website. We have also significantly increased the frequency of communications with our employees in order to keep them informed of the latest developments, recommendations and health precautions. From a customer perspective, we are leveraging the strength of our balance sheet to help address the economic challenges many of our customers are facing. We are prudently extending credit to customers where we support economic activity. In March alone, we extended $13 billion of new credit, including approximately $8 billion from C&I line drills. In addition to keeping our traditional lending channels open, we are also participating in government-sponsored programs established as part of the Cares Act such as the SBA PPP and the forthcoming Main Street Lending Program.  With respect to PPP, we assisted approximately 10,000 clients to employ over 300,000 employees totaling nearly $3.5 billion. To maximize our support, we recently announced we suspended share repurchases. And as Tayfun will discuss in greater detail, we continue to have strong capital and equity levels to weather a prolonged downturn. In addition to utilizing our strong balance sheet, we are directly supporting consumers and businesses by keeping 99% of our branches open and fully operational with modified health protocols and amended hours as appropriate. We continue to process over 100,000 branch transactions per day, underpinning our role as an essential service provider. And for many of their banking needs, we continue to encourage our customers to use our highly rated digital platforms in addition to our network of approximately 53,000 fee-free ATMs. Furthermore, we continue to proactively engage with our customers. Our bankers have personally connected with 2 million customers over the past month to see how they are doing under these circumstances, both personally and financially, and to offer systems as needed under our extensive financial hardship relief programs. In March, we began providing relief in the form of payment deferrals and forbearances to customers across a wide array of lending products. We also suspended vehicle repossessions in home foreclosures. Since the roll of our systems programs, we have processed over 96,000 hardship requests, which represents approximately $1.5 billion in Fifth Third loan balances in addition to $6 billion from our mortgage servicing portfolio. As I mentioned, taking care of our employees is a top priority. In addition to our safety measures, we have announced special payments of up to $1,000 per employee for those providing essential banking services. These measures have helped maintain call center operations and branch personnel at appropriate levels. For our communities, we recently committed nearly $9 million in philanthropic funds to help address the effects of COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to take proactive and aggressive measures to help mitigate the effects of the downturn. From a macro perspective, while we do not know the duration or severity of the crisis, we have spent many years preparing for a downturn by strengthening our balance sheet through a disciplined approach to credit and by increasing our capital and liquidity levels. We have also improved and diversified our revenue streams in our loan portfolios. Finally, we evaluate our firm-wide resilience through stress testing our balance sheet under a range of conditions worse than the last crisis and more severe than a regulatory run stress test.  Since the financial crisis, we have taken several steps, which have put us in a very strong position. We transformed our overall approach to credit risk management, centralized credit underwriting and added stringent geographics, sector and product level concentration limits. We exited certain commercial real estate segments and have remained disciplined in our existing CRE portfolio. The client selection focused on top-tier developers and virtually no land loans. We also continue to maintain an underweight position relative to our peers.  We exited businesses such as commodity trader lending and mezzanine lending. 3 years ago, we exited $5 billion in commercial loans, given the risk return profile. This has helped reduce our leveraged lending exposures by over 50%. We have also reduced our indirect commercial leasing portfolio by almost $2 billion over the past 2 years, which has significantly lowered our exposure to certain assets such as commercial aircrafts and railcars. Lastly, we have maintained our credit discipline in our consumer portfolio with a weighted average FICO score above 750. We have consistently communicated our through-the-cycle principles of disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and an overall balance sheet managed approach focused on long-term performance horizon.  Our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. Our first quarter operating results reflect the strength of our franchise and the strategic decisions we made in managing our balance sheet, our interest rate risk and our liquidity risk exposures in light of the rapid and widespread economic deterioration we saw towards the end of the quarter.  Net interest income, net interest margin, noninterest income and expenses all performed in line with or better than our January guidance, with a net charge-off ratio also consistent with our previous expectations. Tayfun will discuss the changes in our allowance in more detail.  Similar to what you have seen from many of our peers, our reserves reflect the CECL adoption, the economic impacts of COVID-19, lower oil prices and the impact of loan growth during the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that we are in a very strong position from both a capital and liquidity perspective. We are continuing to evaluate potential economic scenarios, but we currently believe our capital position is strong enough to maintain our current dividend if these conditions persist through the end of the year or remain well capitalized.  Before I turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our results and our outlook, I'd like to once again thank our employees. I am very proud of the way you have responded in extraordinary ways to support our customers, our communities and each other as we navigate these unprecedented times. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our company is well positioned to deliver on our pledge to provide financial support to our customers, communities and employees during the current pandemic and the duration of the economic downturn.  It is important to note that despite the unexpected timing and nature of the events that led to the sudden decline in economic activity, we are entering this downturn from a position of balance sheet strength that was built through the actions that we've taken during the past few years. Although it is impossible to predict the timing of inflection points in the economy with precision, since late 2018, we had been anticipating an eventual change in the economic cycle after a record expansion period. Our client selection, capital, interest rate and liquidity risk management decisions have all reflected that expectation. What makes this downturn more challenging than others is clearly the unexpected nature of the initial trigger and the ensuing low visibility surrounding the depth and duration of the downturn. All parts of the global economy are entering this cycle at the same time, but the unprecedented level of fiscal and monetary actions will undoubtedly provide a level of support to cushion a portion of the economic setback. The actions that we have taken so far and those that we will be taking in the coming months will focus on maintaining and leveraging our strength to support our clients and stand by them as we help them manage through this difficult period.  As always, we incorporate all information that is available to us at the time when we provide commentary about our business and discuss our expectations. Our overall perspective on the next few quarters have been very negative at the end of the first quarter, even before the rapid deterioration in the data and market expectations that we have seen over the past couple of weeks. As we look at the economy today, we do not expect a V-shaped recovery. Our discussions on relevant factors, including credit, will be based on an assumption that it will take a number of quarters before we see visible signs of recovery. What is unclear is the interaction between the fiscal and monetary programs and the pace of the recovery, and what the new run rate will be after that point.  Turning to Slide 4. With respect to the first quarter, we were pleased with our overall financial performance despite the economic disruption. Our performance in January and February was ahead of our expectations. Once again, our net interest income, net interest margin, noninterest income and noninterest expenses for the full quarter all performed in line with or better than our guidance.  Credit quality remained strong during the quarter. Charge-offs were consistent with our prior expectations, and the NPA ratio decreased 2 basis points sequentially. Reported results for the quarter included a negative $0.09 impact from several notable items, including a credit valuation adjustment for client derivatives, a charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap, the impact of MB merger-related charges and a mark in our private equity portfolio, in addition to the $0.55 impact of the provision in excess of charge-offs. Adjusting for those items and the purchase accounting impact shown in our earnings materials, first quarter pre-provision net revenue increased 22% from the prior year. Excluding the first quarter seasonal impacts on compensation and benefits expenses, PPNR increased 2% sequentially. Our core return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, increased from the prior year to nearly 15%, and our efficiency ratio continues to trend towards the top quartile among peers.  Moving to Slide 5. Total average loans increased 1% sequentially with growth balanced between the consumer and commercial portfolios. Prior to the market disruption in March, total loan growth was generally tracking in line with our previous guidance. Growth in average commercial loans was impacted by the line draws of approximately $8 billion in March. Since the end of the quarter, line utilization has remained very stable. Average commercial real estate loans were flat sequentially, with the construction book declining by 4%. Our CRE balances as a percentage of total risk-based capital remained very low, around 80%, which is significantly lower than our exposures prior to the last downturn, which stood at 174%. Average total consumer loans grew 1% from last quarter. In general, our consumer portfolio trends from the past year or so continued again during the first 2 months, with the auto portfolio leading the growth, reflecting strong production of $1.7 billion with healthy spreads and the same risk return parameters as before. Clearly, the origination activity significantly slowed down in March. And in the near term, we expect the weakness to continue.  The quarter-over-quarter growth in auto was partially offset by a decline in home equity balances. Average deposits were up 1%. In addition, our end-of-period deposit growth exceeded our end-of-period loan growth, which enabled us to maintain very strong liquidity levels during the quarter, even when we experienced very high utilization rates. The ability to grow deposits so strongly, while reducing deposit rates by 14 basis points during the quarter shows the strength of our franchise and our relationship-based banking market.  Moving on to Slide 6. Reported net interest income increased $1 million compared to the prior quarter with adjusted NII increasing $3 million. The strong NII performance reflects the impact of our $11 billion cash flow hedge portfolio as well as the wider-than-normal LIBOR/Fed fund spread near the end of the quarter. Purchase accounting adjustments benefited our first quarter net interest margin by 4 basis points this quarter compared to 5 basis points last quarter. Our reported NIM increased 1 basis point, and the adjusted NIM increased 2 basis points sequentially, which was at the upper end of our January guidance. Our NIM performance reflected the benefits of our balance sheet hedges, proactive management of deposit rates and a lower day count. The excess short-term liquidity levels in the first quarter caused a 3 basis point drag on our NIM compared to last quarter. Interest-bearing core deposit rates were down 14 basis points during the quarter, better than our previous guidance range of 8 to 10 basis points. We expect interest-bearing core deposit costs to decline another 35 to 40 basis points over the next 2 quarters and be heavily front-loaded in the second quarter. This forecast, combined with the deposit rate actions we have taken since the third quarter of last year in response to the Fed rate moves, results in a cumulative beta in the mid-30s.  In the near term, we intend to maintain higher-than-normal liquidity as we continue to gauge the duration of the line draws and the corresponding deposit growth that we witnessed over the past month. Excluding the impact of PPP loans, we expect our loan to core deposit ratio to remain stable in the second quarter. As a reminder, our margin is approximately 2/3 sensitive to the front end of the curve, which results in a 3 to 4 basis point reduction in NIM per 25 basis points move in Fed funds and 1/3 to the long end, which results together in a cumulative 4 to 5 basis point impact. It's worth noting once again that our differentiated hedge and securities portfolios are expected to provide strong NIM protection on a relative basis. We executed our hedges early when the 10-year was around 3% and also structured them to provide protection for much longer than most peers with hedge protection against lower rates through 2024. And as we have discussed before, our securities portfolio is also structured in a way that is meaningfully different than peers, which results in significantly lower cash flows and less stress on the portfolio yield. Our net premium amortization was under $1 million during the quarter. Moving on to Slide 7. We had a stronger quarter in fee income than we guided in January. The resilience in our fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we have achieved. Adjusted noninterest income increased by 1% sequentially despite the March headwinds compared to our previous expectation of down 3% coming into the quarter. The strong performance was driven by mortgage banking, client financial risk management and wealth and asset management revenues. Mortgage banking revenue of $120 million increased $47 million sequentially, reflecting the widening of primary secondary spreads and strong volumes, combined with the impact of the MSR valuation net of hedges. Origination volume of $4 billion increased 6% sequentially and 145% from the year ago quarter as customers took advantage of the lower rate environment to refinance. We expect second quarter mortgage revenue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19.  In our commercial business, we generated another strong quarter of capital markets revenues, which were up 25% -- over 25% from the year ago quarter. Client financial risk management revenue was very strong this quarter, reflecting investments in talent and technology, the continued focus to deepen client relationships as well as the market volatility during the end of the quarter. Wealth and asset management revenue increased 4% from the prior quarter due to higher brokerage and seasonally strong tax prep fees. We continued the AUM flow momentum again this quarter despite the broader market dynamics. Given the current portfolio allocations, we expect our wealth and asset management revenue to experience approximately a 50 beta relative to the S&P 500 on about a month lag.  Deposit service charges declined slightly this quarter. Commercial deposit fees were positively impacted by deductions in earnings credit rate and solid gross TM revenue, which was offset by seasonal declines in consumer fees. Moving on to Slide 8. First quarter reported pretax expenses included merger-related items totaling $7 million and intangible amortization expense of $13 million. Adjusted for these items and prior period items shown in our materials, noninterest expense increased 2% sequentially, well below our previous guidance of 5%. In line with previous years, our first quarter expenses were impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, our total expenses in the first quarter would have been down approximately 4% sequentially. In the current environment, there will be a natural decline in expense items that are directly tied to business performance and activity. In addition, we recognize that as we navigate this environment, investments and projects with lower returns will need to be reprioritized, which gives us the ability to evaluate a wide range of potential actions. As we develop better visibility on the extent and duration of the downturn, several of these items will be actionable. We will provide more details on our expense management in this environment in the coming months.  In March at the RBC Conference, we provided a snapshot picture of our exposures to COVID-19 high-impact sectors. Slide 9 provides an update for quarter end exposures and also expands our scope of highly impacted industries to include nonessential retail and exposures to health care facilities. We are also adding more information on the utilization rates and the percentage of the portfolio that is described as highly leveraged. The totals on this page represent 12% of our total loans, approximately 1/3 of our total leverage loan portfolio, which at the end of the quarter was just over $4 billion in outstandings. We believe that in these segments, our client selection has been very disciplined with a focus on larger companies that have access to capital in stressed environments. 75% of our total C&I loans in the industries most stressed by COVID-19 are shared national credits. In addition, on Slide 10, we give you a snapshot of our energy portfolio. This portfolio is less levered and more hedged than the portfolio before the last downturn in oil prices. Nearly 80% of the portfolio is in reserve-based lending. During the 2015 disruption, we experienced approximately $25 million in losses. In the current environment, we estimate that the production breakeven is about $18 per barrel. On Slide 11, we give you an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios. The FICO scores clearly indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio with over 55% of the portfolio containing FICO scores of 750 or higher on a balance-weighted basis. Approximately 90% of the consumer portfolio is secured. And as you can see by our FICO band distributions, our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high prime super prime space. From a hardship perspective, only 10% of the mortgage forbearance requests have LTVs greater than 80%, except for those with guarantees or insurance. Also in February, we further tightened our underwriting standards, specifically on minimum FICO scores and maximum LTV levels.  Turning to credit results on Slide 12. Net charge-offs remained near historically low levels during the quarter. The consumer net charge-off ratio was down 12 basis points, and commercial was up 12 basis points sequentially, resulting in a total net charge-off ratio of 44 basis points, consistent with our previous expectations. NPAs continue to be well behaved, up just 4% sequentially. Given the loan portfolio dynamics I mentioned earlier, the NPA ratio was down 2 basis points sequentially. Obviously, with the adoption of CECL, we substantially increased our reserves at the beginning of the quarter. And given the COVID-19 impact and loan growth, our provision was 525% of charge-offs.  Slide 13 provides an overview of the major changes in our loan. Our day 1 build was $653 million, consistent with our previous guidance and includes $171 million from the MB portfolio, as we discussed previously, which was significantly impacted by the disparate manner in which purchase accounting discounts were treated under the incurred model versus the CECL model. The post-day one incremental allowance during the quarter was based on several factors : a significantly weaker economic outlook, including a lower oil price, higher funded loan balances and the impact of unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus. The overall approach is a combination of quantitative model-based estimates and qualitative overlays. We use a three year reasonable and supportable period, followed by a two year reversion to historic losses. The quantitative process is based on multiple economic scenarios. The expectation for the two predominant macroeconomic factors is a sharp downturn in GDP and a rise in unemployment in the next two quarters, the impacts of which are partially cushioned by the aggressive levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus, leading to a very weak recovery in the fourth quarter. The challenge associated with calibrating our expectations is, as other banks have discussed, the speed at which the real-time updates to the economic forecasts are changing. The base scenario assumes that GDP growth will slowly start to recover in the fourth quarter and will reach a year-over-year growth of approximately 3% in 2021, with the unemployment rate remaining above 6% throughout 2021. The more stressful scenario has GDP continuing to decline through the first quarter of 2021 and unemployment staying about 7% for almost the entire 3-year reasonable and supportable forecast period. The oil price under the base case reaches $33 in the fourth quarter, but under the more stressful scenario remains below $30 through 2021.  As a reference point, we compare our current reserve level with a 9-quarter total loss estimates within the 2 most recent severe stress test runs that we ran, including the 2019 stress test that we ran last year despite the fact that we were not required to submit, and the 2020 stress test that we recently submitted to the Fed, in addition to the most recent Fed-run adverse and severe stress tests from 2018. Our current reserves stand at 76% of the 9-quarter cumulative losses projected under the 2018 Fed adverse scenario, 44% of the 9-quarter losses under the 2018 Fed severe scenario, 50% of the 9-quarter losses under the 2019 severe scenario, and 54% of the 9-quarter losses under the 2020 severe scenario that we just submitted. In the absence of better visibility on future levels of economic activity, these reference points give you some guidance on the strength of our current ACL ratio of 2.13%. In addition, we still have approximately $200 million or 17 basis points of our total loans and remaining discounts associated to the MB portfolio.  As other management teams have mentioned during their earnings calls, most of the economic scenarios published since the end of the quarter are forecasting a weaker outlook compared to previous forecasts. As more quantitative and qualitative information becomes available, we will incorporate them into our reserve analysis. As the significant fiscal and monetary support is likely to reduce the impact of both the near-term decline in the GDP and the increase in unemployment, the more meaningful impact on reserve levels will be the shape of the recovery and the level of the economic activity in the post-recovery period.  Turning to Slide 14. Our capital and liquidity positions remained very strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.4%, over 280 basis points above the well-capitalized minimum. Given the various dynamics during the quarter, we are providing you a CET1 reconciliation between net income, RWA growth, CECL adoption and the impact of dividends. As a reminder, we did not repurchase shares during the first quarter. As you can see, the majority of the 39 basis point change in CET1 was attributable to line draws from the commercial book, along with the impact of CECL. Dividend payouts constitute a smaller portion of the change in fees. Understandably, the topic of dividend sustainability is of major interest to our shareholders. We believe that we are similar to other banks in that we are entering this downturn from a position of strength, and that strength will be able to withstand severe downturns. That does not mean that dividends will be sustainable in all scenarios, but at this time, we expect to maintain our dividends, which our Board will continue to evaluate based on the data available.  Our tangible book value per share was $22.02 this quarter, up 18% year-over-year. We have grown our book value for 5 consecutive quarters. At the end of the quarter, our unrealized pretax gain in our securities and hedge portfolios was approximately $3.3 billion, which is not included in our regulatory capital ratios. From a liquidity perspective, we have over $80 billion in readily available and contingent liquidity. Although we are no longer subject to the LCR, we have since continued to stress test our positions on a monthly basis under 7 different types of liquidity scenarios, and we then hold ourselves to the most stressful scenario. Our liquid securities positions have not changed since our phase outs of the LCR.  Slide 15 provides a summary of our current outlook. Given the uncertain environment, we are withdrawing our previous full year guidance until we get more visibility on the economic environment. For the second quarter, based on the line draws at the end of the first quarter and PPP activities, we expect low double-digit growth in average commercial loans and relatively stable consumer loans. Net interest income should grow slightly as a result of higher loan outstandings, while NIM tightens based on my earlier discussion on our interest rate sensitivity. In addition to the impact of the rate environment, NIM will also be impacted by the PPP loans and the amount of short-term liquidity on the balance sheet. Noninterest income and expenses are both expected to decline by high single to low double digits from their current levels, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 related impacts. Total net charge-offs are expected to be in the 45 to 50 basis points range.  In summary, our first quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we've made over the past few years, improving our resiliency, diversifying our revenues and proactively managing the balance sheet. That being said, we are in an unprecedented environment right now and have limited visibility with respect to the economic path forward. We will continue to rely on the same principles, disciplined client selection, and service underwriting and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment.  With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Christopher Doll : Thanks, Tayfun. [Operator Instructions]. Laura, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Saul Martinez : I wanted to ask about the outlook for credit and the interplay there with your reserving. And your reserve -- as you highlighted, Tayfun, your reserve levels are very high versus -- and they're especially high versus peers, so the 213 basis points. It's not only high versus other regionals, but I think even more striking is just within product category, C&I at 168 basis points, way above -- I think anybody who live -- on reserve ratios on resi and home equity despite seeming the high-risk -- high-quality portfolio, sorry. So I know there's a lot -- and you talked about your estimates in your process and your assumptions. But I guess, I just wanted your perspective a little bit on, to what extent your reserving as a function of taking maybe a more conservative stance than others within the confines of plausible scenarios? Or to what extent it actually reflects perhaps a riskier portfolio or at least a portfolio that might be more susceptible to a downturn in terms of the impact on lifetime losses? Tayfun Tuzun : Thanks, Saul. Good question. Obviously, it is a broad question. And the difficulty here is the environment has changed so quickly it is difficult to compare one bank's ratios and coverage to another. But having said that, what we gave you on Page 12 of the slide presentation, is a similar set of coverage numbers for stress test runs that other banks have. And clearly, our coverage levels are exceeding those losses that we have predicted through our models compared to other banks. What we have done is we have incorporated the -- as the environment continued to deteriorate in March into the end of the quarter, and basically reflected a fairly drastic change in the economic environment, not only in the second or third quarter, but try to project a weaker recovery into the second year and third year because we are looking at a 3-year R&S period here.  And I gave you some statistics around our assumptions. In our minds, the current fiscal and monetary policies are likely to cushion the second and third quarter impacts but are not going to be necessarily providing a significant support to the latter years. So our reserve levels, as conservative as they are at 2.35%, do reflect a slowly recovering economy rather than a V-shaped recovery. Underlying those numbers is also the quality of the portfolio that we have. We shared with you statistics on our consumer and mortgage portfolios, and we are also sharing some details on the commercial. The commercial book -- I think Jamie and Richard can comment on the commercial book, but the portions of the commercials that are exposed to COVID-19 also tend to be the book that has more large corporate exposures, more heavy sick exposures. So all of those combined, hard to compare our numbers to another, but we do believe that we've appropriately accounted for a weak outlook, slow recovery and the quality of the portfolio that we have in place. Jamie or Richard, I don't know if you guys want to add more. James Leonard : Yes, Saul, so as I stepped into this chair and started looking at the portfolio, the 1 thing that stands out to me is just how intentional we have been about where we do business with the clients that we select, that should be resilient in times of stress. And frankly, the focus for us has been on companies with larger scale that should be able to persevere in this environment. And so our loan book, I would tell you, is comprised of high-quality liquid resilient names, and the best data we could use to prove that point is the shared national credit information that we included on the page. And as you can see, it's a very high percentage of 75%. Tayfun Tuzun : No, [indiscernible] suggests that this is like -- obviously, we continue to evaluate the data as it comes. We continue to evaluate these new programs. And we -- at the end of this quarter, we'll do that evaluation again just like every other bank will do. And then we'll share you with you the results of our analysis. Saul Martinez : And I know this gets into the weeds but some elements of your modeling, 3-year reasonable supportable and why not maybe on the more conservative side than in some other peers. But 1 follow-up question. You did have the second consecutive quarter where you had a pretty elevated amount of nonperforming loan formation in your commercial book. If you can talk to that, and was any of that related to sort of piece of accounting noise with PCI moving to PCD and then getting reclassified into nonaccrual? Or was there actually something underlying that as suggesting some worsening credit trend in some parts of your book? James Leonard : Yes. So on the first part of the question, there is very little impact on the PCI to PCD transition. So the NPA inflows that you see in the deck of about $175 million was driven by several factors. One -- about 1/3 of the inflow was a single real estate mall exposure. About 1/4 of the NPA formation is actually in smaller businesses, business banking, lower middle market. And then the remainder, when you look at what drove it, it's really spread across industries and geographies, but the 1 common thread is that they're all predominantly in the service industry. So professional, medical, education, financial advisory. So pretty widespread there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: I was wondering if you could comment at all in terms of the PPP loans going to, I guess, those small businesses that need them the most. I mean, obviously, this is kind of a broader question than just Fifth Third, but it seems like a little bit of a free for all, and there's just been some articles out there about maybe some bigger companies getting the loans and not really kind of criteria for deciding who gets it and just wondering if you could comment on that, on your thoughts. Gregory Carmichael : Yes, Matt, this is Greg. As I mentioned, we processed about 10,000 loans for our customers to the tune about $3.5 billion. The average loan size is about $350,000, $370,000. So that -- for our portfolio, I think it was pretty broad-based, but we did a good job, I think, at servicing both the LMI community businesses, small businesses in general, very few of our loans were up for that $9 million to $10 million range. So for our portfolio, I think we did a pretty good job of opportunities much through the system as we could in the short time that we had available -- the system was available to us. Hopefully, that gets refunded tomorrow at the latest. We've got more resources there because we definitely have a larger pent-up demand for the PPP program. But overall, with respect to Fifth Third, I think we did a nice job on -- the size of our loans indicate that we served a large portion of the smaller businesses that are out there versus the larger business. I've read the headlines. I've seen some of the challenges that other banks are faced with as far as prioritizing loans. We did not do that. We worked as hard as we could to get many loans through the system. A lot of that depends on the complexity of the request itself and the ownership structure of companies, kind of dictated how much we can get through at what pace if your loan got through or not. But once again, we've already input a significant additional number of applications, hopeful that the window will open here shortly, and we'll get those through. Matthew O'Connor: And any sense on, call it, what the pipeline is for when there's additional funding? Gregory Carmichael : Yes. Well, obviously, I think most bankers would agree, and most people would agree that the additional $300 billion is not going to be adequate to serve the total demand that's out there right now. We expect that $300 billion to $350 billion to be absorbed pretty quickly, even faster than the last 350 were absorbed. So we think it's going to be very fast, and we don't think it's going to be adequate. We think the demand is going to continue to outpace the available funds. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Erika Najarian : So just to piggyback off of Saul's question. You took a significant reserve build and still earned $0.04, with the stock at $16.75 and tangible book value per share of $22, so clearly, the market is fearful of tangible book erosion. And I guess my question here is, in the realistic scenarios for economic stress that you see, and it seems like your band of expectations are reasonable, do you see yourself continuing to earn positive earnings during the duration of this downturn? Tayfun Tuzun : Good question. I will not comment on this [indiscernible] Look, I mean, I think our -- away from reserve builds and loss expectations, I think the underlying PPNR activity is going to continue to look good. We intend to manage our expenses at an appropriate level relative to the environment. We have a strong protection against a lower rate environment, and we have diversified revenue streams. So the company has strong ability to generate capital on earnings in this environment. As I mentioned earlier, it is a little difficult to predict exactly what will happen to the provision and the charge-offs. But clearly, our intent is to continue to outpace the impact of the credit here. And this is one of those environments where, unfortunately, looking longer than beyond 1 or 2 quarters is extremely difficult. So we will give you a better update as we get a better read on the environment. But obviously, we believe strongly in our ability to manage this company at profitable levels. Erika Najarian : And just my follow-up question is, you noted that there would be a total impact of 4 to 5 basis points on the net interest margin. If we consider each 25 basis point of decline in the short end plus what's happened to the long end. And I'm wondering, does that include the PPP impact? And does that include the reduction in deposit cost that you anticipate? And how do you plan to fund the PPP loans that are coming on balance sheet? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. So we did not give any NIM guidance this quarter, and that was on purpose. I think the general dynamics around NIM and the impact of lower short-term rates and a flatter curve at lower rates is pretty set for us. As I mentioned, it's 4 to 5 basis points per move. The reason why we chose not to give guidance this quarter is because there are 3 -- I view the second quarter as a transitionary quarter. There are 3 main impacts. One of them is the very high levels of liquidity that we are carrying on our books. I mentioned that March carried a significantly more liquidity on our balance sheet. Here in early April, we're carrying even more because some of the government programs are starting to throw cash. The second 1 is PPP, as you mentioned. And the third 1 is the LIBOR/Fed fund spread. We expect LIBOR/Fed fund spread to tighten throughout the quarter from the current levels. And what we also believe is the high level of liquidity that we're carrying in our balance sheet is going to give us a better ability to manage the deposit rates down during the quarter.  So all those together, the second quarter is going to be 1 of those quarters that's going to be very busy. But beyond the second quarter, that relationship between rate moves and the curve shape and our NIM impact holds pretty tightly. 4 to 5 basis points is a pretty good number that you can use. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI. John Pancari : For the detail on Slide 12, I think it's very helpful. And I acknowledge that similar to the prior comments that your reserves are booked to a level that's higher than peers. Can you discuss your confidence in your reserve relative to the DFAST numbers that you cited? I guess there approximating around 50% of DFAST, severe. Given that you are factoring in a U shape essentially versus a V, why wouldn't you think that those numbers should be higher? Not that I've got a problem with it or anything. I'm just saying if it is factoring in a U, should that warrant possibly a level that's higher than about 50% of the severe DFAST? Tayfun Tuzun : In order to achieve a better level of precision, we need to know more about this environment. This -- we are giving you these reference points as a comparison. I think the scenarios that underlie the DFAST are known, and they are quite severe. But no stress scenario is like the other one. And this one, in particular, is going to be very different in the sense that these support programs are yet to be evaluated with respect to how they impact the recovery path and where we are going to end up. That's a big difference because in most classic stress tests, usually the economy comes back at 1 point to where it starts. What we don't know today is where this economy is going to end up and the recovery period flattens out to a -- So I'm very hesitant to answer your question because we just don't know enough about the nature of this downturn. But at least showing you the DFAST results gives you the ability to compare us with others. And then as this economy develops, then we have the ability to reshape our expectations. John Pancari : No. Great. Okay. And then the -- another question on the reserve. Do you have the allocation of the reserve to the high-impact areas that you flagged? James Leonard : So we did not provide that, John. So relative to the 2.1%, one would assume it's north of that number, but we did not disclose that percentage. John Pancari : Okay. All right. That's fine. And then 1 last question, if I could. Just on the loan modifications. How much of your loan modifications have been done on the commercial side of the portfolio? And do you have any industry concentrations really where you're starting to see those deferrals? James Leonard : Yes. So within the commercial segment, we've actually had a fairly limited number of requests in the commercial side to the consumer side. We've only had about 400 or so, and it's predominantly covenant waivers for terms in 2020, and that's roughly $2 billion of outstandings, and that's led by car dealers, hotels and restaurants. When it comes to restructured or modified actual dollars, that's very small to date, with only $200 million in loan balances. And probably the 1 sector with the most activity would be restaurants. You see that on Slide 9, our $1.9 billion in outstandings. The good news is we're favorably weighted with only 35% is in dining and 65% fast food quick service. So about 80% of the book continues to remain open. Those that are closed are predominantly in the in-dining category. So overall, some activity here in the modifications, but it's still a little early. We'll see how it plays out over the course of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Gerard Cassidy : You gave us very good detail on a number of your different risks that you have on the portfolios today. And in the opening comments, Greg, you mentioned that I think about 96,000 fee waivers have been executed, also deferrals on loans up to $1.5 billion. That, I think, represents just under 5% of the consumer loan portfolio. Do you guys have any expectations of where those deferrals may peak out at as a percentage of your portfolio? Gregory Carmichael : Yes. Let me start and I'll throw it over to Jamie here. First off, it's 96,000 [indiscernible] requests, not fee waivers. So it's 96,000 requests in total, which a lot of that included, obviously, both forbearances and deferrals in our loan book also, but the fee waiver is actually much smaller now because -- Jamie, number is at 400? Give me that number. Waivers? James Leonard : About $0.5 million in fee waivers. Gregory Carmichael : Yes. James Leonard : And so Gerard, in terms of the hardship relief to date by product, and this is through the end of last week, so a little bit updated for April activity. What we're seeing is a lot of the fixed rate or fixed payment products have the higher request levels. So autos at 5%. Mortgages in our owned portfolio are at 4% of the portfolio. And then as you see the minimum monthly payments lower in home equity and credit card, they're at 2% and 3%. So as we model, obviously, we expect this to rise as unemployment rises, but the ultimate amount of hardship relief that we give will ultimately depend on where unemployment picks out. And for us, right now on most products, we're offering 90-day loan payment deferrals. And then in mortgage, we offer the 6-month forbearance. So we'll continue to update you as the quarter transpires. Gerard Cassidy : And then obviously, the focus this quarter for you and others has always been on credit quality, the provisions. Equally as important, Tayfun, as you pointed out, is PPNR, can you share with us your outlook for PPNR from the standpoint that, obviously, the second quarter end-of-period first quarter loans from the industry was extremely high due to the drawdowns and revenues, obviously, will benefit from that in the second quarter. But as we get into the third and fourth quarters and the unemployment rate goes up, underwriting standards tighten, should we anticipate that PPNR revenues start to shrink for you guys just because of the environment we're in? Tayfun Tuzun : I think, Gerard, here's my take on the year. I do believe that, assuming these drawdowns will stay with us for a while, the higher loan balances will provide a decent amount of support against the lower rate environment, and assuming that we manage the deposit rates down and our liquidity positions optimally, the year, despite the fact that it is a -- the worst-case scenario beyond just negative interest rates for banks, the balance sheet should support a decent healthy level of NII.  In terms of the sequence of quarters from second into third into fourth, I think we will probably see a changing fee picture here because clearly, the economy stopped, and that will have a near-term negative impact on fees in the second quarter from spend levels to asset management based on equity levels and to some capital markets activity. Our expectation is, assuming that things start somehow normalizing either into the second half of the second quarter or the third quarter, we should see a little healthier fee picture in the second half of the year. And then the expense side of it, we clearly are going to benefit from lower expenses that are tied to activity. And then we will start making some decisions on our end based on this environment.  So in general, you are going -- the second quarter definitely is going to be a transition quarter. But I do believe that as we look into the third and fourth quarter, we are going to start seeing some normalizing PPNR activity -- PPNR levels. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Couple of questions. Firstly, on your oil and gas exposure, can you talk a little bit about where you are in your reserve-based redetermination and what that could mean for the loans? Richard Stein : Yes, it's Richard. We're about 1/3 of the way through the redeterminations. And at this point, we've seen about a 16% drop in oil-based borrowing basis and about a 12% drop-through those that are gas-based producers. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And then I think, you said you've got a breakeven, Tayfun, you said of $18 production price? Richard Stein : Yes. What Tayfun was describing was we went through the portfolio and looked at the average breakeven lifting cost for our portfolio. So think about what it takes to get it out of the ground, and what it costs and what it would take to service interest for that portfolio. That's about $18 when you benchmark it to NYMEX. What Tayfun didn't give you, and I think this is important for the portfolio, we also say on Slide 10, the portfolio is 80% hedged for 2020. Those hedges give our producers about $14.5 of benefit, net benefit. So if you think about -- you had the hedges to it, it's $4 or $5 breakeven. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And those hedges, it sounds like a lot of them mature by the end of 2020. Richard Stein : What we've described on Slide 10 is the percentage of production that is hedged is 80% in '20, and then it rolls down to 30% in '21. Vivek Juneja : Okay, okay. And then what happens to those loans as those hedges roll off? Do you get to be done and the borrower has to figure out how to handle the funding? Or how does it work? Can you walk us through that? Richard Stein : For those under reserve-based structure, the borrowing base is redetermined every 6 months. So there will be a fall redetermination that will be based on current production, current reserves and the outlook from prices at that time. So the borrowing base and the loan amount that we're willing to lend gets reset every 6 months. So to the extent prices improve, that will change the borrowing base. To the extent they don't, the borrowing base would come down. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Great. And, Jamie, any color on the casino exposure of $2 billion? James Leonard : The casino exposure on Slide 9, the top part of the page of Slide 9 refers to lending to the operating companies within the casino and then the CRE portion would be, obviously, building the hotel and going along with it. We -- really, the names are large companies, high-quality, resilient. So again, we feel like we're well positioned. And while there may be losses in this portfolio, we feel like the lost content is very manageable. Richard Stein : It's Richard again. The only thing I'd add is, in addition to high-quality names, we're diversified by operator types, so global operators. Some native American and some regional. And in each case, high quality operators, usually where they -- to the extent they are regional, they have got a great franchise area that is either given to them by regulation or demographics that give them a ton of resiliency and less competition. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Robert Siefers : I guess, first of all, I just want to echo some of the prior comments, really good detail and appreciate the disclosure. And I think at this point, just 1 small question, sort of a follow-up on the deferrals. I guess I'm just curious on the commercial side. And even though it's early, I was hoping you might be able to give a little insight as to how you would expect sort of the, I guess, the re-due diligence process to go as we come up on the end of the deferral time period and how will that go? Sort of willingness to defer again? Or how does that entire process work through? James Leonard : Yes. So on the mortgage, are you talking on the consumer side, Scott? Robert Siefers : No. Actually, even though it's relatively small, I'm actually more curious about the commercial side. James Leonard : Yes. So the commercial side will just continue on a case-by-case basis with each client. The covenant relief period expire. As we're executing on these covenant waivers, we have been adding some additional liquidity capital retention requirements as well. So we feel like the process has been productive. It's been a good dialogue with clients. And so that will just continue over the course of the year. Robert Siefers : Okay. Perfect. And then at what point do you sort of -- I mean, I guess it's all case by case, but at what point do you sort of make the decision as to, okay, we could continue to sort of forbear on this or maybe it needs to be a downgraded charge-off, et cetera? Richard Stein : Yes. Hey, it's Richard. So we review the portfolio actively and for the names that are going to be more impacted at least quarterly. But there is active management, active dialogue. And so as new information comes in, we adjust our internal risk ratings. And then as we have financial reporting, that would be the other driver that would change our view on our risk. To the extent that borrowers continue to perform in line with expectations, we would expect to continue the deferrals and the forbearance that we've agreed to. Operator : There are no question at this time. You may now continue, Chris. Christopher Doll : Thank you, Kyle, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department, and we'll be happy to assist you. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christopher Doll : Thank you, Denise. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today we will be discussing our financial results for the second quarter of 2020. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Risk Officer, Jimmy Leonard and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Gregory Carmichael : Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I'll focus most of my comments on the actions we have taken to navigate this challenging environment, and provide some highlights on our strong financial performance this quarter. Tayfun will then provide more details related to the quarterly financial results in his remarks. In light of the ongoing challenges brought on by the pandemic and the heightened civil unrest resulting from the inequities in our country, we continue to prioritize our actions to support our customers, our communities and our employees. We proactively made over 3 million calls to our customers since the onset of the pandemic to assess their financial situation. In total, we have processed over 150,000 loan deferral and forbearance requests since the rollout of our COVID hardship programs, or approximately 6% of total loans. More than 35% of those in our consumer deferral or forbearance programs have made one or more payments. Consumer hardship relief requests, including mortgage, declined approximately 85% from the mid-April peak through last week of June. Beginning July 1st, we started methodically transitioning our customers from the COVID hardship programs to a combination of short and long-term options if the customer required further assistance, depending on the product type and borrower circumstances. This approach is consistent with our pre-COVID hardship programs. As of the end of last week, more than 50% of the consumer loan deferrals have transitioned off the COVID programs, of which only 12% have requested additional hardship assistance. In total, consumers who have exited COVID programs and requested additional relief represent less than 0.5% of total consumer loans. The declining request, the high percentage of customers who have made a payment and a small number of customers requesting additional assistance, give us confidence in the strength of the underlying credit quality of our consumer portfolio. In addition to providing hardship relief, we continue to support our customers through the Paycheck Protection Program. Due to the tremendous efforts by hundreds of Fifth Third employees, we have successfully originated $5.5 billion of loans, benefiting 38,000 small and mid-sized businesses, which in turn, helps approximately 500,000 employees of our PPP customers. Looking ahead the client forgiveness request, where we are awaiting further clarity from the SBA, we have developed an automated solution, which should help simplify the forgiveness process. Ultimately, we estimate nearly 90% of PPP clients will request and qualify for forgiveness. Our top priority remains the health and safety of our customers and employees. While we have kept approximately 99% of our branches open throughout the pandemic to serve our customers, we continue to monitor developments in select geographies, given the recent increase in COVID cases, and we will continue to follow the state and CDC guidelines to protect the safety of our employees and customers. We continue to encourage customers to utilize our digital tools going into pandemic. As a result, we are seeing increased adoption rates with about 75% of all transactions now occurring through our digital channels. Now moving on to financial results. Our second quarter performance was strong. Once again, our results highlight the strength of our franchise and our ability to navigate the dynamic environment and mitigate the impact of lower rates through well diversified fee revenues and continued expense discipline. We have now generated year-over-year adjusted positive operating leverage in seven out of the past eight quarters and grew tangible book value per share for five consecutive quarters. We grew common equity Tier 1 capital this quarter despite adding to our reserves and paying nearly $200 million in common dividends. Our CET1 ratio improved 35 basis points to 9.7%. Additionally, our loan to core deposit ratio reached a historically low level of 72%, excluding PPP loans. Our strong capital and liquidity ratios are indicative of our balance sheet strength, which will serve us well as we navigate this challenging environment. With respect to capital, we recently announced our indicative stress capital buffer requirement from the 2020 CCAR exercise of 2.5%, which is a floor under the regulatory capital rules. Without the floor, we estimate our buffer would have been approximately 2.1%. We also announced our intention to maintain our current common dividend per share and continue the suspension of share repurchases through at least year-end. We will continue to provide our Board with the necessary information to make forward-looking and data-driven decisions about the sustainability of the dividend. In terms of credit quality, the net charge-off ratio of 44 basis points this quarter was better than the low end of our previous guidance range, reflecting improvement in consumer and relative stability in commercial. While we do not have perfect foresight with respect to the duration or severity of this downturn, we have consistently communicated our through-the-cycle principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and an overall balance sheet management approach focused on long-term performance. While economic visibility remains low, our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. From a commercial client standpoint, we continue to focus on generating relationships with clients who have more diversified and resilient balance sheets as well as multiple sources of repayment. We've been very successful keeping our client relationships. And as a result, have generated record capital markets revenue in three out of the last four quarters. We believe this composition towards larger relationships will serve us well as our clients navigate the pandemic. In fact, corporate banking clients representing approximately 20% of our exposures successfully accessed the debt and equity capital markets since the onset of the pandemic to bolster their liquidity, including 20% in the COVID high-impact industries. We continue to believe we are well positioned relative to peers in commercial real estate, an area where we have been deliberately underweight. We have focused predominantly on top-tier developers with a track record of resilience and significantly lower LTVs compared to the last downturn. Our portfolio is well diversified by geography and property type, including virtually no land loans. And as we have discussed before, we continue to get at the low end of peers as a percentage of total capital. It is worth noting that across both of our portfolios in consumer and commercial, we have focused on maintaining geographical diversification through several national businesses, including indirect auto and residential mortgage in addition to C&I and CRE. Our credit risk is well diversified beyond our retail footprint through these national lending businesses, which will be instrumental in delivering a differentiated credit performance given the likelihood of an uneven economic recovery. In addition to our deliberate positioning with respect to credit risk exposures, we have also spent many years preparing for a turn in the economic cycle by improving and diversifying both our key revenues and our loan portfolios, which was evident in the second quarter results. Our PPNR increased 10% from a year-ago quarter despite the continued headwinds from lower rates. This reflects a record quarter in capital markets, strong mortgage origination revenue, proactive liability management and continued expense discipline. Our four key strategic priorities, leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation, driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies, and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection, remain intact. Clearly, in this type of environment, we are putting the appropriate level of focus and prioritization on the initiatives within those four priorities, which had the highest probability of driving long-term financial success. Before I turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail, I would like to once again thank our employees. I am very proud of the way you have responded in extraordinary ways to support our customers, our communities and each other during these unprecedented times. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before I begin my review of the quarter, let me also reiterate that we are very proud of our - how our colleagues have responded to the many uncertainties that we face in navigating through the challenges associated with the nature of this downturn. We do believe that the actions that we have taken so far and those that we will be taking in the coming quarters will continue to display our strong desire to fulfill our role in reinvigorating the economy by maintaining and leveraging our strength to support our clients in managing through this difficult period. The data and information that are available to us today continue to indicate low visibility regarding the direction of the economy. Our discussion today and our decisions during the second quarter collectively reflect our cautious approach behind our decisions on managing risk exposures in this uncertain period. As we commented during our first quarter earnings conference call, our economic assumptions based on Moody's economic scenarios, which underlie our outlook, including the background scenarios reflected in our reserve build, did not and still do not assume a V-shape recovery. Our downside scenario assumes that GDP will remain below the end of 2019 levels until the second quarter of 2023 and the base case assumes that it does not recover until the second quarter of 2022. Also, our downside scenario assumes the unemployment rates will remain near 12% until the second quarter of 2021, and remain above 11% heading into 2022, with the base case scenario assuming that after the current spike in recovery, the unemployment rate will worsen and peak at nearly 9.5% in the second quarter of 2021 before slowly recovering. This reflects our belief that the downturn will be prolonged and the recovery uneven. Turning to Slide 4. With respect to the second quarter, we were pleased with our overall financial performance despite the economic conditions. We took advantage of favorable market conditions in mortgage and capital markets, which helped us exceed our fee income projections. Credit performance remained relatively strong during the quarter. Charge-offs were better than our prior expectations, and the NPA ratio increased just 5 basis points sequentially. Deposit growth significantly exceeded our expectations. Although clearly a good portion of the inflows were related to the stimulus programs, we believe that we can leverage our clients' demonstrated preference to bank with us for future revenue opportunities and enhanced client interaction. We improved our regulatory capital and liquidity position during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio increased 35 basis points to above 9.7% despite the reserve build and exceeds the required minimum, including the indicative stress capital buffer by over 270 basis points. Our loan to core deposit ratio improved to 75 basis point at 75% as our short-term investments, predominantly interest-bearing cash were approximately $28 billion at quarter end. Our loan to core deposit ratio was 72%, excluding PPP loans. The combined hedge and investment portfolio on realized gain position stands at $3.9 billion, reflecting the growing value associated with the long-term protection that these portfolios provide. As a proof point, the sequential decline of our investment portfolio yield is about a third of the peer median decline. Reported results for the quarter included a negative $0.07 impact from several notable items, including a charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap, certain real estate impairments, including from our branch network, specific COVID-related expenses, MB merger-related charges and a debt extinguishment charge. Second quarter pre-provision net revenue improved 4% from the prior quarter and 10% from the prior year as we generated positive operating leverage again despite the rate headwinds. Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved nearly 200 basis points from last quarter and improved nearly 100 basis points from the year ago quarter. Return metrics were impacted by our reserve build, but we continue to produce strong revenues, while also generating efficiencies throughout the Company. Moving to Slide 5. Total average loans increased 7% sequentially, reflecting growth in C&I from increased line draws and PPP loans as well as growth in construction and auto loans. Excluding PPP, total average loans increased 4% sequentially. Given the rather uneven line utilization trends during the quarter, the timing of PPP loans, we are also providing period-end balance performance. End-of-period loans declined $3 billion sequentially or 3%, reflecting a repayment of line draws as well as subdued borrower demand in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. Our commercial line utilization rate was 38% at quarter end, down 9% from mid-April and essentially flat compared to the pre-pandemic rates. Line utilization so far this quarter has been stable. Commercial pipelines remain generally soft, as you would expect, and our focus continues to be on our existing client base in this environment. Average commercial real estate loans increased 4% sequentially, reflecting draws on previous commitments. Period-end CRE loans were flat compared to the prior quarter. As we discussed many times before, we believe that our industry loan CRE balance as a percentage of risk-based capital, which is less than half of what it was during the last downturn, combined with the strong risk profile of our borrowers, will benefit our future credit results, given the likelihood that commercial real estate will be exposed rather severely during this downturn. Average total consumer loans decreased 1% from last quarter. Growth in auto was offset by declines in home equity and credit cards. Auto production in the quarter was strong at $1.5 billion, rebounding nicely after the April slowdown with healthy spreads and the same super prime profile as before. Our average origination FICO scores were nearly 770 this quarter. Most of the other consumer loan categories reflected the generally-subdued borrower demand and consumer spend levels due to both weak economic activity and government stimulus and other benefit programs. Moving on to Slide 6. Average core deposits increased 19% sequentially with double-digit growth in all deposit captions, except consumer CDs and foreign office deposits. Our growth, so far, is multiple points ahead of the peer banks. This record deposit growth came from growth in every line of business and was very granular across product types and customer size. Growth in the initial months of the quarter reflected deposits from line draw proceeds, followed by growth from depositors who obtain funding through the PPP. Overall, the deposit performance reflects our strong long-standing client relationships, our customers' desire to remain extremely liquid in this environment and the lack of significant investment and growth opportunities. Average commercial transaction deposits increased 34%, and average consumer transaction deposits increased 8%. Commercial growth was well diversified between corporate banking and middle market clients. Average demand deposits represented 31% of total core deposits in the current quarter compared to 29% in the prior quarter. As shown on Slide 7, we have continued to take proactive steps to mitigate the impact of lower rates, which should provide additional support in the coming quarters. Compared to last quarter, we lowered our interest-bearing core deposit rates, 41 basis points, while generating record deposit growth, more than the high end of our previous rate guidance range and sooner than we expected. As a result, our June interest-bearing core deposit rate of 21 basis points was below the floor of the previous rate cycle with every product category meaningfully lower as we exited the second quarter. Our total core deposit costs, including DDAs, was just 19 basis points in the second quarter and 14 basis points in June. We expect third quarter interest-bearing core deposit costs to benefit from our actions and decline another 11 basis points. This reflects a cumulative beta in excess of 40. In addition to the actions taken with respect to deposits, we also terminated $3 billion in FHLB advances. End-of-period wholesale borrowings declined 13% sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, our current loan to core deposit ratio was 72%, excluding PPP loans at the end of the second quarter, significantly below almost all peers. Our current expectation is that the liquidity environment will be slow to change. We expect that our current loan to core deposit ratio will remain at or around the current levels at least through the end of this year. Although we are aggressively lowering our deposit rates, we will maintain a strong preference to meet the needs of our clients, which we believe will reward us in the long term. Ultimately, we believe that the strength of our deposit franchise will help lower and keep deposit costs below previous lows, while growing our client relationships. Turning to Slide 8. Net interest income decreased $30 million or 2% compared to the prior quarter. The NII performance reflects the impact of lower market rates on commercial loans, mortgage portfolio prepayments and the decline in home equity and credit card balances. These impacts were partially offset by elevated average commercial revolving line of credit balances and growth from lower-yielding PPP loans as well as continued focus on reducing deposit costs and the favorable impact of previously executed hedges. As you can see on this slide, the hedges added an incremental $30 million to our second quarter NII or a total contribution of $62 million during the quarter. Purchase accounting adjustments benefited our second quarter net interest margin by 4 basis points this quarter. Our NIM decreased 53 basis points sequentially. Although not detrimental to our net interest income, elevated cash had a 29 basis point incremental negative impact on our NIM, in addition to a 1 basis point drag from PPP loans. Our period-end short-term cash position increased by 4.5 times from $6.3 billion at the end of March to $28 billion at the end of June, with period end excess cash 18 times higher than our 2019 average. Excluding the impact of elevated cash positions and PPP loans, we estimate that our NIM would have been just about 3%. Our focus in this environment is on long-term NIM performance. As such, given the lack of attractive alternative investments and the uncertainty on the timing of future deposit outflows, we expect to remain in this cash position longer than we anticipated in early June. We don't believe that it is in our best interest to deploy any portion of the cash reserves today. We believe that there is more leverage in continuing to reduce our funding costs with the help of our strong liquidity position, but we will reevaluate our options if the market environment changes. In addition to the anticipated longer duration of our cash position, our expected NIM and NII progression over the next two quarters also changed compared to our earlier expectations as the PPP forgiveness period lengthen, which resulted in pushing out our expectations of the timing of the recognition of interest income to the fourth quarter and early next year. At this time, we anticipate forgiveness to commence in the fourth quarter, with about 60% of the NII benefit to accrue in the fourth quarter and the rest during the first quarter of 2021. We expect that our normalized NIM, excluding the impact of elevated cash and PPP loans, is approximately 3% and will remain there for the foreseeable future, helped by our interest rate hedges and investment portfolio composition. In our investment portfolio, we had a net discount accretion this quarter of $1 million as opposed to multiple millions of dollars of premium amortization some of our peers are experiencing. As we have always stated, one needs to look at both the derivative portfolio, where we took early actions with great entry points for longer duration, as well as the structure of the investment portfolio to gauge the long-term NIM performance. The significant impact of our cash reserves and the PPP portfolio during the next few quarters will create some noise, but we anticipate a more stable environment past that. The third quarter NIM is expected to contract another 7 to 10 basis points, driven by the full quarter impact of higher cash positions and PPP loans with NIM expected to then recover in the fourth quarter. The third quarter contraction is predominantly related to higher average cash balances on our balance sheet as the impact of lower rates is expected to be offset by the continued benefits of our hedge portfolio and deposit rate reductions. Moving on to Slide 9. We once again had a very strong quarter generating fee revenue to offset the pressure on interest income. The resilience in our fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we have achieved. Reported non-interest income decreased by 3% sequentially. Adjusted noninterest income of $670 million exceeded the high end of our previous guidance range by approximately $20 million. The strong performance was driven by another record in capital markets as well as better-than-previously-anticipated results in mortgage and wealth and asset management. In our commercial business, the strong performance was led by capital markets revenue, which increased nearly 20% from last quarter and approximately 50% from the year ago quarter. Debt and equity capital markets, both achieved record quarters, again, reflecting our clients' ability to access the market to bolster their liquidity positions. Mortgage banking origination fees and gains on loan sales were strong in the second quarter, up nearly 20%, reflecting improved margins. Originations of $3.4 billion decreased 15% sequentially due to a temporary pause in the corresponding channel in May as we waited for clarification from the agencies regarding loans for sale that entered the forbearance category. Mortgage originations, excluding correspondent channel production, increased 22% compared to the prior quarter.  Our retail originations were up 37% versus last quarter. Asset management fees were down 4%, reflecting the impact of equity market levels throughout the quarter. Total wealth and asset management revenue decreased 10% from the prior quarter, to a large extent, reflecting the seasonal decline in tax preparation fees. Card and processing revenue decreased $4 million or 5%, resulting from lower credit and debit volumes throughout the quarter, reflecting reduced customer spend, partially offset by lower rewards. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect low-to-mid single-digit growth in processing fees. Deposit service charges decreased sequentially, reflecting lower consumer and commercial fees, which were impacted by the record growth in deposit balances as well as hardship-related fee waivers granted throughout the quarter. Given some of the trends that we have seen towards the end of the quarter, we expect double-digit growth in deposit fees in the third quarter. Moving on to Slide 10. Second quarter reported pretax expenses included COVID-related expenses of $12 million, merger-related items of $9 million and FHLB debt extinguishment charge of $6 million, and intangible amortization expense of $12 million. Adjusting for these items and prior items shown in our materials, non-interest expense decreased over 5% sequentially and decreased approximately 3.5% compared to the year ago. Also, due to the mark-to-market nature of our non-qualified deferred comp plans, our expenses include the impact of $22 million expense compared to a $26 million benefit last quarter. Excluding this impact, our expenses declined $110 million or over 9% sequentially, driven by the declines from seasonal items, reduced marketing expense and continued discipline managing expenses throughout the Company. As we are diligently managing in-period expenses, we are also assessing our longer-term efficiency opportunities. We will continue to accelerate our investments in technology and innovation as we see permanent shifts in customer behavior and an increased need to reduce our dependence on manual processes in our operations. We are also very focused on improving the resiliency of our technology infrastructure to achieve a world-class network structure as more and more customer interactions are shifting to digital products. We are also accelerating our implementation of nCino in our commercial business. At the same time, we are very focused on working with an expense base that is more aligned with the muted revenue growth expectations over the next few years. We are sizing our targets within that context and approaching this comprehensively, including opportunities in corporate real estate, vendor management, alignment of our sales capacity with market opportunities, the size of our retail branch network and more efficient middle office and back office operations. Some, but not all of these actions, will be based on environmental factors. We are performing a deeper structural review of our business lines and middle office and back-office functions to identify opportunities that improve the profitability of our Company. We plan to share the outcome of our review with you in the next couple of months when we finalize our findings and decisions. As always, you can trust us to be prudent in managing our expenses with utmost flexibility. Slide 11 provides an update on our COVID high-impact portfolios. The amount on this page represent approximately 11% of our total loans and are down 9% from the last quarter, excluding PPP loans. As you can see, the paydowns during the quarter reduced our balances relative to the first quarter in all subcategories, except for leisure travel, where we have a rather small overall exposures, all to larger operators. The total balances on this slide include approximately $1 billion from our leveraged loan portfolio, which is now under $4 billion. The information on this slide lays out the reasons why we believe that our client selection in these portfolios has been very disciplined with a focus on larger companies that have access to capital in stressed environments and that we have the appropriate credit mitigants in place to limit the ultimate loss content in these portfolios. In addition, on Slide 12, we give you a snapshot of our energy portfolio. This portfolio is less levered and carries a higher hedge position than the portfolio during the last downturn in oil prices. As you can see, the leverage in this portfolio is 2 turns lower with a higher RBL balance and approximately one third of the percentage exposure to oilfield services compared to 2015. Our ongoing stress tests indicate that the level of charge-offs in our energy portfolio under stressed conditions would not meaningfully deviate from the rest of our commercial portfolio. Nearly 80% of the portfolio is in reserve-based structures, and we recently reduced our overall RBL borrowing base approximately 15% as a result of the spring re-determination. On Slide 13, we provide an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios. The FICO scores clearly indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio with over 55% containing FICO scores of 750 or higher on a balance-weighted basis. Approximately 90% of the consumer portfolio is secured. And as you can see by our FICO band distributions, our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high prime, super prime space. As we have previously discussed, we have taken proactive steps to enhance our underwriting standards, specifically on minimum FICO scores and maximum LTV levels in addition to increasing our efforts in collections. Turning to credit results on Slide 14. Net charge-offs were flat sequentially. The consumer net charge-off ratio declined 14 basis points this quarter, following a 12 basis point decline in the prior quarter. And commercial net charge-offs were relatively stable, resulting in a total net charge-off ratio of 44 basis points, better than the low end of our previous expectations. NPAs continue to be well-behaved at 65 basis points, up just 3 basis points since before the pandemic. The sequential increase was entirely in commercial, predominantly in the energy portfolio. As I just mentioned, we are comfortable with the loss content in our energy portfolio. The consumer nonperforming loans remain low. We added $355 million to our credit reserves this quarter, increasing our ACL ratio by 37 basis points to 2.5%. The incremental reserve build this quarter reflected the continued deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook. The cumulative increase in our allowance for credit losses since the end of 2019, including the day one impact, is now over $1.5 billion. As a reference point, we compare our current reserve level with a nine-quarter total loss estimates within the recent severe stress test runs - CCAR severe stress test runs. Our current reserves stand over - at over 60% of our Company run losses and nearly 40% of fed losses. The credit models that the Federal Reserve is utilizing still appear to be heavily influenced by our credit results during the last downturn, which results in a wide gap between our expectations and the fed's. Slide 15 provides more information on the allocation of our allowance and the composition of the changes this quarter. Higher levels of reserves in real estate-based portfolios reflect the deteriorated outlook in the economic scenarios related to real estate valuations in future periods. Including the impact of approximately $170 million in remaining discounts associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.64%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.76%. Our thoughts on the need-for-future reserve builds are similar to what you've heard from other banks. Our reserves reflect the current macroeconomic expectations embedded in the scenarios that we deploy in this exercise. If the outlook does not further deteriorate, there should not be a need to increase our reserve coverage beyond the current levels. Any further increases in reserves would result from a higher likelihood of a more severe and prolonged double dip scenario. Turning to Slide 16. Our capital and liquidity positions remained very strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at over 9.7%, exceeding the first quarter level, even as we built reserves. Given the dynamics during the quarter, we are providing you a CET1 reconciliation between net income, risk-weighted assets and the impact of dividends. As you can see, dividend payouts constitute a very small portion of the change in CET1. It is important to note that our capital levels are now well above our targets. As you may recall, our capital target in early 2019 was 9%. We raised that level closer to 9.5% about 1.5 years ago, and we are now above the 9.5% level. As a reminder, we had no buybacks in the first or second quarter, and our decision to extend that to the end of this year has changed the trajectory of our capital ratios. Even with buildup in reserves, we are ahead of our capital plan, and we expect continued strong levels of PPNR to support our current capital levels. We will be resubmitting our stress test sometime in the fall with the rest of the CCAR banks. We have been very consistent in stating our view that given our very strong capital ratios, balance sheet strength, earnings power and relatively modest pre-COVID dividend payout ratio, we expect to fare well. We believe that our performance in this downturn ultimately will prove the resiliency of our model. Despite the difference in projected loss rates between the two models that I just mentioned, we continue to show significant cushion in our forecasted capital ratios under stressed conditions. Our tangible book value per share was $22.66 this quarter, up 13% year-over-year. At the end of the quarter, our unrealized pretax gain in our securities and hedge portfolios was approximately $3.9 billion, which is not included in our regulatory capital ratios. From a liquidity perspective, we have over $100 billion in total liquidity sources. Slide 17 provides a summary of our current outlook. Given the uncertain environment, we continue to provide only quarterly expectations until we have more long-term visibility on the economic outlook. For the third quarter, we expect a decline in total average loan balances in the 3.5% to 4% range on a quarter-over-quarter basis, with a 6% to 7% decline in commercial loans and a 3% increase in consumer balances. The decline in commercial balances is a result of the paydowns in commercial credit lines. Net interest income is expected to decline approximately 3% compared to last quarter, assuming no benefits from accelerated amortization of PPP fees. This decline is primarily attributable to the impact of line paydowns in our commercial business as the impact of lower floating rate loans is fully offset by the hedges as well as the funding rate benefits. We expect non-interest income to increase 2 plus percent sequentially and expenses to increase about the same. Part of the expense increase is due to performance-based comp related to mortgage, wealth and asset management and leasing revenues that tend to result in higher dollar payouts. In addition, there are some accelerated expenses in IT that are related to our focus on automation. As I mentioned earlier, we are working on a broader expense reduction target that we will share with you in the coming months that is intended to reduce the pressure on our efficiency ratio, resulting from the weak revenue environment, and will also include longer-term structural targets. Total net charge-offs are expected to be in the 50 to 55 basis point range, continuing to reflect the widening gap between the near-term credit performance and the anticipated deterioration in credit metrics beyond 2020. In summary, our second quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we've made over the past few years, improving our resiliency, diversifying our revenues and proactively managing the balance sheet. With limited forecast visibility, we will continue to rely on the same principles : disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. We fully intend to preserve the optimal level of efficiency of our operations in this weak economic - weak revenue environment, while we maintain the investments that we believe are vital to preserve the earnings power and the operational resiliency of our Company. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Christopher Doll : Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A as a courtesy others, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have time for additional questions. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your Company to the operator. Denise, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Tayfun, just wanted to sort of follow-up on the liquidity. You gave a ton of good detail. So, thank you for that. And I certainly understand kind of the nuance of the elevated cash balances, why they'll stick around. But to a large degree, these are issues that affect everyone. Would you say - is there anything unique about Fifth Third that kind of amplifies the order of magnitude so much? Tayfun Tuzun : I think the - we believe we've stayed very close to our clients during the past five, six months as we entered this period and our sales force has been in close contact, and our relationships are very strong across the board in both corporate banking as well as middle market banking. And they are clearly showing a preference to bank with us and to increase the size of their relationships. I mean, this is purely a function of their willingness to work with us because we are not offering any significant rates to them that they can't get with rival banks. So we've lowered our deposit rates well below where we were in the first quarter. But I think the strength of our relationships and our sales force coverage is enabling us to maintain this level of liquidity. And we - I mean, our liquidity levels are significantly higher. The 19% deposit growth, I think, exceeds all of our peers and the increase in our liquidity position is significantly higher than others. Look I mean I think it doesn't impact the NII. We reflect the liquidity profile of the balance sheet. And it also gives us many opportunities in coming quarters to continue to deepen our relationships with our clients. That's our perspective. Scott Siefers : And just as a follow-up to that, I think you said an additional 7 to 10 basis points of margin erosion in the third quarter based on, I guess, like the full quarter impact of the higher cash balances. And then I believe you said it would recover in the fourth quarter with the PPP forgiveness. I know it can be tough to cut through the noise of what's going on with margins these days, but ex the benefit of the PPP benefits in the fourth quarter, would you expect sort of the steady-state margin to stabilize after the 3Q? Tayfun Tuzun : Scott, I don't want to give fourth quarter guidance at this point. But I think what you should rely on is not just for Q4 but also beyond Q4, we believe that 3% level, the 3% NIM, once we are past the PPP and once we are past the impact of the higher cash balances, it's probably a good sort of target for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : So as we think about a pretty sizable reserve, some of the PPNR puts and takes that you're expecting, I guess, if the fed rolls forward the dividend income test beyond the third quarter, are you confident that your GAAP level of pre-preferred earnings would be above that $0.27 run rate as calculated - dividend rate as calculated by the fed? Tayfun Tuzun : Erika, everything that we look at today as well as sort of the outlook that we have in place gives us a lot of confidence that we will have plenty of room. Erika Najarian : And the second follow-up question is, I'm sure a lot of my peers are going to try to tease out this expense reduction announcement. But I'm wondering, how will this initiative compare to North Star? And how conscious are you of incurring charges given the light - the possibility that this income test could extend beyond third quarter on the dividend? Tayfun Tuzun : So North Star was a combination of revenue actions as well as expense actions. So we are talking here a focus on expenses only. And with respect to charges, it is way too early. And not necessarily all expense actions would accompany a charge associated with it. So I would not necessarily be too worried about that. I'm not saying that there's not a charge associated with any of the expense actions, but size-wise, at this point, I'm not too worried about it. Operator : Your next question comes from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Peter Winter : I wanted to follow-up on the expense initiative. And I'm just wondering, is the thought to bring the expense base down going forward? Or is the idea just to kind of hold expenses flat in a more challenging revenue environment? Gregory Carmichael : Peter, this is Greg. First off, our intent is obviously to look at the opportunities in front of us. And the question was just asked about North Star, a lot of the expense opportunities in front of us are very similar to North Star. If you think about our branch transformation and opportunities to optimize our branch network. Thinking about the opportunities around our vendor management and the money that we spend in those areas and the attractive opportunities that sit there, rightsizing our organization for the sales opportunities. There are a lot of opportunities out there in front of us. So our intent would be to continue to invest in the critical aspects of our business that we've mentioned before, the digitization of our platforms, our Southeast expansion and so forth. We want to continue those investments. But over time, we would expect to run at a lower rate on expenses. And the realities of the revenue opportunities that are out there in the environment, we expect to run at a lower level going forward. Peter Winter : And if I could - just another question. You guys provided some really good color on the forbearance on the consumer side. I'm just wondering if you can give some updates on the commercial side about loan deferrals coming in for a second request and what's happening there on the commercial side. James Leonard : Yes, Peter. It's Jamie. Thanks for the question. On the commercial side, I think you saw on the presentation, if you look at payment deferrals, 6% of the loan balances are in payment deferral and the vast majority, over 80% of the payment deferrals we have were 90 days in duration. But because they started midway through the quarter, not many of them have come off. So, I don't want to give you too much of a false positive. But to date, we've not had any request for the - a second 90-day deferral in the commercial book. I guess, some additional color would be that about 75% of our commercial customers that were on deferral have made payments while in the deferral. And then beyond the payment deferral information that we provided in terms of other types of forbearances, there's about 7% of the commercial book that's received a covenant waiver. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : I guess, I have one negative question and one positive question. So I'll go to the negative question first. I mean, flattish charge-offs, kind of flattish problem loans just doesn't seem accurate, and this is not unique to you. It's an industry question. I mean if you didn't have the forbearance, if you didn't have a government assistance, how much worse would charge-offs and NPAs be? And it is a question because eventually, these programs run off and then bankers have to be bankers again and reality sets in. So we're - I mean, it's just in terms of a general question, how bad would it be if you didn't have this other support and forbearance? James Leonard : Yes. So Mike, it's Jamie. On the commercial side, I think what you see is what you get, it's pretty straightforward, and there was a slight uptick in the charge offs, but it was offset by the improvement we saw on the consumer side. And so I think the heart of your question is how good is the consumer in this environment, given both the government support plus the support we've given customers that have requested it for the forbearance and payment deferrals. So when you look at our portfolio on the consumer side, Tayfun mentioned a couple of items. If you exclude mortgage because those were six months, and you look at the non-mortgage loans, only 12% have re-enrolled in additional hardship relief. And through last Friday, we've had over half of our original deferrals, they've come off the program. So I think that's one good data point. We initially expected that number to be as high as 30%. So the fact that we're experiencing 12% shows us both the government support plus the overall health of the consumer is perhaps a little bit better than we expected. The other data point I would point you to is for Fifth Third, in particular, Moody's published a study July 7th, and they evaluated the MSAs most-impacted by COVID. They used number of COVID cases, population density, tourism, global connectedness, et cetera. And the national average weighted by GDP was 0.31, and this was on a scale-up to 2.0 where we're playing golf, so lower is better. Our score for our consumer portfolio is 0.12. So we're 60% better than the national average. And so I think there's a lot of hard work going on in our consumer portfolio. We stopped the 90-day offers at the end of June. And really, we're working to move to the top of the customer payment priority and I think ultimately, between the geographic diversification we have, the overall credit quality of the book, you see in the FICO scores plus our revamped hardship programs, I think we're getting a good view that the consumer is doing better. And in fact, so much so that the second half of 2020, we expect our consumer charge-offs to be below the second half of 2019. Mike Mayo : And then the other question was $3.9 billion of securities and derivatives gains. I mean, to what degree do you expect would you try to bank some of those gains? When we look at where rates are, and then you have cushion for more charges for North Star part two or more cushion for your dividends? Or maybe you could do buy back sooner because you were a little more unique saying no buybacks, including the fourth quarter, you went the extra step to be more conservative. Just wondering why you did that, and if you might want to bank some of those gains. Thanks. Tayfun Tuzun : I will answer the question about the conservative stance. Look, I mean, I think we all recognize that there's a lot of uncertainty and very low level of visibility. Under those circumstances, I think it's natural for us to be a bit more conservative. And with respect to the $3.9 billion gain, it gives us a lot of flexibilities. If there is a need or if we view that the future outlook for rates changes in our perspective such that, that gain is better off harvested and deployed for other purposes, there are some accounting realities that don't necessarily allow you to immediately recognize all of that gain. But it clearly provides a very significant pool of, I would say, capital that we can deploy going forward. At this point, given our view, we're very happy with the portfolios as they stand, and we will continue to harvest, and we have a long maturity date so we were benefited, but as you stated, Mike, it's a rich man's problem, and it gives us a good amount of flexibility. Operator : Your next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : So one thing I'm struggling with this quarter with the banks in channel, it's just that there's a very divergent performance in terms of not just NIM, but the NII trajectory this quarter and also with regards to the outlook. And I mean you guys have been more conservative, I think, than your peers in terms of managing rate risk and the hedging, the way you manage your securities portfolio and yet - obviously, NII is under pressure this quarter, it's likely to be under pressure next quarter. So I guess, I'm asking how you think we should see this dynamic as it pertains to you. Is this is really simply a function of you guys just being much more conservative in terms of how you're managing your risk and that's reflected in your balance sheet dynamics and, obviously, you see that in your short-term investments and loans? So is it really just a function of how you're managing risk right now that's driving that? And - or is there something else that we should also be aware of that maybe more idiosyncratic? Tayfun Tuzun : Two comments, Saul. So one is, if you actually normalize the NIM progress from the first quarter into the second quarter with cash positions and the PPP across all banks, you're getting to a much tighter distribution. So if you get to how core NIM has behaved, that volatility goes down significantly. From our perspective, we have $28 billion in cash, and we are choosing not to deploy any of that part just to show a higher NII outcome. Others have done that. Everybody has their own risk profile and risk preferences. I think what needs to be really more instrumental as we look forward, it's a long game and our outlook that the normalized NIM, once we pass-through this PPP period and a more normalized level of cash, is 3%. When you think about it, our NIM was 3.24% in the first quarter. So with where the short-term rates are and where the yield curve is, a 24 basis point movement between the first quarter NIM and our sort of longer-term outlook on NIM is a pretty good performance. And ultimately, again, this is just - we're talking about a few quarters here where things are going to look a little bit choppy, but NIM is just an outcome. And we have a strong preference in not going after NII boosts in the short-term that would put us into a riskier position in the long term. Saul Martinez : Okay. I mean, I have a few follow-ups, but I'll table that and switch gears to a different topic. And I actually want to ask you about your reserving and actually taking in the other direction, because I think you've been ahead of the curve in terms of building reserves. But when would you actually start to think about releasing reserves? And I mean, especially as charge-offs start to move up, you have reserves for those, for the loans that are charged off. And you - presumably then, your provisioning will reflect reserves on new growth and any sort of recalibration of reserves on the back book as we reassess the losses there. But I'm curious, is - should - could we start to see reserve releases quicker than people expect as charge-offs move up? Or do you think that there's sort of a predisposition for reserves to be sticky and less reserve releases going forward just because of the vast uncertainty in the macro environment. So I'm just kind of curious how we see things in terms of reserve levels as sort of credit normalizes, and we get a little bit more visibility on the macro dynamics. Tayfun Tuzun : So setting aside the impact of loan balances on reserves. Clearly, if the loan balances decline, there's going to be impact of that. Setting that aside for a moment, what we have so far observed is coming out of the first quarter into May and to June and now into July, there is more stability in the economic scenarios that are being provided by Moody's as well as just overall market expectations. My expectation is that banks will continue to watch that progress over the next quarter or two. Because in order to be able to release reserves, you need to develop a confidence that - on the sustainability of the economic outlook. And if that - if the level of sustainability is truly dependable and if the economic indicators should give us the confidence, the answer to your question is, yes. At one point, we will start releasing reserves. But I do believe that we are a few quarters early on that, assuming that there is stability. We do need time in order to develop that level of confidence. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: I was wondering if you could just talk about the process of kind of credit risk management more on like a granular basis, like at the ground level. Obviously, there's been some time since the role of collectors was all that important. So just talk about how you're reallocating, I would assume, some of your resources from originating loans to collecting loans in anticipation of more work to do there? Richard Stein : Matt, it's Richard. So if we think about portfolio management broadly, the expectation is that the relationship managers and their portfolio managers that work with them are continuously reviewing the portfolio. Since the pandemic, we've increased the frequency of those portfolio reviews. We've done specific targeted reviews around industry and geography and product. And from those outcomes, we've seen some re-rating and rating changes. And as a result, as things slide, we move - we start to leverage our special assets group. And there, have been really helpful at helping us work through problem credits, making sure that we can rehabilitate where appropriate. And what we're doing is we are absolutely reallocating resources from both the relationship management teams and our underwriting teams into special assets to increase the capacity there. And virtually, all of them have come from inside of Fifth Third. And the people we've drafted have historical experience and workout in special assets. And so we're trying to leverage that expertise across the platform. But it's the frequency of the reviews and making sure we've got continuity from a coverage standpoint from end-to-end. Matt O'Connor: And is the plan that you should be able to continue to do it in-house reallocating? Or do you think you might need to staff up with some - or partnering with like third parties? Richard Stein : We're not going to - we're not looking to partner with third parties. We believe we can cover with in-house resources. Matt O'Connor: Okay. All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Tayfun or maybe, Jamie, on the loan loss reserves that you have established, Tayfun you outlaid those two economic scenarios for us, the downside one and the base case. Are those reserves set to a mix of those scenarios? Or is it - are they set to the base case scenario? And second, what metrics are you looking at going forward to see if you need to increase those reserves because of a worsening in the economy? James Leonard : Yes, Gerard, it's Jamie. We do use three scenarios weighted with a baseline and then using Moody's one upside scenario, one downside scenario that Tayfun outlined for you. The major economic variables that have the greatest impact on the reserve levels would be unemployment, GDP, HPI are the ones that have the biggest impact on the models. And as Tayfun mentioned, this quarter, the build of $355 million in the ACL, the vast majority of that build was driven by the deterioration in the outlook, and then you have the net impact of loan portfolio decline and migration and ratings almost offsetting each other. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then moving over to the higher-risk commercial portfolio that's exposed to the COVID-19 issues, it fell 9%, as you showed us, to $12.8 billion. When you look going forward, is that a momentum that you can continue having a drop that much in a quarter? And second, what percentage of charge-offs are attributed to bringing that balance down? James Leonard : Yes, I would say, in terms of the momentum going forward, the biggest improvement or biggest factor in the second quarter improvement was the paydown of the defensive draws we saw in the first quarter, and that drove a healthy portion of that decline. In terms of the charge-off composition, this quarter, you had a decent amount of the growth driven by energy and leisure and entertainment. As we look ahead to the third quarter, I think you'll see a common theme with entertainment and leisure, perhaps some CRE and then obviously, energy, as it completes its restructure. So I would say it's - a healthy portion of the charge-off expectation is driven by that COVID stress portfolio. But again, we still feel good about our client selection and the fact that, as Richard pointed out, it's a well-managed portfolio. It's just in this environment, there will be losses, but we think they'll be manageable. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe : I think you guys mentioned that some of the lower - the loan balances being lower and the lower NII guidance for third quarter is really driven by - at least in part, by further corporate line drawdowns. How much of the excess line drives, in terms of balances, do you still have outstanding? And I guess, are you assuming that all those fully run off or normalize or the line utilization normalizes by the end of 3Q? Thanks. James Leonard : Yes, Ken. I think the guidance is based on average loan balances. So they really truly reflect what happened, especially sort of second half of May into June. So the second to third quarter guidance truly reflects that speedy paybacks at the end - towards the end of the second quarter. It's been stable so far. Utilization rate is basically back to where it was pre-pandemic. But again, the decline in average commercial balances is more a function of what happened at the end of the second quarter, more so than the third quarter. Ken Zerbe : And I may have missed this, but have you addressed or did you address like this commentary around sort of ex corporate line draws, just the general sentiment around C&I borrowers? Like are you building in any expectation that C&I or other loan balances actually are declining in 3Q? Thanks. James Leonard : There's not a lot of customer demand for new loans, Ken. The market is very muted at this point, both for economic reasons as well as for what's going on with sort of the healthcare situation that limits interactions. But so far, we're not seeing a whole lot of activity from our clients. Operator : Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open. Rahul Patil : This is Rahul Patil on behalf of John. I just want to go back to the discussion around the reserve release. And I want to put some numbers around it so correct me if I'm wrong. So you've guided to average loans down 3.5%, 4%. Let's say, loans growth - loans are declining, looks like around $4 billion of that. Commercial loans are coming down, $5 billion. Consumer is going up by $1 billion. And you've guided to charge-offs of around - it looks like it's around $150 million in 3Q of charge-offs. So am I thinking about this right, that in terms of provisioning in 3Q, the - really, the main driver of provision will be the consumer new loan growth of $1 billion. And basically, is it fair to then assume and apply that 3% reserve ratio on that $1 billion of new loan growth. And basically, that would imply like $30 million to $40 million of provision in third quarter. Am I thinking about that right? Tayfun Tuzun : One needs to take into account what happens at the end of period. So you just have to - obviously, it's useful to look at the average loan guidance. But we will - when we get to the end of the third quarter, we will see where the balances are at that point. And if there are zero builds, our reserve position will reflect the end-of-period balances compared to - and the movement will be compared to the end-of-period balances in the second quarter. Rahul Patil : But I just want to make sure like conceptually, am I thinking about this correctly in terms of - with regards to provision, and this is also assuming that the macro doesn't get worse or doesn't get better. It's basically assuming a status quo. James Leonard : Yes. The provision could go down, clearly. I mean, if loans continue to go down and the charge-offs stay flat, there is a path which would indicate that the provision number on our income statement will be lower, so that could happen. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Amanda Larsen : This is Amanda Larsen, on for Ken. Can you talk about the accelerated pace of technology investments that you expect? What have you learned about your technology during the pandemic? Are your structural uses of technology not as efficient as you hoped? Or is it more about client-facing technology and you feel limited in your ability to service your clients versus peers? And then as an addendum, if there's any business segment that you can touch on that may require like better tax, that would be helpful now. Thanks Gregory Carmichael : Amanda, this is Greg. First off, we - our strategy and focus on investing in our technology platforms to better serve our customers through product distribution or servicing capabilities hasn't changed. And I think we've made tremendous progress as evidenced by the fact that 75% of all of our transactions now go through our digital channels, using that technology to serve our clients in a much more efficient way. There's more opportunities in front of us and there's an opportunity to replatform our commercial loan system, which we're going to do that. Origination system, we're going to do that. There's opportunities to continue to make the whole mortgage process a digital experience, and that's rolling out as we speak. So we'll continue to invest in those opportunities. In addition to that, there's tremendous opportunities, I believe. When you think about our back office to apply technologies, robotics, artificial intelligence in that environment in a more aggressive way to take out long-term costs, so when we think about our expense base and how we're looking forward here, we'll replace our technology dollars to drive the best outcome for our shareholders and serve our customers. It's going to be the area of automation of our back office, it's going to be continued automation of our origination systems, and it's going to be continued automation of our ability to distribute our products. In addition to that, when you think about the environment we're operating in, resiliency is extremely important. You always have to be on. This isn't 10 years ago, five years ago, where you can afford to have your systems offline. You have to always be on for your customers. So investments in our core infrastructure. We don't want to put new technology, new capabilities on old infrastructure. So it's refurbishing our older infrastructure, pulling our new infrastructure, focused on, once again, serving our clients and making us more efficient going forward in operations. Amanda Larsen : And then can you talk about the outlook for consumer loan growth? You certainly sound more positive on the consumer credit performance. Where do you expect the 3% consumer loan growth to come for in 3Q? Is it auto - Is it all auto? Or are you believing in elsewhere? Gregory Carmichael : No, auto, I think, obviously, we expect to see - the team's done a fantastic job. As we've talked before, we're a super prime borrower in that space. We expect to continue to see growth in auto and attractive spreads. In addition to that, we expect our mortgage business also in our mortgage portfolio continue to expand as we go forward here. Card and so forth, we don't expect to see much growth in those areas. Operator : Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Christopher Marinac : Thanks, good morning. Greg, is there an update on the CFPB issue? And is that possible to get resolved before the end of the year? Gregory Carmichael : First off, I wish it was resolved, and I do not have an update. This is a loan cycle process. As we've stated through numerous channels, we're very comfortable in our position here and willing to deal with that as we move forward here. But there is no update. Is there potential to get settled? Sure. There's always a potential it could get settled. But at the end of the day, we want to make sure that Fifth Third is viewed appropriately and the opportunity to characterize our behavior and the actions that we took proactively, I think, is very, very important to us. So no update at this point. But hopefully, we could solve it. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, Woods. Your line is open. Brian Klock : Just one real quick follow-up. I know that you guys talked about some of the elevated expenses from the better revenue production that came in some of your fee businesses. And you've talked about some of the technology spend as well. I guess, just thinking about the guidance for the third quarter includes some acceleration of some automation and tech expenses. I mean, if we think about what a normalized run rate is even before you think about the new initiatives on the expense savings that you're going to be reviewing; and do we think that a normal run rate, I guess, beyond the third quarter should be something that's maybe back towards that $1.50 billion range where you kind of were before? Is that the way to think about it? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes. I mean, at this point, given the fact that we are spending a lot of time on analyzing the expense base and looking for opportunities for efficiencies. I'd rather not get into the longer-term outlook for expenses, but it is clear that our intent is to lower our expense base from where it is today, so I will make that statement. And as Greg said, we continue to invest in areas where we believe we need to invest in to continue to grow our Company. But our intent is to do it in a way with the utmost efficiency at the rest of the Company. So the focus of this study is going to be lowering the expense base that we are running today and taking it from there. Operator : Your last question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : I have a follow-up. Jamie, can you tell us, on the consumer portfolio where you guys mentioned, I think, 53% of the deferrals have exited the program. Where did they go? Are they all back on accruing status? Or are they in some sort of work out and is separate from the COVID relief programs? Or were they charged off? James Leonard : Yes. So of the loans, the consumer portfolio, this was through last Friday, 53% exited, 12% went into a new relief program. And those programs, I think we've got a pretty good approach there where we offer a short-term program of six months at 50% of your normal payment or we offer with certain eligibility criteria and proof of hardship to longer-term loan modification. And so that's 12% of the group. And of the remaining group, the vast, vast majority, I think the number is 79% or so are making payments and are back on track. And so one of the earlier questions was just how do we feel about the consumer loan portfolio and ultimately, how much support is out there? When we look at our growth rates and our delinquency rates on that core book, it is very good, which is why we're confident in our second half of the year outlook on consumer charge-offs. Gerard Cassidy : And then just finally, Tayfun, this may be a naive question. Coming back to the cash balances, if you take out the money from the PPP loans that may have come into people's deposit accounts and you take out the line draws that were unusual because of the situation we're in today, where is all the cash coming from? Are companies just not spending on capital expenditures? And why is there such elevated cash balances, excluding those two reasons that I mentioned? Tayfun Tuzun : Yes, I think, Gerard, clearly, the inability to use the cash in the short-term is one aspect of why these companies - and it's both individuals as well as companies. So we expect that some of the natural rundown is going to be base that they're going to have to spend that cash within their operating capital. The other one is, I think it is very likely that they - some of our clients have consolidated their deposits into a smaller number of banks, and we have been a beneficiary of that. Because as we look at the distribution, the distribution is extremely granular, which suggests that, again, more of a relationship-based direction in deposit flows than anything else. Operator : I'd now like to turn the call back over to Chris Doll for closing remarks. Christopher Doll : Thank you, Denise, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR department, and we'll be happy to assist you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speakers today. Chris Doll, you may begin. Chris Doll : Thank you, Marcella. Good morning, thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our results for the third quarter of 2020. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. I'm joined this morning by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Risk Officer, Jamie Leonard; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tyson, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over to Greg now for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I hope you are all doing well and staying healthy. Once again, our financial results were strong despite the challenges associated with the current environment. As an essential business, we continue to take appropriate actions for our customers, our employees and our communities during the pandemic. Earlier today, we reported third quarter net income available to common shareholders of $562 million or $0.78 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.07 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted third quarter earnings were $0.85 per share. Tayfun will provide more details on the quarterly financial results in his remarks. But I will share some highlights. Our reported adjusted return metrics were solid, reflecting our strong operating results, including a provision for credit loss performance. Our credit losses were significantly better than expectations. At 35 basis points, our third quarter charge-offs were the lowest level in over a year, with improvement in both consumer and commercial portfolios. Consumer net charge-offs of 40 basis points is the lowest in the past 15-plus years, reflecting our consistently strong approach to underwriting, as well as the benefits of fiscal stimulus and payment deferrals. Our already strong capital position further improved this quarter. Our CET1 ratio of 10.1% is well above our stated target of around 9.5%, and our income levels, combined with the outcomes from our quarterly stress test continue to suggest that we will maintain our current dividend. Furthermore, we have grown tangible book value per share for 6 consecutive quarters. Our PPNR results were better than our previous expectations, reflecting the strength and resilience of our diverse revenue mix in retail, commercial and wealth and asset management. Based on our fee-based businesses, many of our fee-based businesses are generating strong results that are helping to cushion the impact of lower rates. For instance, wealth and asset management revenue increased 10% sequentially as we generated positive AUM inflows again this quarter as we have done in 9 out of the last 10 quarters. Capital markets revenue was up 8% from last year, and was down slightly relative to the record second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, total commercial banking fee revenue was up 16% compared to last year. Topline mortgage revenue is up 45% from the year-ago quarter, with a low rate environment impacting servicing revenue and the MSR valuation. Deposit fees increased 18%, and processing revenue increased 12% sequentially, both better than our previous guidance as we are seeing early signs of normalization in business and consumer spending patterns. While we continue to streamline our operations and position the bank for long-term success, we continue to assess strategic investments in non-bank acquisitions and our fee-based businesses to accelerate revenue growth. For instance, we recently increased our strategic investment in Bellwether Enterprise, a national multiproduct CRE firm, which we originally announced in April. This investment provides clients with a broader set of permanent financing solutions without Fifth Third being exposed to the balance sheet risk associated with longer duration CRE assets. Commercial loan production was relatively stable this quarter compared to the second quarter, offset by further declines in line utilization. Total average loans declined 4% sequentially. Within our previous guidance range, we expect near-term pressure in the loan portfolio to continue. Despite the tepid loan environment, net interest income exceeded our previous guidance as we aggressively reduced our deposit costs in excess of our prior expectations. While the environment remains uncertain, our commercial loan pipelines are beginning to improve in certain areas, particularly in technology, telecom, health care and industrials, which should provide support as we head into next year. Before I turn it over to Tayfun to further discuss the results and outlook, and I'll review our guiding principles, strategic actions and key strategic priorities, which will enable us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value. We have consistently communicated our through-the-cycle principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and overall balance sheet management approach focused on long-term performance. Our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. We have executed numerous strategic actions over the past five years in anticipation of a downturn, which will continue to serve us well. We've reduced our credit risk exposures and built strong reserve coverage. We've built long-term protection to mitigate the impact of lower interest rates. We took decisive actions to reduce our expense base, and we successfully invested in and diversified our fee businesses. From a commercial client standpoint, we continue to focus on generating relationships with clients who have more diversified and resilient businesses. We are confident in our client selection process and proactive approach to credit risk management. We continue to believe we are well positioned relative to peers in commercial real estate, an area where we have been named disciplined. We have focused predominantly on top-tier developers with a track record of resiliency. Our portfolio is well diversified by geography and property type. And as we have discussed before, we continue to be at the low end of peers as a percentage of total capital. In addition to the CRE portfolio, our other lending portfolios continue to do well, be well positioned, combining our strong retail and regional commercial banking franchises in the Midwest and Southeast with our national lending businesses. These portfolios will be instrumental in delivering a differentiated credit performance, given the likelihood of an uneven economic recovery. We're mining our exposures across our total commercial loan portfolio, utilizing early warning systems through a combination of internal portfolio analysis, and third party data. Our relationship teams receive timely alerts that we detect any sign of credit deterioration. This helps us make prompt, prudent and accurate credit rating determinations proactively without waiting for customer statements. Looking ahead to 2021, we continue to expect full year net charge-offs to come in well below 1%. We have also strengthened our balance sheet that building long-term protection, the positioning of our securities, and hedge portfolios. With high likelihood of lower rates for the next several years, our prudent interest rate risk management should help preserve our core margin. Our very strong balance sheet liquidity has enabled us to decisively act in aggressively lower deposit rates. Given the industry wide revenue headwinds, including a strong likelihood of persistently low interest rates, we recently announced an expense optimization plan. We are taking decisive and appropriate actions to reduce our expense base, both temporarily reflecting the weaker revenue environment, and also permanently based on long-term structural saving opportunities. Our four key strategic priorities remain intact, leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation, driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies, and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection. We will put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on the areas that have the highest probability of driving strong financial returns and generate long-term value for shareholders in order for us to emerge from the current environment, a top performing regional bank. Our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues, we continue focus on disciplined expense management to serve us well as we navigate this challenging environment. I would like to once again thank our employees. I'm very proud the way you have responded in extraordinary ways to support our customers, our communities, and each other during these unprecedented times. Our commitment to generate sustainable value for our stakeholders is evident in our inaugural, environmental, social, and governance report as we also became the first U.S. commercial bank to join the SASB alliance in the GRI community report, and other health disclosures are available for your review on a dedicated ESG page on our Investor Relations' website. With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter results, our current outlook. Tayfun Tuzun : Thank you, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let's move to the financial highlights on slide three of the earnings presentation. Reported results for this quarter were negatively impacted by three notable items, a $30 million after-tax charge related to our previously announced restructuring plan, a $17 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap, and $4 million after-tax from COVID-related expenses. Strong operating results for the quarter reflected solid business performance throughout the bank, as well as the impact to provision, which resulted from our best quarterly charge-off performance since mid-2019 stabilization and key forward looking macroeconomic indicators compared to the past several quarters as well as lower period end balances. Although we are seeing relative stability in the key macroeconomic variables used in our reserve calculations, we continue to take a cautious approach, given remaining uncertainties related to the pandemic and the economy. Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes GDP remains below the end of 2019 levels until the second quarter of 2022, with an unemployment rate worse than the current environment, remaining elevated above 8% through 2021. Our base case is generally more conservative than the Fed base scenario published last month. Our downside scenario assumes that GDP will remain below the end of 2019 levels until the second quarter of 2023 with unemployment further deteriorating from the third quarter exceeding 12% through the first half of improving until improving to 11% by the end of 2021 and reaching 8.4% by the end of \u201822. If we were to assign a 100% probability to the downside scenario we would likely require an additional $1.2 billion in reserve based on our balance sheet exposures. Reported and adjusted revenue grew 2%, despite the generally weak environment, as we outperformed our previous fee and NII expectations. Total non-interest income excluding the impact of security gains was up 5% sequentially, 3 percentage points better than our previous guidance. With respect to the outside securities gains this quarter, it is important to note that our unrealized gains in the portfolio at the end of the quarter remained very high at $2.7 billion. Our very deliberate actions over the past few years that focused on structuring the portfolio in an anticipation for a lower rate environment should continue to give us a strong advantage as a very effective hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds. Having said that, even continue to be prudent in managing the gains for the best outcome for our shareholders, cognizant that these gains will continue to be subject to future volatility, especially to fluctuations in the current pre-payment environment. This quarter, a small portion of our portfolio gains cushion the impact of the restructuring charges that we incurred -- related to our expense reduction plan, which we believe was a prudent risk based action in light of the current environment. Reported and adjusted non-interest expenses were flat year over year. On a sequential basis, adjusted expenses increased slightly more than our previous guidance of up 2%. We are in the midst of executing our expense reduction actions announced last month, which will generate annual efficiencies of $200 million starting in 2021 with an additional $100 million, $150 million of annual efficiencies to be generated starting in 2022. As a result of our strong revenue performance and continued expense discipline PPNR increased sequentially and outperformed our July guidance by approximately $15 million. Given the strong PPNR performance combined with the credit related improvements, we generated strong reported and adjusted return metrics. Adjusted ROA of 1.24% and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 18.2% excluding ALCI despite growing our regulatory capital of 42 basis points during the quarter. Excluding the security gains, our adjusted ROTC was nearly 17% even on a credit normalized basis, our underlying ROTC performance is indicative of the strength of the franchise and our ability to successfully navigate a low rate environment.  Moving to slide 4, total average loans declined 4% sequentially within our previous guidance range. CNI loan balance trends continue to reflect lower revolve utilization rates, which declined by 15% from the minute April peak to 33% at quarter end and declined by 5% since the end of June. The decrease in average CNI loans was partially offset by an increase in average auto loan balances. Due to the uneven nature of revolving utilization rates and the impact of PPP loans, we are providing period-end loan balance performance. Revolving line of credit balance has decreased in excess of $3 billion, which constituted approximately three-fourths of the end of period balance quarter-over-quarter decline. Line utilization trends so far in the first two weeks of the fourth quarter indicate continued low utilization levels, which we expect will likely persist at least through the end of this year. C&I client pipelines remain generally soft, but have somewhat improved relative to last quarter. Average and period-end CRE loans decreased 1% sequentially. As we discussed before, we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the current economic environment, and potential changes in the post-pandemic economy, which continues to favor low exposure and focus on high quality borrower in this sector. Average total consumer loans, increased 1% sequentially continued growth in the auto portfolio was offset by declines in home equity and credit cards. Auto production in the quarter was strong at $1.8 billion with average FICO scores around 780, and lower advanced rates, higher internal scores, better spreads and a higher concentration of new versus used autos compared to recent quarters. Most of the other consumer loan categories continue to reflect the generally subdued borrower demand. Our securities portfolio of around $35 billion decreased 2% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of the sales, as well as continued pay down. Unless the market environment changes, we are unlikely to use any of the excess liquidity to grow our investment portfolio in the long-term. The underlying risk return profile of many of the investment options is not attractive in light of the impact of the aggressive monetary actions that the Fed is executing. Average other short-term investments, which includes interest bearing cash increased $10 billion, compared to the prior quarter and increased $27 billion, compared to the year ago quarter, the significant increase in excess cash is the outcome of the ongoing decline in loan balances combined with record deposit growth over the past six months. Moving on to slide 5. Compared to the prior quarter, average core deposits increased 4% with growth in all deposits captions, except other time deposits. Average demand deposits represented 33% of total core deposits in the current quarter, compared to 31% in the prior quarter. Average commercial transaction deposits increased 6% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 3%. The deposit growth, came from improvement in every line of business, and was very granular across product types and customer size. Overall, the deposit performance reflects our strong long standing client relationships, and our customers desire to remain liquid. In addition to growth in deposit dollars, we once again generate consumer household growth during the quarter, reflecting strong production, as well as limited attrition. As shown on slide 6, we have continued to take proactive steps, which are predominantly focused on the right side of the balance sheet to mitigate the impact of lower rates, which should provide additional support in the coming quarter, compared to the second quarter, we lowered our interest bearing core deposit rates 14 basis points, more than our expectations, while continuing to generate strong deposit growth. As a result, our September interest bearing core deposit rate is now just 11 basis points with total core deposit costs of just seven basis points, both well below the floors from the previous rate cycle. We expect fourth quarter interest bearing core deposit costs to benefit from our actions and decline another few basis points. Our loan to core deposit ratio improved to 72% as our short-term investments predominantly interest bearing cash were approximately $31 billion at quarter end. Excluding PPP, our loan to core deposit ratio was 69%. Currently, there are no strong indications that the liquidity profile of our balance sheet is likely to change soon as loan growth continues to be elusive and investment opportunities relatively unattractive, we will remain -- we will maintain our short-term cash balances at these levels until further notice. Turning to slide seven, reported and adjusted NII decreased 2% compared to the prior quarter. The decline was primarily attributable to lower C&I balances and the impact of lower market rates. These impacts were partially offset by the reduction in deposit costs, the full quarter impact of PPP loans, day counts, and the favorable impact of previously executed cash flow hedges. As you can see on the slide, the hedges added an incremental $10 million to our third quarter NII for a total contribution of $72 million during the quarter. Purchase accounting adjustments benefited our third quarter net interest margin by three basis points this quarter. Our adjusted NIM decreased 16 basis points sequentially, driven by the unfavorable impacts from elevated cash balances, which created an approximate 15 basis point drag on NIM compared to the prior quarter, lower market rates, and lower C&I balances, partially offset by benefits from our actions to lower deposit costs, and the previously executed cash flow hedges. As we have been highlighting all along our interest rate risk hedging strategy has two pillars, the structure and composition of our investment portfolio and the size and duration of our derivative portfolio. As I stated earlier, our swaps and floors contributed $72 million this quarter. Our portfolio premium amortization was only $1 million and our portfolio yield declined only seven basis points. You can easily see that our investment portfolio does not erode the protection provided by derivative portfolio like it has for many of our peers. And importantly, we have protection in both portfolios longer than our peers. Excluding the impact of excess cash relative to historical averages and the lower yielding PPP loans, normalized NIM was approximately 3.03% for the third quarter. We expect that we will continue to be able to generate a normalized NIM of around 3% for the foreseeable future helped by our interest rate hedges and investment portfolio composition. The fourth quarter NII and NIM are both expected to remain stable. Our guidance has no accelerated benefits from PPP loan forbearance [ph]. Moving on to slide eight, we once again had a strong quarter generating fee revenues that offset the pressure on interest income. The resilience in our total fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we have achieved. Adjusted non-interest income, excluding the benefit of securities gains increased 5% sequentially, exceeding our previous guidance by approximately $20 million. The strong performance reflected another solid quarter in capital market. Strong performance in wealth and asset management and rebounds in deposit service charges, card and processing revenue and in leasing business. In our commercial business, the strong capital markets revenue was down from the record set last quarter but was up approximately 8% from the year-ago quarter. Mortgage banking net revenue decreased $23 million sequentially primarily driven by an unfavorable MSR net evaluation adjustment and an increase in MSR resulting from higher prepayment fees. Current quarter mortgage originations up $4.5 billion, 32% compared to the prior quarter. Asset management fees increased 10% sequentially, benefiting from stronger market conditions, improved brokerage fees and the continuation of positive AUM flows. With strong wealth and asset management performance over the past several quarters reflects our prioritized investments in this business both in talent upgrades as well as acquisitions to improve the ROE profile of our company. Card and processing revenue increased $10 million or 12%, reflecting increases in credit and debit transaction volumes resulting from continues normalization in consumer spending patterns. Deposit service charges increased $22 million or 18%, with improving commercial deposit fee reflecting a partial loan realization of treasury management service volumes and lower earning credits as well as elevated consumer deposit fees compared to the prior quarter which included hardship-related fee waivers. We expect processing revenues and deposit fees to be stable to slightly higher in the fourth quarter. Moving on to slide 9, third quarter reported pretax expenses included restructuring charges of $8 million, intangible amortization expense of $12 million and COVID-related expenses of $5 million. Adjusting for these items and prior-period items shown in our materials, non-interest expense increased 3% sequentially and decreased $1 million compared to the year-ago quarter. As we discussed first in September during the Barclays Conference, in light of revenue headwinds, we are taking action to reduce our annual 2021 run rate expenses by approximately $200 million. We have started taking appropriate actions in September and expect to finalize all actions by the end of this quarter. We will share with you the full set of details in January during our fourth quarter earnings call when we will also give you an outlook for the direction of our expenses in 2021. With respect to personnel decisions, we expect to generate the full run-rate savings beginning in the first quarter of 2021. In addition to the staffing optimization, we remain on track to deliver the remaining savings through accommodation of process re-engineering, rationalization of certain smaller non-core businesses, vendor re-negotiations and corporate real estate rationalization which are all progressing as well as the savings associated with reduction in our branch network. While we will continue to open branches in our existing high growth southeast markets to generate household and revenue growth, we expect to further optimize our network by closing an additional 37 branches in the first quarter of 2021, predominantly in the Midwest. As we have discussed before, the recent acceleration in customer digitals adoption trends, raising the returns on our technology investments made over the past several years. This gives us increased conviction that we can continue to optimize our branch network while also expanding our presence in high growth markets. Also, our investments and focus on process re-engineering and our areas of our operations will allow us to permanently optimize our expenses in our middle office and back office functions. We believe that approximately 20% of the 2021 savings are environment dependence. When the market rebounds and sustains economic recovery, we will re-adjust these resources accordingly. In addition to a near-term savings target, we also announced a longer-term expense strategy which will help us achieve an additional $100 million to $150 million in run rate savings, starting in 2022 through investments in lean process automation. Slide 10 provides an update on our COVID-19 high impact portfolios. The amounts on this page represent approximately 10% of our total loans and our down 8% from last quarter excluding PPP loans. As you can see, the paydowns during the quarter reduced our balances relative to the second quarter in all sub-categories, except for leisure travel where we have a rather small overall exposure, all to larger operators. The total balances on this slide include approximately $1 billion from our leveraged loan portfolio which remains below $4 billion and has decreased 7% sequentially. The information on this slide lays out the reasons why we believe that our client selection in these portfolios has been very disciplined with a focus on larger companies that have access to capital in stressed environments and where we have the appropriate credit mitigants in place to limit the ultimate loss content in these portfolios. On slide 11, we provide an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios. The FICO scores clearly indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio with over 57% containing FICO scores of 750 or higher on a balance-rated basis. Approximately 90% of the consumer portfolio is secured. And as you can see by our FICO band distributions, our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high prime/super prime space. As we have previously discussed, we have taken proactive steps to enhance our underwriting standards, specifically on minimum FICO scores and maximum LTV levels in addition to increasing our efforts in collections. Turning to credit results on slide 12. The net charge-off ratio, were 45 basis points improved, 9 basis points sequentially. The sequential improvement reflects stable outcomes in both portfolios with the commercial credit favorability coming from better resolutions as well as expansion and consumer credit continuing to exhibit results that are more commensurate with a strong or employment environment. Borrowers have been clearly helped by the stimulus and COVID-related relief programs. And those who request an additional 180 days of mortgage payment assistance as provided under the CARES Act will benefit into next year. NPAs remain generally well behaved at 84 basis points. The sequential increase was entirely in commercial with growth coming predominantly from our COVID high impact portfolios and some credits in the energy portfolio, which we believe will ultimately result in a low-loss content. Our ACL ratio declined only by 1 basis point sequentially to 2.49% reflecting the stability in both the current macroeconomic environment, as well as the drivers of the forward looking scenarios. The low level of net charge-offs, combined with the $116 million decline in the allowance, reflecting a lower period end loans resulted in a net $15 million benefit to the provision. Slide 13 provides more information on the allocation of our allowance and the composition of the changes this quarter commercial. In commercial, higher reserve coverage was warranted due to ratings migration during the quarter. This was partially offset by lower end-of-period balances compared to last quarter. In consumer, the change in reserve coverage reflects improvements in the expected loss content in the portfolio. Including the impact of approximately $150 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.62%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans, with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.75%. Our reserves reflect the current macroeconomic expectations embedded in the scenarios that we deploy in this exercise. But the outlook does not further deteriorate; there should not be a need to increase our reserve coverage beyond the current levels. Turning to slide 14, our capital and liquidity positions remain strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at over 10.1%, above our stated target of around 9.5%. Given the dynamics during the quarter, we providing you a CET1 reconciliation between net income, risk weighted assets and the impact of dividends. As you can see, dividend payouts constitute a very small portion of the change in CET1. We expect to have adequate capital and trailing reported net income to maintain our current dividend for the foreseeable future. We will be resubmitting our stress tested in early November, with the rest of the CCAR banks. We have been very consistent in stating our view that given our very strong capital ratios, balance sheet strength, earnings power and relatively modest pre-COVID dividend payout ratio, we expect to fare well. We believe that our performance in this downturn ultimately will prove the resiliency of our model. Our tangible book value per share was $23.06 this quarter, up 9% year-over-year. At the end of the quarter, our unrealized pre-tax gain in our securities and hedge portfolios was approximately $3.8 billion, which is not included in our regulatory capital ratios. From a liquidity perspective, we have over $100 billion in total liquidity sources. Slide 15 provides a summary of our fourth quarter outlook. We expect a decline in total loan -- average loan balances of approximately 2% on a quarter over quarter basis, with a 4% to 5% decline in commercial loans and a 1% to 2% increase in consumer balances. The decline in commercial balances is a result of expected paydowns in commercial credit lines. Net interest income and NIM are expected to be stable to last quarter, assuming no benefits from accelerated amortization of PPP fees. We expect non-interest income to increase 7% to 8% sequentially, including the recognition of our TRA of approximately $70 million. We expect our expenses to be flat to slightly up. Total net charge offs are expected to be in the 40 to 50 basis point range. In summary, our third quarter results were strong. And continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years, improving our resiliency, diversifying our revenues, and proactively managing the balance sheets. We will continue to rely on the same principals. We settle in client selection, conservative underwriting and a focus on the long-term performance horizon which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. We fully intend to preserve the optimal level of efficiency of our operations in this weak revenue environment, while we maintain the investments that we believe are vital to preserve the earnings power and the operational resilience y of our company. With that, let me turn it over to Chris, to open the call up for the Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks, Tayfun. [Operator Instructions] Marcella, please open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is come from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe : Great. Thank you. In terms of your expense initiatives, just given that most of that falls to the bottom-line, is it possible that we see expenses down on an absolute basis in 2021? Greg Carmichael : Ken this is Greg. First off we provide 2021 guidance after our fourth quarter, earnings net call. We'll talk more about that. As we talk about our expense optimization plans, 200 million that we expect to be out by the end of first quarter, 75% of the actions necessary to accomplish that objective have already been completed. So we're highly confident in our ability to take out that $200 million, by the end of the first quarter. And then we mentioned another 100 million to 150 million that will show up in 2022. Once again we focused mainly on automation, investing in our technology platforms. So we're very confidence. But we'll provide guidance as far as our expense numbers as we get through the fourth quarter. Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah. I think Ken and the other point that I want to make about the program is, we stated that the composition is 80% to 20% between currently in savings and environment-related savings of 20%. But that environment-related savings number is really, how we see 2021. So the other lever that we have here is if things actually look worse or will be worse next year compared to our assumptions, we still will continue to adjust those numbers. So we say that part of it is going to be variable. And it does have more potential, depending upon the economic environment. Obviously, our preference would be that the, be stronger. And we don't have to necessarily go back to that world. But we do have the availability. Ken Zerbe : All right, great. And just one follow-up, Tayfun you mentioned that you don't expect invest the excess cash, can you just help us understand like why not invest in it sounds like something very short-term securities with little risk that would generate a lot more than or at least a little more than cash returns? Tayfun Tuzun : Ken, we don't believe that the tradeoff between the small NII incrementality versus the market exposure is worth taking at this point. It really does not -- from your perspective, our ability to invest the money in the short-term, doesn't really add much to the long-term performance to the company. So, because we believe that, that cash is going to ultimately leave the company over time. So therefore we are more interested in shielding ourselves from a market-to-market exposure because the market volatility continues to be a concern for us related to all investments. Ken Zerbe : All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning. A follow-up on the loan side. So obviously you guys have I think been more or fort rite than other about the declines in loans that you're expecting and the quality of the commercial book. Can you just give us some thoughts just as you look across the footprint of where, if at all, you see activity starting to change from a pacing perspective and at what point would you see the loan book especially the commercial side C&I starting to bottom out? Greg Carmichael : This is Greg. First off, on the loan side on commercial, look at our pipelines, we're seeing some growth in positive forward progress in the area of healthcare, telecom and technology would be two other areas that we're seeing some good growth. And also, the industrials would be the areas that we're most encouraged by as we look ahead here. So we feel pretty good. As we mentioned on the consumer side, we expect the growth 1% to 2% the next quarter and that business continues to perform well. So that's where I think we have the biggest opportunities. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. And then in terms of the deposit side, you've got so good growth and you mentioned some opportunities to still re-price. What other offsets do you have on the right side of the balance sheet, if any to continue to roll down either the fixed term \u2013 fixed short-term borrowings, long-term debt footprint in addition to deposit pricing? Greg Carmichael : We don't really have a lot of long-term debt opportunities other than just running the maturity schedules at this point. So, you know, we've pretty much executed what was available to us. We're looking at some small items maybe bad debt we securitized in the past. But those are small opportunities, so there's not a whole lot remaining there. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then last quick one, Tayfun you mentioned that you're not really interested in building the securities portfolio. Other banks have started to put some of their liquidity to work in contrast. Can you just walk through your philosophy on that and how you expect to just manage overall balance sheet size then if you are not \u2013 net reinvesting? Tayfun Tuzun : Again, as I mentioned, when can ask the question. At this point, we don't believe that the trade-off between incremental NII associated with margin investments and continuing to expose ourselves to an unattractive mark-to-market environment related to those investments is as attractive. So, at this point, we will continue to watch. Now, those decisions are made on a week-to-week, month-to-mouth basis. If you find opportunities, we will be in the market. But at this point, given what we know today, we are currently choosing to be on the sidelines. Ken Usdin : Understood. Sorry, I missed that one. Operator : Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Greg Carmichael : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hey. I guess, I have a wow on the positive side and a wow on the negative side. So the wow on the positive side would be only 35 basis points of loan losses and lowest consumer charges off in 15 years. So that's quite noteworthy. But the wow on the negative side is, a negative provision seems like an outlier. And do you really want to set a tone at this stage of the cycle of taking a negative provision? I mean, you might be right, but you might be wrong. But we don't really know, how this is going to play out. So I guess, my questions are, you said if you had your downside scenario at 100%, that would be 1.3 billion of additional reserves. How much overlay do you have for that downside scenario now? That's number one. Number two, when you mentioned that there were commercial extensions, what does that mean? Is that delaying some of the inevitable? And you did say that loan losses would go up from year. And then third, just the whole tone perspective like it set the tone that that things are okay. Tayfun Tuzun : So, this is Tayfun. Let me take the first part of that and then I'll turn it over to Jamie for his comments. Look, I mean I think as you know at the end of the first quarter, at the end of the second quarter, we came out much more aggressively in terms of building reserves relative to the peers. And when you look at our coverage, it is 2.49% or 2.62% or 2.75%, we are still above the median levels of our peers. And internally obviously when we look at the risk profile of our loan book, we feel very good about it. And, two, we really did not take the cover ratio down. It's only from 2.50% to 2.49. And the balances obviously are lower at the end of the quarter, which have an impact. In terms of rating of the base scenario, we actually increased the lowest wage of the base of the base scenario this and increase the wage of the scenario this quarter. So we are quite cognizant of potential downturns in the economy. But, look, I mean, the underlying profile, credit profile of our balance sheet and the outstanding balances resulted in a release. And we have to abide by certain accounting principles and do the right thing. So that's from my side. Jamie, any comments from your side? Jamie Leonard : Yeah, and Mike, thanks for the question. When we looked at the net provision, it really is an output. And when we break it down into the two inputs, the CECL reserve, the release was 116 million in the quarter. And as we said, it's driven primarily by the payoffs and paydowns in the commercial loan book. And as Tayfun mentioned, the economic outlook did improve during the quarter, both from unemployment and GDP perspective, which does lower our loss expectations in the portfolio. But given the uncertainty in the environment of especially related to additional government support, we increased the weightings on the upside and downside in the scenarios from 10% last quarter to 20% this quarter. And those scenarios really have an asymmetrical profile, so it ultimately increases the required CECL reserve and essentially offsets the benefit from the improvement in the economic outlook. And to your other question then, if we were to run a scenario where it's -- there are no upside or downside scenario and we just said 100% is base, then the reserve requirement would be 250 million less than what it is today. So to your point, the downside scenario does result in a higher CECL reserve than roughly 250 million or so range. Tayfun Tuzun : The other part of the question, I mean it's your job to work with the borrowers, try to bridge the gap between the pre and post-COVID economies, but when you have commercial extensions, I think that's where a lot of people are focused, do you accept that you extend -- you drop covenants, you looseen covenants, I don't really -- there's a whole litany of things that you can do to make the life for borrowers easier, in some cases, probably most cases that will make sense, but in some cases that might not make sense. So what are you doing when you mentioned commercial extensions earlier? Richard Stein : Hey, Mike, it's Richard, I'll take that one. It really is, as you described, working with the borrowers, trying to understand their cash flow needs, their cash flow availability, the collateral that's available that maybe we don't have as part of a security package. So it's really just reworking the transactions, making sure that we're being thoughtful about things like maturity dates and extending maturity dates so that or reamortizing transactions with the cash flow. So it's really part of the workout process to make sure that we can be as accommodative as we can within the risk appetite support our customers and minimize losses over the long-term. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Sorry if I missed it, but did you guys say, how much of the 200 million of savings is in the third quarter runrate? Tayfun Tuzun : In the fourth quarter run rate or third quarter? Matt O\u2019Connor: I guess\u2026 Tayfun Tuzun : There's nothing in the third quarter and large majority of the savings will come in the first quarter of 2021. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. So not now and most of the 200 will be in 1Q on average and then in the second quarter. Tayfun Tuzun : Correct. That's correct. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then looking ahead to the kind of -- so most of that has already been identified I think you said in your earlier comments. And then looking ahead to the $100 million and $150 million, remind us what some of those drivers might be and could identified? Tayfun Tuzun : The opportunity is great, really focuses on our investments in technology, artificial intelligence. You look at our operations, we've done a really good job of being very efficient, but we still have more opportunities over there to reduce our people-related costs and really automate a lot of functions and processes and create more resiliencey and high quality outcomes. So we are very focused on process reengineering, automation. We've identified those process opportunities. We've got teams working aggressively on them. And we fully expect to achieve those objectives going forward. That will show up more in 2022 than it will in 2021 and give the time it takes to put some of these process, these re-engineering exercises in place. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Hey. Appreciate you taking the question. You guys are one of the few guys that have offered a charge-off assumption for next year and you said it a few times well below a percent. So, I guess in that vein, curious how you guys are thinking about how this cycle will end up trajecting? In other words, will we be taking care of most of the losses from this cycle next year? Or will they bleed into 2022 at a higher rate, as well? And I guess part of that question is because you guys have such a strong reserve that if losses indeed stay well below a percent, I guess I'm curious under CECL, at what point it becomes more challenging even to substantiate today's reserves? In other words, you don't just look adequately reserve, but potentially very over reserved. So I'm just curious about how you just think about those dynamics? Tayfun Tuzun : There's a lot of moving pieces, Scott, as you think about what's occurring right now with the amount of stimulus that was thrown at on the pandemic, whether we get the CARES Act next iteration of that, how's that going to be distributed with respect to PPP potential, consumer stimulus opportunities. So, there's a lot of variables involved here. But what we have visibility of right now as you think about the consumer side. We can see forward looking our roll rates, and we think we're in pretty good shape. The consumers are in a pretty good shape as we get into the \u2013 until we get into the second half of next year and it\u2019s going to depend on the variables I mentioned and some of the actions that are being taken. So more to come there, that's probably more of the second half of 2021, and we start to see those losses creep up if we don't get next iteration in the CARES Act. On the commercial side once again, a lot of challenges with respect to how we think about the sector because it really gets back to when do we see a vaccine out there? How effective is it? How is it being distributed certain parts of the economy are opening reopening quicker than the other parts of the economy? Southeast is reopened quicker right now. We\u2019re seeing positive outcomes there from a production standpoint. So this is a lot going on right now, which you can show yourself, because that's going to be very cautious. We came out with aggressive reserve levels. We're going to be very thoughtful and mindful about how we map our environment looks going forward and expectations are. And what's happening with some of the [indiscernible]. Jamie if you want to give more color on it. Jamie Leonard : Thanks for the question. As we look out at 2021 and we say well below 1%, that for us our models would indicate loss rate in the 70 basis points to 80 basis points range and that's as we sit here today with obviously a lot of uncertainty between the path of the virus and the path of stimulus. And when we look at and analyze a lot of data, especially consumer portfolios as Greg said a little bit easier to predicted model, but we get through all the data, really the simple answer when you pulling it out down as that if you were delinquent going into the pandemic you're going to be delinquent coming out. And if you're healthy going in, you're going healthy coming out. And that's what we're seeing and internally we call it the wind-chill effect. So if it's 50 degrees outside and it could be you get a pretty big tailwind and it feels like it's 30 degrees outside really from an un unemployment perspective, the wind-chill was reported numbers of 13% and now we're sitting around 8%. But the wind-chill, because of all of the stimulus programs and hardship relief, it's actually behaving at a 3% level. And that's why you see such good loss rates from us and our forecast assumption for next year has some stimulus round two backed into it. But if we get more than what we've assumed then those numbers could continue to improve from there. Scott Siefers : All right. That's perfect. Thank you guys very much for your thoughts. Operator : Gerard Cassidy from RBC, your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, everyone. Tayfun Tuzun : Good morning Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Thanks. Can you share with us, I know you touched on the capital position in your prepared remarks and your CET1 ratio now is over 10%. Can you remind us what your ideal ratio would be in terms of the amount of capital you want to carry to run the company? And then second, obviously the Fed has suspended buybacks for all the large banks including your own. What's your view that once the gate is lifted, assuming it will be, how quickly would you go back into re-purchasing your stock? Tayfun Tuzun : Gerard, we are at the 10.1% to 4% of CET1 today. I suspect as we look ahead by the end of the year, we will be approaching 10.5% likely and we entered this year coming out of 2019 with a capital ratio target of 9.5%. And that was actually elevated relative to our 9% target just about a year ago before that and we think that even then, back in 2017 and '18, we were making comments that we can run this company with an eight handle capital ratio, but we are very cognizant of where the peers are and the regulators are? So we said okay, 9% probably.  And then as we saw the probability of a recession going up, we lifted back to 9.5%. So from 10.5% to 9.5% assuming that we look ahead to a normalized economy, that's 1% of capital that we either consume by growing loans or we return to shareholders. Tough to predict the timing of the regulatory change in their current position, but I suspect that when we see the results of this CCAR run and when we find out what the regulators are going to do. If the gate opens, I don\u2019t why it would take us a long time to go back to a buyback scenario environment. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And the follow-up, your comments about extending out on the securities portfolio or the cash portfolio, your preference not to do that is very understandable. Would that suggest to us that you are all thinking that interest are likely to rise to 11 [ph] and we'll see a positive yield curve? Tayfun Tuzun : So our perspective on the interest rate outlook is that we will be in this environment for two, three years. I think it's hard to disagree where the market is pricing the next rate moves. Our concern about -- I mentioned, our concern around not exposing ourselves to a market-to-market. We're also very concerned that in the current environment, the spreads do not reflect the actual risk-return profiles, but they are very skewed by the Fed's aggressive actions. And they turn the credit spreads upside down. And in this environment with that kind of uncertainty, despite the fact that we are expecting this low rate environment to continue for a while, we're choosing to be on the sidelines.  We also expect that down the road here, whether it's going to happen in 2021 or 2022, once the sort of Fed starts either stepping back a little bit, slowing down their aggressiveness and once the market builds a certain level of expectation, whether it's about inflation or about the other end of this rate cycle. The yield curve will start to steepen. We are not necessarily expecting that to happen in the near-term. So a combination of the fact that portion of this cash flow -- cash will leave the bank and also we believe that weighting out until a better investment environment is the better alternative for us. That's why we're sitting out. Gerard Cassidy : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Saul Martinez from UBS. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning. What weighted average remaining maturity are you using in calculating your CECL results? Tayfun Tuzun : I\u2019m sorry. Can you repeat that question again? Saul Martinez : Yeah. What is the weighted average remaining maturity of your loan book that you are using as the basis for your CECL calculation? Tayfun Tuzun : I don't necessarily have a number ready, sort of, to give you right now. But I suspect that number is between three and five years. Saul Martinez : Okay. So -- and I would think a portion of your C&I book is much shorter because it is, you know, it's based on contract maturity. You do have a fair amount of revolvers -- annual revolvers. If it is in that -- I mean, is one way to think about it than, sort of, what's implicit in the loss content. If you were to use a four years [indiscernible] it would imply that, you know, the 2.5% reserve ratio, implies an average annual loss ratio or charge-off rate is about 60 basis points. Is that -- and you'll be higher than that during the peak and maybe lower than that when the credit cycle, kind of, -- really goes back to normal. Is that, you know, a fair way to think about it? Because three and five years, you know, would have -- depending on what number you use, it does have a pretty material difference in terms of what the underlying assumption is for annual loss content. So, I guess, I mean, is that a good way to think about, sort of, what's interesting, in your estimate? Tayfun Tuzun : I think, so I think directionally your comment is logical. If you look at page 13. And look at the difference -- that portfolio is within the commercial book. You see that, you know, the commercial mortgage loans, there's a coverage ratio for that one to 3.4%, whereas the -- for the C&I book, it's 2%. It appears, again, your question, and the logic that you're using is reasonable, it gets a little bit skewed in this environment because you know, the we are within -- for the commercial book the bigger impact comes from the reasonable supportable period, which is driven solely by the economic outlook. So the reason why I'm hesitating to say you are correct, is because that relationship does not necessarily readily fail translate to a reasonable annual loss content. So I just want to make that comment on that. Saul Martinez : Got it. You know that well understood. But I guess my point is, that the weighted average the main maturity is arguably the most important input into this calculation. And this isn't a comment on two-thirds of the general comment. And we you know, we received virtually no information on that from any bank. So it is, you know, it is a little bit of a disconnect that. I think.. Tayfun Tuzun : We can actually -- important, we can provide you that information. And we can do that -- in a couple [ph] for your basis, which will give you a little bit flow of content. Saul Martinez : Yes. One additional question. I want to ask on expenses. I mean, 200 million is almost 5% of your current expense base. And I think in the past, you guys had talked about, you know, the vast majority of that flown into the bottom-line. And then you have the additional expense saves. Is this fair to say we should when all said done expect your run rate expenses to be lower than what they are now? And can you just give us a sense as to the timing, I know you're not going to get one -- you're going to wait to get 2021 guidance, but you know, next quarter you see it costs a little bit but [indiscernible] first quarter has some seasonality. So we're likely pushing closer to 12 billion and expenses going 11 [ph], by the first quarter, potentially, maybe I am wrong. But, you know, is my logic, is right that we should expect expense to be lower on a dollar basis at some point in 2021 versus where we\u2019re at now. And any color on timing and magnitude of that? Tayfun Tuzun : So, we will maintain our discipline and not give you color on 2021 today. Saul Martinez : All right. Tayfun Tuzun : But what goes against that $200 million expense save is going to be some natural built-in inflation, whether it's related to merit increases or other compensation-related inflation. And, two, is going to be investments in our company. We will continue to make investments in our company. And the technology line item for all the right reasons is going up. What we feel good about it, though, is that we have now established a discipline the company, so look at those investments that are technology-related with a very disciplined return requirement. So, whatever the built-in expense growth is, is not going to be driven by head count increases. Saul Martinez : Right. Tayfun Tuzun : It's going to be driven by very reasonable investments in our business that have a return profile that we all feel comfortable with and that we believe is prioritized based on our corporate objectives. Saul Martinez : Yeah, okay. Helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi. Just one follow-up question, I know we're almost over time. As we think about that adjusted NIM of 255, assuming no impact from PPP and also, assuming a static balance sheet, how close are we to the trough? Tayfun Tuzun : I believe we are close, Erika. As we look ahead, we believe that we have now a level of stability that we're comfortable with. Could it be within 2, 3, 4 basis points? Yes, it could be. And obviously the margin itself today is probably less meaningful of the metric than it has ever been because it's the influence of the cash balances that we're sitting on. But I do believe that with an assumption that we will live in this highly liquid environment for a while, we are now pretty close to achieving stability here even if we sort of maintain the level of cash. And the faster we get out of the cash position, the faster we're going to start moving towards that 3% number that we believe are natural NIM stands out. But what gives us confidence there, when you think about it, we have $35 billion in the investment portfolio. Our sort of normal level of earning assets is about $150 billion. So, and we have -- I believe it's going to take us, two, three years to get down to where our peers are in their investment portfolio in this low rate environment. We have a huge advantage there. And then we have a significantly longer derivative portfolio compared to most of our peers. Those two give us a pretty reasonable confidence that once we get out of this liquidity environment, we will actually show you a pretty decent margin performance. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Bill Carcache from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Bill Carcache : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. If we set hedging benefits aside, could you discuss the impact of rates at the long end of the curve remaining low, how much are you receiving each quarter on loan and securities portfolio paydowns from your back book? And what's the yield differential between what's coming off and what you're putting on across products that should also give us a sense of how much you could benefit from curve steeping? Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah. So, on the investment portfolio, you have seen our yields went down by 7 basis points and we're not investing anything. And the cash flows are reasonably small, so that's the step down in portfolio yields could be relatively small compared to that's what I will say about that. In terms of the other fixed portfolios, in the auto portfolio, which is really the portfolio that is growing right now, we are probably the current coupons are probably about 20 basis points or so below the portfolio yield. So when you think about that, that really is the portfolio, loan portfolio, that's the only one that's exposed to a fixed rate repricing. Bill Carcache : Thanks, Tayfun. Tayfun Tuzun : Yep. Operator : John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Just a couple on the credit front. Do you have what you're criticized or classified assets did the third quarter? Richard Stein : Yeah. Hey \u2013 it's Richard. We had a slight uptick in the third quarter we'll give you the details in the Q. It was \u2013 it was really around the things that you would imagine across leisure as the cycle continues to extend. John Pancari : Okay. All right. And then the other thing on the credit front, but it's not on the loan side, you \u2013 I know commercial mortgage back securities make up a larger percentage of your securities portfolio than peers. And I know you indicated that Tayfun, you indicated that commercial real estate is particularly vulnerable. Do you have any concerns around how that credit dynamic within commercial real estate could impact your bond investments? Greg Carmichael : We don't, I think we've \u2013 the commercial real estate the non-agent commercial \u2013 I'm sorry, non-agency commercial real estate book that we have is smaller portion. It's about $3 billion or so in the portfolio. And it's all superseding. So the built in credit content of that portfolio does not give us any concern. Jamie Leonard : And John, it's Jamie, I guess since I bought a lot of those bonds, I can tell you that I keep an eye on them in the delinquency rates, like high single digits in the book. And the credit enhancement is approaching 40%. So we are a long way away from having any credit issues in that portfolio it. John Pancari : All right, Jamie. Thank you. That's helpful. If I can ask just one more question, I know you mentioned you're prioritizing investments in your asset and wealth management, including acquisitions, and we actually have seen some asset manager deals, larger ones, in the industry recently. Is that something you will consider as a potential acquisition of an asset manager for your business there? Greg Carmichael : Yeah. This is Greg. First off, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve invested heavily in our fee businesses and registration of our fee businesses and diversification of our fee businesses. That's going to shoot well, wealth and asset management is one of the areas that we're very focused on with respect to additional opportunities both from the acquisition of an entity of nature speaking up or account NIM in that business, and as you've seen, that business has grown really well for us over the years, up 10% sequentially. So we'll continue to look for those opportunities. And, yes, that will be included in that potential opportunity. Tayfun Tuzun : Anything that was slightly larger than our size? So appetite, so we just read that one, right? John Pancari : Yeah, got it. All right. Thank you, appreciate. Operator : Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Christopher Marinac : Excited similar question that Jonathan Callie asked about classified and criticized. So when you have the commercial extensions, do those get picked up a special mention? Or there is something else has to happen before those would migrate? Richard Stein : It's Richard again. If the two words are separate, we think about, when we think about workouts. The rating is the rating and then the workout strategies to workout strategy. Now, I think when we think about things that impact or reduce charge offs, clearly that's going to be in the criticize category, whether it's special mention or substandard. But we don't have the details about around the breakup, between those two. Remember, if you think about as Tayfun mention that is a potential weakness. And there's a ton of judgment of what a potential weakness looks like. It just effectively means higher probability of default, substandard, again another step down in terms of the fault probability. But again, that's a place where we're mitigates like collateral starts to come into play. Christopher Marinac : Great. So some of the extensions could be there now, but others could transition later. It's just \u2026 Richard Stein : Absolutely. And as I said, before, we start thinking about extensions. We're also looking at structural and other mitigates like structural enhancements, guaranteed, collateral. There's other ways we can work with a borrower to help them and protect the day. Christopher Marinac : Got you. Sounds good, Richard. Thank you very much for the insight. Thanks for all the information this morning. Richard Stein : Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Vivek Jain from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Jain : For squeezing me in just a couple of questions. Jamie, I think you mentioned if you're healthy going in, you'll be healthy going out, we're referring to consumers, corporates. And how are you thinking about, what the pandemic does change in the economy. And the way things work? Tayfun Tuzun : Yeah, I was referring to the consumer portfolio, where we have, so much me of information. And then we are just trying to make it as simple as possible. No matter how you slice and dice the data. The bottom line is and there was such a big focus on hardship related and hardship programs and deferral ways all of those things. And no matter how you slice and dice the data. The bottom line is, you know, and there was such a big focus on hardship, relief and hardship programs, and re-default rates, referral rate, all of those things. But no matter how you slice it, it really just comes down to something as simple as you're coming in, you're going to be helping coming out, from a consumer perspective. And that's why that consumer performance really does reflect, frankly, credit losses and credit projections, as if unemployment weren't 3%. So we feel very, very good about that. I think, to your point about, how this ultimately plays out in the economy, it really is the competing forces of the path of the virus versus the path of further stimulus. So if we get an additional round of stimulus, we think the loss curves continue to flatten, perhaps elongate. But again, the peak charge-offs, aren't going to be all that high, relative to the great financial crisis, especially for a bank like the third. Where we've put a lot of thought and effort over the last five years to position the company, as well as we have so that we think our loss rates are a fourth of what they were in the great financial crisis. So we feel good about that. Vivek Jain : So that means even with, if you think post pandemic, even if un unemployment runs at a higher run-rate, you think you'll be fine is what you're assuming? Tayfun Tuzun : We do, but again the stimulus and what that looks like will certainly be a big swing factor in those loss projections. So, for example, on the consumer side, we also are in different model efforts where we took out stimulus altogether, and so, we modeled that as a 20 basis point change in our outcomes if they are going to be no stimulus, so just to put guardrails on what these outcomes might look like. Vivek Jain : One more, if I may, completely different topic. What are you seeing in terms deposits on the pure end basis were flattish, but more if you think about consumer and corporate deposits, Tayfun, Jamie, what are you all seeing in terms of the trends there? Slowing static? Still growing? Any color on that? Tayfun Tuzun : Vivek, we are seeing stable consumer deposits. They're not going down, but we're not seeing any noticeable increases in consumer deposits at very healthy levels there. But we are not seeing further increases. The commercial balance has continued to pick up and I suspect that will in the fourth quarter. It's an election quarter. And there's a lot of hesitancy on the corporate side to do anything different at this point. I do believe that come early 2021, hopefully we will see some more emerging signs. It\u2019s hard to predict yet which side it will go. But that will be dependent on the economy. So for the foreseeable future, we see maybe small upticks in corporate balances and stable consumer balance. Vivek Jain : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to Chris Doll for closing remarks. Chris Doll : All right. Thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR department.

Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. I hope you're all well and staying healthy. Earlier today, we reported full year 2020 net income of $1.4 billion or $1.83 per share. We delivered strong financial results in 2020, despite the challenging operating environment brought on by the pandemic. We had several highlights for the year. We generated a record adjusted pre-provision net revenue. We maintained our expense discipline, producing an adjusted efficiency ratio below 59%, which was stable compared to the prior year and remains near decade lows. We generated a record adjusted fee revenue, including records in both our commercial and wealth and asset management businesses. We also continue to generate peer-leading consumer household growth of 3% with outsized success in Chicago and our key Southeast markets. While nearly doubling our reserves, we generated 11.7% adjusted return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI for the full year and generated an ROTCE of 18.4% in the fourth quarter. Just as importantly, we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping 99% of our branches open for business, while working closely with our customers to support them during these challenging times through the PPP program, hardship relief programs, and other outreach efforts that we have previously discussed. Our efforts have been those externally. We were recognized by an independent third-party as a top-performing bank among the 12 largest U.S. retail banks based on our pandemic response for our customers, communities and employees. Also, we had the honor winning the Greenwich middle market CX Award reflecting our commitment to delivering a superior customer experience and for enduring the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, during the year, we published our inaugural ESG Report highlighting our efforts to generate sustainable value for all stakeholders. And just this week, we announced that we became the first regional bank to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations. Turning to the fourth quarter. We reported net income of $604 million. Our reported EPS include a negative $0.10 impact from the items shown on page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.88 per share. Jamie will walk you through the quarterly financial results in more detail in just a minute. Focused execution on our key strategic priorities and our disciplined approach to credit risk management, continue to drive strong financial performance. As we recently announced, we have taken decisive action to drive efficiencies and improve the long-term profitability of the bank by streamlining our operations, including divesting less profitable businesses, such as property and casualty insurance, while still investing in areas of growth and profitability. For example, we recently finalized the acquisition of H2C, which strengthens our health care investment banking and strategic advisory capabilities. We continue to assess, select strategic investments in non-bank acquisitions to improve fee growth. All reported and adjusted return metrics were solid and improved sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting our strong operating results, including the provision for credit loss performance. We expect a positive momentum in our operating results to continue in 2021. Net interest income increased 1% sequentially despite loan portfolio headwinds. Underlying NIM, which excludes excess cash and PPP impacts, increased 8 basis points sequentially. We expect to generate differentiated NIM performance relative to peers in 2021 and beyond, reflecting the hedge and investment portfolio actions we have taken over the past several years. Our credit quality remains solid, with net charge-offs of 43 basis points stable compared to the recent quarters. Also, our criticized assets and allowance for credit losses both declined sequentially reflecting our credit discipline and improved credit results and economic outlook. We continue to benefit from diversification and resilience of our fee-based businesses in retail, commercial, and wealth and asset management. Many of our fee-based businesses are generating strong results that are helping to cushion the impact of lower rates. Our robust capital and liquidity levels further improved this quarter, indicative of our balance sheet strength. Our regulatory capital levels have increased for three consecutive quarters, as a result of our strong earnings power, balance sheet dynamics, and the Fed's temporary suspension of buybacks. With the partial relief announced by the Fed in December, we intend to execute up to $180 million in share repurchases in the first quarter. Through proactive management, we have built a strong and stable balance sheet and significantly improved the diversification of our fee revenue. We have done this all while maintaining our culture of expense discipline and demonstrating our commitment to consistent and solid through the cycle performance. Our financial performance continues to give us confidence that we can safely and soundly operate the company at significantly lower capital levels. Though our CET1 target remains at 9.5%, we will continue to evaluate the appropriate target -- capital target as the economy improves. We are also seeing continued strength in our commercial loan production levels in our pipelines. The fourth quarter loan production was the highest in 2020 and was down around 20% from the year ago quarter, but was up over 50% from the third quarter. We are encouraged by the recent trends, the sequential improvement in almost all regions and all verticals. Strong production was more than offset by elevated payoffs and another 1% decline in line utilization. Our middle market pipeline improvement was well diversified throughout our footprint including sigma [ph] strength in our Southeast markets. In corporate banking, the pipeline strengthened again this quarter with improvement in industrials, retail, healthcare, solar and financial institutions, partially offset by continued sluggishness in hospitality and energy. Based on a strong pipeline and stable utilization trends for the first three weeks of January, we currently expect C&I loan balances to improve on a period-end basis during the first quarter excluding the impact of PPP loans. Commercial real estate pipelines continue to be well-below pre-COVID levels. Before I turn it over to Jamie to further discuss results and our outlook, I want to reiterate our strategic priorities, which will enable us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value. Our four key strategic priorities have not changed over the past several years and include leveraging technology to accelerate digital transformation, driving organic growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies, and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection. We will put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on areas where we see the highest probability for driving strong financial returns and generate long-term value for our shareholders. Our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve us well as we navigate this environment in 2021 and beyond. I'd like to once again thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers and each other doing these challenging times. Fifth Third continues to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities, while remaining committed to equality, equity and inclusion for all. Through the end, we made a three-year $2.8 billion pledge to this commitment through lending, investing and donating, including a $25 million contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation. Our financial results continue to reflect our focused execution, discipline and through the cycle principles. We remain committed to generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders and anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top-performing regional bank. With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook. Jamie Leonard : Thank you, Greg, and thanks all of you for joining us today. One quick housekeeping item before discussing our financial results for the quarter. As you'll see in our earnings materials, we are no longer adjusting certain metrics for purchase accounting accretion or intangible amortization given that they largely offset and have an immaterial impact on pre-tax income. We hope this will help simplify our disclosures going forward to more easily assess our financial ratio. Now turning to our fourth quarter performance. We ended 2020 with positive momentum and delivered strong financial results. Reported results were impacted by several notable items including a $23 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap, a $21 million after-tax charge related to our acquisition and disposition actions as Greg mentioned; the sale of our HSA business remains in process and should close by the end of this quarter. We also recognized a $16 million after-tax charge related to our branch and non-branch real estate efficiency strategies. This includes impairments associated with seven branches we will be closing in April as part of our normal rigor on reviewing our network for efficiencies. These closures are in addition to the 37 branches we announced last quarter. Furthermore as Greg discussed, we recorded a $19 million after-tax charitable contribution expense to promote racial equality. And we also recorded $4 million after-tax from COVID-related expenses. Lastly, we had a onetime favorable item related to state taxes of $13 million. In terms of the financial highlights for the quarter. Despite the nearly 160 basis point decline in one-month LIBOR over the last 12 months, we were able to generate an adjusted PPNR above the fourth quarter of 2019 level. We generated an efficiency ratio of 58%. Our operating performance reflected a 1% increase in NII, a 16% increase in adjusted fees and a 4% increase in adjusted expenses. Given the strong PPNR results combined with continued credit related improvements, we produced strong reported and adjusted return metrics including an adjusted ROA of 1.31% and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 18.4% excluding AOCI despite growing our regulatory capital 20 basis points during the quarter. Drilling into the income statement performance. The sequential increase in NII of 1% reflected the strength of our balance sheet and deposit franchise. We saw a 4 basis point improvement in our total loan yields, which was supported by both the continued benefits from our long-duration deep-in-the-money cash flow hedges as well as $10 million in additional PPP income.  Our NII results included $11 million of incremental favorable prepayment penalties in the securities portfolio reflecting one of the benefits from our strategy to invest in bullet and locked-out cash flows. Approximately 59% of the investment portfolio still invested in bullet and locked-out cash flows at quarter end. And our investment portfolio yield increased 9 basis points sequentially to 3.1%. Net premium and amortization in our securities portfolio was only $1 million in the fourth quarter.  On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs by another 5 basis points. For the fourth quarter, the average cost of our core deposits was only 5 basis points. CD and debt maturities also provided a 2 basis point improvement to NIM versus the third quarter. Reported NIM was stable compared to the third quarter reflecting the favorable securities portfolio and PPP income I mentioned, offset by the impact of higher cash levels. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash improved 8 basis points to 3.14%.  Once again, we had another strong quarter generating non-interest income to cushion the rate-driven NII pressure. The resilience in our fee income levels continues to highlight the revenue diversification that we have achieved. Total non-interest income increased 9% relative to the third quarter. Excluding the notable items, non-interest income increased 16%.  We generated record commercial banking revenue, which increased double-digits sequentially and year-over-year driven by strength across most of the business. We also recorded TRA income of $74 million as well as gains from several of our direct fintech investments in venture capital funds. These investments generated $75 million of fee income in 2020 and we expect continued gains in 2021.  Top line mortgage banking revenue declined $46 million sequentially driven by a $26 million headwind reflecting a decline in rate lock volumes; a $12 million impact from our decision to retain $250 million of our retail production during the quarter; and $8 million due to margin compression. MSR decay in servicing fees were unchanged sequentially and will remain challenged in this environment. While we did not deliver the mortgage results we expected due to capacity pressures, we have seen meaningful improvement in December and January. Non-interest expenses also increased relative to the third quarter albeit to a much lesser extent than fees.  Adjusted expenses were up 3% excluding the mark-to-market impacts associated with non-qualified deferred compensation, but is offset in security gains within non-interest income. The largest contributor of the expense growth was performance-based compensation driven by the strong performance in fees related to business growth and other revenue-linked expenses. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average loans declined 3% sequentially with both commercial and consumer balances in line with our previous guidance ranges. Commercial loan balances continued to reflect lower revolver utilization rates, which decreased another 1% in the quarter to 32%.  Line utilization rates so far in January are stable relative to the fourth quarter. We currently expect utilization to remain unchanged for the first half of 2021 and are forecasting only a modest increase of approximately 1% in the second half of the year as the economy improves. Average CRE loans were flat sequentially with end-of-period balances declining 1%.  As we have discussed before, we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the current economic environment and supports our strategy of lower exposure and our focus on high-quality borrowers. We have provided more information related to our CRE exposures in our presentation this quarter. Average total consumer loans increased 1% sequentially driven by continued growth in the auto portfolio partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card.  We took additional action in the consumer portfolio at the end of December to improve our NII trajectory for 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion of our excess liquidity by purchasing government-guaranteed residential mortgages currently in forbearance under the CARES Act provision. These loans are in our held-for-sale portfolio as they are not expected to be held for more than one to two years. These loans provide a more attractive risk-adjusted return than other current investment alternatives.  Our securities portfolio of roughly $35 billion decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter reflecting the impact of pay downs combined with the lack of compelling reinvestment opportunities. Our investment portfolio positioning continues to support NII in the current environment allowing for patience in investing at the current unattractive long-term rates.  Given the potential for strong economic growth in the second half of 2021, we do not believe long-duration securities are providing an appropriate risk return trade-off. As a result, we do not expect to grow our investment portfolio in the near term. Our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained at $3.5 billion. Also our deliberate actions within the securities portfolio over the past several years focused on structuring the portfolio in anticipation of a lower rate environment and should continue to give us a strong advantage as a very effective hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds. Average other short-term investments which includes interest-bearing cash increased to $35 billion, growing $5 billion from the prior quarter and $33 billion compared to the year ago quarter. In addition to the loan growth headwinds outside of PPP the significant increase in excess cash reflects record deposit growth over the past nine months. Core deposits increased 3% compared to the third quarter, despite a 12% reduction in consumer CD balances which helped drive down interest-bearing core deposit costs by five basis points. Moving on to credit. Overall credit quality continues to be solid reflecting our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting balance sheet optimization and the improved macroeconomic environment. Charge-offs remained well-behaved at 43 basis points. Nonperforming assets declined $67 million or 7% with the resulting NPA ratio of 79 basis points declining 5 basis points sequentially. Also our criticized assets declined 12% with appreciable improvements in energy, industrial and middle market. Given the solid credit results lower end-of-period loan balances and improvements in the macroeconomic outlook, our reserve coverage declined eight basis points to 2.41% of portfolio loans and leases with improvement in both consumer and commercial. The low level of net charge-offs combined with the $131 million decline in the allowance resulted in a net $13 million benefit to the provision loan. Our ACL decline of $131 million was attributable to several factors. Approximately 1/3 of the decline was the result of lower period-end loan balances with the remainder of the release due to both the improved economic outlook and the improved commercial credit risk profile which is reflected in our lower NPA and criticized asset levels. As is required under CECL, our reserve reflects all known macroeconomic and credit quality information as of December 31. While we are not predicting or forecasting reserve releases at this point, given both the significant uncertainty in the economy and our loan growth expectations to the extent there would be meaningful and sustained improvement in the broader economy, it's not unreasonable that reserves could come down from here even if credit losses tick up. Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes GDP remains below 2019 levels until the end of 2021; an unemployment rate higher than the current 6.7% ending 2021 at 7.2% and declining to 5.6% by the end of 2022. Importantly, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from fiscal stimulus generally consistent with the $900 billion package passed at the end of December, but does not incorporate additional relief as currently proposed by the new administration. We did not change our scenario rates of 16% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $200 million release to our fourth quarter reserve. Conversely applying a 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $900 million build. Inclusive of the impact of approximately $136 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio is 2.53%. Additionally excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL would be approximately 2.65%. Moving to capital. Our capital remained strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.3%, above our stated target of 9.5% which amounts to approximately $1.2 billion of excess capital. As a reminder we have remaining capacity to purchase 76 million shares from our 100 million share program, authorized by our Board of Directors in 2019 representing $2.4 billion or 11% of our current shares outstanding. As Greg mentioned, we plan to execute approximately $180 million in share repurchases during the first quarter. And should the Federal Reserve permit banks to continue to repurchase shares in 2021 under the current net income test framework, we would have around $1 billion of buyback capacity in total for 2021 assuming no change to our reserve coverage. Moving to our current outlook. We have provided detailed guidance for both the full year and the first quarter consistent with previous fourth quarter earnings calls. We expect full year 2021 total loans to be stable with 2020 on both an average and end-of-period basis, reflecting the full year headwinds of commercial line utilization declines from the second half of 2020 and PPP forgiveness offset by the benefit of the consumer loans added at the end of 2020 and our forecast of $2 billion of new PPP loan originations in 2021. Average commercial balances are expected to decline in the low to mid single-digits range compared to 2020, while consumer balances should increase in the mid to high single-digits range. For the first quarter, we expect average total loan balances to increase approximately 2% to 3% sequentially, reflecting relative stability in the C&I portfolio, continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage and other consumer loans, partially offset by a 1% decline in CRE. Given the loan outlook, combined with our expectations for the underlying margin to be around 3% reflective of the structural rate protection from our securities and hedge portfolios, we expect NII to decline approximately 3% next year and also decline around 3% in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, assuming no deployment of our excess liquidity. We expect non-interest income to increase 2% to 3% in 2021, which includes a 1% headwind from lower TRA income in 2021. If not for the TRA impact, our fee expectations would be for 3% to 4% growth, which includes the impact of approximately $40 million in foregone annual revenue, associated with our business exits as part of our expense savings program. For the first quarter, we expect fees to increase mid single-digits year-over-year, which is not which is a 9% to 10% decline sequentially reflecting seasonal impacts, such as the lack of TRA revenue and lighter other non-interest income, partially offset by the seasonal uptick in wealth revenue from tax preparation fees in the first quarter and significantly stronger mortgage revenue. We expect top line mortgage revenue to improve $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter and also anticipate stronger results in our loan and lease syndication businesses. We expect full year 2021 non-interest expense to decline approximately 1% relative to the adjusted 2020 expenses, driven by the impacts of our expense reduction program, but partially offset by expenses associated with strong fee growth, servicing expenses associated with the consumer loan portfolio purchased in the fourth quarter and continued investments to accelerate both our digital transformation and our sales force and branch expansion in our growth markets. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Compared to the first quarter of 2020 reported expenses, we expect total expenses to be flat. On a sequential basis excluding seasonal items, our total first quarter expenses are expected to be down approximately 3% to 4% from the fourth quarter. We currently expect to generate year-over-year adjusted positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be in the 45 basis points to 55 basis point range. If the proposed stimulus passes we would expect to be at the lower end of that range. In summary, our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles; disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks Jamie. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and the follow-up, and then returning the queue if you have additional questions. We'll do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning. Melissa, please open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Greg Carmichael : Hi, Scott. Scott Siefers : I just wanted to ask about sort of the C&I outlook. Near term, I guess, I would characterize the commentary as constructive, but you had the outlook for just, I think a 1% increase in line utilization in the second half. It seems to me it stands in a bit of contrast from some of your peers who seem to require a more robust acceleration in C&I later in the year. I guess, I'm just curious for maybe more color on how you're thinking about the potential rebound in C&I as the economy normalizes around say midyear or so? Greg Carmichael : Hey, Scott. This is Greg. First of all, I'd say, we were encouraged by the fourth quarter pipeline growth that we've seen up significantly over the third quarter albeit slightly down from where we were at the end of 2019. So we're seeing progress out there. It's really -- it's pretty broad-based across all of our regions and across our verticals. So we're encouraged by the strength we're seeing there. Obviously, there's a lot of unknowns going in as we go into 2021, digital stimulus, the vaccines and so forth, the recovery. And so it's a hard thing for us to gauge what the expectations are, but there's a lot of liquidity out there right now. So we're optimistic that if the vaccines get distributed appropriately and we get the economy back in full swing second half of the year that those numbers might look stronger. But right now we're just being at the end of the day conservative, but encouraged by the pipelines that we've seen already. I don't know, Tim if you have anything to add? Tim Spence : No, I think, that's absolutely right. As you said, I think, we're particularly pleased with the pickup in middle market production that we saw in the fourth quarter and the continued strength in the industry verticals like renewable energy, technology and healthcare where the bank has made fairly significant strategic investments over the course of the past several years. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then just within your guidance for the full year, I know that you guys conservatively don't include the PPP impacts. Just curious however to the extent that they do come through how are you expecting those to ebb and flow? While most of the forgiveness is from the first half as that expected to be, sort of, a first half event, or how do you see that flowing through? Jamie Leonard : Yes. Scott, it's Jamie. For PPP in total NII, we expect about $150 million in 2021 which includes about $60 million in accelerated forgiveness fees, which compares to about $100 million of total NII in 2020, which included only $10 million in accelerated forgiveness fees. And right now in our outlook, we expect first quarter forgiveness fees to be in line with the fourth quarter. Perhaps that's we -- we'll be better than that from a forgiveness perspective. We've got about $400 million or a little bit less than 10% of the 2020 originations forgiven. And so as we model it out, we expect the majority of the fees from the 2020 originations to be forgiven in the third quarter as borrowers approach that 16-month time horizon of needing to make payments or have it forgiven. So right now we expect the back half of the year to have a little bit more accelerated fees. And then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect the 2021 round of PPP to be about $2 billion in originations and then that will accrue at a lower rate just given the five year term on those loans. So we expect about a 1.8% yield prior to any of the forgiveness fees. Scott Siefers : Perfect. All right. Thank you all very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jamie, on the fee side I could just hear you reiterate that up 3% to 4% core growth excluding TRA. I heard your core -- your comments about mortgage for the first quarter, but can you just give some more color in terms of what you expect to drive that growth this year and how mortgage fits into that equation? Jamie Leonard : Sure. I think some of the momentum coming off of 2020 will lead to a very successful 2021 in the fee businesses. We did grow households 3% on the consumer side. And then the investments we made in the capital market offerings over the past several years should bear fruit in 2021. So when you line up the fee categories for 2021, I expect high single-digit growth in treasury management and commercial banking, which does include the capital markets business; mid-single digits growth in consumer deposit fees, wealth and asset management and card and processing; and then low single-digit growth in mortgage. Ken Usdin : Got it. So even with the strong year given some of that -- I guess it was a capacity point you made earlier about mortgage. You still think mortgage can grow this year. Is that just because you see production pulling through, or do you see less of the MSR drag over time? Just maybe a little more color on the mortgage side? Thanks. Jamie Leonard : Yes. On mortgage in the fourth quarter there were capacity constraints and there was the headwind from our decision to portfolio $250 million of our retail production. Those loans will close in the first quarter, and then you'll see that show up in the residential mortgage balances in held for investment. And from there, we do expect the capacity constraints to be behind us. And from an MSR perspective this environment for servicing is certainly challenging. We expect that to abate in the second half of 2021. And all-in the low single-digit growth for 2021, I think is a very achievable number for us. Ken Usdin : Okay. Understood. Thanks a lot, Jamie. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Peter Winter : Good morning. Jamie Leonard : Hi, Peter. Peter Winter : I wanted to ask about capital. And if you can, if you could just go over the capacity what's left in the existing share buyback? How much do you have left? And then secondarily, if the Fed were to lift the restrictions on share buybacks, just how you're thinking about capital returns? Jamie Leonard : Yes. Thanks for the question, Peter. In 2019, we approved $100 million share repurchase program. We have 76 million shares left under that program. So call it $2.4 billion. Right now for 2021 you assume the Fed continue their trailing 12-month net income test and you look at our guide on earnings you should generate about $1 billion of capacity assuming no additional reserve releases. And if you look at our capital from a spot basis at the end of 12/31/2020, we have about $1.2 billion of excess even with the loan performance that we've had. So I think for 2021 should the Fed open the window $1 billion or so is -- I think, everything triangulates to that level. Peter Winter : Okay. That's helpful. And then, you guys lowered the net charge-off guidance from December -- towards December, I think it was 55 to 65. What gives you the confidence that, like, there is nothing looming, especially with some of these loans coming off deferral, assuming we don't get an additional stimulus package? Richard Stein : Yes. Hey, it's Richard. Thanks for the question. I think it really comes down to the activity we have from a risk management perspective, the confidence we have in the underwriting and our portfolio management. We continue to see consumer loss rates lower than normal. We saw them lower than normal in 2020. We expect that to continue in 2021, as the impact of stimulus rolls through the portfolio. Remember, our portfolio is concentrated in prime and super prime. We have a weighted average FICO of close to 760. So confidence in what's happening there from an activity standpoint. We do expect commercial losses to tick up a little bit from the -- into the high 40s, low 50s. And that's just going to be a function of the normal migration we see in commercial. We highlighted some potential at-risk industries in the deck. But we've seen criticized assets come down, as Jamie mentioned. We've seen positive resolutions in our workout group. And so, just, given what we see in the portfolio, where we see performance restabilization across a number of sectors, we have a lot more confidence in that range. Peter Winter : That\u2019s great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy from Stephens. Your line is open. Terry McEvoy : Hi. Good morning. Maybe start with a question for Jamie who, I guess, by now we'll call the chief cook and bottle washer at Fifth Third. So a question for Jamie. Pretty clear on kind of the securities purchases and your thoughts there on holding cash. I guess my question, are there opportunities to purchase loans like the government-guaranteed loans that you had in the fourth quarter, as well as the decision to just hold more mortgages on the balance sheet as you think about the next 12 months? Jamie Leonard : Yes. And that's essentially what we did in the back half of 2020. In the third quarter, we repurchased our own Ginnie Mae forbearance pool and that was about $750 that came on to our balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, we purchased a servicers' pool to the tune of $2.1 billion, as well as taking the $250 million of retail production and putting it on the sheet. I think, for now we've done a lot of work on the residential mortgage portfolio to improve it. And we think the returns are incredibly attractive. I think going forward, I'd like to see the loan growth be in other categories, just given the convexity risk you have in residential mortgage and that we've done enough. So that's why we expect in the first quarter to get back to selling all of our production. But, again, I think, the trade that we were able to execute was a nice deployment of excess cash and certainly a far better return than just buying mortgage-backed securities. We think the ROA, it was 2% or so on that transaction, versus security purchases are probably 1% to sub-1% right now. Terry McEvoy : Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, just looking at the CECL allowance; I'm curious, what was behind the increase in commercial mortgage and commercial construction? Other categories drifted lower, those two were up higher quarter-over-quarter and I was hoping to get some insight there. Thank you. Richard Stein : Yes. It's Richard, again. Look, in commercial real estate, we've seen continued negative migration. That's just a portfolio and an asset class that has a longer tail in terms of when problems arise and a longer tail when they're going to be resolved. So we saw criticized assets go up in that sector. And so, we -- that, plus some qualitative adjustments, because we don't believe that the models fully reflect the variables that are impacting some of these subsectors, like hospitality and retail, in terms of the time of recovery. And so, just given the asset migration trends and some qualitative adjustments that drove the ACL for commercial real estate higher in the quarter. Terry McEvoy : Great. Thanks again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ken Zerbe : Hi. Great. Thanks. First question, just in terms of the NII guidance, I just want to make sure that the -- or question, whether the down 3% in 2021, does that include your expectation of accelerated PPP fee income? Jamie Leonard : Yes. Thanks for the question. So we do include the $2 billion of additional 2021 PPP in our guide. I think the NII guide of down 3%, that trajectory could improve, I guess, to the point of the first question on the call today, through higher commercial line utilization, because we do assume just a small uptick in the back half of the year. And frankly, there's not much we can do about that. It's a borrower-customer demand situation. A steepening yield curve benefit would also help. We anchor our guidance on the January 4th implied forward curve. So, perhaps we'll do a little bit better there. And should the curve steepen significantly then we would have opportunity to deploy excess cash. Third, with regard to the PPP, we're assuming $2 billion of originations but as we -- and perhaps that's a conservative number because as we sit here today we've submitted over $1 billion in apps in just the first two days. And then finally, as Greg mentioned, perhaps there'll be better commercial loan production through higher borrower demand and CapEx and inventory buildups. And from a production expectation perspective, we're expecting 2021 commercial loan production to be up about 20% or so from 2020 but still down 7% or so from 2019 levels. So, our outlook assumes improvement, but not returning to a 2019 type of economy. Ken Zerbe : Got it. Okay. And just my second question I think Greg mentioned the 9.5% your CET-1 target currently which I totally understand and you make a comment that you would kind of reconsider that as the economy gets better. Can you just help us dimension like let's assume that the economy is fully better like where is a good level for Fifth Third to run on CE Tier 1? Jamie Leonard : So, prior to some of the challenges that were cropping up in the environment we had a 9% target. So, should the economy improve as we hope it does in the back half of 2021 9% I think is a logical next step for us. When we stress test our balance sheet we believe our balance sheet has a risk profile that could be run in the 8.5% to 9% range. Our stress capital buffer is currently 7%. So I guess the Fed's perspective is much lower than that. But I think for us for this year we're targeting 9.5% and we'll evaluate that target as we see how the economy unfolds. Ken Zerbe : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. We saw back book re-pricing headwinds to loan yields persist throughout the last strip cycle not just for Fifth Third, but across the banking system. I believe about half of your loan portfolio is variable rate and the mix was to the short end of the curve, but there's still some re-pricing yet to come through. Would you expect a similar dynamic with further pressure on loan yields to come in this strip cycle as well? Maybe if you could just speak to that and maybe compare and contrast what's different about this cycle? Jamie Leonard : No, I think that's a good observation and we are experiencing that phenomenon. And we saw it in the fourth quarter NIM and it's a factor in our first quarter guide. Right now from C&I production levels just given the floating nature of the portfolio yields are roughly in line maybe five bps below the current portfolio. But on the consumer side which is more fixed rate in nature instruments, we are seeing new production yields 25 to 35 basis points below portfolio yields. And so that is certainly a headwind in our NII outlook. Bill Carcache : Understood. And separately sorry if I missed this, but I wanted to ask about if you could give some color on new money rates in light of the curve steepening that we've seen? On the security side, it seems like some of the dynamics around QE have led agency MBS spreads over treasuries to turn negative which would seem to temper some of the benefits of the steeper curve. But I was hoping that you guys could discuss some of the opportunities that you see there. Jamie Leonard : Yes, I think it's a great question and we're seeing a divergence in practice across the banks. Our view in terms of what the rate environment would need to progress to in order to put our excess liquidity to work is we would like to see 50 basis points or more improvement in the entry points either through the spread widening or curve steepening. A lot of banks to your point is defined in on the 25 basis points of steepening or even before that. But credit spreads have tightened 10 basis points or more over that time so that the net entry point improvement to us is not that compelling. In fact by our math if you bought in the third quarter or even in the first couple of months of the fourth quarter you lost $2 in value for every $1 in carry you picked up over that period of time. So, you still have more risk should the curve steepen further. And we don't want to be stuck in a bad trade chasing balances at what are still historically low levels of rates. So, the good news for us is we are very well-positioned in the investment portfolio. We have the luxury of time. Portfolio cash flows are about $1 billion a quarter is how we're modeling it. So, we just think being patient -- we can afford to be patient and we'll move when we think we are getting the appropriate risk return in the environment. Bill Carcache : That's very helpful. Thank you for taking the questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. My first question is a clarification question. Jamie, you mentioned $1 billion in buyback capacity for the year. But that would imply that the Fed extends its income test beyond the first quarter, correct? Jamie Leonard : Yes. $180 million in the first quarter and then any additional repurchases are certainly subject to the Fed allowing us to do so. Erika Najarian : So, if they lift the income restriction, I guess number one, what are your plans for DFAST participation this summer? And number two, where could that capacity grow to, if you were not subject to that income restriction after first quarter? Jamie Leonard : So the -- I'll take the second part of the question first because, that's the easier one. Right now, against our target of 9.5%, we have $1.2 billion of excess capital. So, until the economy shows significant improvement, $1.2 billion would take us down to our target. So I think that's a fair number to use. The income test would deliver a little bit less than that. In terms of the CCAR opt in, it's funny because, we've discussed this as a team and we officially have until April 5th to decide. But right now, given that our binding capital constraint is our own internal target of 9.5% versus the Fed's prior Stress Capital Buffer for us at 7% or even 7.2% in their COVID tests, should they adopt those December results in the SCB, frankly, we feel like our team deserves arrest at following the six stress tests we did during the pandemic. And there's essentially nothing to be gained by participating. So, I think for now, if I had to decide today, I would decide not to opt in. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just my second question is on the net charge-off outlook for this cycle. Should we think, of that 45 to 55 basis points as your quantification of the peak, or are you expecting the spike to be delayed in 2022? I'm just trying to square that with a 2.65% reserve ex PPP. Jamie Leonard : Yes. So, it's interesting when you look at the guide for us, the 45 to 55 basis points for the first quarter, we actually expect charge-offs to be in the 40 to 45 basis point range and grow during the year. And to your point those losses get pushed out. But we certainly expect the 45 to 55 range to be the peak, even though some of the additional stimulus are elongating this cycle. I think ultimately the peak of the cycle keeps coming down, which is why we continue to guide to a better and better number. So right now, I think 45 to 55 will be the peak for us. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. On the -- back to the capital topic, given your thoughts on capital and where you stand in terms of excess, can you just give us your updated thoughts on M&A potential in terms of both bank opportunities and what your thoughts are there as well as on the non-bank side? Thanks. Greg Carmichael : John, this is Greg. Good question. I get it often as you might imagine. I think first off, we haven't changed our position. We're really focused on non-bank M&A opportunities as evidenced by our recent acquisition of H2C that really supports our not-for-profit health care part of our vertical. So it's really about making sure that we are additive to both our products and our service capabilities for our fee-based business whether it be wealth and asset management, our payments capability, our capital markets capability. That's where we're spending our energies right now and then really getting out of businesses that are more in hobby such as we talked about our property and casualty business. That wasn't really providing the returns we're looking for and we couldn't get the scale. So our focus is going to continue to be on those opportunities to enhance our business value proposition and grow those fee businesses. And that's the move we've been focused on the last five years mainly. From a bank M&A perspective, it's not on our agenda right now. And as always, we would assess in an attractive situation. But today, that's not our focus. Our focus is on non-bank M&A, that adds to the business we just discussed. John Pancari : Thanks, Greg. And then, on that front, on the non-bank front, I know you mentioned wealth and asset management. Just to confirm, is that -- is it both areas that you'd be interested in? I know you've expressed an interest in wealth, but you would also be interested in the institutional asset management side as well? Greg Carmichael : No, that's pretty -- no not the institutional side. We're pretty much focused on like I said the wealth and asset management side, where we made acquisitions like the Franklin Street Partners in North Carolina. That's pretty much our focus right now on the wealth side of the business. John Pancari : Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And if I can ask just one more question. In terms of the securities portfolio, just wanted to get an update on how the underlying credit within the securities book is holding up. I know you have a CRE concentration there in terms of CMBS. I just wanted get an updated -- an update there on what you're seeing in terms of the performance of the underlying securities if there's any stress there evolving? Thank you. Jamie Leonard : Yes. We're invested in about $3.5 billion of non-agency CMBS and it's holding up well. The delinquency rates are mid to high single digits, but the credit enhancement right now is approaching 40%. And we only invest in the super senior AAA-rated tranches, so that we're at the top of the repayment stack. So we're not concerned about the credit exposure in the non-agency book. John Pancari : Got it. Okay, great. Thank you. Jamie Leonard : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. Greg Carmichael : Hi Mike. Mike Mayo : I think I heard you correctly so you're kind of guiding for negative operating leverage in the first half of the year, and positive operating leverage in the second half of the year, and kind of flattish for the year as a whole. Is that, kind of a fair summary of what you guys said? Jamie Leonard : Yeah. Mike Mayo : Okay. So the question really is, on the spending. And I'm sure, there's a lot of opportunities to spend money, but from the strategic landscape, you have a lot of large banks that are opening up branches in some of your markets, others that are saying branch like digital first, some are trying to use their credit cards in the markets to cross-sell, others are moving kind of middle market businesses into your area. So as it relates to the kind of the competitive banking wars in your markets. How do you think about that? I mean, are you seeing any impact yet? Are you worried about that over the next five years? Is it much to do about nothing, or is this a major strategic threat and you say \"Hey, we need to spend more money on, X, Y and Z?\" Greg Carmichael : Mike, let me start. This is Greg. And I'm going to defer it to Tim, because this is a great question for him also. If you think about, the investments we're making, we still expect to run on an expense basis down next year, as we continue to make the strategic investments. Our strategies and you've heard this over-and-over have not changed in the last five years as far as how we're focused on our business which is digital transformation, feeding our business organic opportunities to grow our businesses such as our fee-based business that I just discussed a moment ago. And that being added to the acquisitions our fintech plays to add to our products and capabilities to deliver to our customers, our services. So we're going to continue to focus on that. We're very competitive. The household growth that we've seen at 3%, strong growth in our Southeast markets, we're a leader in the Chicago market. So we like those investments. So we're very comfortable on our ability to compete. We think our investment structure we have in place today allows us to continue to grow our franchise. And be extremely competitive. So we're not going to change that. We're going to continue to feed the opportunities that we think creates the greatest value for our shareholders. Let me let Tim add, from his side. Tim Spence : Yeah. No. I mean, Mike new competition is always something that we watch closely. And I think I wouldn't isolate it just to the folks, who are traditional, financial institutions that are building into our markets. We pay a lot of attention to the fintech companies. In particular given that in some cases they are arbitraging, the regulatory apparatus at the moment in a way that creates imbalanced competition. I think the point that Greg made to me is the most important one, is we have on a sustained basis continued to gain share, even in our highest density markets over the course of the past three or four years on primary banking relationships, which we view as being the best measure of market share. Because the decisions you make on pricing a deposit product or you domicile headquarter deposits or otherwise, have a big impact on the FDIC numbers that you sometimes see people use on a period-to-period basis. So the strong household growth we have seen across the franchise in particular in focused markets like Chicago and the Southeast as Greg mentioned, on the consumer side of the business and the strong core relationship growth that we continue to see out of our middle market franchise are the things that give us confidence in our ability to continue to compete. Mike Mayo : I think -- so you say 3% household growth over what timeframe? And that's an interesting way to think about it, because what you're making for household is depressed from a -- the low rate environment, so the 3% household growth over the past year or, what timeframe? Tim Spence : Yeah. It's 3% household growth over the past year. But if you were to look at our growth in prior years, it would have been in the 2% to 3% range, quite steadily. So we've actually seen some acceleration, driven both by the build-out in the Southeast. And the growth rates for our Chicago market post-MB have been among the strongest in the franchise and definitely far stronger than you've ever seen in Chicago, when we were Fifth Third on a stand-alone basis. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on Erika's comments and questions. It seems to me, like your reserve ratios are just completely inconsistent with your charge-off guidance. Your NCO of 50 basis points at the midpoint you're -- at the peak of the cycle it does seem to be suggesting that the government has effectively played the role of superhero and prevented credit cycle from really even emerging. And your reserves are about five times that and I would guess your weighted average remaining life is not five years. And that doesn't even consider that your NCO rates are going to fall from here. So can you just help me bridge the gap on, your reserve levels relative to your charge-offs, because the conclusion would be you've -- would seem to me to be that, you're making an ample level of qualitative adjustments or your probability weighting downside scenarios pretty conservatively. And that we should be thinking that it's pretty likely you're going to see pretty significant reserve releases in -- coming in the coming quarters? Jamie Leonard : Yeah. It's a very good question, and the answer really comes down to the fact that the modeling of the ACL was based on the Moody's hypothetical scenario, and that's frankly why we included that in the prepared remarks, so everybody would have that information. It is certainly a scenario that is one, the base scenario is more conservative than our own outlook; and two does include a 20% allocation to a downside scenario that obviously we don't expect to happen. So, by its very nature delivers an ACL reserve that would be higher than our expectations for losses in this environment. Saul Martinez : So, is your model factoring in net charge-offs that are higher than what you're guiding to in 2021? Jamie Leonard : Well, the reserve calculation is a three-year -- for us a three-year reasonable and supportable period, and then it reverts back over the remaining years to your historical loss rates whereas our guide is our internal modeling over the next 12 months. So, you can have differences in that given the different scenarios that are used. Saul Martinez : Right, yes. I don't want to belabor this, but like if you're saying that this is the peak and your reserve is five times that, it just seems hard to disconnect the two to that degree. It just seems like there is a part that's more weighter. Jamie Leonard : Yes. I think to your question, if the outlook continues to improve all other things being equal, the reserve will come down and should come down. Our point is, we remain conservatively positioned and prudently positioned given the uncertainty in the environment and we'd like to get through another three to six months and see how this unfolds with vaccine efficacy and the economy turnaround. Greg Carmichael : I think that's definitely important. Saul Martinez : Yes, right. Greg Carmichael : That's really important, Jamie, just to... Saul Martinez : Yes. It's a good problem to have. Yes. So, go ahead, sorry. Jamie Leonard : Yes. Greg Carmichael : No. This is the conversation. It's Greg. With the conversation, we are obviously -- that's on the forefront of how we think about our business. But we are taking a conservative approach. We do want to wait and see over the next couple of quarters how this vaccine plays out, how the economy out. You're exactly right. If you look at what we've got modeled versus what our expectations are, I think there's significant upside for reserve releases as we go in to the latter part of this year if things play out as we expect they would. Saul Martinez : Okay. Just as a quick follow-up additional question on expenses, just make sure I'm getting the glide path right here. Would see -- based on your full year and your first quarter expenses, it would seem like at the midpoint of the range you're factoring in about $1.1 billion a quarter of expenses from 2Q to 4Q. And I guess you get there in 2Q with -- most of the way there with the seasonal expenses going away. But, I mean is it fair to say like how do we think about that glide path? And should we be thinking that by fourth quarter as some of these expense initiatives filter through you could be even below that $1.1 billion as you run rate as you head into 2022? Jamie Leonard : Yes. It's a good observation. We do have a higher run rate in the first quarter and due to the seasonal items that we typically haven't that I discussed in the prepared remarks. And yes, when you model it out, $1.1 billion is a fairly good run rate to assume given the revenue projections. If the growth ends up being better than the 3% to 4% then expenses obviously revenue ranges would be higher. But for our outlook, right, you are exactly right. And then the benefit that we might have in the fourth quarter to the extent our lean process automation and other initiatives pay off sooner than the 2022 time horizon then you could see some additional improvement in the fourth quarter. But for now, we're expecting $100 million to $150 million of savings to occur in 2022 and not in 2021. Saul Martinez : Got it, okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Greg. Good morning, Jamie. Greg Carmichael : Good morning. Jamie Leonard : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Coming back to loan loss reserves, when you take a look at your loan loss reserve on January 1, when the CECL was put into place for you and your peers, I think your loan loss reserve was about 180 basis points. Clearly -- there you go. Clearly it's higher today. Do you think ultimately, I don't know if it's 2022 or 2023, but is that a good end point that we should look at in terms of when this whole COVID issue is behind us? And then, the second part of this whole loan loss reserving, once your guys' view on CECL now that we've had it for a year? I know it was a very tumultuous year. But do you think it's made it more volatile, less volatile? Jamie Leonard : I'll take these questions. I think Greg can answer the second one. Greg Carmichael : Okay. Jamie Leonard : In terms of the 182 and the day one level, we spent a lot of time looking at that as to when should we or if we ever should return back to that day one, 182 basis points. And right now our current thinking is that in order to get there, it will take -- it's going to be measured a lot longer than several quarters, because we're going to exit this this crisis with corporate debt levels leverage levels significantly higher coming out than they were going in. And you would the way the modeling works you would have to have an economic outlook as well as the outlook was essentially in 4Q of 2019 and that might be hard to ever get back to at least in the next couple of years. So I think the bias for all of our reserves across the industry is probably to take a longer period of time. And ultimately if you said if - take a guess as to where that plays out over the next two years. Or at the end of two years from now would you be at your day 1? I'd say we probably are over that number because of the corporate debt levels and because the economic outlook is probably not as favorable as the 4Q 2019 outlook was when we adopted CECL. Gerard Cassidy : Got it. Greg Carmichael : In terms of it's volatility absolutely yes. I mean obviously given the CECL methodology and going into a stress environment you saw this huge, huge swings that we're dealing with right now then also the adjustments necessary to release of reserves. On the models that have been tuned for this no one modeled in a pandemic. These are new models. So there's a lot of qualitative adjustments to these models that bears burdens to the uncertainty in front of us right now. So and it does definitely makes them more volatile for us. Gerard Cassidy : No doubt. Greg here is a bigger picture question for you. When you go down the elevator in the evening the outlook for the banking industry including Fifth Third is positioned very well. Assuming that the economy recovers as we all think it will as bank stock prices as you know from your own stock price since the Pfizer announcement right after the election has been fantastic. What do you see as the everything is hopefully going to shape out real well this year but what are the risks that you worry about when you go down that elevator at night? Greg Carmichael : First off good question. I think we're well positioned to be competitive in the markets that we're in. The investments that we've made I think are aligned with our long-term growth expectations and success of our business. So I feel really good about how we're competing today. The challenge always is, is when we look what watch these fintech players come forward not under the same regulatory oversight that we're doing with capital expectations and so forth so there's a threat there that we're kind of watching. If they get access to the banking system payment rails and so forth that could create some stress for us that I'm very concerned about. But as far as our investments in fintech entities themselves, the investments that we're making I'm comfortable with. It's really those fintech players out there that aren't under the same regulatory framework that we are creating some stress for us snooping around the edge of our profit pools and maybe shifting some customer behavior. So that's probably the thing that keeps me up most at night. As far as competing against other banks I think we've done all the right things to do that just making sure we keep our eyes open and we have been on what it looks like against some of these other nontraditional bank players. To that end that's why we've made significant investments in our digital capabilities and really created a digital bank ourselves. All of our lending products are online available - production online service capabilities. And we've made huge investments in our digital capabilities to make sure we're well positioned to deal with those type of threats. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott. Christopher Marinac : Thanks. Greg just leveraging off of your last answer to Gerard. Do you see fintech acquisitions as a necessary item in the future, or do you just want to be a good customer of these companies? Greg Carmichael : I think once again we've been either a partner or acquirer of fintech opportunities. Once again it gets back into our strategy whether it's buy partner then build. So we always want to focus on the technology and capabilities that are already out there. And it fits into our strategic direction with respect to how we're going to gain a lot with proper offer or how we're going to offer it. And what the opportunity looks like from a growth perspective we'd like to buy that capability if it's already there. It's a quick way to get to the market. If we can't do that you can watch us do numerous fintech partnerships to allow us to get the capabilities through that type of relationship. And if we can't do that you've watched us build and build those capabilities. And that's really been our mindset over the last decade with respect to how we handle fintechs or how we address those long term. Christopher Marinac : Great. Thanks very much, and thanks for all the information this morning. Greg Carmichael : Thanks. Operator : We have no further questions at this time. Mr. Doll I turn the call back over to you. Chris Doll : Thank you Melissa and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. If you have any follow-up questions please contact the IR department and we will be happy to assist you.

[Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Chris Doll : Thank you, Melissa. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing Fifth Third's financial results for the first quarter of 2020. Please review the cautionary statements and our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to the non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I'm joined by our CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Jamie Leonard; President, Tim Spence; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg to his comment. Greg Carmichael : Thanks Chris. And thank all of you for joining us this morning. Hope you're all well and staying healthy. Earlier today, we reported first quarter net income of $694 million from $0.93 per share. We continued our positive momentum from the past several quarters and once again deliver strong financial results in the first quarter. These strong results reflect record commercial bank and fee revenue, continued success generating consumer household growth and a strong underlying net interest margin. Our performance reflects focused execution on our key strategic priorities. We continue to benefit from the diversification, resilience of our fee based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial and wealth and asset management which are generating strong results in helping to cushion the impact of lower short-term rates. We have maintained our discipline clients selection and conservative underwriting, which are evident in our credit metrics. For the quarter, we recorded a benefit in our provision for credit losses, reflecting a stronger economic outlook, as well as historically low net charge-offs, which included improvements in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. In addition to muted credit, losses, our criticize assets and NPLs also improved sequentially. Nonperforming loans decreased 11% from the prior quarter with NPL inflows at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2019. Our balance sheet earnings power remained very strong. As a result, our robust CET1 ratio further improved to 10.5% this quarter. Our CET1 target remains at 9.5%. As we have stated many times before, we are focused on deploying capital for organic growth opportunities, evaluating nonbank opportunities where it fits our strategy, and share repurchases. Based on our current dividend and trailing four quarters of net income, we have the capacity to repurchase shares up to $347 million in the second quarter. After that, we have more flexibility in terms of how and when returning capital to shareholders under the SCD framework. Jamie will provide more details on our capital plan. The improved macroeconomic data and outlook are aligned with our strongest overall commercial loan production since before the pandemic. Furthermore, we have seen our pipeline strengthened considerably over the past 90 days with significant strength in manufacturing, renewables, healthcare and technology, partially offset by new demand in leisure and hospitality and CRE. Production was offset by elevated payoffs and pay downs combined with another 1% decline in line utilization. We retained the customer and their core banking relationship as virtually none of our commercial payoffs during the quarter were the result of client attrition. Additionally, pay downs on our corporate bank larger reflected clients tapping the capital markets, where we benefited significantly from additional capital market fees. Given the strong production trends, firming pipeline and retention of the client relationship, we remain well positioned to take advantage of a more favorable economic backdrop to clients execute their growth plans in the second half of 2021. We will continue to assess the implications of client supply chain constraints as we progress through the year. Consumer employment, savings and spend trends also remained favorable, given the fiscal stimulus, pumped demand and a gradual reopening of the economy throughout our footprint. Despite the overall economic recovery over the past several quarters, I recognize that not everyone in our society has benefited equally. This is why I'm very proud that in addition to producing strong financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities. I am particularly pleased that we exceeded our five-year $32 billion commitment to invest in low and moderate income communities by more than $9 billion. We also recently announced a $2.8 billion commitment in support of racial equality focused on lending, investing and financial accessibility. We also announced the new banking practice called Momentum Banking, which competes with the fintechs and is now our flagship mass market banking offering. Momentum Banking provides customers with liquidity solutions in our newly enhanced mobile app to help them avoid unnecessary fees, including immediate access to funds from digital deposits, short term on demand borrowing options, simple goal based savings targets, free customer access to their paycheck to two days earlier, with a qualified direct deposit starting in June, and no monthly service fees. In addition, we were honored to once again be named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere also reflecting our strong corporate culture, compliance program and ESG actions. We were one of just five banks globally to receive this accolade this year. We believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve as well in 2021 and beyond. We remain committed to generate sustainable long-term value for shareholders, anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a top regional bank. I would like to once again thank our employees. I am very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers in each other over the past year. You have enabled Fifth Third to continue to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities. With that I'll turn over to Jamie to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook. Jamie Leonard : Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. We generated strong returns this quarter, reflecting our solid operating performance and continued improvement in credit quality. We produced an adjusted ROE of 1.4% and an ROTCE excluding AOCI of 19.8%. PPNR results were also strong driven by strength in both NII and fees. Consequently, expenses were elevated relative to our previous guidance due to performance and market linked compensation expenses. We recorded a $244 million release to our credit reserves this quarter, which lowered our ACL ratio from 2.41% to 2.19%. Our historically low charge -offs which came in better than expected, combined with an improving economic outlook versus previous expectations resulted in a $173 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. Continuing with the income statement performance; net interest income declined just 1% sequentially due to the lower date count and a reduction in prepayment penalties received in the securities portfolio compared to the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by the impact of $2.1 billion in government guaranteed residential mortgage forbearance loans purchased from a third party servicer in December and another $600 million in March. We have continued to take action to prudently deploy excess liquidity in order to improve our NII trajectory for 2021. And these loans provided a more attractive risk adjusted return relative to other alternatives. Our first quarter NII results also included approximately $12 million in incremental PPP fees reflecting loan forgiveness, compared to the fourth quarter. Additionally, as we discussed previously, our prior quarter NII results included prepayment penalty income for our investment portfolio, which declined $10 million sequentially. From a liability management perspective, we reduced our interest bearing core deposit costs, another two basis points this quarter, resulting in a cost of only six basis points. Reported NIM increased four basis points sequentially, reflecting a decline in excess cash incremental PPP forgiveness fees and day count, partially offset by the aforementioned securities prepayment penalty income decline. Underlying NIM excluding PPP and excess cash decreased just four basis points to 310 basis points. With a top quartile margin relative to peers and asset sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion in excess liquidity, we believe that we remain well positioned for a higher rate environment while also benefiting from structural protection against lower rates given our securities and hedge portfolios.  Additionally, we have updated our interest rate risk disclosures to reflect a 38% deposit beta to better align with our future expectations based on the last rate hike cycle experience. In a plus 100 basis points scenario where we invest about 1/3 of our excess liquidity over a 12 month period, we would expect annual NII to be about 15% higher compared to a static rate environment. Total reported noninterest income decreased 5%. Adjusted noninterest income excluding the TRA impact increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Our fee performance reflected strength throughout our lines of business, including record commercial banking fees led by robust debt capital markets revenue, mortgage banking revenue driven by strong production, and strong leasing business revenue.  Top line mortgage banking revenue increased $42 million sequentially, reflecting improved execution and strong production in both retail and correspondent which was partially offset by incremental margin pressure. Also, as we discussed in January, our fourth quarter results included a $12 million headwind from our decision to retain a portion of our retail production. Mortgage servicing fees of $59 million and MSR net valuation gains of $18 million were more than offset by asset decay of $81 million. If primary mortgage rates were to move higher, we would expect to see some servicing revenue improvement which would likely be more than offset by production and margin pressures in that environment. As a result, we currently expect full year mortgage revenue to decline low to mid single digits given our rate outlook. Reported noninterest expenses decreased 2% relative to the fourth quarter. Adjusted expenses were up 3% driven by seasonal items in the first quarter in addition to elevated compensation related expenses linked to strong fee performance, as well as the mark-to-market impact on nonqualified deferred comp plans. Current quarter expenses included $10 million in servicing expenses from our purchase loan portfolios. For the full year, we expect to incur $50 million to $55 million in servicing expenses for purchase loans, including the impact of an additional $1 billion in forbearance pool purchases in April. Moving to the balance sheet; total average loans and leases were flat sequentially. C&I results continued to reflect stronger production levels offset by pay downs. Additionally, revolver utilization rates decreased another 1% this quarter to a record low 31% due to the extraordinary levels of market liquidity and robust capital markets. The sequential decline in utilization came primarily from COVID High Impact industries and our energy vertical. Also, our leverage loan outstandings declined more than 10% sequentially. As Greg mentioned, we are encouraged by the fact that we are retaining customer relationships throughout this environment and are benefiting from the fee opportunities. Average CRE loans were flat sequentially with end of period balances up 2% reflecting draw amounts on prior commitments which were paused during the pandemic. Average total consumer loans were flat sequentially as continued strength in the auto portfolio was offset by declines in home equity, credit card and residential mortgage balances. Auto production in the quarter was strong at $2.2 billion with an average FICO score around 780 with lower advanced rates, higher internal credit scores and better spreads compared to last year. Our securities portfolio increased approximately 1% this quarter as we opportunistically pre invested expected second quarter cash flows of approximately $1 billion during March. With respect to broader securities portfolio positioning, we remain patient, but we will continue to be opportunistic as the environment evolves. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to increase our cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point range. We are optimistic that strong economic growth in the second half of 2021 will present more attractive risk return opportunities. We continue to feel very good about our investment portfolio positioning with 57% of the investment portfolio invested in bullet and locked out cash flows at quarter end. Our securities portfolio had $2 million of net discount accretion in the first quarter and our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained strong at $2.4 billion pretax. Average other short term investments which includes interest bearing cash decreased $2 billion sequentially and increase $30 billion compared to the year ago quarter. The unprecedented excess cash levels are the result of record deposit growth over the past year. Core deposits were flat compared to the fourth quarter as growth in consumer transaction deposits impacted by the fiscal stimulus was offset by seasonal declines in commercial transaction deposits, and a reduction in consumer CD balances. We are experiencing strong deposit growth so far in April and expect low single digit growth in the second quarter from both consumer and commercial customers. Moving to credit. Our overall credit quality continues to reflect our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting, prudent management of our balance sheet exposures, and the continued improvement of the macroeconomic environment. The first quarter net charge-off ratio of 27 basis points improved 16 basis points sequentially. Nonperforming assets declined $81 million, or 9%, with the resulting NPA ratio of 72 basis points, declining seven basis points sequentially. Also, our criticized assets declined 8% with considerable improvements in casinos, restaurants and leisure travel, as well as in our energy and leverage loan portfolios, partially offset by continued pressure in commercial real estate particularly central business district hotels. Our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes the labor market continues to improve with unemployment reaching 5% by the middle of next year, and ending our three year RNS period in this low 4% range. As a result, this scenario assumes most of the labor market disruption created by the pandemic and resulting government programs is resolved by 2024, but still leaves a persistent employment gap of a few million jobs compared to pre COVID expectations. Additionally, our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from the administration's recent fiscal stimulus and assumes an infrastructure package over a $1 trillion is passed this year. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and down side scenarios, applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $169 million released to our reserve.  Conversely, applying 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $788 million bill, inclusive of the impact of approximately $109 million and remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.29%. Additionally, excluding the $5 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserves, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.4%. With the recent economic recovery and our base case expectations point to further improvement, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out given the uncertain environment. Like all of you, we continue to closely watch COVID case and vaccination trends, which could impact the timing of reopening of local economies and reverse the strengthening consumer confidence trends. Our March 31 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the impact of improving economic growth, lower unemployment and improving credit quality, including the expected benefits of government programs. Moving to capital; our capital remains strong during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio grew during the quarter ending at 10.5% above our stated target of 9.5%, which amounts to approximately $1.4 billion of excess capital. Our tangible book value per share excluding AOCI is up 8% since the year ago quarter. During the quarter, we completed $180 million in buybacks, which reduced our share count by approximately 5 million shares compared to the fourth quarter. As Greg mentioned, we have the capacity to repurchase up to $347 million in the second quarter based on our current dividend and the Federal Reserve's average trailing four quarters of net income framework. As a category four bank, we expect to have additional flexibility with respect to capital distributions starting in the third quarter. As prudent stewards of capital we expect to get closer to our CET1 target by mid-2022. While we did not participate in CCAR 2021, we are required to submit our board approved capital plan to the Fed. Those plans support the potential to raise our dividend in the third quarter and repurchase over $800 million in the second half of 2021. Moving to our current outlook; for the full year, we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up a bit compared to last year reflecting relative stability in commercial combined with low single digit growth in consumer, which includes the additional $1 billion in Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases in April. We continue to expect CRE to remain stable in this environment. Our loan outlook assumes commercial revolver utilization rates migrate closer to 33% by year end, and also includes the impact of $2 billion in loan balances we expect to add from the latest round of PPP, including the $1.7 billion we've generated to date, which will continue to be offset by forgiveness throughout the year. We expect our underlying NIM to be in the 305 area for the full year. Combined with our loan outlook, we expect NII to decline just 1% this year, assuming stable securities balances. On a sequential basis, we expect NII to be stable to up 1%. Within our NII guidance, we assume we generate approximately $150 million in PPP related interest income in 2021, of which $53 million was realized in the first quarter compared to $100 million in the full year of 2020. We expect full year fees to increase 4% to 5% compared to 2020, or 5% to 6% excluding the impact of the TRA. Improvement from our previous guide reflects a more robust economic rebound as well as our continued success taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger processing revenue, capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue, which will be partially offset by mortgage.  We expect second quarter fees to decline 3% to 5% reflecting lower mortgage and leasing revenues, partially offset by low single digit growth in card and processing and treasury management revenue. We expect relatively stable commercial banking revenues sequentially. Given both our stronger fee and NII outlook combined with the servicing costs from the loan portfolio purchases, we expect full year expenses to be up 1% driven by volume based compensation and other expenses. On a sequential basis, we expect expenses to decline 5% to 7%. We expect to generate positive operating leverage in the second half of 2021 reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee based businesses, and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be in the 30 to 40 basis point range given the strong first quarter performance, and assuming our base case scenario continues to play out. Second quarter losses are likely to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range. In summary, our first quarter results were strong and continued to demonstrate the progress we made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of discipline client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us very well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Before we start Q&A as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. Operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first response is from Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. BillCarcache: Thank you and good morning. I wanted to ask about your investments specifically in the southeast. You're obviously managing expenses for the revenue environment. But can you talk about the priorities with the investment dollars were allocated to the southeast? Where are those investments being made? And have we started to see the returns from those investments come through already in loan growth NII and fee trends that we saw this quarter? Just a little bit more color on the return timeline would be helpful. GregCarmichael: Fantastic. This is Greg, first of all, thanks for the question. Listen, we continue to be bullish on our investments and our strength and our southeast markets. To remind you, these are markets we're already in. That we have a presence, it's really about being a better provider of products and services in those markets and really taking advantage of the opportunities this market create for us. We couldn't be more pleased to date with the progress we've seen in that market, especially if you look at household growth, new customer acquisition, strength of our commercial businesses, and those in the southeast markets. So the progress we made to date, we're going to continue to invest in those markets, as it makes sense. From other investment perspective, obviously, we balance our investments for the greatest return for our shareholders. But right now, we think the southeast is still a good place for us to continue to invest until we get to the scale and take advantage of the opportunities that are out there. And, Tim, you may want to add a few things on the progress. TimSpence: Yes. So good question. Just to add to what Greg said, when we announced the build out of the de novo strategy in the markets in the southeast, we announced that we were going to build about 120 branches only about 30 of those have come online. But those 30 branches collectively are contributing almost 10% of our new household production this year. So we're seeing some benefit there. But a lot still to come as we add another 30 plus branches in the southeast this year and another 35 next year. On the commercial banking and wealth management side of the equation, I think we've talked in the past about the additions we have made in the southeast on the fee income side of the business; both Coker Capital and HTC are headquartered down there and have strong southeast presences. But we also talked about adding 30 additional middle market bankers to the southeast. And only about seven of those positions were filled in the first quarter with another 10 offers outstanding. So very clearly those benefits are not yet in the run rate. But we've been very pleased with the quality and talent that we are able to attract. We expect that to continue to further accelerate the shift in the business mix between the Midwest and the southeast markets. BillCarcache: That's really helpful. Thank you. As a follow up, can you speak to your asset sensitivity and any plans to alter it from here and then maybe just discuss how you're thinking about the potential for layering any swaps from where we are currently? JamieLeonard: Yes, it's Jamie. Thanks for the question. We did, as I said in our prepared remarks, update our asset sensitivity disclosures to, I think be a little more transparent and give you our views of how we see the next rate hike cycle playing out. So we did change our deposit betas from 70% down to 38%. So with that in mind, obviously that reflects a very asset sensitive balance sheet as you can see in the disclosures, and how we look at it right now is that given our view on the economy, we believe there's still momentum and bias for higher rates, as 2021 plays out, and even 2022, so for us we can afford to be patient. And fortunately our investment portfolio is running off at a pretty slow pace, the hedges aren't running off at all, we still have two and a half more years before, we have that headwind. So we're really not forced into trades today that would sacrifice future NII levels just to make income now. So I think we'll continue to be patient, we'll be opportunistic, but we would certainly like to see entry points a little bit better. And our focus would be more on just extension of protection, as opposed to laying on net new notional amounts to where we are today. Operator : Your next response is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. GerardCassidy: Thank you. Good morning. How are you guys? Jamie can you share with us and may be Greg too. We all have seen in the banking industry, and you guys certainly are showing it as well, this incredible deposit growth year-over-year, and clearly the quantitative easing from the Fed is a major contributor to the industry's deposit growth, as well as the deficit spending by the US government. Obviously, you're not a wholesale bank, like some of our money center banks that might be gathering some of these deposits from this quantitative easing. Can you share with us where is the, or kind of give us a timeline or a trail of where is this deposit growth coming from in terms of via customer base, and what's going to eventually bring it down so that your short-term investments will eventually be utilized by your customers basically drawing down those deposits? JamieLeonard: Thanks Gerard. Great question and a difficult to answer. But I'll start with the easy parts. In terms of where our deposit growth has come from, we're up 27% year-over-year $30 plus billion, 70% of that has come from our commercial customer base, and 30% has come out of the consumer book. In terms of the consumer book, the growth has really driven, as we've talked about the 3% household growth, but also just the consumers deleveraging. And when you slice the consumer deposit book, just March over March, average DDA and IVTs per account are up about 30%, savings are up 15%. So we're seeing that consumer behavior being a little more conservative plus the additional stimulus and all the other liquidity programs available are just adding significant balances to these consumer accounts. I think that will come down as consumer spending picks up and we should expect that excess liquidity of about $2,000 per account start to wane in the back half of the year. But for the second quarter, we do expect consumer deposit growth to continue. We've seen that with the stimulus payments, with tax refunds. And so we see a portion of that excess liquidity being applied to paying down unsecured loans but for the most part, sticking. From a commercial perspective, I think clients are just being more conservative, and I expect the commercial deposit balances, perhaps stick down a little bit slower in over a period of years as folks, while we see strong pipelines and encouragement for loan growth, I think corporations will can hold a little bit extra liquidity given what we've just been through. And so I think you might see the ability to grow loans without really seeing a lot of runoff in the commercial deposits. But I think consumer spending will drive a decline in the consumer book, perhaps sooner than commercial. GerardCassidy: Very good. I know you gave us some good color Jamie on the loan loss reserves relative to loans and credit quality for you and your peers has been extraordinarily good through a cycle that was pretty dramatic as we all know. What do you think and I know it's a moving target with CECL, but what do you think about getting the reserves down to that day one CECL level in January of 2020. What would it take and how long would it take for, do you think for you guys to bring it down to that level? JamieLeonard: So our day one reserves were 182 basis points, and on an apples-to-apples basis today, if you exclude PPP, let's call it a 230 level. So when you look at our process at the end of each quarter, we have a robust process that estimate fee allowance based on the credit risk in the portfolio. And that's driven by the economic forecasts over the three year reasonable and supportable horizon that we use. So while we feel very positive about our credit performance to date, through the pandemic, there are still segments of the economy and our loan book that have not returned to those pre pandemic levels of health. So we do think full normalization will take time and will not occur over a period of just a few quarters. And I guess the answer, the heart of your question, to get back to those adoption level reserve rates, we would need to see a sustained strengthening in the credit characteristics of those borrowers that are most at risk for the longer term negative impacts from the pandemic in concert with improving economic forecasts, and most importantly, those forecasts need to improve above our current expectations. So I think it will take some time. Operator : Your next response is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. MikeMayo: Hi. Can you size the level of your investments? You expect positive operating leverage in the second half of the year; this must be taking some sort of a toll. And I guess we've heard a lot of investments, you have the southeast expansion where you're opening 70 branches, that's one category. Second category would be other expansion markets like Texas and California. And the third category would be the loan process automation. So when you add it all up what sort of impact does this have when do these investments peak? If you think of J curve as investing and hurting your profits, then improving later when you get to that inflection point. JamieLeonard: Yes, Mike, it's Jamie, thanks for the question. It really, when you look at our expense outlook for the year, yes, as you mentioned, we do expect the operating cost, cost of operating leverage second half of the year, the second quarter of 2021 is probably going to be the highest year-over-year growth rate on expenses. And the IT investments will be year-over-year up double digits; we expect marketing to accelerate in the second quarter. And then we have the investments from the loan servicing costs for some of the loan pool purchases. So really, when we look out at the expense guide, each quarter should be better and better in terms of expenses. Whereas NII grows we're at the trough now, NII should grow every quarter. And then as we talked about before fees from the second quarter trough should then build throughout the rest of the year. So that's how we see the year playing out. Obviously, we've got some flexibility to change that expense progression, should it not play out and deliver that extra revenue. But that's really how we see the year playing out. MikeMayo: And just a separate question for the southeast expansion strategy. What is the end game? In terms of where do you want to be in terms of market share where you are today? Or other metrics that you're monitoring? GregCarmichael: Now, my guess is, this is Greg, I mean, listen, as we said many times before, we like the southeast markets for all the reasons you would expect. It's also been one of our strongest performing, the strongest performing sector of our business. So on the retail side, and on the commercial side, and on the wealth side, so it's really been a strong performance for us. So for the end game we want to be just call it top five banks end up of market from a deposit perspective, will be objective of ours. That's pretty much what we search for, we think that makes us relevant allows us to serve the community the best. So top five retail deposits that we're thinking about it. And then from a banker perspective on the commercial side, just making sure we have the talent in the market to take advantage of the opportunities down there that are presented to us. So that's kind of what we're focused on. Tim, anything you want to add to that? TimSpence: No, I think that's right. We're a little bit unique. If you look at the southeast footprint and the most of the growth in the southeast is happening on the Atlantic coast side in the Mid Atlantic and then on both sides in Florida, and we really have a metro market strategy down there. So the focus is on places like Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, Nashville, Naples, Tampa, the high growth mid-size markets and as Greg said, top five in those markets would get you to call it 8% to 10% market share in those stated metro areas as opposed to, including the micropolitan markets elsewhere in the state. Operator : The next response is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. KenUsdin: Thanks. Good morning. Just to follow up on the Ginnie Mae and the mortgage banking businesses. Do you still see room to find and repurchase more of those Ginnie Mae buyouts? And you mentioned on the mortgage side that you're retaining a little bit more of your production? Can you give us an understanding of how much of that production you're now planning to retain? And then and how much that's changed over time? Thanks. JamieLeonard: Yes, thanks, Ken. In terms of the Ginnie Mae pools, they're becoming more and more difficult to locate, I think, as everybody's been executing on that play for their own portfolio. And, as we talked about, we bought back our $750 million in the third quarter of 2020. So that combined with the fact that we're over $3 billion of product now, I think that's a healthy and appropriate allocation for our balance sheet. So I'm not looking to add more there. In terms of the mortgage retention, we did retain in the fourth quarter, a $0.25 billion or so of our retail production. This quarter, we did not elect to retain anything that was saleable. So we're currently selling everything that is saleable, and then retaining jumbo nonconforming and other items. So I think that's in that for now would be our intention for the rest of this year. KenUsdin: Okay. And Jamie, one follow up on mortgage, you guys have been taking long -- a little bit longer to get kind of the pipeline through and we saw the originations up, can you just give us a an update there on just your outlook for origination volumes? And have you kind of gotten that to the right spot in terms of you being able to get the production through and in terms of that opportunity set? Thanks. JamieLeonard: Yes, for as disappointing as the fourth quarter was in mortgage, the first quarter was just as exciting. So, we feel very good about how the team performed, the first quarter was very strong. And we've got the trains running on time and everything is in a good spot, as you can tell from the first quarter results. So, in terms of the outlook for the year, we expect the mortgage originations to be up a bit, call it mid-single digits, second quarter volumes, mid-single digits. But the headwind is going to be margin compression.  So, while we transition to more of a purchase environment here over the summer months, volumes should be strong, margins will compress. And then as those prepayments refi slow down, we expect to see a little bit of a lift in the servicing portfolio. So it's less of a headwind and perhaps even a positive in the back half of the year. But net-net, I think on a year-over-year basis, we're looking at a slight decline in both top line and bottom line, mortgage fees. Operator : Your next response is from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. KenZerbe: I apologize. I was on mute. In terms of getting to the 9.5% CET1 target, how much of that comes from being at the very high end of your allowable stock buybacks like $800 million in the back half of the year versus balance sheet growth later in the year. JamieLeonard: The balance sheet growth is fairly stable in terms I guess of the year-over-year, we do have, I guess the dynamic of C&I growth, but PPP pay downs but I don't see the balance sheet at least in 2021 being that big of a driver. I guess there's a nine basis points of erosion with the CECL transition that kicks in in the first quarter of 2022. But overall, our income levels are more than sufficient to cover the balance sheet growth. So the real benefit for us is just buying back the $347 million in the second quarter and then $800 million or more in the back half of the year to try to bring that down to 9.5% by mid-year 2022. That's our goal and then also has a dividend increase here in the third quarter. KenZerbe: Got it. Okay, perfect. And then just as a follow up in terms of your net charge-offs guidance, I think you're 27 basis points this quarter. Your guidance for next quarter is sort of call it maybe 30 basis points at the midpoint. But your full year guidance is the 30 to 40 basis points. Are you implying that second half should see noticeably higher charge offs? Or is that just being more conservative? GregCarmichael: Yes, I think it's an element of conservatism given the uncertainty in the environment, we certainly could experience charge-offs at the very low end of that range. But at this point in time, I feel like it's prudent to guide to a 30 to 40 basis point range. Operator : Your next response is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. MattO'Connor: Good morning. So to just ask a liquidity question a little bit different. You actually had a more modest increase in both deposits and the cash this quarter than what we were seeing for the overall industry. And just wondering how you'd reconcile that difference? JamieLeonard: Yes, it's really driven by our commercial clients. And in particular, our focus on retailers where you typically have seasonal run off in the first quarter of every year from elevated fourth quarter balances. I think on a year-over-year basis, our growth is certainly at the high end. And I think we've done a very nice job of capturing more than our fair share of the excess liquidity in the commercial book. And then obviously, the household growth on the consumer side has contributed. So, I feel good about how we're positioned from a deposit gathering perspective, and it's just more about when is the right time to start putting the money to work. MattO'Connor: Okay, and then, just separately, the incremental costs related to the mortgage servicing for the loans that you purchase. There's obviously a lot more revenue that you're getting than the $50 million of additional costs. But I guess I was a little surprised that there's that much incremental cost, that is if not more scalable, or is it a bit of a kind of more intensive product to service given the nature of the Ginnie Mae's? JamieLeonard: No, very good question. The answer is actually far simpler, which is we don't service the loans. And therefore, we pay a servicing fee. And that servicing fee is certainly on the high side, given the yield on the securities. And so it ends up being almost a 2% servicing fee paid to the servicer, but the flip side is you get more than that benefit, but it does show up in NII. So when you look at our expense guide, as diligent as we are and as focused as we are on expenses. At the end of the day, we did raise the expense guide to two points. Half of that is from the volume related compensation expense and fee growth and then half is from these additional loan servicing costs that are more than offset by the improvement in NII. MattO'Connor: And what's the related pickup in revenue that you get from those loans? Or the yield, if you up at percent? JamieLeonard: Yes, high 3% yield. MattO'Connor: Okay. JamieLeonard: And then there's additional fee income that comes as the loans are resold. So all in it's an ROA of roughly 2%, which is very attractive in this environment, and certainly better than just buying MBS in the portfolio. Operator : Your next response is from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. ScottSiefers: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just I guess when we talk about the line utilization, improving potentially from 31%, up to 33% by the end of the year, maybe just a reminder of what you would consider sort of a typical number for you guys. And then just as the follow up, I'm not sure anyone has a great answer for it but maybe just best guesses or thoughts on why utilization isn't already improving, kind of broadly for the industry, given that we all have what seems like pretty good visibility into the likely trajectory of the economy, vaccination rates, et cetera. Just would be curious to hear your thoughts there. GregCarmichael: Scott, good question. This is Greg. I'll start it and maybe throw it back over to Tim, for some more color. And first off, we normalize line utilization for us going into the pandemic would have been 36%, 37% on average. So obviously with the pandemic, we saw a spike up the 40 plus percent, but think about normalized rates 36%, we're running about 31% right now. So hopefully second half the year is little stronger as we anticipate, look at our bonds up forecast. We can pick up another 2% lift. That's a stretch out there. But we think that's doable, given we're seeing in our pipelines. Just back up to 33%, which is still not the normalized level. You think about each 1% is about $750 million outstanding for us. So the impact of the 2% uplift by year end is less than 1% on total loan growth for 2021, given the ramp up throughout the year, so it's possible but once again, I think there's a lot of a variable out there, we're watching. But we are encouraged by the pipeline strength that we're seeing right now at our production levels, and commercial in the first quarter, we have pre pandemic level. So we're encouraged by that.  If you look at the pipeline are going forward and the forecast right now we will be about 30% up in production over 2020, but slightly below pre pandemic levels. And we're seeing good strength in manufacturing and healthcare, TMT and renewables right now. If you look at our markets, we're seeing some good progress, Indiana, Michigan, California, and the Carolinas would jump out as a source of strength from an asset perspective. So production is strong, pipeline look good. We're hopeful we'll see the second -- back half of this year and improvement in line utilization. And once again, there is a lot of liquidity out there. So it's something we're watching. TimSpence: I think just to add to what Greg said, I mean, Scott, we're asking the same question to ourselves, right, in terms of what the visibility we have into the economy and some of the signals we're seeing about a pickup and inflation and input costs. I have the chance since the beginning of the year to be out in 12, of our 15 different regions, and to spend time with clients there. So we've been asking that question. And what we're hearing from them primarily are either supply chain disruptions. Some of that, obviously, is the some of the global dynamics that we have talked about whether it was stuck in the canal, or shortages in semiconductors, but it also is just -- get access to materials. And then on the other side of the equation, labor shortages, in particular as it relates to the skilled trades. And the byproduct of that is we're not seeing the inventory building that you might otherwise expect to see yet. So we're watching inventory levels closely. We're watching the IFM Index closely as leading indicators to when we may see a pickup in utilization. I think one positive note which is reflected in the results in the first quarter is we are seeing increased demand on the equipment side of the business. And that is encouraging because that obviously would be the other precondition to an expansion. Operator : And your last question is from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. ErikaNajarian: Hey, good morning. My first question is for Jamie. Jamie, thank you so much for slide 5. I love it. Most investors have started to talk about normalized ROTCE as they think about valuing banks with a two to three year forward look and even though you deployed some excess liquidity what stunning and how significant it still is relative to 4Q, 2019. And as investors contemplate what normalized returns are for Fifth Third, where do short term investments normalize to? JamieLeonard: So your question, are you from a total return perspective, ROTCE? Or are you just asking on what do we do? How much excess cash do we end up holding? ErikaNajarian: Yes, so do you ever go back to $3 billion or we redefine what excess liquidity is for you guys? JamieLeonard: Yes, because we've, obviously, we debate daily, when is the right time to put the money to work? And how do we see the environment playing out? Right now, I think the easiest way to consider the excess liquidity would be a third of it runs off a third of it we'd love to invest in organic loan growth, and a third of it ultimately gets invested in the investment portfolio. And so in terms of what that return profile looks like, with regard to the investment portfolio. We want to wait for the right time to put the money to work. But when we do put it to work we're at 18% right now as securities as a percent of total assets. We're comfortable running that number at 23% or so. So that means about $10 billion or so of that additional liquidity we would deploy into the investment portfolio over a period of time. ErikaNajarian: Got it. And just one last question on Momentum Banking, how should we think about how Momentum Banking can potential impact long-term consumer deposit growth versus whether or not that renormalize service charges on deposits lower. TimSpence: Sure, Erika, it's Tim. Good question. So I think we are very focused. Our strategy, as I think we've discussed quite frequently as a primary relationship strategy. It's a focus on primary banking. It's a focus on being the place where you get paid on where you pay your bills, and how you build up liquidity. And the byproduct of that, obviously, as Jamie mentioned earlier, is we did see really positive trends on the consumer side of the business because the liquidity that consumers have built up really is in the transaction accounts as opposed to somewhere else. So our deposit growth on the consumer side has been underpinned by call it 2% to 3% household growth over a period of several years now. We would like to continue to bump that number up. And we think that the Momentum Banking products coupled with the expansion in the southeast gives us a path to doing that, in terms of the overall household growth rates that we experienced, which will support noninterest bearing deposit growth. I think on the other side of the equation, yes, when somebody elects to use a short-term liquidity product, take our early access product, the deposit advanced product that we've had in the market for several years now, that is a lower cost way to cover cash flow shortfall than an overdraft fee. But it's also a very sustainable way. And owing to the fact that we have had those products in our product set for several years now, our overdraft charges as a percentage of total consumer deposits are lower than all but one of the large, US banks already. So I think from our perspective, we're giving the consumer the widest possible range of options to avoid fees. We're getting the benefit of that in the form of household growth, and of primacy, which is the entry point for us to the broadest range of products and services that we offer. And because of our position on the overdraft side of the equation and the low reliance on that feeling we have left to give up there and we're going to be able to outgrow any sort of an impact on the fees per household measure. Operator : Thank you. There are no further responses at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Chris Doll. Chris Doll : Thank you all for your interest Fifth Third. If you have any follow up questions, please contact the IR department and we will be happy to assist you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Chris Doll : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we will be discussing our financial results for the second quarter of 2021. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, as well as information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I'm joined by our CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Jamie Leonard; President, Tim Spence; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Jamie, we will open the call for questions. Let me turn the call over to Greg now for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported second quarter net income of $709 million or $0.94 per share. On an adjusted basis, we earned $0.98 per share. Once again, our financial results were very strong, continuing the positive momentum from the past several quarters. During the quarter, we generated sequential PPNR growth of 15% on an adjusted basis, a growth of 6% compared to the year-ago quarter. Commercial loan production increased 10% from last quarter, with strength in middle-market across our footprint, as well as in corporate banking. We generated strong consumer household growth of 4% compared to last year, and we also experienced historically low net charge-offs of 16 basis points, reflecting improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. We generated an adjusted ROTCE of nearly 20% for the second consecutive quarter, reflecting strong business and credit results across the franchise. Our results were supported by our continued improvement in our diversified businesses. In fact, we achieved record results in several of our fee-based businesses, including commercial banking and wealth and asset management. Despite continued pressure from low interest rates, net interest income increased 3% sequentially and the underlying NIM increased 2 basis points. We believe that our disciplined approach to managing the balance sheet, including our securities and hedge portfolios, will continue to generate differentiated performance relative to peers. We also continue to maintain our expense discipline, while still investing for long-term outperformance. As a result of our strong revenue growth combined with our expense management, we generated positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis with an adjusted efficiency ratio of 58%. We are prioritizing investments to drive further operational efficiencies to improve our resiliency, generate household growth, and improve the customer experience. To that end, we recently announced and expanded partnership with FIS to modernize our core deposit and wealth systems to the cloud, which will enable us to further our digital transformation. This will significantly improve the flexibility and scalability of our technology infrastructure and accelerate us in the market. Combining this agreement with the renegotiation of our existing payment processing relationship allows us to modernize our platforms, while maintaining an efficient overall cost structure. From a commercial standpoint, loan production this quarter was the highest since before the pandemic, with significant sequential improvement in technology, renewable energy, and manufacturing. However, our strong production was once again offset by elevated pay downs and PPP forgiveness. While we continue to retain the customer and their core banking relationship, loan growth remains muted due to the environment. Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines, and retention of the client relationship, all continue to support the potential for improved loan growth once supply and labor constraints normalize. We currently expect our 31% commercial revolver utilization rate to increase 1% by year-end. On the consumer side, as I mentioned, we once again generated robust household growth. This strong performance reflects our ability to acquire new customers, combined with low attrition, both of which were supported by our branch and digital investments. Our recent Southeast de novo branches have helped contribute to our household growth. On the digital side, we continue to leverage technology and data analytics to deliver solutions that improve the customer experience, increase revenue, and drive efficiencies. We recently launched Fifth Third Momentum Banking across our footprint, a banking value proposition unparalleled in our industry. Momentum combines the best of a traditional bank offering with several leading fintech capabilities, including Early Pay, which gives customers free access to their paycheck up to two days early; Extra Time, which allows customers to cure an overdraft until midnight the following business day without a fee; MyAdvance, which gives customers short-term on-demand liquidity advances, smart savings, and other features, all provided with no monthly fee. Our strategy to keep the customer at the center has significantly reduced our reliance on punitive consumer deposit fees, including overdrafts and ATM fees, where Fifth Third has been among the lowest compared to peers for several years. Fifth Third Momentum Banking has put efforts to help customers avoid unnecessary fees. As I mentioned, during the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses, reflecting historically low net charge-offs, combined with a stronger economic outlook. Our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs. In addition to historically low credit losses, our criticized assets and NPAs once again improved this quarter. Criticized assets declined another 16% and our NPA ratio declined 11 basis points sequentially. Our balance sheet and earnings power remain very strong. Our CET1 ratio of 10.4% was relatively stable compared to last quarter, despite share repurchases of $347 million in the second quarter. As we have said before, we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic non-bank opportunities, dividend increases, and share repurchases. Additionally, our capital position and earnings capacity support an increase in our common dividend, starting in the third quarter. We currently expect to request a $0.03 increase to our quarterly dividend in September, subject to Board approval and economic conditions. We also expect to execute share repurchases totaling approximately $850 million in the second half of 2021, and continue to target a 9.5% CET1 by June 2022. We recently announced the strategic acquisition of Provide, a fintech healthcare practice finance firm. Provide focuses on the dental, veterinarian, and vision segments and delivers digital capabilities, which support a best-in-class experience and speed to close. Provide previously utilized an originate to sell model. As a result, the closing of the acquisition will not include a transfer of loan balances. However, post close, Fifth will retain all loan originations. We currently hold around $400 million in loans generated by Provide and have non-credit relationships with over 70% of these borrowers through deposit in our treasury management products. The acquisition is expected to close in early August and will utilize approximately 20 basis points of capital. In summary, we believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues, and continued focus on discipline throughout the company will serve us well this year and beyond. We remain committed to generating sustainable long-term value and consistently producing top-quartile results. I once again like to thank our employees. I'm very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers. Our commitment to generate sustainable value for stakeholders is evident in our second annual ESG report published in June. This expands our last year's report with increased transparency, including enhanced disclosures of priority topics such as inclusion and diversity, our climate strategy, and our commitment to fair and responsible banking. We remain guided by our purpose, vision, and core values and expect to continue delivering strong results over the long term. With that, I will turn it over to Jamie to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook. Jamie Leonard : Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. We are very pleased with the financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit. The reported results for the quarter included a $37 million reduction in fee income for the negative mark related to the Visa total return swap. Our improved business performance throughout the bank resulted in strong return metrics. We produced an adjusted ROA of 1.43% and an adjusted ROTCE, excluding AOCI, of 19.7%. Our adjusted earnings per share were a record for the Bancorp. We generated healthy PPNR results, the strongest since before the pandemic, with net interest income growing 3% sequentially, continued success growing and diversifying non-interest income, and diligent expense management. Improvements in credit quality this quarter resulted in a $159 million release to our credit reserve, resulting in an ACL ratio of 206 basis points compared to 219 basis points last quarter. With historically low charge-offs of just 16 basis points this quarter and an improved economic outlook, we recorded a $115 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement, net interest income increased $32 million sequentially, reflecting our ability to effectively manage the balance sheet despite the environmental headwinds from low-interest rates and elevated paydowns, given capital market conditions. Our NII growth was driven by average loan growth of 1% and $11 million of incremental prepayment penalty benefits from our bullet and locked-out cash flow strategy in our investment portfolio, which that position remains a 58% at quarter-end. Our loan balances benefited from the additional $1 billion of Ginnie Mae forbearance loan buyout purchases in early April, bringing the total third-party purchases to $3.7 billion. The other NII benefits were from a higher day count and not replacing long-term debt maturities, partially offset by the impact of declining average commercial loan balances and lower loan yields. PPP related interest income was $53 million this quarter, unchanged relative to the prior quarter. On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs by another basis point this quarter to 5 basis points and also have maturities of approximately $2.3 billion of long-term debt. With most deposit products at or near their assumed floors, the remaining liability management benefits going forward will likely be limited to CDs and reductions in long-term debt balances due to maturities. Reported NIM increased 1 basis point compared to the prior quarter, as the aforementioned investment portfolio, long-term debt, and Ginnie Mae loan buyout impacts were partially offset by the decline in commercial loan balances and lower loan yields. Underlying NIM, excluding PPP and excess cash, increased 2 basis points to 312 basis points. With a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion in excess liquidity, we continue to be well positioned to benefit when interest rates rise, while also remaining well hedged if rates remain low, given our securities portfolio and derivatives. Total reported non-interest income decreased just 1% sequentially. Adjusted non-interest income increased 1%, driven by record commercial banking revenue, with strength in loan syndications and financial risk management products, solid card and processing revenue from higher credit and debit interchange revenue reflecting the robust economic rebound, and an increase in both commercial and consumer deposit fees. These increases were partially offset by sequential declines in mortgage and lease syndications. Top line mortgage banking revenue decreased $8 million sequentially, reflecting incremental margin pressure. Production was strong during the quarter in both the retail and correspondent channels, with second quarter originations of $5 billion, up 7% sequentially. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted non-interest income increased 15%, with strength in deposit service charges, commercial banking revenue, wealth and asset management, and card and processing revenue, reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business and the robust economic rebound over the past year. The performance and resilience of our fee income levels over the past several quarters highlight the benefit of the revenue diversification that we have achieved. Non-interest expense decreased 5% compared to the first quarter, reflecting declines in compensation and benefits expenses, lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiations, and disciplined expense management throughout the bank. This was partially offset by expenses linked to strong business performance, as well as servicing expenses associated with loan purchases, and a $12 million mark-to-market impact from our non-qualified deferred compensation plans, which had a corresponding offset in security gains. For the full year, we expect to incur around $50 million in third-party servicing expense for purchased loans. Our compensation-related expense growth this year continues to be proportionate to the success we are seeing in our fee-based businesses. On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted fees have increased 15% compared to 4% expense growth. Additionally, compared to the pre-pandemic levels of the second quarter of 2019, total adjusted fees have increased 14% compared to expense growth of just 3%. Moving to the balance sheet, total average loans and leases were up 1% sequentially, as consumer loan growth was partially offset by a decline in commercial loans. Additionally, period-end loans were up 1%, excluding PPP. Average total consumer loans increased 4%, as ongoing strength in the auto portfolio and the impact of Ginnie Mae loans purchased were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances, reflecting the continued impacts of government stimulus. Average commercial loans declined 1% compared to the prior quarter, largely driven by PPP forgiveness and elevated payoffs, which were partially offset by strong production across most of our verticals and throughout our middle market footprint. Production was up 10% compared to the prior quarter and up over 20% compared to the pre-pandemic levels of the second quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of PPP, our end of period C&I loans were up slightly sequentially, as client sentiment and business activities in several industries are showing signs of stabilization. Revolver utilization of 31% was flat compared to the prior quarter, reflecting the market liquidity and capital markets conditions. We are encouraged by the fact that we have successfully retained virtually all clients throughout the pandemic, which will enable us to further deepen and grow these relationships going forward. Average CRE loans were flat sequentially with end of period balances declining 3%. Our securities portfolio increased 1% this quarter. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows, but we'll remain patient on deploying the excess cash. We will continue to be opportunistic as the economic environment evolves. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to increase our cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point level. We remain optimistic that strong economic growth in the second half of 2021 and an eventual Fed tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive risk-return opportunities in the future. Average short-term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, remain elevated due to continued strength in core deposit balances, which have grown 10% year-over-year. We are seeing strength in both consumer and commercial deposits. Compared to the prior quarter, average core deposits increased 3%. About two-thirds of the balance growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis has come from consumer, reflecting continued fiscal and monetary stimulus and strong household growth. Moving to credit, our strong credit performance once again this quarter reflects our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and prudent balance sheet management, while also benefiting from continued fiscal and monetary stimulus and improvement in the broader economy. The second quarter net charge-off ratio of 16 basis points was historically low and improved 11 basis points sequentially. Non-performing assets declined 16% or $126 million. The NPA ratio declined 11 basis points sequentially to 61 basis points, which is comparable to the fourth quarter of 2019. Also, our criticized assets declined 16%, with significant improvements in retail non-essential, leisure and healthcare, as well as in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios. However, we continue to focus on non-owner occupied commercial real estate, particularly central business district hotels. Moving to the ACL, our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes that labor market continues to improve and job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4% by the first quarter of 2022 and ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Applying a 100% probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a $169 million reserve release. Conversely, applying 100% to the downside scenario would result in a $763 million build. Inclusive of the impact of approximately $108 million in remaining discount associated with the MB loan portfolio, our ACL ratio was 2.15%. Additionally, excluding the $3.7 billion in PPP loans with virtually no associated credit reserve, the ACL ratio would be approximately 2.22%. While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out, given the uncertain environment. We continue to monitor the COVID situation, which could still impact many businesses, particularly those we have identified as being in highly impacted industries, or reverse, the rising consumer confidence trends. Our June 30th allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment with lower unemployment and continued improving credit quality. Moving to capital, our capital levels remained strong in the second quarter. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 10.4%, which is $1.3 billion above our stated target of 9.5%. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 3% during the quarter. As a Category Four institution, Fifth Third was not subject to the latest Federal Reserve stress test and we did not opt-in. At the end of June, the Fed notified us that our FCB would be 2.5% effective July 1st, which is the floor under the regulatory capital rules. Without the floor, a buffer would have been approximately 2.1%. During the quarter, we completed $347 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by approximately 9 million shares compared to the first quarter. As Greg mentioned, we expect to repurchase approximately $850 million of shares in the second half of 2021, while also increasing our common dividend in September. We also announced our acquisition of Provide this quarter. We will utilize approximately 20 basis points of CET1 upon closing. This financially compelling acquisition of an asset generation engine dovetails perfectly with our existing strategic focus on digital enablement and generating profitable growth on our balance sheet. We believe in Provide's strong growth prospects. From an origination standpoint, they have produced $300 million in the first half of 2021, of which Fifth Third purchased approximately 80%. We expect second half originations to be around $400 million, and given the expected early August closing, virtually all of that will go on our balance sheet. We expect over $1 billion in originations in 2022 and could grow to over $2 billion annually within a few years. Moving to our current outlook, for the full year, we expect average total loan balances to be stable compared to last year, reflecting continued pressure from PPP forgiveness and paydowns in commercial, combined with low double-digit growth in consumer. We continue to expect CRE balances to remain stable in this environment. We continue to expect our underlying NIM to be in the 305 basis point area for the full year. Combined with our loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% this year, assuming stable security balances and incorporating all PPP impacts. On a sequential basis, we expect NII to decline around 2%, given the impacts of the securities portfolio prepayment income we experienced in the second quarter that we do not assume will repeat in our outlook, as well as an assumed decline in PPP income. Within our NII guidance, we expect approximately $165 million in PPP related interest income for 2021, of which $106 million was realized in the first half of the year compared to $100 million in 2020 and approximately $50 million expected in 2022. For the third quarter of 2021, we expect approximately $40 million in PPP income. Therefore, excluding PPP impacts, we would expect third quarter NII to decline around 1% compared to the second quarter, or up over 2% from the third quarter of 2020. Given the continued strength throughout our businesses, we expect full year fees to increase 7% to 8% compared to 2020 or 8% to 9%, excluding the impact of the TRA. Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy, as well as our ongoing success taking market share as a result of our investments in talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger processing revenue, capital markets fees, and wealth and asset management revenue, which will be partially offset by mortgage declines. Additionally, as we discussed in January, we expect to generate private equity gains from several of our direct investments in venture capital funds throughout 2021, potentially exceeding the 2020 level of $75 million. We have recognized around $30 million in gains through the first half of 2021, which we expect to double in the second half of 2021. We expect third quarter total fees to be relatively stable from the second quarter, and would be up mid to high-single digits year-over-year. In the mortgage business, we expect revenue throughout the second half of the year to benefit from lower asset decay and higher servicing fees. The top-line revenue is expected to decline high single-digits year-over-year due to continued headwinds from margin compression. Our fee outlook does not incorporate a pre-tax gain of approximately $60 million associated with the sale of our HSA business that is expected to close in the third quarter. We do plan to redeploy half of that gain in the third quarter, split evenly between a $15 million donation to the Fifth Third Foundation that will complete our previously announced philanthropy commitment to accelerating racial equality and inclusion in our communities and a $15 million additional marketing program, supporting momentum given the upside potential we see in that product. We expect full-year expenses to be up 2% to 3%, given our strong revenue outlook and the continued servicing costs from the loan portfolio purchases, as well as the incremental expenses associated with the Provide acquisition. On a sequential basis, we expect expenses to be down 1%, excluding the redeployment of half of the HSA gain. As we recently discussed, we expect to consolidate 42 branches, primarily in our legacy Midwest footprint, which we expect to complete in early 2022. Additionally, we've opened five branches so far this year and plan to add approximately 25 more Southeast in market de novo branches in the second half of 2021. All run rate branch impacts are included in our outlook. We've generated year-over-year positive operating leverage this quarter and we expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage for the second half of 2021, reflecting our expense actions, our continued success growing our fee-based businesses, and our proactive balance sheet management. We expect total net charge-offs in 2021 to be 20 basis points to 25 basis points, given the strong first half performance and assuming our base case scenario continues to play out. Third quarter losses are likely to be in the 15 basis point to 20 basis point range. In summary, our second quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long-term performance horizon, which has served us well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks, Jamie. Before we start the Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. Operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Ken Zerbe : Now, you guys are doing a lot to make Fifth Third more consumer friendly, like Early Pay and Extra Time. If we expect that trend to continue, what's the total amount of fees or revenue that might be at risk as the broader industry really continues to wean itself off of consumer fees? Jamie Leonard : Yes, Ken, it's, Jamie. Thanks for the question. The one thing we are proud of at Fifth Third is how much we've reduced our exposure on the consumer side, from a unit a punitive fee standpoint and how we are, I would say, a very consumer-focused and consumer-friendly bank. I think 3% or so of our revenue was in consumer overdrafts and our peers are significantly higher than those levels. We expect to continue to improve upon that with the Momentum bank offering and some of the features that Greg talked about in his prepared remarks. So I think you can continue to expect that from us and that if we were to have any future changes on overdraft policies or fees would only be to the positive and that we would more than make up for it with the incremental volume from Momentum. I don't know, Tim, if there's anything else you want to add? Tim Spence : Yes. No, I just want to emphasize that. I mean, whenever you launch a new product, the trade-off you have to evaluate is what you think you can produce as it relates to total franchise growth relative to any sort of cannibalization, right? So the fact that we have been deliberate about driving revenue growth through value-added services as opposed to maintenance and punitive fees means that for us, we're going to get the benefit of the franchise growth and more households from Momentum with comparatively substantially less impact than any of our large competitors would have, to the extent that they would attempt to follow us here. Ken Zerbe : And then just maybe a second question. In terms of the Ginnie Mae buyouts, I think some of the other banks this quarter have mentioned they just didn't see the opportunity or they didn't have - or they couldn't find the opportunity relative to do a lot - the Ginnie Mae buyouts. But it feels like you guys got a fairly decent benefit from that this quarter. Was that - are you seeing the same trends or do you still see opportunity to continue that going forward? Jamie Leonard : Very good question actually, because what we've seen is that, given we were a first mover in this product and it's far back as the third quarter of 2020 when we bought our own pools and then helped structure these additional purchases that we've done, totaling $3.7 billion thus far to date, I would say that the economics were certainly more attractive if you were in the first mover stage, and the economics have really waned to the point that we would not be pursuing additional purchases at these levels. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask sort of a top level on sort of the eventuality of a commercial recovery. What's your best guess as to what that will look like for larger regionals like yourself? It's sort of unclear to the degree to which capital markets competition will abate if there are questions regarding the sustainability of the sort of the sugar high that consumers are on right now, meaning demand couldn't decrease - the further we go and then you've got all this excess liquidity that's getting worked through. So just curious to hear your top-level thoughts on what that recovery will ultimately look like in your eyes. Greg Carmichael : Well, let me start, then I'll forward to Jamie or Tim for additional color. First off, it's - right now, there's a lot of uncertainty out here right now as we're dealing with the labor shortage and the supply chain disruptions, which are extremely real and you see it across the Board in all conversation with our customers. But that said, we back to pretty much pre-pandemic global production numbers, but payoffs continue to be stout, and obviously you got something like PPP. So when you think about the environment in front of us, I think loan growth, as we continue to beat the challenge as we go through the rest of the year. I think we offset that by our strengths in our fee businesses, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, that compensate for some of those challenges, but I do think this changes over time [technical difficulty] every 1% to $750 million. So there's a lot of upside opportunity there. At some point, labor shortage and supply chain constraints start to abate, if we pick up the benefit of that. We also added about $2.4 million new commitments since the beginning of the year and continue to acquire new households in commercial relationships. We're very, very positive. As to what the future might hold, we've got some economic and some environmental challenges in front of us that we have to continue to deal with. Tim Spence : Yes. I think when we announced NorthStar, we talked about pivoting the return profile of the bank to be good through the cycle. A portion of the focus there was on business mix, right? It was about constructing a business portfolio that had balance. So in an environment where utilization is down like that now and where rates are low, we have fee businesses that are firing and are providing nice support, and some countercyclical businesses in particular on the consumer side, like autos and mortgages, which are doing very, very well. I think as some of the tailwind from those businesses abates, what you would expect to see is a benefit both, as Greg mentioned, relates to line utilization and ultimately some benefit from rates, which provides a lot of support for the through-the-cycle focus. Scott Siefers : Thank you for those thoughts. And then maybe just a thought on overall reserving levels. You guys still maintain a very high and conservative overall reserve. How are you sort of thinking about the steady state? Is it back to where we were CECL day 1 or just given the backdrop and what we've already gone through, can we blow through that a little bit on when you go lower than that? How do you think about those dynamics? Jamie Leonard : It's Jamie, I'll take that one. When you look at the quarter, with the ACL release of $159 million, we had that split fairly evenly between the consumer portfolio and the commercial portfolio, and the decline was essentially driven by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook versus the prior quarter. When you look ahead, we continue to overweight non-baseline scenarios at 20%. So the upside is 20%, the base is 60%, and the downside is 20%. And that's really driven by the uncertainty in the environment, including the vaccine efficacy and frankly this week's concerns highlight that risk. So when you look at the asymmetrical nature of the upside and downside scenarios, that weighting versus the 80%, 10%, 10% on CECL day 1 generates about a $90 million higher reserve. So I guess the first part to your fairly complicated question is that the scenario weightings do matter, and we expect to maintain the 60%, 20%, 20%, while this period of uncertainty continues to exist. And then relative to Day 1, it really is a tale of two portfolios. So when you look at the commercial side, to get back to those Day 1 adoption reserve rates, you really do need to see a sustained strengthening in the credit characteristics of the borrowers that are most at risk to the longer-term negative impacts from the pandemic. And so that would have to occur in conjunction with improving economic forecasts above our current expectations. But then when you look at the consumer side, we're actually already below the CECL day 1 level. We're at 1.99% at the end of the second quarter versus the 2.46% on CECL Day 1, and that's driven by the combination of the loan mix, as well as improvements in real estate and auto collateral values experienced since the adoption of CECL, as well as the economic forecasts for the - at the end of the second quarter, and then we've had an improvement in credit quality in auto and card, as well as in the delinquency rate. So consumer is already there, but commercial, again, we have to have things play out differently than what we - better than what we currently expect. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America Securities. Ebrahim Poonawala : I just wanted to go back, Greg, on your announcement partnering with FIS on the modern core and on the wealth management side. If you could give us some visibility on three things, one, what that means for near-term expense impact, what it means for longer-term efficiency as you kind of do go through that process, if you could tell us what the timeline would be. And then finally, we are hearing from other banks talking about moving to a modern core and that being a competitive advantage. Do you see that as a competitive advantage for Fifth Third when you get to that point, or is it table stakes given where the industry is moving? Greg Carmichael : Okay, that's a lot there. So let me try and dissect that a little bit for you. First off, the FIS announcement we just made is a continuation of a relationship that's been in place for quite some time, this replacement of our [indiscernible] core deposit platforms. But we've been on this journey to re-engineer our technical infrastructure, focusing on the actual resiliency, the skills of our businesses, replace our HR platform Workday. We completed our enterprise data strategy, we completely re-platformed mortgage FIS environment. So the FIS is the natural extension of the continuation of the modernization of those activities. We also re-engineered and restructured pricing agreement of our legacy relationship with FIS that could help make that - the cost associated with that implementation of the new FIS components, a lot more reasonable but guess for us, we will manage our costs going forward. So we're pretty pleased with the way that came out. As far as a competitive advantage, listen, I think at the end of the day, this is a long game. We have to continue to refresh our platforms, we got to continue to modernize our platforms to the cloud. I think every bank is trying to get this right. So whether it becomes a competitive advantage or not, I think it's a requirement, I mean it basic table stakes to be the business to be a digital bank. Our customers expect the bank anywhere anytime, we have to have platforms that are always on. So that's just a re-transformation of our business. We have to repurpose our expense dollars from the legacy brick-and-mortar infrastructure and we got to continue to reinvest in technology. So we're going to continue to do that, and I think the banks that don't do that are going to be at a competitive disadvantage. But many banks, as you've already heard, are continuing to focus on core modernization, and we're going to be just doing the same thing. We're think we have a great strategy for that monetization and for bringing in new technologies. We have a buy-partner-build strategy that we work on very hard. If the technology is already out there, we buy it. If we can't buy it, can partner. And if we can't partner, we build it. Momentum is an example of that. You have partnerships like GreenSky and Exchange thanks systems covered bond due to her list and our recent acquisition of Provide. So we - I think we've got a good strategy for moving quickly, but it is going to take time to get all the legacy stuff re-platformed, but net-net, once again, I think it may not be a competitive advantage at the end of the day, but definitely will be a requirement to be in this business in the future. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's good color, appreciate it. And just as a follow-up on - to that, when you think about acquisition of Provide, healthcare is obviously a very hot sector. Do you see more opportunities like that across different verticals where you might be - we should expect similar kind of deals which become tools for client acquisitions? Tim Spence : Yes, sure. This is Tim. I'm happy to take that one. So healthcare was the right starting point for us. It's a diverse industry vertical that we launched here over a decade ago and we have a vertically integrated strategy on that front across our corporate banking group, our middle market banking group out in the regions, and now also business banking. I think Provide with an important next step for us in the strategy because it gave us the opportunity to provide a differentiated value proposition to independent medical practices, like Greg mentioned, with a big focus on dentists that's - and otherwise. And Provide was a little bit unique in that it had, as a fintech company, actually already grown into one of the largest lenders into that market, driven primarily by their technology and their expertise. And just as a point of example there, the digital experience that they offer enables them to get loans approved and closed about 70% faster than a typical lending process would - it would in that market. And in addition, because of the sector focus, they have a growing digital marketplace that actually allows existing practice owners who would like to transition into retirement to post their practices for sale and to get connected with folks who are interested in buying an established practice, and so it functions, I guess, a little bit like the Craigslist or the eBay of dental practices today. Are there opportunities in other verticals? Yes, we do think there are, and we have been pretty active, as Greg mentioned, in partnering with many of those firms. Whether those relationships evolve from a partnership into an outright acquisition, I think it depends a lot on the circumstances business in a given point in time. But in the case of Provide, their next leg of the growth journey was going to be about the delivery of the broad - the full set of products and services and it absolutely makes sense for them to be part of the bank as opposed to a stand-alone entity on that journey. Operator : Your next question comes the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Jamie, this question is for you. On the securities portfolio, can you share with us - I saw the yield, as you presented in your deck, increased sequentially, and I was wondering how you achieve that in this rate environment. Was it due to the derivatives and hedges you have on the books? And then second, I think you said that obviously, you're going to keep the liquidity in the portfolio until rates start to rise. I think you may have mentioned the 2% rate. Would you lean into it as rates were to go 2%, if they do, or would you wait until we actually got to 2% before you really move? Jamie Leonard : I think if you look back at our actions in the first quarter, to answer the second part of your question, if you look back at our first quarter actions, we did leg into a little bit of additional investment portfolio buildup at that point in time. We pre-invested $1 billion of our second quarter cash flows, and then given the entry points and - of rally in the bond market, decided to maintain that additional leverage throughout the quarter. So we did grow the book a little bit in the second quarter. Our guide assumes we hold it fairly stable as the year progresses, because we don't expect to get to those 2% or a better entry point, but should the market get there, we would leg into the trade and not do everything all at once. But when you look at our additional $30 billion of excess liquidity that we're sitting on, we've earmarked about a third of that to go into the investment portfolio. So to get $10 billion of purchases done would certainly take some time and we've ramped that up over time. And our goal here is, we sit through peer results and actions versus ours and we certainly are an outlier in terms of being, I think, more prudent and more cautious to deploying at these low rates, our goal is, let's maximize our NII over the next five years, not over the next 12 months. And we think ultimately this is the better outcome and the Fed will eventually taper, not sure when that will be, but when the largest bond buyer in the world is price indiscriminate in their purchases every month, it certainly distorts the market. So eventually, that distortion is going to end and we think we'll get better entry points than what we see today. And then in terms of the first part of your question, the growth in the yield this quarter in the investment portfolio is really the benefit of what we did five years ago with structuring the portfolio to be more weighted to bullet and locked-out cash flows so that to the extent there are prepayments in the portfolio, the make-whole provisions provide a nice pickup in investment yield. And as we - we never include those in our outlook, so that - the guide on NII might look soft on the surface, but if things continue to be the same then obviously NII will outperform the guide, should those prepayment penalties continue to occur. We're sitting on almost $2 billion of gains in the investment portfolio. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, thank you for the color. And then, Greg, I've asked this question in the past, but I'll ask it again, which is when you sit down with your senior management team and you guys look out over the risks that you foresee in the horizon and if we take the delta variant and the COVID risk off the table, since that's an obvious one, what are some of the risks that you guys wrestle with as you look out over the next 12 months that we just have to keep our eye on and looking around the corner so that we're not surprised a year from now? Greg Carmichael : Yes, it's a good question, and honestly, I wouldn't respond immediately with the variant of COVID and what that could mean to the slowing down the economy and not getting the robust recovery we're all hoping for in credit risk. But I think right now, as I mentioned earlier, Gerard, I think about every customer I sit down with since that we have a conversation. I mean, you're seeing it in various ways, labor shortage, supply chain constraints, significant issues out there right now. You're seeing that in backlogs, order delays, restaurants not being able to open, small businesses not open full time, can't get labor. So it's a big challenge right now. And when does that start to abate? When does that start to correct itself? I'm not sure when that is. I believe it will have to, obviously, but to - when is that, later this year, is that the next year. So I think that's going to put a lot of pressure, inventory levels are extremely low compared with the demand that is out there, we're not seeing that tick up right now. Line utilization, it looks kind of flat right now, but we are not seeing that tick-up that we were hoping to see. So those are all kind of concerns that I have right now. Obviously, inflation is another concern out there, we've been watching that, how the Fed manages through that complexity, and more to come on that. But now, I think, overall the economy is fairly healthy. We just got some challenges still in front of us that haven't been understood yet. Tim Spence : And on that\u2026 Gerard Cassidy : I'm sorry, go ahead. Greg Carmichael : Tim has\u2026 Tim Spence : No, I just was going to say, just to add a little bit of color, Greg and I together were out. We spent a full day in 12 of our 13 regions this quarter, which made for a busy travel schedule, but a lot of good input in terms of what we're actually hearing from clients on the ground, and I mean, some of the stories that you hear about how people are dealing with the labor shortages or inventory supply issues are wild. I mean, we have a client, a fuels marketer who had to open their own driving school so that they can get people - enough folks with qualified commercial driver's licenses to do fuel deliveries. You have hospitals who are operating at 50% capacity on the elective portions of their business, which are a really important driver, right, when you think about the revenues who can't get enough skilled nursing staff on hand to be able to operate at levels above that, and we had folks who had been sending employees out to a local CVS or a Walgreens and buying out all of the Gorilla Glue because the adhesives that are used to seal together their cardboard packaging are backlogged, owing to the hard freak in Texas this last winter and - it really these - they are not theoretical concepts when you get out and you talk to our middle market clients. They are really hard realities that they are grappling with. And I think as Greg said, we all hope that especially if the enhanced unemployment benefits weigh in and as we work through some of these supply chain challenges that our clients are able to invest in their business, but if you can't get the people, you can't the materials, you can't invest to grow Gerard Cassidy : Is there any risk, just to follow up quickly, that is a permanent change in the way these companies will manage themselves, which would lead to a lesser need from borrowing from banks like yours because of what they're going through, have you heard that at all from your customers? Tim Spence : No, not yet. I think we hear them exploring opportunities to be less reliant on manual labor and to drive automation, but that drives CapEx, right, so that helps us. We hear them exploring opportunities to secure more captive supply and otherwise through M&A, but that also drives borrowing in terms of the way that they operate, and ironically, actually we hear many of them say, hey, we have been pushing for decades now to run more asset-light, which meant less liquidity on hand and maybe we don't want to do that going forward and we're willing to absorb slightly higher debt service costs in favor of being a little bit more liquid, and that would be helpful to us in terms of the borrowing. So I don't think so, Gerard. It just - we got to see our way through to the other side of this, because you can't get labor, you can't get inventory. It's hard to grow. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Bill Carcache : Can you relate the fee income strength that you saw this quarter to the growth you're seeing in the Southeast region? Are you leading in the Southeast with your fee-based products like treasury management rather than credit as you grow into that region, and if you could discuss the longer-term growth outlook across your other fee-based products in the Southeast? Tim Spence : Yes, sure. Bill, it's Tim. I'll take that. I think the growth, if you look at new client relationships and otherwise, is very strong in the commercial business in the Southeast. So they are contributing just disproportionately to that incremental fee income, but I wouldn't tell you that it is focused exclusively on the Southeast. If you look at our new commercial relationships, about 30% of them this year are lead with treasury management, and then there's another percentage, which I don't have off the top of my head, but which has come to us primarily through the capital markets business. So we are having good success using those products as wedge opportunities to drive new relationships. If you look forward, I think we're trying to build what is a really nicely diversified capital markets business with low activities like rates and commodities hedging and otherwise to complement the M&A advisory business and what we do on equities with what we do on the bond market. I mean, what we continue to anticipate is at some point here, the capital markets will be a little bit less accommodative. We'll get the benefit of that in loan balances, but you'll see some lightening on bond fees. But the other side of it is, we're sitting on an M&A pipeline now, which is almost double what it was in January 1 of this year. So we do have a nice M&A advisory pipeline that should come behind it. On the treasury management side, we've pretty consistently grown at the rate of the industry plus two to three percentage points. I am of the belief that we can do better than that, but it's definitely better to be taking share there over time than it is to have the alternative situations. We feel good about both of those fee lines over the near to medium term. Bill Carcache : And Greg, you mentioned GreenSky when talking about your partnerships there. Can you give us an update on how you're thinking about indirect lending partnerships more broadly and the opportunity to leverage these partnerships to continue to grow nationally beyond your footprint credits of that model, or do you really need to own the relationship and are at a disadvantage when all you're doing is putting up your balance sheet and somebody else has the relationship with the customer, but we'd love to hear your thoughts. Greg Carmichael : First off, there's not a lot of these opportunities out there. We - the economics of the GreenSky relationship as we went in as an investor have made a lot of sense for us. This is not how we grow our business over time, we're much more relationship business. That's why the Provide acquisition was extremely important. You think about Provide, that was a partnership originally, we had about $400 million in asset, the 70% of those relationships, we had additional relationship outside the credit facility, whether it be TM or deposit relationship. So that was important, the relationship type of opportunity for us, and that's what we're looking for to continue to enhance our business and grow our businesses. GreenSky created another channel for us, but yes, that's a non-relationship business for us. And those opportunities that makes sense to us are a very few out there, but the GreenSky one does for the economics of the transaction in place. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Couple of quick ones. First of all, the third quarter Momentum marketing program that you mentioned where you had used part of that benefit, is that just to get it kick-started, and then would you have ongoing expenses related to marketing built into your forward outlook past 3Q? Jamie Leonard : Yes. It's Jamie. The - Yes, the $15 million incremental spend over the second quarter marketing spend level of $20 million, and we expect to spend $35 million of marketing in the third quarter, that should abate going forward. However, if it is successful, then we'll continue to program at that elevated level and until we've really captured as much of the first-mover advantage with the product as we can. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Understood. And then do you have any plan to or thoughts on re-securitizing those Ginnie Mae loans that you - the $3.7 billion that you mentioned, I know some of them are newer, so they might not have quite gotten to that seasoning point yet, but is that added all in your outlook in terms of whether they stay in loans or move to mortgage banking over time? Jamie Leonard : So for the $3.7 billion of loans that we purchased from other third-party servicers, we have a - there is a nominal amount of fees assumed in the outlook related to that as they get resold to the servicer. The bigger economic opportunity is on the $750 million forbearance loans that we bought going back from Ginnie Mae on our own production, as well as within our resi mortgage portfolio to the extent that there are any on non-accrual or delinquents that cure, we do have - we have had sales this year that generate several million dollars in fees and we expect to do that over the next 6, 7 quarters as well. So I think it\u2019s more of a run rate normal course of business than it is any one-time top. Ken Usdin : That makes sense. Last one, you redeemed a bunch of debt mostly at the banks, some at the parents. Is there any more room to do that as that's, obviously, still the highest cost of funding, but again, you have all the excess deposits? What's the balancing act in terms of where you want that long-term debt footprint to settle over time? Thanks, guys. Jamie Leonard : Yes, given the excess liquidity that we have, there is clearly not a need to maintain the higher unsecured debt levels that we have. We have an additional maturity in the third quarter we'll most likely not replace that's about $850 million, almost 3% rate. So there is a little bit left to go in terms of improvement along with running down the wholesale CD book, but those benefits are baked into our outlook. So I would not expect it to get better than what we've guided to from the right-hand side of the sheet. I think the opportunity for us, from an NII improvement standpoint, will be on the left-hand side of the sheet. Operator : Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the loan growth side, on the utilization, I know you expect it to improve by about 1% through the year-end. Can you just help out with what is your pre-pandemic utilization level and expected timing where you think you can get back to that level on that front? Greg Carmichael : Yes, it's a great question. I wish I knew the answer to that. I do know we would typically - run at 36%, 37% as I mentioned, every 1% of our $750 million assets. So, we're running at 31% kind of flat line rate there. I can't really - we're hopeful, but I - like I tell my team, hope is not a strategy, we're hopeful we'll start to see that tick up a little bit based on the production levels that we're seeing out there right now. Hope we can get some of these challenges that are in front us on a supply chain and labor front maybe abating a little later this year, but when to get it is a tough thing to say. When do we get back to a normalized run rate? It's going to be awhile. I mean, it's going to be in quarters, not - maybe a year plus before we get there, I believe. John Pancari : That's helpful. And on that same topic, on the loan growth guide, I know you indicated a double-digit consumer growth, stable CRE, you got PPP impact in commercial. What would be your growth expectation for commercial with PPP and ex-PPP on that full year guide? Jamie Leonard : Relatively stable on commercial. I would say John, I would say, full year commercial average loans would be down mid-single digits, and ex-PPP a little bit more than that, but ending the year with a little bit of a - a little closer to stable. And then PPP is - we've been running steadily down as the year as the year has progressed, where on an end of period basis, we finished the first quarter at 5.4 billion, we finished the second quarter at $3.7 billion. That will continue to drift down to $2.1 billion at the end of the third, and then a $1.7 billion at year-end is our current projection on PPP. John Pancari : And then lastly on the M&A front, as you look at the incremental opportunities there. Greg, I just wanted to get your thoughts on potential incremental bank and non-bank, and more importantly curious where you think of President Biden's executive order and the implied added scrutiny around bank deals. Do you believe that could impact the bank of your size, looking at a potential whole bank deal? Greg Carmichael : Yes. I think, first off, I would respond by saying our focus is on non-bank transactions that enhance our product and service capabilities like Provide, would be a great example of that. So we'll stay focused there for the most part. If the right opportunity presents itself in a market that's attractive to us, that consoles would be financial [indiscernible] Chicago, obviously, we always consider those types of opportunities, but the [indiscernible] another focus to the organization. As far as Biden's executive order, listen, it's still a lot of work to be done. The agencies, the OCC, Fed, FERC, and DOJ are trying to figure out what that means. So more to come on that, but you can believe as I do that transactions - the economics of transactions could be more challenging going forward. It is an executive order and the timeline to get those transactions approved, they take a little bit longer, but good transactions will get done. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Just talk a bit more about the path for the 9.5% CET1 target. Obviously, you talked about the dividend increase, the buybacks back half of this year, the 20 basis point drag. But if you put it all out together, just still about the, it seems like kind of treading water on the capital, just given the good earnings generation and probably not a lot of balance sheet growth the next few quarters or so. Do you think you'll get that target? Are you going to hold back for the loan growth and maybe to flush it out a little bit think about the first half of the next year? Jamie Leonard : Yes, our goal is certainly to get to the 9.5% by June of 2022. And yes, it is certainly a large amount of repurchases. I think the two factors to bake into it would be, there's 20 basis points of CET1 erosion from the Provide acquisition in the third quarter and then 9 basis points of CECL transition in the first quarter of 2022, so that - a little bit of capital gets spent there. But yes, to your point, we have a lot of capital deployment opportunity ahead of us to get to the 9.5%. And certainly if loan growth doesn't materialize, then we'll look to continue it at the 9.5%. And then we do feel that should loan growth accelerate, we certainly have a buffer from where we think we need to run the company from a capital perspective. Clearly, from the credit outcomes you're seeing we could run the balance sheet, I think, at 9% or so if loan growth were to accelerate, but for now, our focus is just getting to the 9.5% by midyear next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Winter with Wedbush. Peter Winter : I wanted to ask just on the middle market and small business, are you seeing any willingness of them maybe to top their lines of credit while maintaining higher levels of cash on hand, or is it just an issue of supply and labor shortages that's holding it all back? Tim Spence : Peter, it's Tim. I would tell you it's primarily issues with supply chain and labor, like Greg said, and not liquidity. If you're looking for green shoots, I think that borrowers who are either smaller or who will rely on structures that look more like asset-based lending structures are starting to tap their lines. So we are seeing modest improvements in utilization in that sector. Now, in aggregate, that's not a large segment of our balance sheet, which is the reason that you see utilization, overall, Fifth Third being stable. But generally as these things happen, they happen at the lower end of the book first and they migrate upward into the larger borrowers. So I at least, when I feel like finding a positive signal, that's where I'm going these days. Peter Winter : Okay. And then, Jamie, just to ask about the outlook for the margin in the second half of the year, some of the puts and takes? Jamie Leonard : Sure. The second quarter was obviously very strong from a margin perspective, and we're pleased with how our balance sheet has been performing. But given the high levels of PPP, as well as the investment securities prepayment penalties that we don't expect to recur or at least don't forecast to recur, we would expect to see the NIM decline a bit to a more normalized level, which is that 305 basis point areas what we've talked about. But I think, pretty much all year in terms of what we think this balance sheet should stabilize that certainly for the foreseeable future. So NIM should come down, call it 5 basis points or so in the third quarter. I would say the big drivers there, certainly the PPP, the prepayment penalties, a little bit of day count, and otherwise still maintain that floor of 305 basis point or better. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW. David Konrad : Quick follow-up on the securities portfolio. Maybe, Jamie, can you remind us what the remaining duration is for the bullet structured product? Jamie Leonard : So the total portfolio is of 4.9 duration and so the bullet - when we quote the 58% number, we're saying it's bullet and locked-out for at least the next two years, but the duration of that portfolio is not that different from the portfolio in total. David Konrad : I guess the locked-out is two additional years? Jamie Leonard : Correct, but there's not a step-down. For a while, we had quoted a 12-month and then we got the questions, so we expanded to 24, but there's not a cliff here. It's just a slow erosion over time. Operator : Our next question is from Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott. Christopher Marinac : I just wanted to go back to the regulatory question before, Greg. Is the environment any different than it would have been six or nine months ago, whether it's a CFPB or any of the agencies? Greg Carmichael : Well, listen, obviously, with the picture changing right now, there is still a process on the CFPB front from a nomination perspective. So is the changed - this has been - it's - I don't believe it's changed to be honest with you. I think the agencies have a job to do and a role to play, and I think the focus of the CFPB and the OCC and the FDIC are going to be making sure that there is the safety and soundness, but also the way that - the way the banks handle themselves and operate are going to be extremely important. So I haven't sensed a big shift in - with the new administration on requirements and demands of the other bank in the totality, so to speak, from the top as to what they expect from us. So it's not something that keeps me up at night. Let's put it that way. Christopher Marinac : Okay, Greg. Thank you for that, and thanks for all of the background this morning. Greg Carmichael : Thank you. Operator : Those are all the questions we have at this time. Are there any closing remarks? Chris Doll : Yes. Thank you, Christy, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department and we will be happy to assist you. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

On a core basis, we earned $0.94 per share. Once again, we delivered strong and steady financial results while fully supporting our customers, communities and employees. During the quarter, we generated adjusted ROTCE of nearly 19%, which represents the fifth straight quarter exceeding 18%. We generated period-end C&I loan growth of 4% compared to the prior quarter, excluding the impact of PPP. Commercial loan production increased 5% from last quarter, representing the strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2019. We generated strong consumer household growth of 3% compared to last year with growth in every region in our footprint, reflected in the continued success of our branch and digital initiatives, and as expected, we generated positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. Our performance this quarter reflected strong business outcomes across our franchise, resulting in improved and diversified revenues. This was combined with disciplined balance sheet management, expense management, and yet another quarter of benign credit results. We closed the Provide acquisition and the sale of HSA deposits during the quarter to improve long-term growth and profitability. Provide, a leading fintech company serving healthcare practices, will further accelerate profitable relationship growth. The sale of our HSA deposits is part of our multi-year strategy to simplify the organization and prioritize investments in order to generate differentiated outcomes for our customers and shareholders. Despite continued pressure from low interest rates, adjusted PP&R increased 4% compared to the year-ago quarter, highlighting the strong results from our fee-based businesses in retail, mortgage, commercial, and wealth and asset management. Excluding the impact of PPP, average total loans increased 4% compared to last quarter, reflecting strong commercial loan production as well as strength in our indirect auto and residential mortgage portfolios. Commercial loan production increased 5% sequentially with record quarters in corporate banking and middle markets. Despite some of the challenges we have been hearing from our customers, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, the strong production was led by our healthcare, renewable energy, and retail verticals, and was well diversified geographically. Our commercial lending production trends, pipelines, and retention of the client relationship all support continued loan growth. As it relates to Provide, we are very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve seen so far and we are even more excited about the opportunities for continued growth. As we have previously mentioned, we expect strong origination volumes in 2022, reflecting a robust pipeline, added product capabilities, and key talent hires. Provide supports a relationship approach with approximately two-thirds of customers having either a deposit account or a payments relationship with Fifth Third. During the quarter, we recorded a net benefit to credit losses as well as historically low net charge-offs of 8 basis points, reflecting continued improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. In addition to historical low credit losses, we experienced another quarter of improvement in criticized assets and NPAs. Our criticized assets declined nearly 20%. Our NPA ratio declined 9 basis points sequentially. Our NPA and NPL ratios this quarter have reverted back to pre-pandemic levels. Our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs.  Our balance sheet and earnings power remain very strong. As we have said before, we remain focused on deploying capital into organic growth opportunities, evaluating strategic non-bank opportunities, paying a strong dividend, and share repurchases. Bank acquisitions remain a lower priority.  I\u2019d like to once again thank our employees. I very much appreciate the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers, communities, and each other. I am very proud that in addition to producing strong financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and wellbeing of our communities. For our customers, we are excited to roll out Genie [ph], our new AI-driven digital assistant in the fourth quarter. This will drive targeted marketing capabilities, digital engagement, and improved customer retention. For our communities, we made a $15 million contribution to our foundation this quarter as part of our $2.8 billion commitment to accelerate racial equity, equality and inclusion in our communities.  In total, we have contributed $40 million in philanthropic support since the end of last year. We continue to make targeted investments to accelerate economic revitalization, as you may have seen in last week\u2019s announcement of Fifth Third\u2019s Neighborhood Investment Program. This innovative initiative further demonstrates our commitment to being an ESG leader in addition to other recent proof points, including [indiscernible] over $600 billion towards our $8 billion renewable energy goal to be achieved by 2025, announcing a new position as climate risk to focus on identifying, measuring and managing the physical and transition risk of our clients, and a robust transparent and peer-leading ESG disclosure. In summary, we believe our balance sheet strength, diversified revenues, and continued focus on disciplined management through the company will serve us well into 2022 and beyond. We expect to generate positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter and also for the full year in 2021. We remain committed to generating sustainable long term value and consistently producing through the cycle top quartile results. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jamie to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook. James Leonard : Thank you Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today.  We are very pleased with our financial results this quarter, reflecting focused execution throughout the bank. Our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit. The reported earnings included a $21 million after-tax benefit, or $0.03 per share from the three items noted on Page 2 of the release. Our strong business performance throughout the bank is reflected in our return metrics. We\u2019ve produced an adjusted ROA of 1.32% and an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of 18.7%. Improvements in our loan portfolio credit quality resulted in a $63 million release to our credit reserves and an ACL ratio of 200 basis points compared to 206 last quarter. Combined with our historically low net charge-offs, we had a $42 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement, net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion increased 2% compared to the year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefits of our balance sheet positioning, continuing benefits from PPP income, and income from our Ginnie Mae forbearance loan purchases. Our NII results relative to the second quarter included a $6 million reduction in PPP income, a $4 million decline in prepayment penalties in our investment portfolio, and the impact of lower earning asset yields partially offset by a higher day count and a reduction in long term debt. Our allocation to bullet and locked-out structures is currently 60% of the total investment portfolio, which is expected to continue to provide ongoing NII protection in this low rate environment. On the liability side, we reduced our interest-bearing core deposit costs another basis point this quarter to 4 basis points. With a highly asset sensitive balance sheet and over $30 billion of excess liquidity, we continue to be well positioned to benefit when interest rates rise while also remaining well hedged if rates remain low, given our securities portfolio and derivatives. Total reported non-interest income increased 13% sequentially, impacted by a $60 million gain associated with the disposition of HSA deposits as previously communicated. Adjusted non-interest income increased 3%, driven by strong mortgage banking, treasury management, leasing, and wealth and asset management revenues. Commercial banking revenue, which achieved record results the past two quarters, remained solid as strength in M&A advisory fees, particularly in our healthcare vertical, was more than offset by lower corporate bond fees.  Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted non-interest income increased 13% with improvement in every single caption, reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business as well as the robust economic rebound over the past year. Our total non-interest revenue was 41% of total revenue in the third quarter.  Reported non-interest expense increased 2% compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the $15 million foundation contribution. Adjusted expenses were flat sequentially as an increase in marketing expense associated with Momentum banking and increased T&E expense were offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expense. Compared to the year-ago quarter, adjusted non-interest expense increased 2% primarily driven by an increase in performance-based compensation, reflecting strong business results, servicing expenses associated with Ginnie Mae loan purchases, and the impact of the Provide acquisition. These items were partially offset by lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiation and lower net occupancy expense. On a year-over-year basis, total adjusted fees have increased 13% compared to just 2% expense growth.  Moving to the balance sheet, total average portfolio loans and leases declined half of a percent sequentially, including the headwind from PPP loans. Excluding PPP, average loans and leases increased 1% with period-end loans up 1.5%, pointing to positive momentum as we head into the fourth quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 2% as continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage balances were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances. While we did not retain incremental conforming mortgage originations in the third quarter, we have elected to retain approximately $400 million of our retail mortgage production for the balance sheet in the fourth quarter and will continue to evaluate the economic trade-offs, given our balance sheet capacity in this environment.  Average commercial loans declined 2% compared to the prior quarter, due entirely to PPP forgiveness. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased around half of a percent with C&I loans up 2%. Production was robust across the board, up 5% compared to the prior quarter with both corporate and middle market banking generating record production, which was well diversified geographically. As a result, period-end C&I loans excluding PPP increased 4%. Revolver utilization of 31% was stable compared to the prior quarter; however, it is worth noting that total commitments have increased approximately $5 billion since the end of last year, driven by new client acquisition and an increase in demand from existing clients in anticipation of future business growth.  Average CRE loans were down 3% sequentially with lower balances in mortgage and construction, driven by elevated payoffs in areas most impacted by the pandemic, reflecting our cautious approach to those sectors.  Our securities portfolio was stable sequentially. We continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows but will remain patient on deploying the excess liquidity. Assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook, we would expect to begin our excess cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200 basis point level. We remain optimistic that continued GDP growth and the Fed\u2019s eventual tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive risk-return opportunities in the future.  Average other short term investments, which includes interest-bearing cash, remain elevated, reflecting growth in core deposits since the onset of the pandemic, which are up 6% year-over-year.  Moving to credit, our strong credit performance this quarter once again reflects our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, prudent balance sheet management, and the continued benefit of fiscal and monetary stimulus programs and improvement in the broader economy. As Greg mentioned, the third quarter net charge-off ratio of 8 basis points was historically low and improved 8 basis points sequentially. Non-performing assets declined 15% with the NPA ratio declining 9 basis points sequentially to 52 basis points.  The decline in criticized assets reflected significant improvements in retail non-essential and leisure, consistent with the reopening of the economy and higher activity in those sectors as well as improvements in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios. We continue to focus on segments of non-owner occupied commercial real estate, particularly central business district hotels as activity has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels.  Moving to the ACL, our base case macroeconomic scenario is relatively similar to last quarter, which assumes the labor market continues to improve and job growth continues to strengthen, with unemployment reaching 4% in the first quarter of 2022 and ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.5%. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios; however, our ACL release was lower this quarter as the improvement in the underlying economic forecast decelerated from the second quarter. Additionally, the ACL requirement in the downside scenario worsened compared to the second quarter due to a forecasted slower pace of recovery and a larger increase in unemployment. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $788 million higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $176 million lower.  While the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out, given the uncertain environment. In addition to COVID, we continue to monitor the economic and [indiscernible] implications of the supply chain and labor market constraints that currently exist. Our September 30 incorporates our best estimate for the economic environment with lower unemployment and continued improvement in credit quality.  Moving to capital, our capital levels remain strong in the third quarter. Our CET-1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.8%. During the quarter, we completed $550 million in share repurchases which reduced our share count by 14.5 million shares compared to the second quarter. We also raised our common dividend $0.03 or 11% to $0.30 per share. Our capital plans support approximately $300 million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2021, and we continue to target a 9.5% CET-1 by June 2022.  Moving to our fourth quarter outlook, we expect average total loan balances to increase 2% sequentially, excluding the PPP headwind. Including the PPP impact, we expect average total loans to increase approximately 1%. Our outlook reflects half a point of improvement from commercial revolving line utilization, continued strength in commercial production given our record pipeline, and a continued stabilization in pay downs based on activity that we are seeing so far in October.  We expect average C&I growth of 4% to 5% excluding PPP in the fourth quarter, and CRE balances to decline around 1% or so primarily due to construction constraints. As a result, we anticipate total average commercial loan growth of around 3% sequentially, excluding PPP. We expect average total consumer loan balances to increase around 1% sequentially, including the impacts of Ginnie Mae forbearance pool purchases in our held-for-sale portfolio. We purchased $300 million during the third quarter and an additional $700 million in early October. Given our loan outlook, we expect NII to be down 1% sequentially in the fourth quarter, assuming stable securities balances and a $17 million reduction in PPP income. Excluding PPP, we expect fourth quarter NII to be up slightly relative to the third quarter. Our guidance indicates full year 2021 NII declines less than 1% compared to full year 2020, despite no meaningful growth in investment securities balances throughout the year and an average decline in one-month LIBOR of approximately 40 basis points. We expect NIM to decline 3 to 4 basis points in the fourth quarter primarily due to loan yield compression. We expect fourth quarter fees to increase around 6% compared to the third quarter and to be up around 8% on a year-over-year basis, excluding the impacts of the TRA. This results in full-year 2021 fee growth excluding the impacts of the TRA of approximately 10% compared to 2020.  Our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy resulting in a record full-year commercial banking revenue led by 20% growth in capital markets fees, record wealth and asset management revenue up double digits, and double digit growth in card and processing revenue. We expect private equity income to be in the $40 million area in the fourth quarter. Our outlook assumes a sequential decline in top line mortgage revenue of approximately 40% with roughly half of that decline due to seasonally lower fourth quarter volumes and declining spreads, and half to our decision to retain $400 million in retail production that I mentioned earlier. We expect fourth quarter expenses to be stable to up 1% compared to the third quarter, reflecting continued growth in technology investments, servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae loan purchases, and continued marketing support related to our roll-out of Momentum, offset by disciplined expense management throughout the company and initial savings beginning from our process automation program. As a result, our full-year 2021 total core revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in core expenses despite the rate environment. We will have achieved positive operating leverage in a year in which the vast majority of the industry will likely experience an erosion in efficiency. We expect total net charge-offs in the fourth quarter to be in the 10 to 15 basis points range, which would result in full-year 2021 charge-offs of 15 basis points or so. In summary, our third quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. We will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting, and a focus on a long term performance horizon which has served us well during this environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks Jamie. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning. Operator, please open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : Morning guys, thanks for taking the question. Greg Carmichael : Morning. Scott Siefers : Just wanted to ask a couple questions on loan growth, which looks like it\u2019s coming back nicely. First, I was hoping you could talk about any differences you\u2019re seeing in demand between your larger and smaller customers. Jamie, I think you had mentioned that production, it sounded pretty strong in both corporate and middle markets, any additional color there? Then second, was just wondering if you could speak to the dynamics you\u2019re seeing in terms of book pricing and structure; in other words, changes to the competitive environment. Greg Carmichael : This is Greg. Let me start off, and then I\u2019ll flip over to Tim and maybe Jamie. First off, we\u2019re very encouraged with what we\u2019re seeing from a production perspective. We\u2019ve got commercial production in third quarter [indiscernible] was strong at $5.4 billion - that was up from $5.1 billion in second quarter and $5.2 billion in third quarter 2019. We expect that production to continue to be stable going into the fourth quarter, so that\u2019s encouraging. We expect average loans up 1% with PPP and 2% up without PPP, so that\u2019s some strength there. We\u2019re also seeing line utilization tick up a little bit more in our core middle market, which is nice to see that for a change.  When you think about our geographies and what we\u2019re seeing right now, from a geography perspective, North Carolina, Texas, Cincinnati, Columbus were our top four markets for commercial loan growth in Q3, which is encouraging. If you look at six regions that had all-time highs, which were very encouraging, with Chicago, Grand Rapids, Columbus, Kentucky, North Carolina and Texas, so that felt really good and we\u2019re starting to see once again some good momentum out there. Net new relationships, something we watch very carefully, brought in 419 new commercial relationships year-to-date. Most of that was in core middle market and some of that in large core, so net-net we\u2019re seeing good progress out there, good performance, encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing to date as we go into the fourth quarter and then into 2022. Timothy Spence : Yes, to add a few points to what Greg mentioned, I had the chance to be out in eight of our 14 regions this past quarter. I think you get really excellent color when you have an opportunity to sit with clients and with bankers. They\u2019re all feeling the shortages as it relates to labor and supply chain. We have hotel operators who are now only cleaning rooms when people leave, as an example. I visited an electronics client out west and asked to see their demo room, and there was nothing but holes in the wall. I said, where\u2019s the equipment, and they had sold all the inventory because they are struggling to get the parts in to be able to fill orders, so all those issues are still real. I think the good news is we are seeing M&A as a catalyst, we\u2019re seeing capex now as a catalyst in particular for businesses that are able to substitute equipment and automation for manual processes, and then bluntly, as Greg mentioned, I think we feel pretty confident that a lot of the improvement we\u2019re seeing is just coming from taking share. The relationship count Greg mentioned would be higher than where we were at prior to the pandemic, so we\u2019ll have taken more new relationships on board this year through nine months than we had in all of 2018 or 2019, just as an example. So there\u2019s good general pick-up there. It would be great to continue to see a little bit more activity as it relates to utilization as folks try to build inventories, and otherwise that\u2019s going to be the wildcard for us. Greg Carmichael : Jamie, let me add one thing. Scott, also if you look at our verticals, which I should have mentioned this, our largest production, the areas we\u2019re seeing the largest strength in right now is technology and media telecom. Our retailers and financial institutions are all doing well, so we\u2019re seeing some good momentum in those spaces. James Leonard : Then Scott, to answer the second part of your question in terms of the segments, I think Greg and Tim did a nice summary there. What we\u2019re seeing from a line utilization perspective is that the middle market line utilizations are up almost 1%, whereas corporate banking continues to trend down, so quarter-over-quarter that utilization was stable, and if we want to go into the decimals, it was 31.3 at the end of June and 31.1 as we sat here on September 30, but we are starting to see more borrowing demand and pick-up in the middle market space as opposed to the corporate banking. Then in terms of pricing, while NIM came in as expected, in line with our July guide, we do have the headwind in the C&I yield portfolio because it is very competitive out there. I think for the most part, banks are competing on price and non-banks are competing on structure, so for us, the price headwind comes in just a little bit tighter spreads but also some of the reduction in the LIBOR floor, so you lose some of that excess earnings in this environment but you can perhaps recapture the yield benefit as the Fed starts to move on the front end of the curve, hopefully in the next year to 18 months, so as expected but certainly a headwind when it comes to pricing. Scott Siefers : Yes, okay. Good, thank you very much for all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Peter Winter : Good morning. You guys have done a phenomenal job on the securities yields with the rate locks on the cash flows and the bullets, but I\u2019m wondering is this type of securities yield sustainable into next year with the rate locks continuing? James Leonard : I would say, Peter, we\u2019re inoculated from the rate environment but we\u2019re not immune to it, so as you saw in the numbers this quarter and as we look out even next quarter, it is a steady grind down as we reinvest the cash flows, so that hurts the yield a bit, 10, 15 basis points or so.  If you look out on the bullets themselves, they\u2019re at a 2.65 yield with cash flows--I think we\u2019re projecting about $7 billion of cash flows in that portfolio over the next five years, so there will be a step down should rates stay where they are today. Reinvestment yields right now, I think are in the 1.70 to 1.80 range, so barring a curve steepener, it will be a slow but definitely downward trend on the portfolio yield. The good news for us is we\u2019re very well positioned and it is pretty insulated from the environment relative to how the peers have positioned their portfolios. Peter Winter : Okay, thanks. If I could just follow up on expenses, you\u2019ve had the benefit of those expense initiatives this year, which clearly benefited when looking at the fee income growth relative to the expense growth. Can you just talk about some of the expense opportunities going forward as we go into next year, or has a lot of the low-hanging fruit been realized, and if you could also talk about any inflation pressures looking into next year. James Leonard : Sure, thanks for the question. One update we have on expense savings in our program for 2022 is that we are targeting $125 million in savings for 2022, and that\u2019s a combination of the lean process automation and intelligent operations, the branch closures - we have 42 branches closing in the first quarter of 2022, and then some smaller vendor savings bundled together, so we\u2019ve tightened the range on that bundle of savings from $100 million to $150 million to $125 million, and then obviously we\u2019re not getting into expense guide for 2022 because we\u2019ll continue to evaluate how much of those savings will be reinvested into sales force expansion on commercial, as well as wealth and asset management. But we feel good about the progress we\u2019re making on the LPA program; in fact, if you look in the press release, buried, I think, at the bottom of Page 14 is an FTE count, and we\u2019re down a couple hundred FTE, even with adding about 100 from the Provide acquisition, and that\u2019s starting to show the benefit of that LPA savings.  We\u2019ve made progress, we\u2019ve had some success. There\u2019s about $6 million of savings in our fourth quarter forecast tied into that program, but then the $125 million for next year. Timothy Spence : And the headcount there doesn\u2019t even reflect the benefit from the offshore, right - the automation savings on offshore processes that were completed by JV partners, where we\u2019re, I think, north of 20% at this point of the processes that were offshore now fully automated. James Leonard : The other part of your question on inflation, in terms of wage inflation and other things, we\u2019ve been able to manage through the environment from an employee and cost structure and still deliver fairly stable expenses this quarter. We continue to see opportunity to do the same while there is the wage inflation and other pressures. We do have those other opportunities ahead of us, and so perhaps some of the $125 million would be absorbed by some inflationary pressure but ultimately a moderate amount of inflation would ultimately be very positive for the bank in terms of PP&R and interest income capabilities. Peter Winter : That\u2019s great, thanks Jamie. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning everyone. Greg Carmichael : Morning Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Greg, when you look at your CET-1 ratio, you\u2019re targeting to bring it down to 9.5% by June of next year. It looks like, if I recall correctly, your required number is 7% by the Fed. What would it take for you guys to bring it down from 9.5% to something lower, or is it no, the 9.5% is set in stone and you\u2019re just not going to budge off of that? Greg Carmichael : Well, there\u2019s nothing set in stone, Gerard, but at the end of the day, we think that\u2019s the prudent place to be. It\u2019s multi-faceted as we think about that level. Obviously we believe we could run the bank at a much lower level, but also we watch what the market\u2019s doing, the environment we\u2019re operating in, what our peers are doing. We just think that\u2019s the prudent target point to shoot for at this point. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, and then maybe Richard, we could talk about credit quality. Obviously your numbers, similar to some of your peers, are quite strong, particularly in the net charge-off area, and I suspect that this is unusually good and it\u2019s not sustainable, just due to normal seasoning of portfolios. How long do you think you guys could see net charge-offs stay at this extremely low level, and when do you think they start creeping up to a more normal level? I know normal is hard to define, but when do they start to creep up? Richard Stein : Yes Gerard, thanks for the question. Clearly we\u2019re pleased with the 8 basis points this quarter, and like you said, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to repeat. But given the economic outlook, we do expect charge-offs to be better than our through-the-cycle average, and probably certainly into \u201922 and into \u201923 for a couple reasons.  One, it\u2019s going to be simply the amount of liquidity that\u2019s out there. Two, inflation, collateral values continue to be strong, and when we run our mid-cycle stress tests, we\u2019re seeing 25 to 35 basis points as a charge-off range for the bank through \u201922 and \u201923. Now, that graph, as I said, it\u2019s a little bit lower than what we think the long term average is. If you recall, we think through-the-cycle average is somewhere between 35 and 45 basis points, but given our approach, given the way we manage the balance sheet, the way we think about client selection and underwriting, we think it\u2019s a grind through \u201922 and \u201923 back to something that feels a little bit more normal. Gerard Cassidy : Great, appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, thanks. Good morning.  Hey Jamie, I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the portfolio structure. When you talk about the $7 billion that\u2019s going to run off over the next several years, how high are you on that part of the book, and when you\u2019re reinvesting the cash flows to keep the book flat, are you also buying back some new type of bullet structures or are you just more investing in plain vanilla today? James Leonard : We\u2019ve been buying a little bit of everything when we\u2019re reinvesting. Portfolio cash flows have been running about $1.5 billion a quarter - you know, second quarter, third quarter, so depending on the day, we\u2019ve added some level 1s, we\u2019ve added some level 2s, but in total the mix hasn\u2019t really changed a whole lot. Then in terms of the bullets, over the next couple years it\u2019s a very small number in terms of total cash flow, maybe a couple hundred million, and then over years 3, 4, 5, then you start to have cash flow portfolioing. But right now, the total book of bullets, as well as the cash flowing securities, we\u2019re in a 2.75 yield, give or take, and then for the fourth quarter, yields should be a little bit better than that with a little bit of seasonal, mutual fund dividends in the N2DC [ph], plus a little bit of prepayment penalties that have occurred thus far in October. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Thank you. Just a follow-up, you guys have been really taking down the long term debt footprint, which is still even outsized the majority of your interest-bearing liability costs. Just wonder, where is the level that you need to keep it at and what\u2019s the trade-offs versus the deposit base, the mix of deposits, and how much more could you potentially reduce that footprint? Thanks. James Leonard : You know, we\u2019re probably at the low point in terms of the long term debt outstanding. We had a maturity in September, $850 million that we\u2019re perhaps look to replenish in the next quarter or two, but I think we\u2019re at a good spot and we\u2019re well positioned. We\u2019ve been able to utilize the excess liquidity and take advantage of the environment to deliver some savings from a cost standpoint, both from long term debt as well as running off some of the CD book that certainly behaves more like wholesale funding than the core deposit book.  I think we\u2019re in a good spot and we\u2019ve probably reached the end of the line on the long term debt, but probably have a little bit more room on the CD book to run it down a little bit more. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Morning. Greg, you mentioned some key talent hires that should help drive loan production into 2022. Can you provide a little bit of color on the areas where you\u2019re hiring, particularly within the lending areas, and if that hiring is continuing? Thanks. Greg Carmichael : Absolutely, thanks for your question. Obviously the southeast markets, we\u2019ve been adding to our relationship management bankers in that market with a lot of success there. We\u2019re real pleased with the production we\u2019re seeing in that market, so we\u2019ll continue to add in that market. There\u2019s great opportunities and we run a good franchise down there, and that\u2019s obviously a focal point for our expansion. In addition to that, I would say Texas, the west coast, California, the talent we\u2019ve been able to acquire in those markets, the bankers that we\u2019ve brought on, a significant increase in bankers in those markets over the last two or three years, and we\u2019re seeing great progress from a production perspective, outstanding perspective. Listen those were the strategies, we watch them very carefully. We invest when we see opportunities, and those areas continue to be great opportunities for us. More to come. Let me just throw it over to Tim to see if he has any color he wants to add to that. Timothy Spence : Yes, I think a couple other. I think Greg hit the geographic points. We also are in the process of building out a mortgage warehouse vertical - that\u2019s a good business for us. It\u2019s a business we\u2019ve been in historically but it hasn\u2019t been a point of focus, and we saw an opportunity there with some talent to go out and take some market share, so I think that\u2019s an area.  We continue to add to the renewables team and are focused on how we expand what is already, I think, a pretty strong capability there and a good track record, and then we were pleased to be able to land some really important talent into Provide post the Provide acquisition, and have now formally launched the vet vertical there for veterinarians, which I think is going to be a really good source of growth to complement the strength we already had in medical, dental, and that business line. John Pancari : Got it. All right, thank you. Then secondly, if you could just update us where you stand on your core system upgrade. Can you maybe remind us of the timing of the project and the cost that you see tied to it, and then separately, do you see any risk to the cost that you had budgeted for the upgrade, given the wage inflation dynamics? Thanks. James Leonard : First off, our tech budget, let me take that first, is about $700 million, and that\u2019s been growing about 10% per year for the last five years. When you think about our core platforms, when we talk about the modernization effort, that\u2019s been going on for a couple years. You saw that with our mortgage loan origination system, the resiliency platforms we put in place, the data architecture strategy that we rolled out. Next coming up is obviously FYS core deposits. We\u2019re in the midst right now of turning on Encino, that\u2019s going extremely well and something we\u2019re very pleased with, so this is an ongoing effort. If you asked me, if it was a baseball analogy, we\u2019re probably in mid-innings here, but it\u2019s a long game and we\u2019ll continue to invest prudently.  In addition to that, if you think about our tech spend, a lot of that tech spend is focused on being able to take cost out, so lean process automation has been a great focus of our business and an area we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in. We\u2019ll continue to invest for those opportunities, we\u2019ll continue to stay focused on core platform replacement, our partnership with FIS, in fact we\u2019re their largest processing customer. If you think about how we think about that business and the integration, what we\u2019ve done with our core platform, we\u2019ve been able to manage costs very efficiently and effectively through that exercise, so we\u2019re very comfortable with what we think the new operating environment will look like from a cost perspective. But if you think about our tech spend and how we think about our business, it\u2019s really 50% keeping the business running, so to speak, 35% advancing the business, and then 15% protecting the business. Timothy Spence : John, it\u2019s Tim. One small point to add to that, and it came up earlier, there was a question about inflation and wages. Jamie said earlier we were immune but not inoculated on a--I\u2019m sorry, inoculated but not immune on a different point. I think here again, we raised our minimum wage to $18 an hour in 2019 - I think we were the first of the regional banks, certainly of our peer group, to have made that move, and the by-product of that is we are watching, as I\u2019m sure you are, the announcements coming out of many of our peers that they\u2019re raising their minimum wage, but they\u2019re getting to $18 an hour in nearly all cases, which is where Fifth Third is already at, and the by-product of that is a lot of that near term impact is kind of in our run rate. John Pancari : Got it. All right, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research Bill Carcache : Thanks, good morning. I\u2019d like to follow up on your net charge-off rate commentary. As you think about the normalization of your NCO rates off these low levels to the 25, 35 basis points in \u201922, \u201923 that you mentioned, is the level of your reserve rate currently high enough such that the trajectory is also likely to be flat to down, even as NCO rates normalize higher? Any color that you could give on that dynamic would be helpful. James Leonard : Yes, I think it\u2019s a little tough to take a life of loan expected loss rate of the ACL and compare it to short term forecasts, because the loan maturities certainly are a swing factor in that. Obviously we\u2019re comfortable with our ACL at 200 basis points - it\u2019s 204 basis points excluding PPP, so yes, I\u2019m comfortable that the ACL is adequate to cover the expected losses over the life of the loans. Then when Richard\u2019s talking about those periodic charge-off levels for a point in time and with a fairly shorter duration portfolio throwing off some of those losses in the consumer side - you know, card and auto, I think we\u2019re at a good spot. Bill Carcache : Very helpful, thank you. Then following up on the utilization commentary, to the extent that supply chain problems were to extend further into next year, how much do you think that weighs on--you know, just given the make-up of your client base, how much would that weigh on the normalization of utilization rates versus the potential for those utilization rates to continue to improve, even if those supply chain problems were to extend a bit longer? James Leonard : Yes, I think we\u2019re seeing stable line utilization because of those supply chain constraints, so hopefully the worst case scenario would be stable. As we talked about in our guide, we expect a little bit of an uptick both from a seasonal and year-end positioning with our customers of about half a percent, so we\u2019ve reduced our outlook on utilization because of the supply chain and labor constraints.  From a next year perspective, hopefully they get resolved and we\u2019ll start to see inventory builds, and that should provide a little bit of a tailwind to our loan growth expectations. Bill Carcache : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I was wondering if you could dig a little bit more into some of the loan yield pressure that you were talking about earlier, and if you kind of just hold rates constant, when does that eventually flatten out? James Leonard : Yes Matt, for our quarter, if you look in the tables and you look at the gross yield decline 2Q to 3Q, it\u2019s really driven by three factors. One, 2Q had elevated prepayment loan fees that get recorded in the NII, so 2Q was high, so that was a portion. You have regular re-pricing front book, back book phenomenon, and I would characterize it as three basis points or so of NIM from that. I expect that should continue into the fourth quarter. Then the other phenomenon on the LIBOR floor is more a consequence of getting through renewal season and some of the other things happening out of the second quarter, so that should dissipate, but that was, call it, a third half of that yield compression you see in the tables in the earnings release. As we look ahead, I would expect a couple BP, 2 to 3 BP headwind from C&I loan yield compression for all of those factors into the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re guiding the reported NIM down as well for the fourth quarter, similar to what we saw in the third quarter. Matt O\u2019Connor: Then I guess beyond 4Q, is there still a fair amount of re-pricing between the back book and the front book and all that, or are you getting close to--sorry, go ahead? James Leonard : No, thanks for the question. I think from a front book, back book perspective, the tailwind is the curve steepening we\u2019ve seen in the third quarter, and should that continue we\u2019ll hit that intersection. But until we get a little more lift, you do have the re-pricing effect continuing, where new loans are coming on at lower yields than the runoff and paydowns in the back book.  I think on top of that, we have done a nice job managing NII and the balance sheet through this environment, and we certainly have dry powder, whether it\u2019s through the asset sensitivity or the $33 billion of excess cash, that we could choose to deploy to mitigate those effects if need be. But for now, we still think patience is still the way to go, and therefore if there\u2019s a little bit of NIM compression along the way, that\u2019s fine. Our focus is more on the long term and delivering the best performance we can over the next five years. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. You mentioned positive operating leverage in 2021 even while you spend 10% more on tech, and that you\u2019re in kind of the fourth or fifth inning of your tech transformation, so I guess the question is do you intend to continue to spend around 10% more on tech each year, and how is that changing, especially as you move off-premise as much as you are? Is there going to be a period where you have to run somewhat parallel systems and then you\u2019ll get the benefit a few years out, and more generally, how do you think about the number of tech partners that you have, and if you can quantify the number, I\u2019ll take that too. Greg Carmichael : Yes Mike, this is Greg. I think 10% is probably the right number for us. It\u2019s not cast in stone. As you mentioned, operating leverage, positive operating leverage, that\u2019s something we\u2019re very focused on. We delivered it, we\u2019ll deliver it in 2021. As we go into our planning process for 2022, our focus is on positive operating leverage. As I mentioned earlier, some of that tech spend is going right to process efficiencies, where we\u2019re able to take our 200-plus additional people and so forth, branch closures and things that we\u2019re working on right now on the other expense side of the house that supports that positive operating leverage, and we continue to grow fees at a really robust rate, close to 10% CAGR over the last couple years.  Net-net, positive operating leverage, something we\u2019re very focused on, believe we can continue to deliver on. In addition to that, the tech spend will roughly run around 10%-plus. If you think about the core platform modernization, we talked about the fourth or fifth inning. I think of it more as a cricket test match - it\u2019s been going on, it\u2019s going to continue to go on for quite some time. We\u2019re going to have to deal with that, but at the end of the day, I think as we put these new platforms in, we\u2019re able to do it in a very systematic way with respect to how we turn these platforms in, so it\u2019s not the big bang approach. We\u2019re able to turn it on by geography, by product line, so we\u2019re very insulated if we\u2019re having to do a big bang impact. With that said, you\u2019d have some dual system platforms that are going to be run simultaneously until we get all markets, all products converted over in the case of some of our major implementations coming up, like our core deposit platform. That\u2019s going to take a little bit of time, but at the end of the day we should be a lot more efficient, we should be able to bring through more enhancements at a different cage forward to our business. We should be able to continue to take out costs through our lean process automation and our investments in AI technology, so net-net tech is going to be a source of spend for us, in that range that I mentioned before as we go forward, but then I think we\u2019re getting very well for it. Our objective is to go head-to-head with the fintech players, the large bank competitors that we have to deal with, and be very successful, and we\u2019ve been able to do that and demonstrate that. When you think about the fintech players that are out there, we\u2019ve got the same capabilities if you look at our products like Momentum, but we\u2019ve also got 53,000 free ATMs, 1,100 banking centers, and 10,000 service personnel that they don\u2019t have, and we\u2019ve got the core relationships.  So net-net, we\u2019ll continue to stay focused, but that\u2019s kind of the range we\u2019re going to operate in. Mike Mayo : That\u2019s helpful. Just one more follow-up. One simple thought - I mean, there\u2019s a debate of how much banks should keep on premise versus off-premise. Clearly you\u2019re going more in the off-premise direction, and it seems like you\u2019re accelerating that. What was the tipping point, what was the biggest factor to say, you know what, we want to have more of the open architecture be off-premise, even though some other banks are saying we want to keep a lot on-premise? Greg Carmichael : You know, I think we intend to transition. Basically, we shed 90% on-premise, and you think about that, sort of the next five years as we look at this, that\u2019s going to shift, as you mentioned before, so 90% on-premise is going to shift to roughly 90% off-premise. Seventy percent of that will be hosted in a private cloud. When you think about platforms like FYS and C&F are all going to be private clouds, in the public cloud AWS about 20%, so you think about the shift, 90% will be an off-premise model and roughly 70% private, 20% public. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW. David Konrad : Hey, I was hoping you could help us out with if there\u2019s any constraint limitations on the balance sheet, meaning as we look at our earnings models over the next couple years and redeploy a lot of the excess liquidity, just wondering, some of your peers have mentioned maybe 30% of earning assets would be the limit of securities, regardless of rate. Just wondering if you thought about a constraint on the securities book, and then also embedded in the securities book, the CMBS portfolio has kind of crept up - now it\u2019s just under 60% of the available for sale. Didn\u2019t know if there--you know, it\u2019s all agency or predominantly agency, but didn\u2019t know if there\u2019s a concentration limit that you\u2019d have on that portfolio as well. Thank you. James Leonard : Yes, thanks for the question, David. The short answer is that when we look at the excess liquidity, call it $30 billion, we expect a third of it to go into the securities portfolio, a third of it into loans, a third of it, we think while the deposits in the banking system may not decline, we do expect those deposits to find a more productive home, perhaps money market funds or other investment vehicles. For us, we\u2019re running at 18% or so in the securities book as a percent of total assets, so if we take, call it $10 billion of the excess liquidity and put it into the book, we\u2019re at 23, 24%. That\u2019s where I\u2019d like to operate, is somewhere 23 to 25% of total assets, but it\u2019s not a capacity constraint. It\u2019s more--I think given the environment, that\u2019s a more productive place to be. In terms of the CMBS, I think the heart of your question is what is the non-agency CMBS portion of the portfolio, and that\u2019s $3.8 billion or so, and again for us it\u2019s super senior tranches. We feel very good about the credit enhancement, 30%-plus there, so not a large credit risk position to have, whereas the rest of the CMBS book would be agency guaranteed. David Konrad : Great, thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back to management for any additional or closing remarks. A - Greg Carmichael : Thank you Angie, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any further questions. Operator : Thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Chris Doll : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today we\u2019ll be discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2021. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third\u2019s performance. We undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I\u2019m joined by our CEO, Greg Carmichael; President, Tim Spence, CFO, Jamie Leonard; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : Thanks, Chris, and thank all you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported full year net income of $2.8 billion or $3.73 per share. We delivered strong financial results throughout the year, while fully supporting our customers, our communities and our employees. We generated full-year adjusted ROTCE, excluding AOCI, of 19%. Additionally, excluding the provision benefit in excess of charge-offs, our ROTCE exceeded 16% and improved more than 130 basis points from last year, driven by record financial results throughout the franchise. We generated record revenue of nearly $8 billion in 2021, which increased 4% compared to 2020, highlighted by strength in commercial, retail and wealth and asset management. Our performance was led by record adjusted fee revenue, which increased 8%. Net interest income was stable compared to last year despite the continued environmental headwinds as we have been disciplined deploying excess cash. Full-year adjusted expenses increased just 2.5% compared to last year, reflecting disciplined expense management throughout the company. As a result of our strong financial performance, we achieved positive operating leverage, excluding security gains and losses and generated an adjusted efficiency ratio below 60%. Credit quality remained strong with historically low full-year net charge-offs of just 16 basis points. Additionally, non-performing loans and criticized assets continue to improve throughout the year, including the fourth quarter. Our credit results demonstrate our disciplined client selection, conservative underwriting and continued benefits from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $662 million or $0.90 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.03 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release. Excluding these items, adjusted fourth quarter earnings were $0.93 per share. Our quarterly financial results reflected strong momentum in most of our businesses. We saw that improved revenues compared to the third quarter. We generated record commercial banking revenue, record treasury management revenue and record wealth and asset management revenue in the quarter. We expect the positive momentum in our business to carry forward into 2022 and beyond. In our commercial business, record loan production of $8.2 billion increased approximately 50% sequentially with record performances in both corporate banking and middle market. Despite the ongoing challenges we are hearing from our customers, including supply chain constraints and labor shortages, production was broad-based across our regions and verticals. From a regional middle market perspective, we generated strong production this year in several markets, including Chicago, the Carolinas, Indiana, Georgia and our expansion markets. From an industry vertical perspective, health care, renewables, retail, technology and financial institutions all continued to outperform.\\ As result of our record production and record new quality relationships, we generated C&I loan growth, excluding PPP of 7% on an average basis or 11% on a period-end basis compared to last quarter. The acceleration of commercial loan growth at the end of 2021, our strong pipeline, new commitment growth, production anticipated from Provide and continued investments in capabilities and talent will also support accelerated loan growth in 2022. In our retail business, we once again generated consistent peer-leading consumer household growth in excess of 3% year-over-year, highlighted by our Chicago and Southeast markets. We continue to add households in every region, reflecting the ongoing success of momentum banking as well as our branch expansion and digital initiatives. Our success throughout our retail business comes down to three factors. First, we are generating smart scale in our local markets. This quarter, we opened 18 banking centers in our key Southeast MSAs, while consolidating four locations throughout our footprint. We have also closed an additional 40 locations in the month of January, primarily in legacy markets. We will continue to leverage our geospatial analytics to optimize our overall branch network, while taking into account evolving customer preferences. We continue to target a branch network allocation of approximately 35% in the Southeast by 2025. Second, we offer differentiated products and services like Momentum Banking, which includes features that enable customers to avoid overdraft fees and get access to short-term liquidity when needed. I'd like to point out with respect to unit fees we have been the lowest among peers with significant consumer banking operations for several quarters. And third, we are delivering an outstanding customer experience as shown by leading third-party surveys. We have improved in the bottom quartile five years ago to top quartile today. We are recognized as the number one bank out of the top 25 banks taking care of our customers during the pandemic. Our balance sheet earnings power remained very strong. Last night to support continued acceleration of our growth and profitability, we announced the acquisition of Dividend Finance, a leading fintech point-of-sale, consumer lender, providing solutions for a highly attractive and growing renewable energy industry. They have strong relationships with a robust contract network, offer sales and project management solutions through a state-of-the-art technology platform, and have a customer footprint focused on prime and super-prime borrowers. They have a coast-to-coast footprint with targeted growth initiatives in the Southeast. By financing consumer renewable energy solutions, combined with our existing leadership in providing renewable solutions to commercial clients since 2012, we are supporting the country's transition to a more sustainable economy and furthering our ESG leadership position among peers. As the only bank among peers that are earning a leadership score from CDP for three consecutive years, we are intensely focused on leading the transition to a sustainable future. Our focus has been recognized by several prominent ESG providers, including MSCI, which recently gave us a three-notch rating upgrade. Whereas our sustained peer-leading household growth, top quartile key metrics, balance sheet management or strong diversified fee revenues, we have established a track record of doing what we say we're going to do. Our execution ultimately produces superior, consistent and sustainable financial performance. Across all of our businesses, our strategic priorities are unchanged. We remain focused on leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation, investing to drive growth and profitability, expanding market share in key geographies and maintaining discipline throughout the company. Before turning it over to Jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook, I'd like to once again thank our employees. I very much appreciate the way you have continued to raise to the occasion to support our customers, communities and each other. This is because of our frontline employees that we were able to keep within 99% of our branches opened since the onset of the pandemic. We gave a special bonus to these employees in the quarter in recognition of their extraordinary and ongoing efforts to provide essential banking services for our customers. This marks the second time during the pandemic that we have recognized the work of our frontline employees through a special bonus. In summary, we believe our strong and highly asset-sensitive balance sheet, diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined management throughout the company will serve us well this year and beyond. We expect to generate positive operating leverage again for the full year in 2022 without adjusting for PPP or other known headwinds. We remain focused on growing strong relationships and managing the balance sheet with a through-the-cycle perspective to generate sustainable long-term value for our stakeholders and maintaining our position as a top-performing regional bank. With that, I'll turn over to Jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook. James Leonard : Thank you, Greg, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our strong quarterly financial results reflect focused execution throughout the bank. The reported earnings included a negative $0.03 impact from the two items noted in the release. We generated solid revenue growth, which resulted in record fee income, combined with another quarter of strong credit quality. As a result, we produced an adjusted ROTCE excluding AOCI of over 18%. Improvements in credit quality resulted in an $85 million release to our credit reserves and an ACL ratio of 185 basis points compared to 200 basis points last quarter. Combined with another quarter of historically low net charge-offs, we had a $47 million net benefit to the provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion increased 1% sequentially, reflecting C&I loan growth, $10 million in seasonal mutual fund dividends and $18 million in prepayment penalties received in the investment portfolio, as well as a reduction in long-term debt. These items were partially offset by lower loan yields and a decline in PPP-related income, which was $36 million this quarter compared to $47 million in the prior quarter. Excluding PPP, NII increased $19 million or 2% sequentially. On the funding side, we reduced our total interest-bearing liabilities cost three basis points this quarter. Compared to the prior quarter, reported net interest margin decreased four basis points, reflecting a $2.6 billion increase in interest-bearing cash and lower loan yields, partially offset by prepayment penalties and mutual fund dividends from our investment portfolio. Excluding the impact of excess cash, NIM was flat sequentially. Total reported noninterest income increased 1% compared to the year ago quarter. As we discussed in early December, reported results included negative valuation marks totaling $22 million, attributable to a $5 million negative MSR valuation as well as a $17 million fintech investment unrealized loss recorded in securities losses that occurred since its October IPO. Similar to our previous holdings of public companies, we will exit our position at the appropriate time. Adjusted noninterest income results exclude the impact of security gains and losses, the Visa swap as well as prior period business disposition gains and losses. Adjusted noninterest income increased 4% sequentially, driven by another quarter of record commercial banking revenue. We generated record M&A advisory fees notably in our healthcare vertical, reflecting successful outcomes from our Coker and H2C teams, combined with strong business lending and syndication revenue. These items were partially offset by lower corporate bond fees. We also generated solid fee revenue growth in treasury management, card and processing and wealth and asset management, where we generated record net AUM inflows in both the fourth quarter and the full year. We were recently recognized as one of the world's best private banks for the third consecutive year by Global Finance Magazine and our results reflected. Additionally, Mortgage banking revenue decreased $51 million compared to the third quarter, which included a $12 million unfavorable impact from our decision to retain $350 million of retail production during the quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter, adjusted noninterest income increased 2% with improvement in every single fee caption reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business as well as the robust economic rebound over the past year. Noninterest income represented 40% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Reported noninterest expenses decreased 2% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily driven by lower occupancy expense as well as lower processing expense reflecting contract renegotiations. Adjusted expenses increased 2%, driven by higher performance-based compensation, reflecting strong business results from record AUM inflows and commercial loan production, elevated medical benefits due to pandemic, loan servicing expenses and continued technology investments. Our expenses this quarter included mark-to-market impacts associated with nonqualified deferred compensation of $10 million compared to less than $1 million last quarter. For the full year, total adjusted fees increased 8% compared to just 2.5% expense growth. Commercial Banking revenue increased 21%. Card and processing revenue increased 14%. Wealth and asset management revenue increased 13% and TM revenue increased 9%, offset by a $28 million reduction from lower TRA income and a 16% decline in mortgage banking. On the expense side, the largest contributor of the growth was elevated performance-based compensation, technology investments and loan servicing expenses. These items were partially offset by the actions we took about a year ago to streamline the organization, including process reengineering, vendor renegotiations, and divestitures of noncore businesses such as property and casualty insurance, HSA deposits and 401(k) recordkeeping. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 1% sequentially, including the PPP headwind. Excluding PPP, portfolio loans and leases increased 3% on an average basis and increased 5% on a period end basis. Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 1% compared to the prior quarter has continued to strengthen auto was partially offset by declines in home equity and other consumer loan balances.  Average commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 2% compared to the prior quarter reflecting growth in C&I loans. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased 4% with C&I loans up 7%. As Greg mentioned, commercial loan production was robust across the board up nearly 50% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting strong corporate and middle market banking production, which was well diversified geographically. As a result, period-end C&I loans excluding PPP increased a 11% sequentially. Revolver utilization of 33% increased 2% compared to the prior quarter. Average CRE loans were down 3% sequentially with lower balances and mortgage and construction driven by elevated payoffs in areas most impacted by the pandemic. As we have discussed before, we continue to have the lowest CRE concentration as a percentage of total capital compared to peers.  Given the rate environment towards the end of the fourth quarter, we began investing a small portion of our excess cash with the average securities portfolio balances increasing 1% sequentially. Average other short-term investments, which includes our interest bearing cash remained elevated, reflecting continued growth in core deposits. Compared to the prior quarter commercial transaction deposits increased 5% and consumer transaction deposits increased 2%  Moving to credit, as Greg mentioned, our credit performance this quarter was once again strong, with fourth quarter net charge-offs remaining historically low. Non-performing assets declined 6% sequentially with the NPA ratio declining 5 basis points. Criticized assets declined 13% sequentially, reflecting a significant improvement from COVID high impact industries.  Additionally, criticized assets declined in virtually every region in vertical and also improved in our leverage loan portfolio. From a product standpoint, we continue to closely monitor CRE including office and hospitality exposures, given the ongoing effects of the pandemic.  Moving to the ACL, our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains stable with unemployment and main our three year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.8%. We did not change our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios given the continued uncertainty during the pandemic. Our ACL release this quarter came primarily from commercial reflecting the improved risk profile of the portfolio. If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $960 million higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $213 million lower. While the economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to continued strength in the economy, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, which could play out given the uncertain environment. In addition to COVID, we continue to monitor the economic and lending implications of the supply chain and labor market constraints that currently exist. Our December 31 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment.  Moving to capital, our capital levels remained strong with the CET1 ratio ending the quarter at 9.5%. During the quarter, we completed $316 million in share repurchases as part of our capital plan, which reduced our share count by 7.3 million shares. Now that we have reached our 9.5% CET1 goal, we are returning to our 2019 CET1 target of 9% based on our improved credit risk profile and the economic outlook. It is worth noting that combining regulatory capital, credit reserves and unrealized gains we have one of the highest overall loss absorbency rates among peers. As Greg mentioned, last night, we announced the strategic acquisition of Dividend Finance. Strategically, Dividend furthers our existing indirect consumer point-of-sale capabilities with a tech-forward platform. Dividend pioneered the financing model, which improves economic outcomes for customers and contractors. This helps accelerate dividend growth in the solar industry which is expected to continue growing at a double-digit CAGR over the next several years. Dividend will improve Fifth Third's loan portfolio granularity, geographic diversification and balance between consumer and commercial loans. Furthermore, while not modelled we expect to generate synergies over time in our mortgage and home equity business as well as with our existing commercial clients. The transaction is also financially compelling. In 2021, Dividend gained market share and originated over $1 billion in loans, which increased 40% compared to 2019. We expect total origination volume of around $1 billion in 2022 post close. Dividend Finance previously utilized an originate-to-sell model. And as a result, the closing of the acquisition will not include a material transfer of loan losses. However, post close, Fifth Third will retain all loan originations. Given the scalability of the business, we expect a life of loan ROA of 3% plus, ROTCE of 30% plus and an efficiency ratio below 20%. Our modelling conservatively assumes a market share consistent with dividend finances recent history, no extension of the federal solar investment tax credit, an annualized net charge offs around 130 basis points. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter and will utilize approximately 30 basis points of capital. Our long term capital priorities remain unchanged. First, deploy capital into organic growth initiatives. Then evaluate strategic non-bank opportunities, continue paying a strong dividend and finally execute share repurchases with excess capital. Given the strong loan growth and the acquisition of Dividend Finance, we currently expect to resume share repurchases sometime in the second half of the year. Moving to our current outlook, our full year guidance includes the financial impacts from Dividend Finance, which is expected to close in the second quarter. We expect full year average total loan growth between 5% and 6% compared to 2021, including the expected headwinds from PPP and the Ginnie Mae forbearance loans we added throughout last year. Excluding these items, we expect total average loan growth between 10% and 11%, reflecting robust pipelines, sales force additions the dividend and provide acquisitions and only a 1% improvement in commercial revolver utilization rates over the course of the year. This should result in commercial loan growth of 12% to 13%, excluding PPP. Additionally, we expect total average consumer loan growth between 6% and 7%, excluding the Ginnie Mae loans. On a sequential basis, we expect first quarter average total loan growth of 3% to 4%, excluding PPP and Ginnie Mae loans. Including those impacts, we expect average total loans to increase 1% to 2% compared to the fourth quarter. Our outlook reflects continued strength in commercial given our production and pipelines. We expect 6% average C&I growth in the first quarter, excluding PPP. We expect CRE balances to be stable sequentially in the first quarter, and as a result, expect average total commercial loan growth of 4% to 5% sequentially, excluding PPP. We expect average consumer loan balances to increase around 1% sequentially, excluding the Ginnie Mae impacts. We provide our expectations for this portfolio in our presentation appendix. Given our loan outlook, we expect full year NII to increase 4% to 5%. It is worth noting that our outlook incorporates the impacts from the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios, which will result in a $220 million headwind next year or about 4.5 percentage points. Meaning, we would have expected close to double-digit growth in NII, if not for those portfolios, which have served their purpose to help bridge us to the more productive rate environment. Given that current rate environment, our forecast assumes growth in our securities portfolio of approximately $1 billion per quarter and includes three rate hikes beginning in May. Due to the evolving economic outlook, our forecast and balance sheet management strategies are subject to change. As a reference point, we estimate that a 25 basis point incremental rate hike would increase NII by approximately $30 million to $35 million per quarter or seven basis points of NIM when fully realized. The ultimate impact to NII of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing of short-term rate movements, balance sheet management strategies, including securities growth and hedging transactions and realized deposit betas. On the topic of deposit betas, our current outlook assumes a deposit beta around 13% over the first 100 basis points of rate hikes, including less than 10% for the first couple of hikes. We have updated our NII sensitivity disclosures in the presentation appendix, which now incorporates a dynamic beta repricing assumption rather than static beta approach previously utilized. The information in the appendix uses modeled approaches to estimate the impacts of various rate scenarios based on decades of historical data. These model betas are 30% for the first 100 basis point scenario and 36% for the plus 200 basis point scenario. For the first quarter, we expect NII to be down 1% sequentially, impacted primarily by day count as well as lower prepayment penalty, PPP and Ginnie Mae income, partially offset by strong loan growth. Given the January 3 forward curve did not consider a March rate hike, if the Fed were to move in March with a run-up in benchmark rates, we would expect first quarter NII to be stable sequentially. We expect adjusted noninterest income to increase 3% to 5% in 2022, reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities resulting in stronger treasury management revenue, capital markets fees and wealth and asset management revenue. Additionally, we expect strong processing revenue, reflecting both the economic environment and continued household growth. Mortgage revenue should improve modestly in 2022, reflecting elevated servicing revenue from MSR purchases throughout 2021 and moderating asset decay partially offset by a meaningful decrease in production revenue. We expect TRA and private equity income to be stable compared to 2021 levels. We expect first quarter adjusted noninterest income to be stable year-over-year or decline around 8% to 9% compared to the fourth quarter. Excluding the impacts of the TRA, we expect fees to be down approximately 3% sequentially, reflecting seasonal factors, a decline in private equity income and lower leasing revenue. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up around 1%, excluding the impact of dividend finance compared to 2021 or up 2% to 3%, including dividend. We expect compensation expenses to increase around 3% or so, reflecting wage pressures and sales force additions, partially offset by lower performance-based compensation in certain areas such as mortgage given the outlook for lower origination volumes. We also continue to invest in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth of around 10%, consistent with the past several years. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid-single-digits area. Our outlook also assumes we add 20 to 25 new branches in our high-growth markets, which will result in high-single-digit growth of our Southeast branch network. We expect these items to be partially offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives, reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio, a decline in leasing expense given the revenue outlook and continued overall expense discipline throughout the company. We expect total adjusted expenses in the first quarter of 2022 to be up around 3% to 4% compared to the year ago quarter or up 5% to 6% compared to the prior quarter. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are also impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, we expect first quarter expenses to be down approximately 2% compared to the fourth quarter. Additionally, our first quarter expense outlook is impacted by a broader and larger special equity grant for eligible employees to reward the record performance in 2021 and to provide a retention incentive over the next several years in this competitive labor market. As a result, our full year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in expenses, resulting in more than a 1 point improvement in the efficiency ratio. Our outlook for positive operating leverage reflects continued success growing our fee-based businesses, recent acquisitions, expense discipline and strong balance sheet management. It also considers the known revenue headwinds from PPP and our Ginnie Mae portfolio. We would have guided to positive operating leverage on a stand-alone basis even without any rate hikes. We expect 2022 net charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis point range and we expect first quarter net charge-offs to be in the 15 to 20 basis points range. In summary, our fourth quarter and full year results were strong. We achieved positive operating leverage in 2021 in a challenging interest rate environment, while maintaining discipline throughout the company. We have a highly asset-sensitive balance sheet, which should perform very well in a rising rate environment, we have over $30 billion of excess cash and continue to grow and diversify our fee revenues, all of which support our through-the-cycle outperformance. We are deploying capital in order to maximize long-term profitability and are committed to generating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning. Operator, please open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : On the loan growth front, clearly, on the commercial side on C&I, very robust on the end-of-period growth, 11% ex the PPP impacts. Can you give us a little more detail on the drivers in terms of the businesses? I know you mentioned corporate and middle market. And then also, do you see any impact from borrowers pulling forward demand for borrowing into the fourth quarter given the change from LIBOR to SOFR? Thanks. Greg Carmichael : John, this is Greg. I\u2019ll start off and with those activities prepared with a lot of color to your question we were expecting of course. First off, we've made significant investments over the last five years in our strategic markets in the Southeast, west Coast, Texas on verticals and talent and so forth. So we would expect to see this type of outcome as we go into last year into this year. So we're very pleased with the performance. We're very pleased with the momentum we have going into it. Once again, I think it's a byproduct of the investments we made in talent, our expansion of these geographies and just the way we've approached this business over the last five years. You're starting to see the outcomes. But Tim will give you more as the markets itself and where we're seeing the outcomes. TimothySpence: Yes, sure. Happy to do it. So let me anchor it to the numbers. So ex PPP, as you mentioned, C&I loan growth was about 11% or on a dollar basis, it was about $4.9 billion point-to-point in the quarter. So of that, about one-third of it came from an increase in utilization on existing revolver and then a full two-third of the growth were a byproduct either of the record production we had. We had a record quarter in addition to it being a record year in both corporate banking and in the middle market or it was new clients funding up commitments that were extended in earlier quarters this year, consistent with the data we have been sharing on commitment growth. So on the utilization front, the lower end of our book tends to move in terms of utilization faster than the corporate banking side. And we did see that middle market and business banking had the best pickup in utilization rates, which is probably at least in part a byproduct to the manufacturing and logistics centric nature of the Midwest markets. But the drivers there when you talk to clients were really inventory levels. There were some tax distributions or business expansion related, people investing in CapEx or acquisitions. On the corporate banking side, it was really the big vertical, but the draws there were most concentrated in the mortgage servicer segment. On the two-thirds of the growth that came from production. I think, as Greg mentioned, they're literally basically entirely driven by the strategic investments. So on, Corporate Banking, it was industry verticals. In the middle market, it was really the sales force expansion in the Southeast through the additions of California and Texas. And then it was strong performance from Provide as they got into the run rate. In total, it really is new relationships, more than it forwards a transition to SOFR. So we added 551 new relationships in commercial in 2021, so about 30% more than our prior high mark at any one point. And I think what we feel very good about is these really aren't just loan-only relationships. They are the driver of what you saw in the strong growth we had on both treasury management and capital markets. I think if you look forward, I was looking at the bottoms-up pipelines earlier this week, and they are about 75% larger than where they were at the same time last year and almost 90% larger than the first quarter of 2019. So we feel very good about our ability to sustain the robust loan growth. And the drivers there, again, are the strategic investments. Chicago is the biggest year-over-year improver as we continue to see strength and the benefits of the synergies from the MB merger. And then its markets like Tennessee, North Florida, California and Texas in the regions. And then on the vertical side, it's the stalwart verticals for us, health care and TMT along with continued really good growth in renewables. And then as we talked about in the past, the mortgage warehouse segment that we launched recently. I think haven't been out in the market. The energy is really good there. I think there's a strong sense for us that between the investments we've made and the fact that we've really been able to focus on execution and collaboration, having had our people back in the office for longer than most and not having the distractions of merger integration or otherwise, it really has been -- it's been nice to see the pickup. John Pancari : Thanks, Tim. And then quickly Greg just on M&A, I wanted to get your updated thoughts on deals. I know you indicated that non-bank acquisitions would be more of a priority. And if so, what additional businesses outside of what you just did on the Dividend Finance side? What are the businesses in terms of bolt-ons? And then maybe a quick comment just on whole bank fields. Thanks. Greg Carmichael : First, thanks for the questions. Our strategy hasn't changed. It's really, as you said, it's the bolt-ons opportunities non-bank transactions, just like we did with Dividend, which we couldn't be more pleased about that acquisition and how it fits into our portfolio of opportunities strategically. But more of those type of opportunities we're going to continue to look for. So point of sale on the consumer side, in addition to that, we're going to continue to focus on wealth and asset management opportunities that might emerge. Obviously, on the cap market side, on the advisory side of the house there's other verticals that we're looking for partners in that space from an advisory perspective. So we'll continue to focus on those opportunities, the fintech plays and the advisory that fits to some of the additional verticals, wealth and asset management will be the areas of opportunity we continue to stay focused on. And when you think about a bank acquisition right now, especially given all the challenges and complexity of what we're seeing in on the regulatory front in Washington with some of the movements that are underway right now and the challenge to get a large transaction done or a bank transaction for banks over $100 billion that's out there. So it's on your mind as you think about the timing to get a transaction done. But once again, at this point right now, our focus is to be relevant in the strategic markets that we're already banking in. There's not many of these opportunities that exist right now. So once again, it's not a primary focus of ours today, and I don't see that in the near future also as we think about the rest of this year. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : My first question is for Jamie. Jamie, you have been vocal in the past in terms of guiding or giving us a sense of what kind of deposit attrition we could expect in a rising rate backdrop. One of your biggest competitors mentioned that we don't expect negative deposit growth at all. In fact, they expect positive deposit growth through this rate cycle. And I'm wondering, especially in light of your commentary that you're deploying about $1 billion of cash per quarter, if you have changed your tune as to the duration of the excess deposits that you gathered during the pandemic? James Leonard : Thanks, Erika, and welcome back to the coverage of Fifth Third. So I appreciate the question. Let me take it in two parts. So first, when it comes to the macro view and for the industry, you go back over the last 100 years, I think there's only been two years where deposits didn't grow in the industry. So I do believe that there can be deposit growth as the Fed tightens and history proves that. So when it comes to Fifth Third, the more idiosyncratic view that we have is that, we would be comfortable having up to one-third of our excess cash migrate away from Fifth Third deposit products and into more productive vehicles for those customers. So with that said, when we look at our deposit betas, our deposit pricing outlook for the rate hikes on the horizon, we're going to be very disciplined on those deposit rates. And therefore, if deposits leave, it's a very manageable outcome for us. However, I will tell you, given our strong commercial client acquisition, our strong treasury management growth and our strong household growth as we sit here today, even with balance and disciplined deposit betas, we still expect deposit growth this year at Fifth Third and that's even with continuing to run down our CD portfolio. As much as I would be comfortable with a little bit of deposit outflow, I think given our sales success, we will have deposit growth this year. Erika Najarian : And my second question is for Greg. I thought it was very striking and telling that Jamie said during his prepared remarks that you would have generated positive operating leverage without rates. And the earnings season has really put CEOs in two camps. One, the CEOs that are spending the rate hikes and second, those that are more allowing it to fall to the bottom line. As we think about Fifth Third and Fifth Third in the middle of a normalizing rate cycle, what is your view of reinvesting later years, right, after the PPP headwinds dissipate versus taking that rate generated additional income and reinvesting it. Greg Carmichael : First of all, we're always going to continue, Erika, invest in the future of this company. We're in it for the long haul. We never do anything focused on the quarter or even for a full year. So we'll continue to invest. Look at our technology investments. It's been running around 10%. You can expect we're going to continue to do that. We're also going to continue to invest in our ability to expand this franchise both geography, product sets through our verticals, capabilities, in our talent capabilities. So we'll continue to invest in those areas. Obviously, wages are another area we're going to have to continue to step up on and be aggressive on which we have been as a leader in the minimum wage going from 12% to 15% to 15% to 18%, we took that pain before most of our peers did. We saw the need to do that. So, as you think about our investment, we're going to continue to invest. But we also believe a lot of the guidance we're giving right now this year, when you think about the first 3, 4 ,5 increases on the rate side of the house, most of that will fall to the bottom line as we already got our investment structure put in place for 2022. Beyond that, we'll continue to think about our investments necessary. You can expect some of that then will start to continue to turn into future investments. But I think as you look at this year, the guidance we provided most of that would fall to the bottom line. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Hi, Jamie, you've been steadfast in your view of holding back on the liquidity deployment, and we see that again this quarter. Just wanted -- as we've seen quite a change in what the potential outlook for rates looks like, any different views here about how you expect to use excess liquidity and look at the securities book going forward? Jamie Leonard : So in the prepared remarks, we talked about deploying $1 billion per quarter into the investment portfolio, a little more detail around our thinking there is that we've been patient. We were fortunate to be able to be patient. We have a very well positioned portfolio heading into the pandemic. And so it's afforded us this opportunity to wait. We've always said we wanted to get to the 2% entry points. And we got that visibility at the back half of December. And so we put some money to work in December, and then we've continued to do that here in January and expect to do it as the year progresses. Should rates continue, the curve continues to steepened, we perhaps could choose to move a little bit faster. And if they dip back down, we may choose to step off the gas a little bit in terms of the investment. But what we're investing in, we're really focused on structure right now. We finished the year with the bullet and locked-out cash flows at 59%. I would expect that number to get a little bit higher as we deploy a portion of the excess cash. So let's call it 40% to 50% of the allotment that we have for the security portfolio currently of $10 billion. So we'll reinvest cash flows. We'll add a little bit of leverage during the course of the year and look for us to do that in more structured product. Ken Usdin : Great. And my follow-up is just 275 exit on your securities portfolio yields. And following on that point you just made about the locked-out cash flows. Can you help us understand how you see that 275 trajecting inside your overall NII outlook in the moment? Thanks. Jamie Leonard : Thanks. Very good question. We expect yields for the portfolio to be in the 260 to 270 range this year, and that's with reinvesting and adding the additional leverage. The one component to the portfolio yield that is a little bit lumpy is the prepayment penalties. It's one of the advantages you get from the bullet structure that we have, and we were the beneficiaries of it in the fourth quarter. We've had a little bit thus far in January, and we would expect some of that as the year progresses. But that's the one item that makes it a little more challenging. But I would expect call it, 5 to 8 basis points of erosion as the year progresses, but then some prepayment penalties bolstering the yield so that we end up in that 260 to 270 range for the year. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Jamie, can you elaborate. You gave some interesting numbers on the Dividend acquisition. When you talk about the life of loans in terms of the ROAs and profitability, can you give us some more information or just elaborate on how you're going to grow that business and why the profitability appears to be so high in that business. James Leonard : I'll start, and then I'll turn it over to Tim to add a little more color, but thanks for the question, Gerard. In terms of the loans and why they scream so profitably. Right now, it's offered as a 20 to 25-year term, the coupon, the customer is paying is in the 3% range. But the tax incentives are significant and allows a merchant discount to be paid and that merchant discount could add as much as 5 percentage points to the yield given that the loans end up being about a five year life. So you end up in the 22%, 23% type of federal benefit as part of the energy tax credit program. So there are some moving parts here. The yield will ebb and flow as a result of how that merchant discount plays out in the ultimate weighted average life, but that is why on the surface. It is a very profitable business more so than some of the other consumer origination channels that we have. And this is an area that we even talked about at several of the conferences in 2021 as a key challenge for Fifth Third is really improving the technology and the distribution around home equity lending and other consumer point-of-sale origination channel. Timothy Spence : Yes. I think to Jamie's point, I mean, point one, Gerard, as it relates to the way that you grow it is it's easier to grow when you have a strong tailwind, and there's no question when you look at the level of investment that's going to go into home improvement over the course of the next five to 10 years focused on sustainability. There is a really significant opportunity. I mean the Dividend's business today has been primarily on the solar panel side of the business. But in addition to that, there's storage, which is a fast-growing sector. There's energy efficiency-related investments, whether that's HVAC or Windows or green landscaping or otherwise. And then I think as we continue to see this push towards electric vehicles, there's a dynamic as it relates to high voltage currency into different parts of the homes than you needed previously. So all those categories are going to be big drivers of secular growth in the broader home improvement sector. And with dividends positioning, and the investments that have been made in this end-to-end technology platform, I think we believe they're pretty uniquely positioned to benefit and to continue to gain share there. I mean this is to call it a point-of-sale platform is almost to understate what it is. It's a fully integrated end-to-end solution that allows contractors to drive quoting to specify the sort of technical details around the installation itself. They're third-party data checks on the appropriateness of what is being installed, given the weather environment and the power generation potential and the local utility rates, which are obviously very customer-friendly, but also a good guardrail for the contractors themselves. They have APIs directly into the largest contractors CRM system. So in many cases, there isn't a third-party point of sale at all. It's just generated out of the iPad application that the contractor is using to begin with. And then all manner of downstream capabilities, including not funding loans until there's actually power coming off of the panels today that provide a really excellent customer experience. So as they come into Fifth Third, they obviously have the benefit of our balance sheet. That's one less thing that these fintech credit mono-lines otherwise would need to do in terms of recruiting bank funding partners. So we should be able to improve the product innovation velocity the way that we have with Provide bluntly. Provide's launched more products in the last six months than they had in the three years prior, okay, on the financing side. I think the other obvious benefit is while we are not believers in the way that some are and the opportunities associated with indirect lending to checking account cross-sell, they are very obvious loan-to-loan opportunities here, whether it's the Fifth Third mortgage servicing portfolio and providing an extension of credit there. We're leveraging our ability to underwrite and manage home equity and to connect that with a replenishable open to buy against what's an instalment alone or otherwise. So I think that is how we -- the first point of growth here is going to be make sure we get the talent. And we'll continue to make investments in the technology platform benefit from the secular growth. And then we're going to add capabilities that a bank can have in this case. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, and then as a follow-up, Jamie, when looking at your balance sheet, obviously, quite low, as for the industry because of the deposit growth you touched on what you think deposits could do. What do you think is an optimal loan-to-deposit ratio for Fifth Third? And how long would it take to reach that level considering the puts and takes of what's going on in the marketplace today? James Leonard : Yes. As you pointed out, it's certainly a low loan-to-deposit ratio in the mid-60s right now. It's certainly far better than I think our -- at least in my career, our highest number was back in 2005. It looks like 120%. So I think the optimal ratio is probably somewhere in between. I'd like to operate the balance sheet in the 85% or so range, which is why we would be willing to have some of the more rate-sensitive deposits run off during the tightening cycle, but also and more importantly is that we do expect significant loan growth as we talked about $10-plus billion could be $13 billion to $14 billion next year. And so that's going to help give a nice notch up in the loan-to-deposit ratio, but it probably takes us a couple of years to get back to the number that we would, I think, like to operate and that would be indicative of a very productive balance sheet. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Jamie, can you speak to whether there's a risk that some of the upward pressure you're seeing on expenses maybe out of your control. If you could just frame your confidence level and being able to manage [technical difficulty] environment such that you continue to achieve positive operating leverage even under different inflation scenarios? James Leonard : Yes. We feel very confident in our ability to manage expenses. It's one of the things that's been a hallmark of the company under Greg's leadership is the expectation that every year, every area has to get more efficient. It's just a base expectation when we go through our planning and you see it in the results. So heading into this year, there's $125 million of savings that I'm highly confident we will achieve through the lean process, automation, through the branch consolidations and the vendor savings. But then as Greg pointed out, we do want to invest in our employees and in our franchise to really drive that revenue growth. So I think we've got a good approach here where we're balancing the revenue growth and sales expansion of the company while leaning out the support functions. And then to your main point of the question when it comes to inflation, wages, we have a stronger merit pool this year, and we have the special equity grant that we mentioned earlier to help improve retention, but that comes at a cost, and that is baked into our guide. And our guide was to be up 1% on a stand-alone basis. The Dividend acquisition adds 1.5 or so to the expense number, which is how we ended up in the 2% to 3% range. But as Greg said, we're really focused on the long-term performance doing the right thing in the long run. And I think our expense discipline helps drive that and it may appear to an outsider when you look at the numbers, that there's not a lot of activity there because things are fairly stable. The reality is we are driving a lot of savings, but we're choosing to reinvest those savings to improve the company for the long run. Bill Carcache : That's helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up for Greg, I wanted to ask a strategic question. When you look at the success you've had with some of the bolt-on deals you've done, do you see a time where you'll want to continue to expand into new markets beyond those you're already in through digital channels without the need for traditional M&A and all the disruption that they can bring? Or are the -- I guess, the focus of -- focusing on your digital investments on serving customers in your existing markets? Gregory Carmichael : First off, every CEO says a relationship bank, but we really live and breathe being a relationship bank as evidenced by our commitment to have our employees back in the office, focus on taking care of the customer. So we think our digital channels. It's really about how we reach our customers and how we service our customers and doing that best-in-class. So right now, we're pleased with the expansion markets that we're focused on right now. As we look at those, there's probably a couple of other markets that we're interested in. If we buy the right talent, we will go into those markets, but it's all based on the talent. I don't see us necessarily leading with a digital play at this point on the consumer side in markets that we're not in today from a brick-and-mortar perspective. I don't see that happening in the near term. I don't think we need to do that. I don't think it's a good business for us. As we mentioned before, we're flushed liquidity. We got strong household growth. The profitability of our retail franchise has never been stronger. So we think the model we have right now which provide the brick-and-mortar services, call center services, both our digital capabilities is the best model for us today. Now obviously, we're not going to be naive and are a barrier ahead to seen as what the future might hold. But if that opportunity presents all that makes sense, we have our capabilities to do those expansions with our technology and they're designed for that. But we'll take advantage of that opportunity if it makes sense at some point in the future if it materializes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Set off the starting gun for loan growth. So what you grew, that 44% annualized commercial loans were up $9 billion. And what you described, I guess, what, one-third drawdown and roughly split on middle market, large corporate. You talked about inventory build and capital expenditures. So I think you gave a nice summary of all that. But what had happened to the supply chain disruptions and the delay in loan growth later when the supply chain disruption go away. Really, the question is why now? Timothy Spence : Yes. I mean, Mike, it's Tim Spence. Hello. No, I think the supply chain issues are still real. We have many clients who say they'd like to be running at inventory levels that are above where they're at. I just think we took share this year. I mean that's the reason I anchor back to this point about our having record new relationship growth, new quality relationship growth into the commercial bank. Anecdotally, when you get into the ground, there wasn't a geographic market that didn't add double-digit new relationships this year, then you go out and you talk to those clients. And then literally, they were house relationships at other places who either associated with the disruption or who felt like they were not getting what they needed in terms of the breadth of capabilities or who follow the banker that we managed to attract into our franchise over time, who chose to move from another financial institution to Fifth Third. So, I think that is the reason that we managed to grow at the rate that we did despite the fact that there are still natural constraints to inventory building. And then we haven't yet seen the pop quite at the level that we expect to see, although we did get some benefit of that associated with the M&A activity. I think the one other thing I would tell you is there was an inflection point this year in our pipelines, when we got people back into the office and we started seeing clients in person, in April of this past year. And the level of activity that we generate through our One Bank model, which is the relationship management model that's been in place here for more than a decade, is really core to the way that we grow business. And I think we saw the outcomes of that over the course of the year in terms of the acceleration of loan growth and production in particular. Mike Mayo : So, not to put words in your mouth, I'm looking for validation. As it relates to loan growth, the pandemic is over. Greg Carmichael : [indiscernible]. Timothy Spence : We're all looking at each other trying to figure out what who is going to take that one. Greg Carmichael : But I do think the supply chain constraints. I think the labor shortages and so forth are here to stay for a while. I don't see that add at all as we go into the year. But I think people are adjusting. I think corporations are adjusting, I think they're figuring out ways to do things more efficiently. As Tim said, there's not a customer we talk to where labor is not an issue. There's not a customer we talked to where they would like to build more inventory faster. But I think we've just done a good job of banking these customers and taking those relationships. But it will still be a challenging environment as we move forward. But we're very optimistic in investments we've made in the geographies and people and capabilities. And we just feel like we've got -- we get the right formula right now. James Leonard : Yes, Mike, I would say that while the pandemic is not over, we're navigating it quite well with all of the strategies that Tim and Greg have laid out and that we're very bullish on that loan growth for 2022 in addition to the Provide acquisition now adding Dividend Finance to the Fifth Third family. Mike Mayo : And then just one clarification. So clearly, you're pursuing build not buy, but part of that decision not to pursue bank deals, you said it's because of the communication of Washington to see about the regulatory scrutiny or mergers over $100 billion. That typically is holding you back some even if you wanted to. Greg Carmichael : Yes, we tell you if we wanted to and if we thought there was a right opportunity, another if that's out there that makes sense that's actionable, I would be very concerned as a CEO to try to introduce an opportunity right now into the regulatory environment with some of the constraints that are out there. I think on how they're thinking about mergers until I get some of those items addressed, dealt with, figured out. I just think it's going to be problematic for a period of time. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: You talked about how overdraft or NSF fee is lower for you guys than peers. I think it was last month and rolled out some changes. Just remind us what the impact to revenues might be this year and kind of longer term? And then is there any kind of additional changes you're thinking of making given some announcements from bigger banks as well? Thanks. Timothy Spence : Yes. Matt, it's Tim. Thanks. So just to recap, I mean, we talked a lot about the fact that we've been among the least reliant banks on punitive fees for a while now and about the fact that, that really was a part of about a three to four year journey that we have been on to improve the checking value proposition and then really to get out of the business of charging customers when something went wrong as opposed to charging them because we've added value and giving them the tools to manage liquidity more effectively. And it was because of all the forces you see people reacting to today.  So yes, I think we've been very clear about what's in the Momentum banking proposition. The fact that it offers the broadest suite of tools to avoid an overdraft that we talked a little bit about in the fourth quarter, the fact that we made changes in October including things like changing posting orders, increasing the de minimis negative balance threshold, lowering the limit on the number of daily occurrences. I think essentially the same things you're hearing from others today. Lastly, the -- one other item that has been on the road map that we are moving forward with is eliminating NSF fees, and we do intend to do that at the end of the second quarter, all those changes are incorporated into the 2022 fee outlook. So you should not expect an incremental negative from Fifth Third associated with the evolution of the way that we think about helping customers manage short-term liquidity. Matt O'Connor: And then separately, a bit of a random question. But you're a very big auto lending bank to consumers. And as we think about car prices being up so much, especially used cars. Have you thought about kind of underwriting a bit different? You've got really good disclosures in your appendix, the LTVs have come down a little bit, might go up a little bit. When I read about used car prices up 40%, 45%, I just think for myself, underwriting to that may not be a great idea. I don't know how you're thinking about that but just being a big player on that. Richard Stein : Yes. Thanks for the question. It's Richard. From an underwriting standpoint, we do think about how values have changed. But I think it's important to understand, we look at supply-demand dynamics for autos. I don't -- we don't think that's going to change in the near-term, certainly. And I think the dynamics around how the OEMs actually produce and sell cars are going to create a continued tightness, if you will, in terms of supply. I don't -- I think the days of the OEMs filling the factory and flooding the market with cars are done they're are going to be more discipline, that' kind of give us -- that' kind of give us more certainty around used car prices overtime. The other thing I'll add is we are a prime and super prime underwriter from an auto perspective. And so while the collateral value is important, it's the quality of the borrower that really stands to all for us, and that hasn't changed for us at all. And we continue to see the tailwinds around the consumer from a quality perspective to be strong. So, no real changes in terms of the underwriting criteria. We were mindful of supply demand dynamics and do consider what car prices will do in the future. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And remind me the mix of new versus used car lending that you did. Greg Carmichael : It's 58-42 used in 2021. Timothy Spence : And I don't think it's ever been outside of the 60-40 one way or the other. Matt O'Connor: Yes. Timothy Spence : We live in the sort of roughly evenly balanced range. Operator : Now we have reached the end of our Q&A session, I would like to hand the conference back to Mr. Chris Doll for the closing remarks. Chris Doll : Thank you, Ludy. And thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the IR department if you have any further questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] 00:35 Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Chris Doll : 00:42 Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the first quarter of 2022. 00:48 Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. 01:09 This morning, I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Greg Carmichael; President, Tim Spence; CFO, Jamie Leonard; and Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein. Following prepared remarks by Greg, Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. 01:23 Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments. Greg Carmichael : 01:27 Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us. Earlier today, we reported first quarter net income of $494 million or $0.68 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.02 impact from the Visa total return swap, the mark-to-market impact over to AvidXchange Holdings. 01:43 Excluding these items, adjusted first quarter earnings were $0.70 per share. During the quarter, we generated strong loan growth, including average C&I growth of up 8%, excluding PPP. We grew core deposits once again with strength in consumer transaction deposits of 4% reflecting our success in generating quality household growth, which increased 3% on a year-over-year basis. 02:09 We also took advantage of attractive market entry points for deploying our excess cash that grew our securities portfolio by approximately $5 billion on an average basis. As a result of our interest-earning asset growth, net interest income increased 1% sequentially, excluding PPP. We had yet another quarter of benign credit quality, reflecting our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting, which resulted in near record low charge-offs of just 12 basis points. In addition to our muted credit losses, NPA remained stable, our commercial criticized assets continued to improve. 02:48 As many of you saw last week, I announced my plans to retire as CEO and transition to Executive Chairman effective July 5th. As part of our thorough succession planning process, I'm excited and proud to announce the Board has unanimously appointed Tim Spence to succeed me as our next CEO. I believe this is the right time for a transition, given Fifth Third's tremendous financial health and performance. Shareholders who have follow Fifth Third for a while, know that when I became CEO, I made a commitment that we would generate strong financial results and performed well through the various business cycles, we improvised our plans on a project North Star, we articulated several key strategic priorities generate strong and sustainable long-term financial results, including optimizing our balance sheet, differentiating our customer experience, growing and diversifying our fee revenues, building on our legacy of digital innovation and maintaining expense discipline. I am very proud of what we achieved. 03:49 We transformed our approach to credit-risk management, centralizing credit underwriting with geographic sector and product level concentration limits. We exited commercial relationships that had a skewed risk return profile totaling $7 billion focusing on high quality relationships with a more diversified and resilient businesses. We deliberately reduced our leverage lending exposure down more than 6% since 2015. 04:16 We remain cautious with respect to our CRE portfolio, with the lowest CRE as a percentage of capital among peers. We maintained our expense discipline, taking actions when necessary, including exiting non-core businesses, which allowed us to prioritize our investments in areas of strategic importance. We invested heavily in our treasury management systems, shifting our focus to building managed service platforms. As a result, we now have the highest TM fees as a percentage of revenue and commitments, and we are the fastest growing among our peers. 04:50 We made significant investments in technology to improve our resiliency and better serve our customers. We build a consumer business that has consistently added households far in excess of our peers in the U.S. average, while also taking our customers\u2019 satisfaction scores from below peer median in 2015 to top quartile today. We grew market share organically in the Southeast and West Coast and established a leading position in Chicago through the strategic acquisition of MB Financial. 05:20 We also invested in strategic nonbank acquisitions like Provide, Dividend, Coker Capital, H2C, Franklin Street and more, to accelerate growth and broaden our capabilities. We structure our security portfolio to generate stable, predictable cash flows that has allowed us to extend in our earnings advantage versus peers. And we focus on generating sustainable value for all stakeholders, including customers, employees and communities. 05:49 From day one, my focus was to build a franchise that would perform well through the cycle, while generating consistent and quality earnings quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year. While some of these decisions impact the near-term profitability at the time, all of these proof points highlight the actions we have taken over the past several years to improve Fifth Third and set us up for long-term outperformance through various business cycles. 06:13 Furthermore, we expect our intentionally asset-sensitive balance sheet to perform extremely well relative to peers in this rate environment. With the revenue benefits of higher rates for August, we are mindful that there are likely to be elevated risk in the overall U.S. economy, which is a fairly aggressively tightens monetary policy the curb inflation, combined with the existing supply chain constraints and labor shortages . However, because of our actions and positioning Fifth Third is a strong as ever and well positioned for long-term outperformance. 06:45 I would just like to say that being the CEO of Fifth Third has been an honor of a lifetime. I'm grateful for the support of the board and all of our employees and I'm incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished. Fifth Third is in great shape and Tim is well prepared to lead Fifth Third into the future. Tim is an outstanding and visionary leader. He is been an integral part of Fifth Third\u2019s leadership team since 2015, helping develop strategies and vision that we are executing with excellence through innovation and technology. 07:13 Before I hand over to Tim, so this is my 29th and final quarterly earnings call. I can also say that I have enjoyed almost all of these discussions about our financial performance and outlook with the honest investor community. I want to say thank you for your confidence that you have given me for my tenure. Also I want to thank our entire leadership team, I have been extremely fortunate to work with such a great seasoned team, which I believe is the best-in-the-industry. We have accomplished together that has been nothing short of remarkable. Thank you. I know that under Tim's leadership, you will continue do great things, inspire others and improve the lives of our customers and well-being of our communities. 07:50 With that let me turn it over to Tim. Timothy Spence : 07:52 Good morning to you all. Thank you, Greg for the kind words . I'm honored to serve as Fifth Third's next CEO and to follow-on the footsteps of an incredible leader like you. I could be more excited about Fifth Third's future. Given my role in the company over the past several years and the strength of our performance, you should expect continuity in our strategic focus areas and then how we run the bank. We will maintain our operational focus, expense discipline and culture of accountability to produce consistent financial results while investing for the future. We will continue to anticipate and respond proactively to demand shifts and new competitive threats, consistent with the actions you have seen us take over the past several years, including our deliberate multi-year reduction in punitive consumer fees before it became an industry topic, the rollout of our award-winning Momentum Banking product suite, which is unparalleled among peers, our differentiated digitally enabled treasury management services to automate accounts payable and receivable launched well before the pandemic. 08:53 Partnerships and acquisitions of FinTech platforms like Provide and Dividend Finance that create national scale and a best-in-class customer experience and our focus on financing renewable energy well before ESG became a mainstream term. More broadly, we will remain mindful of the long-term structural shifts taking place such as the evolving geopolitical environments, population aging, government debt levels and central bank tightening that will create winners and losers over the next decade. No one knows for sure what the world will look like 10 years from now, but it's prudent risk managers we are always contemplating the many potential tail risks, as well as positioning the bank to take advantage of potential business opportunities that will arise. We will also be steadfast in our belief that we are most successful when we take care of all our stakeholders. 09:44 To that end, yesterday, we announced that we are increasing our minimum wage to $20 an hour across our footprint and that concurrently we will provide a mid-year wage increase to employees in our first four job bands. We are taking these actions despite having best-in-class employee retention according to leading research because we recognize that rising costs throughout the economy have a disproportionate impact on our frontline employees who are the face of Fifth Third. In total, more than 40% of our workforce will benefit from these increases, including 95% of our retail branch and operations employees. It is simply the right thing to do. 10:21 In the short term, this will result in roughly $18 million in the incremental annualized expenses. However, as we have seen with our two previous wage increases, we fully expect to achieve stronger financial outcomes from lower turnover, improved workforce quality, lower recruiting expenses and more effective training. As Greg mentioned, our balance sheet and earnings power are extremely strong. From a capital deployment perspective, we will continue to favor organic growth, evaluating strategic nonbank opportunities such as Provide and Dividend Finance paying a strong dividend and then share repurchases. Practically speaking given our robust loan growth, we currently anticipate resuming share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2022. 11:07 On behalf of the entire leadership team, I would like to say thank you to our employees. I'm very proud that in addition to producing solid financial results, we have also continued to take deliberate actions to improve the lives of our customers and the well-being of our communities. I also hope you all feel the same sense of pride that I do in being part of an organization that was just named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, one of just five banks globally. Fifth Third is a great company, because we have great people who live our core values every day. 11:39 With that, I will turn it over to Jamie to discuss our financial results and our current outlook. James Leonard : 11:46 Thank you, Tim and thank all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were solid despite the market volatility during the quarter. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories, deployed excess liquidity into securities at attractive entry points and grew deposits. Expenses were once again well controlled, but fees underperformed our January expectations due to the market environment. 12:13 Improvements in credit quality resulted in an ACL ratio of 180 basis points compared to 185 basis points last quarter, while an increase in loan balances resulted in the net of $11 million increase to our credit reserves. Combined with another quarter muted net charge-offs, we had a $45 million total provision for credit losses. 12:37 Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.2 billion was stable sequentially. Reported results were impacted by lower day count, lower PPP income including a slowdown in forgiveness that resulted in $10 million less than expected PPP related NII, and the expected decline in residential mortgage balances from previous Ginnie Mae purchases. These detriments were offset by the benefit from the deployment of excess liquidity into securities, strong loan growth and the impact of higher market rates. 13:13 Excluding PPP, NII increased 1% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. Total reported non-interest income decreased 9% compared to the year ago quarter, or 7% on an adjusted basis. Similar to peers, our results were impacted by lower capital markets revenue, primarily due to transaction delays, as well as lower mortgage revenue in light of lower origination volumes and gain on sale margins, partially offset by improving MSR asset decay. 13:40 We generated solid year-over-year fee growth in treasury management and wealth and asset management where we produced net AUM inflows again this quarter. Consumer deposit fees were stable as our success generating household growth, offset that continued decline in punitive consumer fees as part of our Momentum Banking offering. 14:08 Non-interest expenses increased just 1% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting continued discipline throughout the company. Compensation expenses were well controlled with the year-over-year increase reflecting the previously announced broad-based restricted equity awards, which will support the continuation of our strong employee retention. We also continue to invest in the ongoing modernization of our tech platforms. These items were partially offset by lower card and processing expense due to 2021\u2019s contract renegotiations. 14:45 Adjusted expenses increased 2% sequentially, driven by the special equity award and the usual seasonal increase in compensation and benefits expense. Our expenses this quarter included a mark-to-market benefit associated with non-qualified deferred compensation plans of $12 million with a corresponding offset in securities losses. 15:09 Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 4% sequentially. Average total consumer portfolio loans increased 2% compared to the prior quarter as strength in auto originations combined with growth in residential mortgage was partially offset by declines in home equity and other consumer loan balances, primarily from GreenSky balance runoff. 15:37 Average commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 5% compared to the prior quarter, primarily reflecting growth in C&I loans. Excluding PPP, average commercial loans increased 6% with C&I loans, up 8%. Commercial loan production remains strong and in-line with our original expectations. Production was strongest in core middle market, which was well diversified geographically, which increased over 60% year-over-year. 16:09 Our production and pipelines continued to reflect our strategic investments in talent and our successful geographic expansion, as we sustained our record pace in adding new quality relationships during the first quarter. With muted payoffs and higher revolver utilization rates reflecting the capital market slowdown, period endcommercial loans excluding PPP increased 5% sequentially, and 13% compared to the year ago quarter. Over half of the sequential period end growth was due to existing revolvers with the utilization rate increasing 2% to 35.5%. 16:50 Given the market opportunities in the first quarter, we began deploying excess cash to protect against the rising risk of an economic downturn. During the first quarter, we grew our securities portfolio approximately $13 billion. On an average basis, securities increased $5 billion, or 13% sequentially. As we have said over the past two years, our balance sheet positioning allowed us to remain patient and not grow the portfolio at historically low interest rates caused by the extraordinary Federal Reserve intervention. 17:27 The past 90 days have absolutely validated our decision to patiently wait, but our actions this quarter and beyond will ensure our strong through the cycle performance under various rate scenarios over the long term. Our investments continue to focus on adding duration and structure to the portfolio with stable and predictable cash flows. Consequently, our overall allocation to bullet and locked-out structures increased from 59% to 64% at quarter end. 17:59 Average other short-term investments, which includes our interest-bearing cash decreased $6 billion, reflecting the growth in loans and securities, partially offset by continued core deposit growth. Compared to the year ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits increased 5% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 11%, reflecting our continued success growing consumer households. We once again added households in every market compared to last year led by our key Southeast markets. 18:34 Moving to credit. As Greg mentioned, our credit performance this quarter was once again strong with NPAs at 47 basis points and net charge-offs at 12 basis points. We continue to closely monitor areas where inflation and higher rates may cause stress. As Greg also mentioned we have deliberately reduced our highly monitored leveraged loan portfolio for this very reason, which is now below $3 billion in outstanding\u2019s. while also significantly improving the quality of the portfolio. 19:09 Moving to the ACL. Our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains stable with unemployment ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.7%. We maintained our scenario weights of 60% to the base and 20% to the upside and downside scenarios. Our ACL build this quarter reflected strong loan growth and a worsening downside economic scenario, partially offset by improvements in the credit risk profile of the loan portfolio, including a reduction in borrowers and prolonged distress. 19:49 If the ACL were based 100% on the downside scenario, the ACL would be $1.1 billion higher. If the ACL were 100% weighted to the baseline scenario, the reserve would be $236 million lower. While our base case expectations point to continued economic growth, there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario, including escalating geopolitical tensions, which could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strained supply chains, pressures from the Fed's quantitative tightening or additional COVID variants, which could play out given the uncertain environment. Our March 31st allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment. 20:41 Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.3%, above our stated target of 9%. The decline in capital was primarily due to strong RWA growth in light of the robust organic business opportunities and securities purchases combined with an 8 basis point impact from the CECL capital transition rule. We expect to close the acquisition of Dividend Finance in the second quarter, which will deploy approximately 30 basis points of capital. Our tangible book value per share excluding AOCI increased 1% during the quarter and 5% compared to the year ago quarter. 21:27 Moving to our current outlook, which includes the financial impacts from Dividend Finance. We expect full year average total loan growth between 5% and 6% compared to 2021 including the expected headwinds from PPP and the Ginnie Mae forbearance loans we added last year. Excluding these items, we expect total average loan growth of around 10% reflecting strong pipelines, sales force additions, the Dividend and Provide acquisitions and stable commercial revolver utilization rates over the remainder of the year. This should result in commercial loan growth of 9% to 10%, or 15% to 16% excluding PPP. 22:15 We now expect total average consumer loans to be stable in 2022, reflecting our first quarter decision to lower auto loan production in order to enhance our returns on capital. We now expect around $8 billion in auto and specialty production for the full year, which will still result in double-digit growth in indirect consumer secured balances in 2022. Our outlook also assumes modest growth in other consumer loans, reflecting the benefits of Dividend Finance, partially offset by a 20% decline in GreenSky loans. 22:56 On a sequential basis, we expect second quarter average total loan growth of 2% to 3% comprised of 3% to 4% commercial balance growth and stable consumer balances. We expect 5% to 6% average C&I growth in the second quarter, excluding PPP. We expect our average securities portfolio to increase approximately $10 billion in the second quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made later in the first quarter combined with the assumption that we have $2 billion more in balances given the market opportunities we have seen through early April. We also assume $1 billion in additional securities growth in both the third and fourth quarter. 23:48 Given our outlook for earning asset growth combined with the implied forward curve as of April 1st, we now expect full year NII to increase approximately 13% to 14%. It is worth noting that our outlook incorporates the impacts from the run-off of the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios, which resulted in a $220 million headwind this year. Excluding those portfolios, NII growth would exceed 18%. Our current outlook assumes stable to slight growth in deposit balances in 2022 compared to 2021 with continued strong growth in consumer deposits in the mid-single digits offset by the expected run off of non-operational commercial deposits. 24:43 We expect deposit betas of around 15% on the first 125 basis points of Fed rate hikes. The 25 basis points, we saw in March combined with another 50 basis points in both May and June. While we remain confident in the quality of our deposit base, the rapid and aggressive policy response by the Fed to curb inflation, including the potential for 10 rate hikes from March 2022 to March 2023 and aggressive Fed balance sheet reductions. We expect deposit betas of approximately 25% over the first 200 basis points this cycle compared to the mid-30s last cycle. The ultimate impact to NII of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of interest rate movements, balance sheet management strategies including securities growth and hedging transactions, and realized deposit betas. 25:46 For the second quarter, we expect NII to be up 11% to 13% sequentially, reflecting strong loan growth, the impact of securities purchases and the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet. We expect adjusted non-interest income to be stable to down 1% in 2022 compared to our prior expectations of up 3% to 5%. This change is primarily driven by the change in our rate outlook. The single biggest line contributing to the change as deposit service charges, which is reflective of incremental earnings credits in light of the higher interest rate environment. The rate environment has also impacted our outlook for mortgage revenue, which we now expect to be down 10% or so in 2022 compared to 2021. 26:39 We continue to expect strong but slightly lower than January expectations in commercial banking fees and private equity income in 2022 provided resolutions of the temporary delays experienced in the first quarter occur. It is worth noting that even with the decline and expected fee income primarily due to the interest rate environment, we expect total revenue to now be approximately $275 million more than our January guidance. 27:12 We expect second quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 8% to 9% compared to the first quarter or down around 1% compared to the year ago quarter. We expect full year adjusted non-interest expense to be stable on a standalone basis, or up 1% to 2% including the impact of Dividend Finance compared to 2021, which is an improvement from our previous guidance of up to 2% to 3%. We continue to strategically invest in our franchise, which should result in low double-digit growth in both technology and marketing expenses. 27:52 Our outlook also assumes we add 25 new branches primarily in our high growth Southeast markets. Our guidance also incorporates the minimum wage increase to $20 per hour that Tim mentioned. We expect these investments in our people, platforms and franchise to be partially offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives, reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio, a decline in leasing expense given our disposition of LaSalle Business Solutions, which was completed in April and our continued overall expense discipline throughout the company. 28:35 We expect total adjusted expenses in the second quarter to be down around 3% to 4% compared to the first quarter, which is up 2% compared to the year ago quarter, due to the acquisitions of Provide and Dividend Finance or stable on a stand-alone basis. As a result, our full-year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth is expected to significantly exceed the growth in expenses, resulting in nearly 3.5 points of improvement in the efficiency ratio. 29:12 Our outlook for significantly delivering on our positive operating leverage commitment reflects our recent acquisitions expense discipline and strong balance sheet management. It also considers the known revenue headwinds from PPP and our Ginnie Mae portfolio. We continue to expect second quarter and full year 2022 net charge-offs to be in the 20 basis points to 25 basis points range. 29:37 In summary, we continue to take actions to further strengthen our balance sheet positioning for this environment. We are deploying excess cash prudently into both loans and securities to support continued through the cycle-out performance and have a lot of momentum in our businesses to have a very successful 2022. 29:57 With that let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : 30:02 Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. 30:17 Operator, please open the call up for questions. Operator : 30:21 [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Scott Siefers : 30:35 Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hi, Jamie, I appreciate -- hey, [indiscernible] I guess, first of all, I hope that Greg and Tim congratulations to both of you, best wishes. Greg as you go forward and Tim in the new position. Timothy Spence : 30:50 Thank you. Scott Siefers : 30:52 Yeah. Jamie, appreciate all the thoughts on sort of liquidity deployment, I guess now that you've deployed sort of a majority of the target and roughly $10 billion or so in excess liquidity and the rest will be deployed through the remainder of the year. Is there in your mind sort of an opportunity to kind of redefine what you're excess liquidity looks like? In other words, deposits aren't really coming out of the system as large the way one might have thought earlier? Is there a point at which you say, hey, those are going to stick around and there sort of user or will they just be absorbed with loan growth et cetera. Just maybe any thoughts there? James Leonard : 31:30 So it's a good question and thanks for asking, Scott, I probably should have included it in my prepared remarks, but I have recalibrated our excess liquidity given the first quarter's activity to where we're sitting on about $15 billion of excess cash here in April. I still like the one-third, one-third, one-third approach, where perhaps a third of it runs off in the commercial deposit book is the Fed starts to move in 50 basis point increments. And then, a third in additional security purchases, so $5 billion more during the course of this year. And then, obviously, the rest in loan growth especially with Dividend coming on board, where we expect continued nice loan growth throughout the year. Scott Siefers : 32:19 Okay. Perfect. And then, you gave some thoughts on sort of the puts and takes in the expense outlook. I guess, so nice to see that you can absorb that minimum wage increases still improve the expense guidance. Are there any areas where you guys exclusively dial back things outside of compensation increase or but I guess sort of maybe just a little more thought on the puts and takes as you see them? James Leonard : 32:46 Yeah. The puts and takes this quarter relative to the January guide really is the interplay of the rate environment between fees and NII, whereas expenses, the main driver of the improved expense base on a stand-alone basis was really the fulfillment costs and related compensation related to the lower fees, but the rest of the franchise in our approach to managing expenses during the year really hasn't changed from when we started the year. We continue to focus on technology investments and supporting our marketing efforts and so the marketing spend is actually a little bit higher as we look out at the year given the strong growth, we've had in consumer household acquisitions and the Momentum Banking product. Obviously, the minimum wage adjustment was a little bit of an uptick in expenses, but again offset by some of the savings from the lower fee guide. So overall, I think the approach remains the same, which has continued to invest in the business and continue to let that strong momentum show up in the rest of the balance sheet activities. Scott Siefers : 34:02 Perfect. All right. Good. Thank you very much. Operator : 34:06 Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Erika Najarian : 34:15 Hi. Good morning. My first question is that really for Greg and Tim. Greg, congratulations on your retirement. I'm wondering sort of why you decided now would be a good time to step aside. And Tim, maybe just as a follow-up to that, what are you most excited about as you look forward outside of macro in terms of the growth prospects for the bank that you're inheriting? Greg Carmichael : 34:44 Thanks for the question. First of all, I think it's really a perfect time for to me to be stepping down as CEO. The bank is in fantastic shape. I became CEO in 2015. The objectives we put in place to be good through cycle, make the changes that lead to for outperformance through the cycle. I feel really good about. So, position of the bank, our business for the future of the success we've had, it's a great time to step aside. Second thing is Tim\u2019s readiness. Tim's worked in the bank, six plus years, it's been succession, I think well final succession plan. Tim is absolutely ready and the time is now for him step up given the forms of bank. And third thing is my personal aspiration retire at age 60, which I turned 60 in January and that's always an aspiration mine to be able to be able to do that. And there's a lot of things I want to focus on, lot as travel on the personal side, personal investments and 60 was kind of my timeline also. So that would not have been work if Tim was already in the bank was position as well as also it really came together to right time. Timothy Spence : 35:51 Yeah. Erika, as it pertains to your question for me, I\u2019m excited about a lot. We are in as good a shape as Fifth Third has been at any point since I have been around the company, including the several years that I spent outside the bank as a consultant to the bank and Greg. And I think we have assembled to really outstanding bench of leadership talent, right. We talk a lot about experience being a team sport here. So you have deeply experienced folks from inside the company, you have folks who have joined from outside the bank who brought in fresh perspectives and it really helped us to think about how we shape the business going forward. 36:34 And if you think about the long-term objective, we set for ourselves, which is to outperform through the cycle. I think all the pieces parts are in place. We have a great culture of expense discipline. We've inculcated a credit discipline that will support through the cycle performance. We have been investing continuously. I think sometimes maybe we haven't got an enough credit for it because we have essentially been harvesting expenses in some areas and redeploying them and grow. And the byproduct of that is, we have a really excellent footprint and a nice balance between the Southeast and the Midwest. And we're seeing bloom coming for many of the investments we've made in digital capabilities. I think, in particular, with a focus on product innovation, right, whether that is Momentum Banking and the differentiation that, that is Provide and supported has provided to our household growth goals where the managed services, which as Greg mentioned in his prepared remarks that help to really drive the right balance in fees to total revenue. 37:33 And then I think last but certainly not least the benefits we're going to continue to see from the acquisitions that Provide and Dividend in terms of providing sustainable loan growth was really attractive ROAs. So, I do have lots to feel good about here. Erika Najarian : 37:48 Got it. And the second question is for Jamie. Jamie, AFS has become a bad word this quarter and I'm wondering, you've always had a very distinct investment policy. If you could explain to the generalist that are listening to this call. There have been distressed about the CET1 erosion that they've seen at the big banks for it's been relevant and then the role the AOCI in other regional banks impacted tangible book. What you bought in the quarter to $10 billion and the difference between duration risk or CMBS and RMBS? And also if you could translate into generalist language, what bullet and locked-out structures mean? James Leonard : 38:35 I think, I can take the next hour of this call and go through those but this tells you how difficult question it is. Jump in if I don\u2019t touch on all aspects of it, but I guess, I would start with saying and maybe I'm fighting a losing battle on this one, but I do struggle with the concept of fair valuing one line item of the balance sheet, but not the rest of it or not evaluating HTM in combination with AFS because philosophically for me, as a category four bank. Our election to put a security in the AFS or HTM doesn't change the economics or the risk of the investment. And I understand, the largest banks there is value in minimizing the risk of the regulatory capital volatility, but for us, well below $700 billion in assets, we believe the benefits of maintaining the flexibility to manage the portfolio as the environment unfolds or our outlook changes create significant value. 39:42 And you've seen that over the last eight years where we've had the number one performing investment portfolio yield in the industry. So I struggle with the concept of what our company be worth more if I place the securities into the Roche Motel of HTM or if I maintained by flexibility in my optionality and put it in AFS, but I understand that's how the valuation work. Our goal is always to optimize the balance sheet to deliver long-term real economic value and not make decisions, but optimize accounting outcome over economic value. So that's why we continue to pull it all of the securities and AFS because we like the optionality. In terms of what we're buying -- the second part of your question, we do like the bullet and locked-out cash flow structure so that there is a minimal extension risk in that security relative to RMBS. Probably the best example for the generalist on that would be our duration was 4.8 years at the end of the year and it moved to 5.4 years at the end of this quarter. All of that duration extension was because of the securities that we purchased, we averaged 2.5 yield and 6.5 year duration on what we purchased. So all of our duration extension was intentional and we prefer to add duration when we want to add it as opposed to the market foreseeing that duration extension upon us and that's really the value of the bullet and the locked-out cash flow. And I'll sacrifice a little bit of yield in a base environment but I protect the volatility on up rates or down rates and that's really the philosophy of managing the investment portfolio. Erika Najarian : 41:40 Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : 41:44 Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : 41:53 Hi. Just, -- I\u2019m saying questions if that's going to clarify there. So you've deployed or what 60% of your excess capital -- excess cash, I'm sorry and now you have about 40% of the excess cash to deploy from year? How we should think about this? James Leonard : 42:14 Yeah. I looked at it Mike is, I had a $35 billion of excess cash, I bought 13 of additional leverage in the quarter. Got about 15 left, net of loan growth for second quarter purchases and additional cash deployment as the year progresses. And I think to Scott's question early on, there is an opportunity to perhaps that other $5 billion of run-off in deposits doesn\u2019t occur as offset by growth in other areas, but for now that's how we see the year playing out. Mike Mayo : 42:46 And then to the other question for the CEO change, Greg, you gave a summary of what you've accomplished over the last seven, eight years. Anything that you say if you had more time, you'd like to have achieved? And then Tim, more like who -- who is Tim Spence, right? What is your background? Maybe Greg, why did the Board select Tim? What are the unique characteristics for Tim to be steward of Fifth Third's shareholders capital for the next several years for? Thanks. Greg Carmichael : 43:23 Absolutely, right. First of all, I think, we accomplished the objectives that I set out for as we talked about and we put project those where in place. I'd like to done more faster you're probably, but you will see an ability of the organization absorbed amount of change that we're bringing forth was important also. So I think we did it the right way it\u2019s not a whole lot, I would have changed or done differently. I'm sort of very probably accomplished as Jamie said and Tim said, , it's a team sport and we've got a great organization. We've worked hard to put a great organization and great team around Tim. 43:56 Why Tim, right now? Absolutely, the right person. Tim has a strong technology background. He has been instrumental into other acquisitions and the investments that we've been in this space. He has great, great abilities to look ahead. Understand and assess the challenges that we're going to be faced with now one year, two years, but five years down the road. So you think about our bank needs going forward, strong technology, expertise, but also beneficiary being able to see down the road or with the challenges might be that we're faced with and also execution. Tim is fantastic on the execution side you can be the great visionary, great strategist but if you cannot execute, you are not to be successful. Tim demonstrated over the years especially as present and he can execute extremely, extremely well. Once again, if that wasn't the case, we wouldn't be making this transition at this time. But he is absolutely ready, he is the right person. The reason I just said, I couldn't be more excited. I'm a large shareholder. I\u2019m going to be a large shareholder to have Tim at the helm forward. And I\u2019m excited about starting the next phase of my life, which is retirements of retirement I worked hard to achieve at early age and I think it's just a great, great time for both of us. Mike Mayo : 45:06 Okay. I'll requeue. I\u2019ve some more tech questions. Thanks. Operator : 45:11 Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Betsy Graseck : 45:19 Hi. Good morning. James Leonard : 45:23 Good morning. Betsy Graseck : 45:25 Okay. A couple of questions, first on C&I. I noticed in the deck that ex-PPP you were up 8% QQ. And I just wanted to see if you could unpack the drivers a little bit. One of the reasons is, inventory build is going up, how much longer can that last? I've got a colleague internally who is telling me that inventories are about peaking and I'm wondering, if you agree with that or not? And maybe give some sense of what you're seeing in your customers desire for CapEx and what the runway is on that? Thanks. Timothy Spence : 46:00 Yeah. Sure. Betsy. This is Tim. Thanks for the question. So I think you have to think about our C&I business is being the corporate banking business and the middle market business. So I think, very clearly the corporate banking side of the business that rising utilization there is at least in part a byproduct of the capital markets having been influx and I do anticipate that as the markets are opened up and that folks that we bank who are issuers on a regular basis. Go back into them that you'll see more fee income and then in turn a little bit less utilization. But there is no question inventory build there. Core middle market, I think there is still room to run on inventory build but there is no question that the catalyst for us in terms of our own growth has been now that the focus on CapEx in particular, investments that are going to drive labor productivity or at a minimum, a reduction in labor requirements. 47:00 And then in addition to that we have benefited now and are continuing to benefit from what was a record pace of adding new quality relationships. Last year, which is carried over into the first quarter that Jamie and Greg and I were laughing before the call. It's really, it's the 4Cs for us at Cincinnati, Chicago, the Carolinas and California plus Tennessee and we couldn't figure out how to get to fee out of that one, but that drove the outperformance and C&I production in the first quarter. Betsy Graseck : 47:33 Okay. I guess, Tennessee, so maybe at the end of that. Timothy Spence : 47:36 Yeah. There you got Tennessee, exactly. Betsy Graseck : 47:40 And then maybe you could help me understand how you're thinking about deposits and deposit moving from here, you get the Fed QE that then you\u2019ve got your high quality book and so, how should we be thinking about deposit growth and what the loan to deposit ratio should look like as we progress over the next year or so? Thanks. James Leonard : 48:03 Yeah. We certainly expect the loan-to-deposit ratio to what I'll say improve get higher. We finished the quarter at 69% and really the interaction between the loan-to-deposit ratio and the deposit betas is obviously, highly correlated. And as we entered the last tightening cycle at third, we were in the mid-90s. So we don't expect to get that high in this over the next couple of years, but we certainly would like to manage the company in the 80s from a loan-to-deposit ratio, but it will take a little bit time to get there. I think from a deposit activity standpoint, we expect continued strong consumer deposit growth and then we're forecasting and perhaps it's conservative, a run-off in the non-operational deposits within the commercial book is, we're just not going to chase rate sensitive non-relationship deposit balances. 49:06 But with that said, I really like the balance sheet that we've put together over the last seven years where we've really improved the primacy within the consumer book as well as the granularity through the household growth along with the improvements in the operational deposits through our strong treasury management business. I know we've talked about at different conferences over the course of the year the strength of our TM business, but that ultimately will pay off as rates start to rise and we can perhaps manage to a lower beta in the next 200 basis points than what we saw with the start of the 2015 hikes. Betsy Graseck : 49:48 And the non-operational, you size that. James Leonard : 49:54 I'm sorry, I couldn\u2019t... Betsy Graseck : 49:56 The non-operational deposits you've sized that. James Leonard : 50:02 Yeah. Betsy Graseck : 50:03 Okay. Thanks. Operator : 50:07 Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Ken Usdin : 50:14 Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Jamie, just a following up on the securities portfolio purchases, now that you've both move more in and also rates have moved higher. I wonder if you could just level set us relative to your comments last quarter about where you think the securities book yields go over the course of the year -- year end [indiscernible]. Can you just give us kind of an updated level set on how that trajectory, given the better front book yields that you've been able to see? James Leonard : 50:44 Yes. We expect the investment yields to be in the 2.75 area in the second quarter as well as for the full year, which is up, obviously from the guide we had in January in the 2.60 to 2.70 range. Ken Usdin : 51:00 Perfect. Great. And then second question on a deepening on the expense side. So the expense guide got a little better for the full year even with the incremental minimum wage. Could you just kind of give us some granularity on what was the rest of the delta, was it incentive comp or related to fees? Was it just incremental efficiencies that you've been able to find just a details there would be great? Thank you. James Leonard : 51:25 It's predominantly the fulfillment costs within mortgage and incentives in the other businesses that were impacted by the lower fee outlook. And then, partially offset by the higher marketing expenses and the minimum wage increase impact. Ken Usdin : 51:46 Okay. Got it. So everything else related to like brands, branch savings et cetera., technology spend is intact underneath the surface? James Leonard : 51:54 Correct. Yeah. Ken Usdin : 51:56 Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : 52:01 Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Ebrahim Poonawala : 52:09 Hey. Good morning. I guess one question just around, as we think about capital deployment, future M&A. Just to talk us around how and maybe Tim, if you want to jump in, how you think about adding scale for your obviously organically growing in the Southeast, talk to us about like bank M&A, is there any appetite for that? And then how does that fit in, when you think about technology and I know, Tim has spent a lot of time on payment and strategy? So just some perspective around how you see Fifth Third position on the tech stack and what are the one or two big sort of areas that you are looking to invest as we think about the next couple of years? Greg Carmichael : 52:54 Okay. A lot of questions. Let me get started here. First off, when you think about deploying capital, we have not changed I would think about. Number one is organic growth that's extremely important is the expansion in Southeast and the West Coast, investing in our people, technology, products, services, job one is organic growth, billion quality franchise for the future that performed well. Second, we look at non-bank M&A transactions. So opportunities like Provide, Dividend Finance, H2C, Coker, Franklin will be examples of non-bank opportunities that really add to our products and service capabilities, that's extremely in our reach extremely important to us. We're always looking for those type of opportunities that make us a better bank, and that\u2019s number two. 53:36 Number three, more obviously, want to continue to pay a strong dividend. Number four, with excess cash will be share repurchases. Lowering our part would be M&A. Now why is M&A bank M&A lower on our progress of us. Quite frankly, there's not a lot of opportunities out there. And we will believe M&A is a strategy unto itself. We think, M&A is a strategy, which will support our strategic direction. When you look at some of the transactions that we've done recently, we did not participate those type of transactions. So once again if there was an opportunity from a bank M&A perspective, they have to fit into our strategic objectives such as the larger and more relevant the Southeast and attractive markets. There is just not lot of those opportunities that exist today. That's why it\u2019s lower in our priority list. It doesn\u2019t mean if something did emerge that fits into our strategic direction, makes us more relevant to Southeast in a right markets that we're looking for and is a good cultural fit that we wouldn't consider it. We actually we consider it. It's just lower on our prior list because there is not a lot of opportunities out there that really fit or we should be trying to accomplish that we think are actionable. So that's why it\u2019s lower in the list for us. But once again it's something emerge, we will obviously assess that for long-term strategic shareholder value when we consider it. Timothy Spence : 54:53 Yeah. And moving forward towards, I concur with all that, I think we said for a long time that we don't believe that scale is an and in another itself and that certainly will be consistent in terms of our point of view on how we proceed. As it pertains to your questions about technology, you can think about the investments that we have been making and basically three areas. One is, just the core infrastructure, right. We talked a lot about data centers. We've talked a lot about the cloud data strategy. We talked a lot about information security and otherwise. I think we feel very good about where we're at on that front. We are making good progress. I can't remember the cricket analogy, Simon have to go with middle innings, but we are in the platform modernization front, okay. And I think feel very good about the migration away from legacy mainframe platforms and on the platforms that allow us to spend a lot more of our money on new application development as opposed to maintenance and service. 55:54 And then I think the thing that's probably been less, there has been under emphasized in our industry in general, but which is a big point of focus for ours. We are believers that the more fundamental disruption associated with the Internet in all sectors, is the way that it informs product and product innovation. So that is the area where I think we will continue to look to differentiate. We have to be good at all of the other items. There are hygiene factors, but it's the opportunities to leverage technology to change the nature of the value proposition that we have for our customers. The way that we did with Momentum Banking when we launched a year ago. And as we continue to hone and refine and add feature functionality to that platform. The things that the folks have provide have done over time that they -- where they have actually been able to accelerate the amount of innovation that they brought to market. We launched five or six new products within the first six months that they were on board and they had gotten two or three out in the prior few years beforehand. And then the managed services, which are obviously a critical platform for us and which provide really stable and high margin fee income. Ebrahim Poonawala : 57:09 Thanks for the comprehensive response. One quick follow-up. Jamie, sorry if I missed it, did you mention what the dollar amount was for the non-operational deposits? James Leonard : 57:17 We did not, but it's baked into the $5 billion of outflow that we're assuming occurs during the course of the year. So, sorry, I didn't answer that more clearly with Betsy's question. Ebrahim Poonawala : 57:30 Understand. Greg and Tim, congratulations. Thank you. Timothy Spence : 57:33 Thank you. Operator : 57:35 Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Matt O'Connor: 57:42 Good morning. Could you guys talk about how C&I spreads are trending? I know a few quarters ago, you were talking about pressure, but we've seen obviously widening spreads in capital markets, which is a perfect indicator, but certainly better to widen the narrow. And on the flip side, as rates go up, there's obviously more spread to potentially probably where does you think about competitive forces? So, maybe what you're seeing now and how you think will trend next few quarters? Thank you. James Leonard : 58:13 Yeah, Matt. It's Jamie. Thanks for the question. The C&I spreads or definitely stabilized during the course of the first quarter, such that the C&I yields ex-PPP were only down 4 basis points as opposed to some of the double-digit types of declines you saw in other quarters. So we feel good about stabilization of loan yields. And in fact for the balance sheet hitting an inflection point in the second quarter for pretty much every asset class, but yields and spreads should be improving as we go forward from here. Matt O'Connor: 58:55 Okay. And then as we think about, I guess specifically like on the spreads like yields will go up obviously rates are going up, but then a lot of banks are -- all banks are trying to grow kind of the core C&I which has been trying to Fifth Third for years. So how do you think some of the spreads trend the next few quarters between the puts and takes off again capital markets you've seen some spread widening but competitive forces from the banks? James Leonard : 59:19 Yeah. I think C&I spreads in the second quarter stable flat and then improvement perhaps as we get to the back end of the second quarter heading into the second half of the year, given some of the disruption in the capital markets and the spread widening from the geopolitical tensions, that's how we have a model going forward. Matt O'Connor: 59:42 Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : 59:44 Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Gerard Cassidy : 59:50 Good morning, everyone. Greg Carmichael : 59:53 Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : 59:56 Greg and Tim congratulations on the new roles for both of you. Jamie, I always appreciate your color commentary about the balance sheet and the asset liability sensitivity as well as the expectations you have for the full year as well as the second quarter and the world has changed dramatically in this first quarter as evidenced by your assumptions on the Fed funds rate and the powerful impact that has had on net interest income. Can you share with us, if we're here a year from now, then Greg will be drinking a pina colada in the Caribbean and we know that. But for you [Multiple Speakers] What should we really focus in on a year from now that could be a starling. Is it just breathtaking how it's changed and it's not just for you folks, of course, it\u2019s everybody. But I'm just taking the back at how strong everyone's net interest income growth is now because of the rate environment changed and I\u2019m wondering a year from now, what could it be like that could make us stay up late at night worrying? James Leonard : 61:07 I think a year from now and really the value that we see from our actions this quarter is just how well positioned our balance sheet is to perform well through the cycle both from an NII perspective and a credit perspective. And I think perhaps there was some concern that we have waited too long and miss the opportunity. And I think the good news from today's release is that we are well positioned and well protected to the possibility of recession in 2023 or 2024, not that that's our base case, but certainly something that we're mindful of and we pride ourselves and really under Greg's leadership over the last seven years of being good risk managers and that's how we approach thanks for that show that downturn occur. We're well positioned to be a strong performer. But should we continue to see good economic growth, but this is a company that's positioned to do well with generating high returns, high PPNR growth and really do well through the cycle. Timothy Spence : 62:22 Gerard, if I were to add on adding Jamie referenced credit, we've come out of a period here where the dynamic around rates as I think really obscured the importance of funding quality. And it just given the way that reporting gets done, it's probably hard to tell from the outside looking in, how good the funding base is, and that doesn't just extend the banks, it's the non-banks as well, right. So as the Fed tightens, I think there is going to be more differentiation and maybe the market fully appreciates as it relates to the stability and the quality your funding base and the banks who have done the things that we've tried to do in terms of growing primary relationships and what the focus on core operational deposits should be much better positioned to whether an environment where liquidity maybe is, there is a premium attached to it unlike the environment that we really have come out of over the course of the past handful years. Gerard Cassidy : 63:25 Very good. Thank you for the color. And the prime relationships that you've developed with your customers and the low cost funding that comes along with that is obviously very beneficial. At what point or is there a point that you folks may look for some term funding if rates were to really go higher 12 months from now. Just like they've done in the last three or four months, does it make sense at some point to start looking at some term funding? James Leonard : 63:57 Yes. And that is included in our NII guide as well for the year. Gerard Cassidy : 64:02 Very good. Thank you, Jamie. Operator : 64:07 Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open John Pancari : 64:13 Good morning. On the deposit beta topic, I just wanted to see if you could perhaps discuss any of the risks or concerns that investors had that is for the industry could surprise higher than many of the banks are expecting, I know you guys are expecting a lower beta perhaps in the 25% range versus we experienced in previous cycle. Can you just talk about the concerns there that competition to be could be much more intense this time around given the various players in the space that could perhaps influence deposit betas to be higher than expected? James Leonard : 64:56 Yeah, John. Thanks for the question. There are a lot of competing factors on where the betas shake out. We think the overwhelming factor for the industry is the amount of liquidity is signified by the loan to deposit ratio and the industry being 20% better than they were at the end of 2015, heading into the last cycle, but you're certainly right the level of competition ultimately dictates the deposit betas, we just think the industry is so much better positioned now that the level of that competition should be less. So from an industry perspective, we think that should win out but then if we're wrong then let's talk about it on an idiosyncratic basis for Fifth Third, what we've been able to accomplish with the primacy and operational deposits and the treasury management business has translated for us what we believe should be a lower beta on the first 200 -- at the 35 last time, 25 this time. But with that said, 90 days ago, we were modeling a 20 beta on those first 200. So we have raised our own expectations a bit. Hopefully, we will do better than that, but possibility that we would not 25% beta is what we've settled in our outlook in the up 200. 66:31 When you break it down by customer segment, obviously the wealth and asset management area as a highly price sensitive portfolio whereas for us the improvement won\u2019t be as much in that portfolio as it is in the commercial business because of the treasury management. And then in the retail book if the value exchange with the free services that you receive in Momentum Banking, we believe should result in a little bit lower beta this time around so that we're not competing on rate for the retail customer, but rather the value exchange with those other services, then including things like less punitive fees, the NSF elimination and all of the other structural changes we made to our product lineup should result in a better beta of the cycle. But if by chance, we are wrong. I think we're well positioned to be able to compete well regardless of how that plays out. John Pancari : 67:32 Got it. Okay. Thanks, Jamie. That's helpful. And then a similar question actually on the credit side. I know you're not flagging anything to concerning on the credit front and that's very similar to the message that we've gotten net of out of the banks this earnings season. And you know, but I know you saw a bit of a tick up in your [indiscernible] in a couple of the banks we have seen that as well. What areas of credit are you watching most closely? What areas do you think will move first? And are there any signs of faster than expected normalization at all within your consumer portfolio for example? Richard Stein : 68:11 Yeah. Hey. It's Richard. Let me start with the last one. From a consumer standpoint, we're actually not seeing signs of acceleration. If you think about where the excess liquidity certainly to the top 70% of that went to the top 20% of income households that liquidity has been sticking around for our customer base and again, we're prime and super-prime. And activity really haven\u2019t -- we really haven't seen a shift in activity with respect to behavior changes in terms of that excess liquidity running off faster than we expected. In fact it's running off a little slower than we expected as people continue to strike the right balance across their lifestyles. 68:40 From a delinquency standpoint, we're at such a low level and this links to change for us was really in commercial. We're at such a low level, but it just takes one or two to slip over the quarter to change the percentage. So, we're really not seeing any trends. In terms of that would be alarming, that would -- that points us to an acceleration of the normalization across credit, whether it's consumer or commercial I think areas we're watching. Clearly, we continue to watch the leverage space, particularly enterprise value lending that's an area that we've been very disciplined on and we were happy with the portfolio. But that's a place where we continue to exercise discipline. 69:27 There is a handful of segments and CRE. Office is one that we're watching long term just given -- just given the structural changes in that space, but we focus on quality Class A properties, gateway cities. It's all very good stuff. And then, there's -- we're watching consumer products and manufacturing and senior living in a couple of more places where, look, we're watching as places where the ability to pass through cost increase, maybe a little harder. We haven't seen evidence of that at least at this point most people been able to pass cost increases through, but that's where we're watching. John Pancari : 70:05 Very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : 70:08 Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Your line is now open. Terry McEvoy : 70:15 I'll take that. Good morning. Jamie, maybe a question for you. Could you just remind us what the mixes within commercial banking revenue, it was down 21%, but the better than some of your others who maybe, call it, capital markets or investment banking? And then maybe what are pipelines like today, and do you have any near-term thoughts on that business? James Leonard : 70:36 Yeah. The disruption in the first quarter definitely impacted the debt capital markets groups with the loan syndications and the corporate bond fees. For us within the commercial banking, it's a pretty good split between FRM products where we're helping customers with hedging called out a third of the business, a little bit more than that amount in investment banking revenue and then the remainder within some of the lending fee categories that an aggregate to the total. So, what we've seen is that FRM has done better that we originally expected, but that investment banking category within corporate bond and loan syndication and branch fees performed worse than expectations, so that's the mix there. The guide for the year includes some assumption that\u2019s markets stabilize and reopen and should that not happen and we would just have more of that interplay between NII and fees. So that at the end of the day I will still feel good about the revenue generation of the company. Terry McEvoy : 71:52 And then just as a follow-up, the average commercial loan growth of 9% to 10% versus 7% to 8% in January. Is that all layering in Dividend Finance or ex that deal, you see a stronger year within commercial lending? James Leonard : 72:08 Yeah. So Dividend Finance will show up in other consumer loans, unlike Provide that did show up in C&I. So you'll see Provide\u2019s benefit is in the C&I guide and Dividend Finance's and other consumer loans category. Terry McEvoy : 72:24 Okay. Great. Thanks for clearing that up. And then congrats to both Greg and Tim. Thank you for taking my questions. Greg Carmichael : 72:30 Thank you, Terry. Operator : 72:35 Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open. Christopher Marinac : 72:41 Thanks. Good morning. Jamie, I wanted to ask about the Fed balance sheet and epic contracts. Does not make a difference to your rate outlook and/or kind of how you perceive the macro picture? James Leonard : 72:53 We do expect contraction with our outlook of the Fed balance sheet as they potentially begin the sell down in June, announced that in May. I guess ultimately, the variable to our outlook would be, if they were to move significantly faster than perhaps you have a little bit more deposit outflow or higher deposit betas than what's expected, but it would have to be pretty quick and significant action on their part to implement the quantitative tightening more so than what we've got baked in. So I think ultimately it will play out, okay. Christopher Marinac : 73:38 Okay. But you're not expecting the opposite where they don't contract at all, it's not part of the interaction? James Leonard : 73:44 Correct. Yeah. Christopher Marinac : 73:45 Okay. Very well. Thanks. Operator : 73:51 Your next question again comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : 73:59 Hi. I was since, Greg you define Tim starting with the word tack or technology maybe just dig into a little bit more, Tim, your vision for what droves the bank in the future look like in terms of technology. Greg, you certainly have taken Fifth Third away, but there's still a lot more to go, I'm sure. So I'll give you Column A or Column B. Column A would be more one premise proprietary in-house don't rely too much on third-party and you can control your destiny, and Column A is where certain banks are where they want to protect a lot of their customer data and information, safety and security. Now Column B would be a zero ops, 100% public cloud, maybe 10, 15, 20 FinTech partners and the Lego approach where you piece those together really making use of having kind of a break down the borders around the bank. So column A or column B or maybe I'm framing this wrong and you can give another answer, but how do you 4C that the tech bank of the future? Greg Carmichael : 75:08 Tim is going to answer towards C here. Timothy Spence : 75:11 No. Look like, I think it's a mix of both the nice thing about our sector is there really is a very active technology vendor community and it gives you a lot of choices about how you want to run the business. I don't think we're ever going to be all in bucket A or bucket B. We're big believers that where there is an industry utilities that drives very limited customer differentiation and where there is a benefit to shared scale it makes sense to ride on the rails that are available and where there is an opportunity to differentiate and/or in the aspect of the business that's deeply proprietary that it's got to be managed and maintained in-house. So I think you're going to see us take a best of blend approach as it relates to those two areas. But with a heavy focus on owning the tech platforms in the products which are customer facing and probably comparatively a lighter emphasis on that as it relates to the back office where you're talking about a scaled utility that's processing credits and debits as opposed to something that's more strategic our proprietary to business. Mike Mayo : 76:26 Okay. That was clear. Any more concrete metrics that you can give us not everyone disclosed this, but the number of apps that you have and how much you'd like to reduce that or the number of vendors you have and where you'd like that to go, or percent that you're on the public cloud and where you'd like to take that or number of data centers where the end state is what you desire? So anything concrete those of us on the outside could -- you maybe ask you again in a couple of years to track your progress? Greg Carmichael : 76:55 Hey, Mike. This is Greg. I don't have concrete numbers for you. When you think about things like data centers it's two. Obviously, we want to be down to two data centers and we're approaching that pretty quickly here. Obviously, we want to make sure we have a hot sight and you get latency on how fast things could travel, it's really mindful that, but that's going to be the case. We think about our core apps around the business something less than we have today. I'm not sure how substantial of the agenda today, but something less we have today. Customer-facing apps as you think about them, when we can build off of common platforms and expand of a common platform very different than the past, there is an open source cloud-based computing that technology enabled us to do things over definitely we have less applications. So less applications for the customer facing side of house somewhat less applications on the back and as we consolidate some of our platforms and vendors, definitely less vendors. And data center we wanted to. Timothy Spence : 77:53 Mike, the metric that I think I'm really -- the metrics I'd really chiefly focused on how to deal with the resiliency of our environment. We have talked a lot about that, then they have to do with the mix of spend and the sort of continued focus on driving a heavier share of our overall spend to new application, development and products and out of legacy maintenance costs, right. Those I think are the things coupled then with what you can see publicly in terms of the way that customers evaluate our digital channels, in terms of the differentiation that you can see in the quality and the products and the services that are going to be the things that you should hold us accountable to. Mike Mayo : 78:37 Last one, so to run the bank, change the bank spend for technology where has it been, where is it today and where it might go to then? Timothy Spence : 78:46 Yeah. You include information security and otherwise, it's been, call it 35 change the bank, 65 run the bank the goal going forward is to invert that 65-35. Mike Mayo : 78:57 Great. Thank you very much. Operator : 79:02 Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Gerard Cassidy : 79:10 Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up and apologize if you guys addressed this in your opening remarks. But Tim, you mentioned the 4Cs of your markets post Tennessee. Can you share with us where you're seeing the best commercial loan growth within the portfolio. I mean, coming from what parts of the 4Cs? Timothy Spence : 79:35 Yeah. As in which industry sectors, Gerard or where within -- where geographically within the markets? Gerard Cassidy : 79:41 More geographic that said, yeah. Timothy Spence : 79:44 Yeah, sure. So Betsy did correct me, it is the 5Cs if you count the FEE at the end of Tennessee as one, and I got an angry text message from our Head of Indiana and pointed out that they had a pretty good quarter as well. So, yeah, look I think geographically we have the benefit of having a really strong presence and mid-sized natural areas. And if you look at both demographics and economic activity that's where the majority of growth is coming from across the U.S. right now. It isn't necessarily the mega cities and it's certainly not the rural areas. It's the Charlotte's, the Raleigh's, the Cincinnati, the Indianapolis, the Columbus, the Inland Empire and California, as a point of example there as well, where you're seeing a lot of the activity and that is very consistent with what you would see inside our book of business as well. 80:41 So the Cincinnati Columbus corridor, I think has been a very strong resilient corridor that should be even better as Intel lands here and we get the downstream component suppliers and logistics companies and software engineering companies and otherwise that make their way into the space. Indianapolis and Columbus, I think are the two bright stars in terms of economic growth in the Midwest and obviously what we are getting out of the upstate. And Charlotte and Raleigh has been really outstanding along with middle Tennessee and Nashville, as opposed to other parts of the state that are growing at less robust pace. Gerard Cassidy : 81:21 And then as a follow-up to, in the commercial lending areas, how important are the treasury management products to complement the actual loan growth, obviously, we know lending standards can easily drive loan growth if you lower them. [Multiple Speakers] Can you share with us the color as well. Timothy Spence : 81:40 Yeah. I know there -- I mean they are extremely important and they have been a big catalyst for the success we've had in growing our quality relationship count, Gerard, so a third 30% to 35% of our new relationships have been led by TM in terms of the initial product sale, which certainly is anomalous to what I had experienced prior to or having had the success that we've had as it relates to managed services. And if you look at the available industry research the folks that do benchmarking on this front that Fifth Third is always in the very top of the top quartile in terms of TM penetration in the middle market into our middle-market lending relationships, which I think you can kind of evaluate just by looking at the growth of commercial deposit fees over time and commercial deposits as a percentage of Commercial total loan commitments, both of which Fifth Third is best-in-class in relative to its investor peer group. So it's important strategically in terms of how we go to market and the results are bearing out in terms of the financial performance. Gerard Cassidy : 82:50 Great. Thank you. Operator : 82:54 There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to your Chris Doll. Chris Doll : 82:59 Thank you, Emma, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the IR department if you have questions Operator *: 83:06 This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Chris Doll : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third second quarter 2022 earnings call.  This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard will provide an overview of our second quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein; and Treasurer, Bryan Preston have also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding to the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of July 21, 2022 and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie we will open the call up for questions. With that let me turn it over to Tim. Tim Spence : Thanks, Chris, and thank all you for joining us.  With this being my first earnings call as CEO I'd like to say what an honor it is to follow a great leader like Greg Carmichael. Let's jump right in. Earlier today, we reported a solid second quarter reflecting our focus on profitability, organic growth, and through the cycle returns. We generated record adjusted revenue and maintained our expense discipline producing adjusted PPNR growth of 11% compared to last year. We extended our track record for strong organic growth, adding new quality relationships in commercial and new households in consumer, and both our recent acquisitions, dividend finance and provide [indiscernible] originations. Charge-offs remained low, NPAs and early stage delinquencies improved sequentially and we saw no decline in the liquidity buffers that our consumer households built during the pandemic. With that said, there is no question in my mind that the economic outlook is blurrier today than it was at the start of the year. Due to the potential forward economic challenges we are maintaining a prudently cautious view on credit as reflected in our reserve coverage. Turning to the balance sheet, loan growth was solid and diversified across our franchise. Average commercial loan growth was driven by C&I which included a 1% increase in utilization on revolving lines of credit. We generated robust loan growth in nearly all our corporate banking verticals in our Chicago, Cincinnati, North and South Carolina and Florida regions led the way in middle market lending. Average consumer loans grew in almost all categories. Our results include a small benefit from a mid-May closing of dividend finance. We're very excited about dividend as rising energy costs and the trend of homeowners improving their existing homes versus trading up only enhances our market opportunity. Switching to deposits, our second quarter results were in line with our prior commentary with average balances, intentionally down $6 billion sequentially and stable from the prior year. As we focused on margins over volume given our overall liquidity position. We have a very strong deposit base with a higher allocation to consumer deposits in the stable retail category than any institution that reports as part of the LCR rule. Consumer transaction deposits grew 1% sequentially and increased 7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued growth in momentum banking and double digit deposit balance growth in our Southeast markets. Commercial transaction deposits were down sequentially, partially reflecting the anticipated movement of excess balances to higher yielding alternatives combined with some seasonal impacts. As of yesterday, total deposit balances have remained stable since mid may, despite the Fed rate hikes that occurred late in the second quarter. As a result of our loan growth and deposit pricing discipline, net interest income increased 12% sequentially or 15% excluding the impacts of PPP, Ginnie Mae and the securities prepayment penalty income. As we indicated in the investor conference last month, fees were softer for the quarter, reflecting the impact of market conditions on debt capital markets mortgage, and wealth and management. I am, however, quite pleased with the strength and diversification of our underlying fee growth engines. In payments, our gross treasury management revenue increased 7% and credit card spend grew 10%, both compared to a year ago quarter. In capital markets, financial risk management revenue increased 18% and M&A advisory revenue grew 30%, the majority of which was sourced from existing middle market relationships. In wealth management, despite the market volatility, personal asset management revenue was up 3% year-to-date and we generated our fourth consecutive quarter of positive net AUM inflows. We continue to manage expenses very diligently throughout the bank, reflecting our multi-year continuous improvement discipline, which has funded a significant portion of our organic growth and tech modernization strategies. Looking forward, our proactive actions over the past several years, with respect to our minimum wage and other employee retention strategies should provide us a buffer against inflation relative to peers. With respect to capital, we recently announced our 2.5% stress capital buffer requirements from the Fed stress test to exercise, the minimum under the regulatory capital rules. Our top priorities for capital deployment remains funding organic growth and paying a strong dividend. We recently announced our ability to increase the quarterly dividend by up to $0.03 in September, subject to board approval and economic conditions.  Given our robust loan growth and our desire to run the bank slightly above our capital targets in the current environment, we do not anticipate executing share repurchases for the remainder of the year at this time. While credit quality remains benign, we remain cautious of the impact that the FED\u2019s continued aggressive monetary policy and geopolitical dynamics could have on the economy. Over the past several years, we have built Fifth Third to be resilient and to produce strong results under any market environment. We have been consistent in our strategic priorities and have had the discipline to fund investments in geographic expansion, product innovation and technology through continuous improvement and pruning non-core businesses. We have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on high quality commercial relationships and on homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in commercial real estate and in non-prime borrowers among our peers, and 93% of the mortgages on our balance sheet are fixed rate. We have protected NII through a series of actions, including our securities portfolio positioning, adding cash flow hedges to protect the down rate scenario for the next decade. And by maintaining a strong deposit franchise with a focus on primary relationships. Through the dividend and provide acquisitions, we added fixed rate loan origination platforms that will be especially powerful in a lower rate environment. Our allowance for credit losses provides greater loss absorbency than virtually any of our peers. Under my leadership, you should expect us to continue to make decisions with the long-term in mind, to hold ourselves accountable to what we say; we are going to do, and to invest in product and service innovations that generate sustainable long-term value for customers and shareholders alike. In closing, on behalf of the entire leadership team, I\u2019d like to say thank you to our employees who are listening today. As you know, banks inhabit a special place in the communities where they operate and with that comes a special responsibility to be a proponent for positive change. You work hard every day to live our purpose, including delivering 8 million meals to fight hunger across our footprint as part of Fifth Third Day, as well as positioning us to achieve our new $100 billion environmental and social finance commitment. I also want to thank you for the myriad of small things you do every day to improve our customer\u2019s lives. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our second quarter financial results and our current outlook. Jamie Leonard : Thank you, Tim. And thank all of you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were solid. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories, deployed excess liquidity in the securities at attractive entry points and remain disciplined in managing our deposit costs. Expenses were once again, well controlled, even though we continue to reinvest in our businesses. Fees did underperform our April expectations due to the market volatility, but even with that softness, we generated core PPNR growth of 11% on a year-over-year basis. As a result, we achieved a sub 55% efficiency ratio and generated seven points of positive operating leverage from the second quarter of 2021. The ACL ratio increased five basis points sequentially to 1.85%, which includes a four basis point impact from the Dividend Finance acquisition, combined with $62 million in net charge-offs, we recorded a $179 million total provision for credit losses. Moving to the income statement. Net interest income of approximately $1.3 billion increased 12% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. As Tim mentioned, the underlying NII growth was around 15% compared to last quarter of which approximately half of the growth was attributable to higher market rates, and half from the combination of investment portfolio growth and loan growth, primarily in C&I. Our interest bearing core deposit costs were well controlled at just nine basis points of this quarter up just five basis points sequentially and help drive the 33 basis points of NIM expansion during the quarter. Total reported non-interest income decreased 1% sequentially and increased 3% on an adjusted basis. Compared to the prior quarter, we generated improved financial risk management card and processing, gross treasury management fees and private equity income, which was partially offset by weaker performance from our market sensitive businesses, including commercial capital markets and mortgage, and the impact of higher treasury management earnings credit rates. Non-interest expense decreased 9% compared to the prior quarter, driven by a decline in compensation and benefits expense from the seasonal peak in the first quarter, lower incentive-based comp in the current quarter due to market dynamics that impacted fees and overall continued expense discipline throughout the company. Expenses in the quarter included a $27 million benefit related to the mark-to-market impact of non-qualified deferred compensation, which has a corresponding offset in security losses. This compares to a $12 million benefit in the prior quarter. Excluding the non-qualified deferred compensation impacts from both periods, total noninterest expense, decreased $95 million or 8%. Noninterest expense decreased 4% compared to the year ago quarter. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increase 4% sequentially including health for sale loans, total average loans increased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 4% compared to the prior quarter, primarily reflecting growth in C&I loans. Commercial loan production remained robust throughout the franchise outperforming our original expectations. Our production and pipelines are the result of our strategic investments and talent, as we continue to see strength and new quality relationship generation during the second quarter. With muted payoffs and a 1% increase in the revolver utilization rate to 37% period and commercial loans increased 3% sequentially, and 12% compared to the year ago quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased 3% compared to the prior quarter driven by residential mortgage and the dividend acquisition, which are recorded in other consumer loans. This growth was partially offset by a decline in home equity. At quarter end, total dividend loan balances were $650 million reflecting our decision to hold some loans the dividend would have otherwise sold combined with their post-close production volume. Average core deposits were stable compared to the year ago quarter, and decreased 4% compared to the prior quarter, including the impact of the intentional runoff of excess and higher cost commercial deposits. This runoff was in line with our expectations and reflects our pricing discipline from our strong overall liquidity position. Compared to the year ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits decreased 8% and average consumer transaction deposits increased 1% reflecting our continued success growing consumer households. Given the improved entry points during the first and second quarters we deployed cash into the securities portfolio, which resulted in second quarter average securities balance growth of approximately $12 billion. We completed net purchases of $6 billion in securities during the second quarter compared to $13 billion in the prior quarter. The higher than previously expected security purchases in the second quarter were the result of accelerating planned second half of 2022 purchases given the attractive entry points in late May and June. We currently expect security portfolio balances to remain generally stable through the rest of the year. We have continued to focus on adding duration and structure to the investment portfolio to provide stable and predictable cash flows. Consequently, our overall allocation to bullet and locked out structures increase from 64% to 67% at quarter end, and our duration increase from 5.4 to 5.7. Moving to credit; as Tim mentioned, credit remained healthy and in line with our previous expectations. The NPA ratio of 47 basis points improved 2 basis points sequentially with net charge offs of just 21 basis points. The ratio of early stage delinquencies, 30 to 89 days past due relative to loans was stable in the second quarter and the amount of loans 90 days past due is less than half of what it was a year ago. We continue to closely monitor the same areas we have previously discussed such as central business district hotels, senior living and office CRE. We are also monitoring exposures where inflation and higher rates may cost stress, including the impact of changing consumer discretionary spending patterns as well as the ongoing monitoring of the leverage loan portfolio. Our ACL build this quarter was $117 million of which approximately 75% was from strong loan growth, including the $53 million ACL impact from the dividend acquisition and the remaining 25% was attributable to worsening economic projections relative to March, net of reductions in certain pandemic related qualitative adjustments. Given the incremental clarity on the economy's ability to withstand geopolitical tensions and the pandemic fallout with vaccine efficacy and other measures, we elected to return to our standard approach for scenario weights of 80% to the baseline and 10% to the downside and upside scenarios. We believe our models are better suited to appropriately evaluate economic scenarios and outcomes from monetary tightening on our loan portfolio than on humanitarian crises such as pandemics and wars. Despite the scenario weight change we increased our reserves in specific portfolios such as CRE, where we continue to believe there elevated risks. Our baseline scenario assumes the labor market remains relatively stable with unemployment ending our three-year reasonable and supportable period at around 3.8%, which is slightly weaker than our previous estimate. Additionally, GDP growth and home price forecast have weakened relative to our March forecast in both our baseline and downside scenarios. Our expectations incorporate several key risks that could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strain supply chains including aggressive rate hikes and quantitative tightening and labor supply constraints becoming more binding than originally anticipated. Our June 30 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment. Moving to capital, our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9% compared to 9.3% in the prior quarter. The decline in capital was primarily due to strong RWA growth reflecting robust organic business opportunities and the impact of the dividend finance acquisition. We expect to accrete capital to the 9.25% area by year-end given our strong earnings capacity and we will evaluate resuming buybacks after that time. Moving to our current outlook, for the full year 2022 we continue to expect average total loan growth between 5% and 6% compared to 2021 or around 10% excluding PPP and Ginnie Mae impacts, reflecting strong pipelines and stable commercial revolver utilization rates over the remainder of the year. Dividend finance is generating strong origination volumes. We expect loan originations of around $1.3 billion in the second half of 2022 which is 30% more than our original estimates. Similarly provide loan production remain strong as we expect over $1 billion in total production in 2022. Dividend and provide together are expected to contribute a little more than 1% of the total average loan growth for the year. We expect average commercial loan growth of 9% to 10% or 14% to 15% excluding PPP. We expect total average consumer loans to be stable in 2022, reflecting our decision to lower auto loan production to enhance our returns on capital. We expect around $7 billion in auto and specialty production for the full year, which will still result in double-digit growth and average indirect consumer secured balances in 2022. Our outlook also assumes growth of approximately 15% in other consumer loans reflecting the benefits of dividend finance. Shifting to the income statement we continue to expect full year adjusted revenue growth of 7% to 8%, which will be a record year of revenue for Fifth Third. Given our outlook for earning asset growth combined with the implied forward curve as of July 1st, which assumes a fed funds rate of 3.25% by year end. We expect full year NII to increase 17% to 18%. Our outlook incorporates the impacts from runoff of the PPP and Ginnie Mae portfolios. Excluding those portfolios, NII growth would be around 20%. Our current outlook assumes average deposit balances decline a $2 billion in the third quarter, reflecting the full quarter impact of the second quarter runoff of excess and higher cost commercial deposits and seasonality, and then return to growth in the fourth quarter. Since the onset of the rate hikes, our deposit betas have been muted at low single-digits for the cycle to date. We expect increases to our interest-bearing core deposit costs to accelerate over the next two quarters due to the timing impact of deposit reprising lags from earlier hikes and continued aggressive rate hikes from the fed. We continue to expect a 25% deposit beta on the first 225 basis points of rate hikes and a marginal beta of around 45% to 50% on the next 75 basis points of rate hikes. The ultimate impact NII of incremental rate hikes will be dependent on the timing and magnitude of interest rate movements, balance sheet management strategies, including securities growth and hedging transactions and realized deposit betas. We expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be down 7% to 8% in 2022, reflecting softer second quarter performance combined with the high probability of continued market volatility, reflecting a more aggressive rate outlook, including lower wealth and asset management mortgage and capital markets revenue, as well as higher earnings credit rates offsetting strong gross treasury management fee growth. Despite the expected decline in capital markets revenue, we expect full year capital markets revenue to be up nearly 50% from the pre-pandemic 2019 levels, which highlights the success we\u2019ve had over the past few years in growing a diversified capital markets business. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense, including the impacts of dividend finance to be stable to down 1% compared to 2021. An improvement from our previous guide of up 1% to 2%. We continue to strategically invest in our franchise, which should result in low double-digit growth in both technology and marketing expenses. Our outlook also assumes we had 20 to 25 new branches, primarily in our high growth Southeast markets in 2022. Our guidance also incorporates the minimum wage increase to $20 per hour that went into effect on July 4th. We expect these investments in our people platforms and franchise to be offset by the savings from our process automation initiatives reduced servicing expenses associated with the Ginnie Mae portfolio, a decline in leasing expense, given our LaSalle Solutions sale and our continued overall expense discipline throughout the company. As a result our full year 2022 total adjusted revenue growth combined with our expense outlook should generate four points of improvement in the efficiency ratio and positive operating leverage of around 8%. Full year adjusted PPNR growth is expected to be 17% to 19%, which is an improvement to the range compared to our April estimate, reflecting the strong NII and expense outcomes, partially offset by the market related fee headwinds. Our outlook for significantly delivering on our positive operating leverage commitment reflects the benefits of our ability to grow our customer base combined with our strong balance sheet management and expense discipline. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect average total loan balances to increase 1% sequentially reflecting 1% to 2% growth in commercial and stable consumer balances. We expect our average securities portfolio to increase $2 billion to $3 billion reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made during the second quarter. Shifting to the income statement, we expect third quarter adjusted revenue growth of 8% to 9% compared to the second quarter. We expect NII to be up 11% to 12% sequentially, reflecting strong loan growth, the impact of securities purchases and the benefits of our balance sheet positioning. We expect adjusted noninterest income to be down 3% to 4% compared to the second quarter. We expect total adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4% to 5% compared to the second quarter or up 2% compared to the year ago quarter due to the acquisitions of provide and dividend finance. Excluding the second quarter NQDC benefits on expenses, we expect noninterest expenses to increase around 2% sequentially. We continue to expect third quarter and full year 2022 net charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis point range. In summary with our balance sheet positioning, PPNR growth engine and disciplined credit risk management, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong performance in this type of environment. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue, if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck [Morgan Stanley]. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Tim Spence : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Two questions, one on the buyback. I just wanted to understand the thought process around when the reinstatement would be, is that a function of a certain CET1, that you\u2019re looking to achieve? And should we take it to mean that you'll restart it in 1Q? Thanks. Jamie Leonard : Yes. Betsy its Jamie. Given the environment that we're operating in, we, as you can tell from our results are clearly positioning to be a little more cautious in this environment. So we think accreting capital for the remainder of the year would be appropriate. And then we will evaluate resuming the buybacks in the first quarter of 2023. And certainly that would be outlook dependent, but that's the current plan as we sit here today. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then on the deposit side, I know you mentioned that deposits have been stable since the middle of May, and it's interesting that you didn't see that deposit outflow continue in June. I'm just wondering, is there a certain kind of depositor that you think will be \u2013 that the outflow came from a type of depositor that will not be incented when the Fed raises rates next week. And corollary here is if you have deposits stable, but loan growth continues to be robust as you are indicating, how are you thinking about funding that? What type of borrowings are you looking to access? Thanks. Jamie Leonard : Yes. Great question. And I'll start and turn over to Brian for some additional color. Actually I think it was at your conference in early June that we talked about our plans on managing the balance sheet from a deposit standpoint and frankly for the past year, year and a half, we said we'd like to see about $10 billion of the deposits run off. Fortunately, this quarter we were able to really manage the balance sheet almost exactly as we had intended again at your conference, I think, we said we'd done the quarter at a loan to deposit ratio of 74% and we finished at 74.7%. So I do feel good about how we position the balance sheet and our ability to right size it. And maybe with that I will turn it over to Bryan to give a little more color of what we've seen on the outflows. Bryan Preston : Yes, absolutely. We made the deliberate decision to not match market rates on certain high beta, lower relationship debt to customers. As we've said all along, we estimated about $10 billion in excess balances in our commercial deposit book that we believed may not be sticky. We do not have a lot of appetite for a 100 beta balances that want to be priced at Fed Funds or Fed Funds plus. We were in a position to let about $5 billion of these balances find a new home. We've not lost customer relationships. We know what it would take from a pricing perspective to get these balances back. A decent amount of these funds ended up in our liquidity portal, which gives our customers access to money market investments. We also saw some heightened seasonality this year Betsy, as it relates to tax payments that were a little bit larger. We estimate the tax payment impact with another $4 billion to $5 billion of the runoff. Our commercial balances, as we've said, were stable since mid-May, our consumer balances continued to be very stable and sticky. And overall, we're pleased with our cost of total interest bearing core deposits of 9 bips was up only 5 bips from the first quarter. In terms of how we're thinking about funding balance sheet growth from here, we are always going to be focused on being core deposit funded. We have a lot of levers that we can continue to pull to grow deposits from here. And we're confident in our ability to do that. That being said, we will use short term borrowings as a mechanism to help us manage volatility in the balance sheet month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. And that includes funding opportunistic investment portfolio purchases that we've done. Additionally over time, we've obviously run down our long-term debt portfolio. We'll be looking to re-enter the bank note market. We do think it's important for us to get some structure back into our liability framework. And so that's something that we'll use as well. But we continue to be confident with our ability to be core deposit funded. We are still sitting here at a 75% loan-to-deposit ratio. And so we feel very good right now about our overall positioning. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott [indiscernible]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask a follow-up question on deposits. So it sounds like exclusive of the runoff, or pardon me, the continued impact of the decisions you made in the second quarter. We'd see sort of stable deposits or growth otherwise. Jamie, what are you thinking in terms of what will grow, are those consumer or commercial deposits as we look in the year? Jamie Leonard : Yes. Talking on the consumer side first, obviously we have a great retail franchise with tremendous products with momentum and the de novo plan and the Southeast build out. So retail deposits, we would expect to continue to grow in the back half of the year. On the commercial side, as I said in my prepared remarks, we'll probably see a little bit more runoff, couple billion in the third quarter before we experience a return to growth in the fourth quarter. And again, that'll be driven by our Treasury Management business where, I think, we've presented different conferences talking about how our TM business is best-in-class in the regional bank space, in terms of TMPs as a percent of revenue or TMPs to loan commitments to help show that share of wallet. And I think Brian's comments are very important to realize that these weren't lost relationships. This was just excess money going to a better home and we expected it. And from here, it'll just be business as usual. Tim Spence : I think if I can add one thing there that maybe has been less fully appreciated. I think that Jamie's point, we've talked a lot about Momentum Banking, we've talked about Treasury Management, but among our investor peers, we also have the highest percentage of our branch network that has been open less than five years. And the majority of that time has not been in an environment where we were focused on deposit gathering out of those locations so much as we were household growth and otherwise. And the byproduct of that is we think there is a lot of latent new deposit generation power that will come out of the call it 70 de novos that have been opened in the Southeast and the 20 in addition that are going to come between the second half of this year and the first quarter of next year that will provide an additional kick in terms of core deposit generation above and beyond what we're getting out of Momentum Banking and the Treasury Management business. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then if I could ask a separate one just maybe Jamie your thoughts on sort of drivers of the continued weakness in fees into the third quarter, I think, some of them are probably, I think, logically what they would be, but would just be curious to hear your thoughts on sort of puts and takes. Jamie Leonard : Yes, I think in this environment, the accelerated rate hikes and magnitude of the rate hikes just continue to weigh on the rate dependent fee businesses. So the outlook for mortgage capital markets and TM earnings credits are the biggest drivers of the change in our fee outlook. As Tim mentioned in the prepared remarks, the fee equivalent growth has actually been very strong. It's just as we get that additional NII benefit from the rate hikes, we give a portion of it back and the rates paid on earnings credit. So, from here I would expect the strong consumer household growth to help carry the day on combination of card and deposit service charges. But as a reminder, we are implementing or did implement July 1, the elimination of the NSF fee. So that'll weigh a little bit on the back half of the year fee guide. And then on wealth and asset management fees we've done a great job of new customer acquisition, as well as our AUM net inflows, but obviously the market headwinds have an impact on the fee revenue there, so that again it\u2019s in the updated guide. And then commercial banking is really a fascinating tale of two cities where our ability to help customers manage different exposures that they want to hedge, whether it's raise commodities or FX, along with our institutional brokerage business is just growing 30 plus percent. But the disruption in the capital markets having a big impact on the corporate bond fees and loan syndication fees and we don't really in our outlook expect significant improvement in the capital markets activity in the back half of the year. And I guess when you add up our fee outlook in total, we made about $1,000,000,004 in the first half of the year, we're saying we'll make, you know, $1,000,000,005 plus or minus a little bit in the back half of the year and the TRA of that a $100 million a growth TRA is half of it. So at least for now, that's how we see the back half of the year playing out. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, perfect. Thank you guys very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy [RBC Capital Markets]. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi Tim. Hi, Jamie. Jamie Leonard : Hello. Gerard Cassidy : [Indiscernible] for the organization. Can you\u2026 Tim Spence : Gerard, I apologize, you cut out right at the beginning there. Could you start the question over? Yes. Gerard Cassidy : Sure. Can you hear me now, Tim? Tim Spence : We can, yes. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Thank you. Jamie, you pointed out some very strong loan growth numbers for the commercial and industrial portfolio. Can you guys share with us where you\u2019re seeing this growth both geographically and by industry, and then as \u2013 and in addition to that, I assume you\u2019re probably going to expect to see utilization rates go up as well as that growth comes in. Jamie Leonard : Yes, I\u2019ll take the second part of the question first. When it comes to the line utilization, and I\u2019m glad you asked the question. What we saw in the second quarter was that in total line utilization moved up a point, and we\u2019re guiding for the rest of the year for that to actually be stable. So, we\u2019ll see how things play out. And in the second quarter, the movement in the line utilization, the biggest group that moved was actually the middle market group was up several points and so that was nice to see. From a production standpoint, it was pretty widespread, and again a very strong quarter of middle market production. I think Tim mentioned, several geographies in his prepared remarks, but, Cincinnati, Carolinas, Florida, it\u2019s a consistent story for us where, a little bit of softness in East Michigan, Northern Ohio is more than offset by strong performance in the rest of the Midwest in the Southeast. And then from a vertical perspective, the renewables team continues and energy continues to go very robust as well as our TMT business. So, we feel good about frankly the ability to acquire new customers in this environment, the sales teams with the RM expansion play out west as well as in the Southeast has worked very well. We\u2019re just mindful of what appears to us to be a slowing economy. And therefore, we\u2019re trimming a little bit on the edges, but frankly, the core is performing very well and you see that in the results this quarter. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow up question, and pivoting to credit quality for a moment, obviously you guys have very strong credit quality, and you built up the reserves as you pointed out in this quarter. And I understand that with the numbers being so small with you and your peers, one or two loans can move the numbers. So with that as a backdrop, can you give us some color on two questions on the commercial portfolio? First is the transfer to the nonaccrual status. That was an increase of about a $100 million this quarter versus $47 million in the prior quarter. Just any color there. And second, I believe you had a higher charge-off number in that category as well at $45 million versus $1 million in the prior quarter. And again, I emphasize the numbers, one loan can move those numbers since they\u2019re so low, but I\u2019m just curious. Richard Stein : Yes. Hey Gerard, it\u2019s Richard. Thanks for the question. You\u2019ve described it in your question what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re at levels that are so low, there\u2019s a little bit of balancing along the bottom purposing, if you will. The change in both NPA and in charge-offs was a handful, was a handful of loans. And just finally rolled to a place where we needed to take a more direct action in terms of making them non-accrual in charging them off. I think overall the portfolio continues to form as you point out very well. Well, inside our appetite and we\u2019re very pleased about where we sit today both today, and then also with the outlook in front of us. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of John Pancari [Evercore ISI]. Your line is now open. John Pancari : Good morning guys. Tim Spence : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Well, as a follow-up to the Gerard\u2019s question on the on credit. The increasing you just talked about in the non-accruals and charge-offs in the commercial side you said it was a handful of loans, any commonality in terms of industries or businesses that would help give us a little bit of color there? And then separately, are you seeing any signs of emerging stress anywhere within your portfolio worth noting? I know you\u2019re keeping an eye on commercial real estate and your leverage portfolio as well. Thanks. Tim Spence : Yes, no commonality by industry in those names. I think certainly the economic headwinds of inflation labor supply chain were elements to the \u2013 those were the common elements, but different industries, different segments, but they ultimately put pressure on cash flow. And that caused us to, as I said, take different action. Broadly in terms of pressure, I mean, it\u2019s the same thing we\u2019ve talked about. We\u2019ve talked about office that continues to be challenged, senior living again, that\u2019s another place where you see a disconnect between cost inflation and what they can get from a reimbursement rate perspective. And then what we\u2019re watching are places where changes in consumer behavior are shifting whether it\u2019s from durables and discretionary to consumables and non-discretionary, but it \u2013 no large segments. There\u2019s a little bit of idiosyncratic movement across the portfolio, but nothing major that causes us any concern. John Pancari : Okay. All right. Great. And then, and my follow up is somewhat related on credit to a degree. The, your rationale to pull back in auto, I know you\u2019ve been talking about that. Can you just give us a kind of a reminder of the reason to pull back what you\u2019re seeing? Is it more just about the competition in the space, or are you seeing something on the credit front that is driving that decision? Because we did see, we are having some other banks talk about that pullback as well. And then separately don\u2019t know if you have your criticized asset trend or change that you can give us color on for the quarter. Thanks. Jamie Leonard : Yes, sure John. Thanks for the question. In terms of auto, when we started the year forecast was about $11 billion in total production for a combination of auto plus the specialty business RV & Marine. We\u2019re now expecting to do about $7 billion in total in that asset class. And so the $4 billion of reduction is solely driven by the returns dynamic in that sector where several large players have certainly, if it\u2019s not irrational, it\u2019s certainly very aggressive pricing. And therefore we don\u2019t want to compete on an indirect asset class at such low spreads. So spreads a drop to levels that were reminiscent of when we did the pull back, five or six years ago. So the good news for us is, we keep the dealer relationships. We\u2019re continuing to monitor performance. We have spreads back up towards our target level and feel good about the production from a credit quality perspective, as well as a spread. But it\u2019s just not an asset class you want to grow, its single digit returns on capital. In terms of the credits, they were fairly stable in the quarter, not a lot to report there. John Pancari : Great. All right, Jamie, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin [Jefferies]. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Hey guys. Good morning. Just following up on the deposit side. So, hearing your earlier comments about the purposeful outflows, just wondering if you can give a sense of like, are we at the right bottoming spot where on the non-operational side, and given the good start to deposit betas where your interest bearing costs were only up five basis points. Can you just give us updated thoughts on how you\u2019re expecting betas to trend from here relative to prior business? Thanks. Jamie Leonard : Yes, I think from an end of period perspective, we\u2019ve accomplished what we wanted to accomplish on the non-operational excess deposits. So again, there\u2019ll be an average effect in the third quarter, but overall, we said, a year and a half ago, we\u2019d like to get $10 billion of the excess out. I think we\u2019ve done that. And frankly year-over-year deposits are flat. So it\u2019s not shouldn\u2019t be a big surprise to people that we were able to right size it. And again, the loan, the deposit ratio at 74.7 would love to get it into the mid-80s over a period of several years but that would certainly be driven more by continued loan growth as opposed to any more deposit runoff. In terms of the betas, it is difficult I think to track betas by quarter when the fed is moving in such big chunks, but how we see it playing out is that we'd have a fourth quarter beta of 23% the month of December be 28% and then by the time we get to midyear next year that the trail effect because in our forecast we have the fed going to three in a quarter and then stopping for a little bit longer than normal period of time. And therefore there'll be a little bit of that drift effect as the lag catches up so that the ultimate beta ends up being 30% on those 300 basis points of rate hike. So from a rates paid perspective, it looks something in the area of the 9 basis points this quarter goes to mid-40s in the third, mid-70s in the fourth and then drifts to the mid-90s by the second quarter of 2023. That's how we think this'll play out and then continue to see deposit growth beginning in the fourth quarter and thereafter. Ken Usdin : All right, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo [Wells Fargo Securities]. Your line is open. Tim Spence : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. I really like your Slide 4. Your NIM is up 33 basis points link quarter and 19 is due to rates, I get that; 16 is due to security, it looks like your timing was good in late May and June, but only 1 basis point due to loan growth. So I guess I think about the remixing of the portfolio into higher yielding securities. Yes, but even higher yielding loans, which doesn't show up. So I guess on the one hand your deposits are down 7% period end. So what was the margin on those deposits like you, I guess you've been saying that's really low margin stuff. You're not staying around for 100% deposit beta deposits. So I get that that's \u2013 that's probably helping you running that off. On the other hand, why don't you have more pickup from loan growth? Are you just originating low yielding loans or what? Jamie Leonard : No, I wouldn't say we're originating loan \u2013 yielding loans. The mix of a lot of our loan growth and our C&I book just given the floating rate nature of that portfolio and where it's been pricing in has been relatively neutral in terms of a NIM impact. But it does drive a decent amount of NII. Some of the consumer assets that we've been talking about especially the dividend assets in particular; it's just a late quarter impact. So you'll start to see some pickup from those in the future as those balances have a bigger average balance impact. But overall we do expect to see some pickup. The \u2013 we will continue to see C&I benefits just because of the asset sensitivity of our commercial floating rate portfolio. And we'll see some nice kind of drive from here and our NIM will continue to increase throughout the year. We would expect to end the year in a kind of a 3.30 to 3.35-ish range from a NIM perspective in the fourth quarter. So a lot of earnings powers still to come. Mike Mayo : And then in terms of your expense control, Tim, this is your, I guess as you said your first earnings call as CEO, so you probably going to get the guidance, right. And you guys are guiding third quarter for 8% higher revenues and only 2% higher core expenses. Actually if you look at first quarter to third quarter your run rate NII should be going up by one-fourth based on your guidance, even while your expenses and your guide is to be lower. So I guess how confident are you in that and what is your incremental profit margin and why would it be so much better than your existing profit margin? Tim Spence : Yes. Mike thanks for the question. I mean, to answer narrowly vary in terms of our level of confidence on our ability to manage expenses. I think the driver here when you think about our business, right, it\u2019s a people costs are a huge share of our overall expense base. And we've been, I think very public about the efforts that we have made over the course of the past few years to drive not only a culture of continuous expense discipline, but also a real focus on leveraging the technology investments we have been making to drive automation and reduce the unit costs associated with core processing activities. So our FTE count on a \u2013 is down about 600 right now, which is a big driver of the savings in terms of expense management and that's helping us. So it's less a dynamic around the margin on the incremental business so much as it is us continuing to make progress on the fixed cost base and the variable costs associated with our existing business activity. Jamie Leonard : And Mike, I would say, yes. Your math on the NII is very good and we are highly confident in that. I would say if there are two things, the third is extremely good at, one is balance sheet management and you see that in the NIM expansion, and as Bryan mentioned the continued expansion over the course of the year. And then we're also very efficient from an expense standpoint and what you have happening is that as there is fee weakness back to your profit margin question, as there is fee weakness, fees have a higher cost of delivery than obviously NII. NII for the most part's dropping straight to the bottom line. And so that's certainly an element of helping the efficiency ratio, but in addition to that all of the expense savings initiatives we have going on in the company, as Tim mentioned, year-over-year were down 600 people. If you exclude the acquisitions and dispositions and just sequentially we're down 260 people exclusive of the acquisitions and the dispositions, and that's rightsizing our mortgage business closing one of our fulfillment sites, right sizing the interact auto and specialty business, given the slow down and volumes and then all of the LPA enhancements with reducing IT and ops and the branch closure benefits from the first quarter. So we have a lot going on underneath to help provide those tailwinds on expenses, but then we're very mindful of continuing to invest. And so in the third quarter, in the guide you have an increase in technology and marketing and then a little bit of noise from the NQDC assuming it comes out at zero in the third quarter, which is the driver Y expenses, will be up 4% to 5% sequentially. But overall feel very good about our ability to deliver an efficient balance sheet and an efficient income statement. Mike Mayo : Alright. Thank you. Tim Spence : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian [Bank of America]. Your line is open Erika Najarian : Two follow up questions for me please. Jamie, how should we think about how you're thinking of the securities portfolio from here? Do you feel like that's something that you'll continue to build especially after deposit growth comes back or you think it could be a source of funding as deposit pricing accelerates? Jamie Leonard : Yes. I would expect the investment portfolio to be stable from here. I would not expect to be selling down the portfolio to fund loan growth. It obviously in a crisis could be a great source of liquidity but that would probably be through more collateral usage at FHLB or backing \u2013 backstopping public funds deposits. But overall I'd expect it to be stable in the yield, our guide for the back half of the year on yield is in the 280 both for the third quarter as well as on a full year basis. So that yield guide is up a bit as Mike pointed out with some fortuitous timing on the, the additional leverage we\u2019ve added. Erika Najarian : Got it. And maybe this is for Richard. I\u2019ll give you the CECL question near the end of the hour. What \u2013 could you remind us when you built your ACL to 241 in 2020? What was the unemployment rate that you were assuming? And the reason I ask this is at 185 ACL, if we think about the scenario, different scenarios of charge-off outcome in a mild recession for Fifth Third, taking into account the, that\u2019s been going on. It feels like in a mild downturn, your ACL is in the right place. And any guidance on this would be great because obviously everybody\u2019s now anticipating some sort of downturns sooner rather than later. Jamie Leonard : Hey, Erika, it\u2019s Jamie. I\u2019ll take that one. And I\u2019ll answer your question a little bit differently than how you asked it, because the only piece of data I have on the history is the unemployment level versus day one. So our current scenario for the baseline has unemployment, at 3 :4, 3:5, 3:7 versus the day one reserve in years, one, two and three were 3 :6, 4:3, and 4 :4. So versus day one unemployment is a little better, but the big driver of our variance to day one reserves is that, the GDP outlook and collateral values, both for housing and auto are worse. And then obviously the rate environment is significantly worse, which in the modeling puts pressure on corporate profits. So, we\u2019re sitting a little bit elevated over the day one levels, but to your point, we think that is a prudent place to be. And frankly, versus last quarter, the scenarios are certainly worse. And so, GDP erosion, housing pricing is worse, interest rates higher. So from our standpoint, when you have a period of strong loan growth, like we did in the second quarter you have eroding economic forecasts, you should have a CECL build. And then on top of that, we have the dividend acquisition effect, which that $50 million or so of the ACL build on related to the dividend finance production is something that will continue as we commented on strong production expectations for dividend until that portfolio reaches a state of maturity. And so, those ACL builds ultimately we\u2019ll see, what the loss content is to your question on, should there be a mild recession, the Moody\u2019s baseline scenario that we utilize while worse is not, a broad based persistent decline in economic activity that would result in a recession. But again, it\u2019s certainly worse than last quarter and certainly worse than the day one bill. Richard Stein : Yes. And I think, with that being said, if we sound more cautious, right. I think we probably are just based on what I read in here. We\u2019ve tried to be really consistent, especially as it relates to the alignment of, what we talk about worrying about and how that\u2019s reflected in the actions and how we run the company. And to try to be realistic about what\u2019s in front of us. Like Jamie said that, you look at what\u2019s going on in the current environment, Erika, and things are, there\u2019s a lot of things to feel optimistic about. And in our particular portfolio, not only do we, as credit obviously has been great and NCOs are low and NPAs, and delinquencies actually came down; the ratios there came down quarter-over-quarter. We are very mindful of the broader backdrop in attempting to gauge how to position the company for the next, 18 to 24 to 36 months. And at least from my point of view, if the goal is to have a company that\u2019s great through the cycle, you always have to be asking yourself what happens if you\u2019re wrong, right. And if we\u2019re wrong in this case, and we\u2019re being too cautious, maybe we miss a point or two alone growth that we otherwise could have gotten, right. But that\u2019s against a backdrop where we\u2019ve done very well on that measure, maybe we buy back stock a quarter or two later than we would have otherwise and then the ACL dressed down naturally as the scenario outlook changes, right. But if we\u2019re right to be cautious on the other hand, the actions we\u2019ve taken as it relates to the securities portfolio, the swaps, the total loss absorption that Fifth Third has relative to peers. And the fact that we did not take the benefit that we\u2019re getting from NII and spend it in the form of different sorts of investments and otherwise are going to pay off very handsomely, in terms of performance. So one way or the other like, even against this backdrop, I think our return metrics look really good on a relative basis. PPNR is going to be up, high teens on a year-over-year basis. I think we feel really good about how the bank is positioned. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor [Deutsche Bank]. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Obviously bought a lot of securities and added some swaps of quarter. And here you on keeping securities relatively flat rest of the year, but just kind of as you step back, would you consider yourself fully invested as you think about, I guess securities plus, mortgage plus swaps or holding deposit flat obviously. Tim Spence : Yes. I would say the investment portfolio is well positioned and at the level, that we would like to manage it long-term. Now with that said, if we see great opportunities, could we pull forward one quarter or two quarters of cash flow, which is currently running about a billion a quarter, I\u2019m not going to tie my hands and say, I wouldn\u2019t take advantage of great opportunities, but as I said here today and what rates have done, we feel really good about, just stability from here. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. All right. Yes, it seems like you had pretty good timing with the spike and rates in the quarter. So thank you. Tim Spence : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your final question comes from Christopher Marinac [Janney Montgomery]. Your line is open. Christopher Marinac : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the need to protect for lower interest rates. Jamie is that something that you spend much time thinking about and is that something that\u2019s in place? Jamie Leonard : Yes, that\u2019s the story of my life right now, because in our outlook, we expect that the fed hikes to the 325 level. And then, I saw a research piece the other day that talked about, on average or the median of the fed cuts begin four months after the last hike. Now, we expect the fed to in order to tamp down in inflation, is really focused on slowing the economy. So, they probably hold for a longer period of time than that median and hold it that, whatever the peak level is. And so frankly, that could tip things over into a recession, maybe not, but at a minimum there will be rate cuts down the road and rate cuts are ultimately the most detrimental activity to a bank\u2019s balance sheet if left unprotected, and therefore everything we\u2019ve done over the past couple of years has been building for that time, that the fed does move and we have a rate decline. And so we\u2019ve added duration to the portfolio. Again, this quarter, it\u2019s up to 5 :7 [ph]. We increase the bullet, locked-out, cash flows to 67%. We grew the portfolio to $55 billion. We added $10 billion in swaps. And then as Tim pointed out in his comments, we\u2019ve added some fixed rate loan platforms to our business model, and that should also be helpful should rates decline. So yes, we spend a lot of time on that, and I think we have a very, very good team to be able to help manage through that environment. And certainly deposit generation activities are very helpful, especially from the retail footprint as those are the low cost stable funding that banks like to enjoy. Christopher Marinac : Well, that\u2019s great caller. Thank you very much for walking us through that and thanks for all the information this morning. Tim Spence : Thank you. Chris Doll : Thanks everyone. Please feel free to reach to the Investor Relations department. If you have any follow up questions and thank you for your interest in Fifth Third. Operator, you can now disconnect the call.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Chris Doll : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third\u2019s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard will provide an overview of our third quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein; and Treasurer, Bryan Preston have also joined us for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of October 20, 2022 and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim. Tim Spence : Thanks, Chris, and thank all you for joining us this morning. Before we turn to our financial results, I\u2019d like to take a moment to express our sympathies for all of those across the state of Florida who were impacted by Hurricane Ian. I would also like to thank our employees for answering the call to take care of our customers and communities in the state. In the day since the hurricane made landfall, our employees have made nearly 90,000 Customer wellness calls, reopened all our branches, and staffed Fifth Third financial empowerment bus to enable customers who lost power and Internet access to apply for FEMA disaster relief. For those of you listening today, your resilience in the face of this natural disaster is awe inspiring. Thank you for living our core values. Turning to the financials. Earlier today, we reported third quarter results that reflect our commitment to strong performance through the cycle. We generated record adjusted revenue of $2.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Credit quality remains strong reflected in charge offs at the low end of our previous guidance. We also generated 10 points of positive operating leverage compared to the year ago quarter and achieved one of our lowest adjusted efficiency ratios over the past decade at 53%. Most all of our core return measures remained in the top quartile among peers, including an ROA of approximately 1.3% and ROTCE, excluding AOCI of nearly 18%. We also produced strong organic growth during the quarter, sustaining a record pace and adding new quality relationships and commercial and growing new households by 3% across our footprint and consumer. Our two recent fintech acquisitions, Dividend and Provide, each chief record quarterly origination levels. Turning to the balance sheet, loan growth was solid across our franchise. Our commercial loan production remains well diversified and supported by the bank's strategic investments. Within our regions, loan production in our southeast and other expansion markets roughly equaled our Midwest markets. Among our verticals, new production was strongest in energy including renewables, with a 70% increase in origination volume compared to the year ago quarter. Small Business production was led by Provide, which doubled year-over-year. Average consumer loans were up 1% led by dividend finance and top five national residential solar lender, and a return to growth in home equity. Dividend recently announced several key national partnerships which will continue to accelerate growth in the future. Switching to deposits. Consistent with prior guidance, our third quarter end of period balances were stable, with average balances down nearly $5 billion, due primarily to the full quarter impact of our delivered exits in the second quarter. In consumer, we grew households 3% year-over-year led by our southeast markets, which grew 8%. We generated consumer transaction balance growth of 5% compared to last year and opened a 1 million momentum banking account in the quarter. In commercial, our deposit franchise is anchored by our peer leading treasury management business. We ranked number two through number nine nationally in most TM payment types as shown in EY's annual cash management survey. We have a strong deposit base and new relationship growth engines in both our consumer and commercial business lines. And we expect the positive production momentum that we built during the third quarter to produce growth in the fourth quarter. Turning to the income statement. The strength and diversification of our fee-based businesses throughout the bank has helped to partially offset the market headwinds all banks are experiencing. In commercial, our gross treasury management revenue increased 6% compared to the year ago quarter led by our Expert AR and Expert AP Solutions. Our capital markets revenue associated with helping clients had share exposure to rates, commodities and foreign exchange increased 30% compared to the year ago quarter. In consumer, we generated strong mortgage revenue growth this quarter in an otherwise challenging environment, thanks to the strength of our mortgage servicing operation. Fifth Third is a low-cost high-quality servicer, one of the only banks to be recognized as both a Fannie Mae Star servicer and a HUD grade A servicer. The actions we took to grow our MSR portfolio nearly 30% since the end of 2019 will continue to pay dividends going forward. Finally, in wealth management, excluding tax payments, we have generated positive AUM inflows in every one of the past 13 quarters, and we were recognized this quarter as the best private bank for high net worth clients by the Digital Banker in Global Private Banker Magazine. We continue to focus on maintaining our culture of prudent expense management across the company while investing in organic growth and tech modernization initiatives. In the third quarter, we made meaningful progress in our technology and platform modernization journey. We successfully migrated our core platforms to a new data center and have now virtualized over 90% of our servers, strengthening network resiliency, increasing speed and capacity and improving the experience for both our customers and employees. In the fourth quarter, we'll re-launch our mobile app and a new cloud based architecture and with several improvements to the user experience. Credit quality remains strong throughout the bank. Our charge-off ratio was 21 basis points for the quarter and our non-performing asset ratio declined compared to the prior quarter. We remain cautious with respect to the broader economy given persistent inflation, the Fed\u2019s aggressive monetary policies and global growth concerns. We've continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on high-quality relationships and companies with more diversified resilient business models. We continue to proactively monitor our portfolios for signs of potential stress. And regardless of what comes, I'm confident in our ability to outperform peers through the full economic cycle. With respect to capital, we announced a 10% increase to the quarterly common dividend in September. We continue to accrete capital with strong PPNR growth and expect to achieve a 9.25% CET1 by year-end. We also expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter of 2023 subject to economic conditions. We continue to make decisions with the long-term in mind, hold ourselves accountable to what we say we are going to do, and invest in product and service innovations that generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders. With that, I will now turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our third quarter financial results and our current outlook. Jamie Leonard : Thank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. We are pleased with our third quarter results. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories and generated record adjusted revenue. NII was positively impacted by higher market rates. The income was resilient despite the market-related headwinds and expenses were well controlled while we continue to reinvest in our businesses. Consequently, we achieved a 53% adjusted efficiency ratio. Also excluding net securities losses related to two legacy venture capital investments, we generated core PPNR growth of 13% compared to last quarter and 27% compared to last year. Net interest income was approximately $1.5 billion, a record quarter and increased 12% sequentially and 26% year-over-year, primarily attributable to the benefit of higher market rates, growth and commercial loan balances, and the full quarter benefit of securities purchased in the second quarter. Our NIM expanded 30 basis points during the quarter, while interest bearing core deposit costs increased 32 basis points to 41 basis points in total, this quarter. This equates to a cycle to date deposit beta of 16% thus far on the first 225 basis points of rate hikes. Total reported non-interest income decreased just 1% sequentially. We generated improved mortgage banking and leasing business fee income, which was offset by software results in market sensitive businesses, including capital markets, and the impact of higher earnings credit rates in treasury management. Non-interest expense increased 5% compared to the prior quarter, driven by an increase in compensation and benefits expense, including the impact of the July minimum wage increase to $20 per hour, higher technology and communications expense reflecting our focus on technology modernization initiatives, and the full quarter impact of the dividend finance acquisition. Expenses in the quarter included a $7 million benefit related to the mark-to-market impact of non-qualified deferred compensation with a corresponding offset in securities losses. This compares to a $27 million benefit in the prior quarter. Excluding the NQDC impacts from both periods, total non-interest expense increased $35 million or 3%. Non-interest expense was flat compared to the year ago quarter despite the impacts of our fintech lending acquisitions of both Dividend and Provide. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increased 2% sequentially, including held for sale loans, total average loans increased 1% compared to the prior quarter. Average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, with muted pay-off and a stable revolver utilization rate of 37% period and commercial loans increased 1% sequentially and 14% compared to the year ago quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increased 1% compared to the prior quarter driven by dividend finance, which as a reminder is recorded in other consumer loans as well as growth in residential mortgage. This growth was partially offset by a decline in indirect secured consumer loans. At quarter end, dividend loan balances were approximately $1.4 billion. Average core deposits decreased 3% compared to both the year ago quarter and the prior quarter impacted by the intentional runoff of excess and higher cross commercial deposits in the second quarter, and lower consumer interest checking balances in the third quarter. Compared to the year ago quarter, average commercial transaction deposits decreased 10% while average consumer transaction deposits increased 5% reflecting our continued success growing consumer households. We grew our securities portfolio approximately $1 billion during the third quarter, compared to $6 billion in the prior quarter. We currently expect security portfolio balances to remain generally stable through the rest of the year. We have continued to focus on maintaining structure and the investment portfolio to provide stable and predictable cash flows. Our overall allocation to bullet and locked-out structures a quarter and remain at 67% in our duration declined to 5.5 in the current quarter compared to 5.8 in the prior quarter. Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends remain healthy. And our key credit metrics remain well below normalized levels. The NPA ratio of 46 basis points was down one basis point sequentially. Our commercial NPA ratio has now declined for eight consecutive quarters. The net charge-off rate ratio was flat sequentially at 21 basis points. The ratio of early stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due remained relatively stable sequentially than the amount of loans 90 days past due was approximately two thirds of what it was a year ago. We continue to closely monitor central business district hotels, non-profit health care, including senior living and office CRE we are also monitoring exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress, including the impact of changing consumer discretionary spending patterns, as well as the on-going monitoring of the leverage loan portfolio. From a balance sheet management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolio with a focus on high quality commercial relationships. And on homeowners which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We maintain the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in both commercial real estate and in non-prime borrowers among our peers. Through the Dividend and Provide acquisitions, we added granular fixed rate loan origination platforms. We have also focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong, stable NII through the cycle. Our strong deposit franchise, our securities and cash flow hedge portfolios, as well as the additions of Dividend and Provide lending capabilities should continue to position us to drive strong outcomes. In the cash flow hedge portfolio, we have added an incremental $5 billion since the end of the second quarter, bringing the total cash flow hedges added this year to $15 billion. The combined securities and cash flow hedge positions will support NII through the end of the decade. Moving to the ACL, our ACL build this quarter was $96 million, primarily reflecting loan growth, as well as a slightly worsening economic outlook relative to June. Dividend finance loan growth contributed $63 million to this ACL build. Relative to the second quarter, the Moody's GDP growth forecasts are slightly stronger, while the unemployment and home price forecasts have weakened in both the baseline and downside scenarios. Given our expected period and loan growth, including stronger production from dividend finance, we currently expect a fourth quarter bill to the ACL of approximately $100 million assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios. The impact of the expected dividend loan originations to the ACL should be in the $80 million to $90 million range due to our improved loan growth expectations. Our economic scenarios incorporate several key risks that could exacerbate existing inflationary pressures and further strained supply chains including continued aggressive rate hikes, and quantitative tightening and labor supply constraints becoming more binding than originally anticipated. Our September 30 allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment. Future baseline unemployment estimates may begin to be increasingly impacted by the Feds aggressive monetary policies. Moving to capital, our CET1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.1% compared to 9% in the quarter. The increase in capital was primarily due to our strong earnings capacity, partially offset by RWA growth reflecting robust organic business opportunities. Moving to our current outlook, for the fourth quarter of 2022 we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% sequentially. We expect commercial loans to grow 1%, reflecting strong pipelines and middle market and corporate banking, and assuming commercial revolver utilization rates remain stable at 37%. We expect consumer balances to be stable down 1% reflecting our decision to lower auto loan production to enhance our returns on capital and lower residential mortgage balances partially offset by dividend loan originations of around $1 billion in the fourth quarter. From a funding perspective, we expect average core deposits to increase 1% to 2% sequentially, however we do expect some continued migration from DDA into interest bearing products. Wholesale funding balances should be stable given expected core deposit growth relative to our earning asset base. Shifting to the income statement. We expect fourth quarter adjusted revenue growth of 6% compared to the third quarter, excluding the third quarter security losses associated with legacy venture equity investments. We expect NII to be up approximately 5% sequentially, assuming a 75 basis point hike in November and another 50 basis points in December. We expect a cumulative deposit beta of around 30% by year-end. This should result in interest-bearing core deposit costs rising from 41 basis points in the third quarter to the mid-to-high 90 basis point area for the fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 6% to 7% compared to the third quarter or stable, excluding the impacts of the TRA. We have a strong M&A advisory pipeline and expect to continue generating strong financial risk management revenue, which we expect will be offset by earnings credits and softer top line mortgage banking revenue, given the rate environment. We expect total adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 3% to 4% compared to the third quarter, reflecting continued investments in talent, technology and our Southeast branch expansion. Our guidance assumes we open 17 new branches, 16 of which will be in our high-growth Southeast markets. Our fourth quarter guide implies stable expenses for 2022 on a full year basis compared to 2021 and 8% adjusted revenue growth, excluding securities losses, resulting in PPNR growth in the high teens. This will result in a mid-50s efficiency ratio for the full year, a 4-point improvement from 2021 and a fourth quarter efficiency ratio in the 51% to 52% range. We expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be in the 20 to 25 basis point range, which will result in full year net charge-offs of approximately 20 basis points. In summary, with our PPNR growth engine, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Robert Siefers : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Jamie Leonard : Good morning, Scott. Robert Siefers : I was hoping you guys could sort of address the -- maybe, Jamie, that's for you, kind of walk through the puts and takes with Dividend Finance. I think since that closed the origination expectations have been great and continue to increase, but so do the reserve build expectations. So maybe just some thoughts on how much longer will those related reserve builds last. And how is the overall accretion from that transaction trending relative to what you would have thought at announcement? Jamie Leonard : Yes. Thanks for the question, Scott. It's a good one and timely because the dividend expectations on loan growth have continued to go up and up, their performance continues to be very strong from a loan origination standpoint. When we bought them, they were fifth in market share. And our best estimate is that they're top 3 in market share now today, and it's certainly a booming business given the rising energy costs. So with that, we had originally modeled a 5-year earn-back on the acquisition that they'd be profitable in 2023 ex the ACL and in 2024 with the ACL and they're certainly tracking ahead of those expectations. Obviously, the challenge during this quarter and as we look ahead, given their strong loan growth is the ACL build, the ACL build and the credit performance is in line with how we modeled the portfolio with the annual loss rates peaking at a 125 charge-off rate, give or take. But given the long-dated nature of the asset, it results in a much higher ACL build than some of our other loan categories. And so we're going to be providing at a pretty healthy rate in dollars given their strong loan production, and that could be $80 million to $90 million next quarter and perhaps every quarter in 2023 given that we expect $1 billion or more per quarter from them. So I guess that's a long answer to say, it's a good problem to have in the long-term because it's a high-returning asset, both from an NII perspective but also a return on the capital. It's just the unfortunate cost of providing life of loan losses at origination. Robert Siefers : Okay. Thank you for that color. And then maybe the follow-up. You guys have really good common equity Tier 1 and are anticipating resuming share repurchase early next year, but the TCE ratio continues to -- from the AOCI. Maybe if you can sort of just discuss the extent to which TCE, if at all, weighs into your capital decisions. And I think one of the emergent questions at market is if investors are going to sort of rally behind share repurchase from a low starting point of TCE, so just curious to hear your thoughts there. Jamie Leonard : Well, thanks for the question because as you know, I do have some opinions on this topic and bear with me a moment while I walk through it because we run the company looking at metrics that both include and exclude AOCI, and we've been showing you both sets of metrics for better or for worse consistently over the past decade, whether that's ROTCE or tangible book value per share and TCE. And when you look at the tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, we actually grew it in the quarter and for the year, even with the Dividend finance acquisition. So really, when it comes down to the lower TCE ratio and the tangible book value per share, including the AOCI, it really does come down to how the AOCI is moving. And so when Brian and I talk about this and have been thinking through it, we think we're really mixing two issues into that one question. The first question when you parse it out is really based on how do I feel about our investment portfolio's positioning and performance. And I would answer that as I feel very good about how we are positioned and especially how we're positioned relative to peers. It would have been great to time the market perfectly and hit the very best entry points of course. But our two years of patience definitely paid off for us. On a relative basis, we continue to have one of the highest-yielding portfolios and among the lowest unrealized losses as a percent of total securities in the industry. So the potential TCE and AOCI issue from this perspective ultimately comes down to whether you have a low-quality or poorly structured investment portfolio that will incur losses in the future, we do not. We will accrete 45 to 50 basis points or about $1 billion of TCE per year going forward and do not expect to incur any losses in the portfolio. And as we've always said, given the high composition of floating rate loans on our balance sheet, the investment portfolio should act as a shock absorber in a falling rate environment, and we believe the nice duration and structure that we have in the portfolio will do just that. So then the second question that gets mixed into this is then should we be putting securities in HTM instead of AFS? And as we said before, as a Category 4 bank, the election to put the security into AFS or HTM really doesn't impact regulatory capital other than a small deferred tax asset impact, more does it change the economics or the risk of an investment. For the largest banks, clearly, there's value to minimizing the risk of regulatory capital volatility by using the held-to-maturity bucket. For banks like us, we believe the benefits of maintaining some flexibility to manage the portfolio through a volatile environment really does create value for us through the cycle. And given that there's no change in the actual value of the security, simply based on the accounting classification of which the portfolio that we put the securities in, so it really does come down to do we think the company from a TCE or value perspective is worth less by simply fair valuing one line item in the balance sheet, or is it worth less because we placed the security and AFS? And the answer to that, we believe, is clearly no. So our goal is always optimize the balance sheet to deliver long-term real economic value and not make decisions that optimize accounting outcomes over economic value. So with that, I apologize for what may have just been the longest answer in the history of earnings calls. But as you might imagine, we feel strongly about the topic. Tim Spence : And if I can put a point on it, no, it has not factored into the decisions that we make on a day in, day out basis in the way that we run the company or as it relates to capital return. Robert Siefers : Perfect. I appreciate that color. It's an interesting issue to say the least and is having kind of wide-ranging ramifications. I really appreciate that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. Tim Spence : Good morning. John Pancari : Wonder if you can give us a little more color on your thoughts on deposit growth. I know that you indicated that you do expect growth in the fourth quarter, maybe you can help size up that level of growth. And then how do you think about growth into 2023, particularly given that you've completed the delivery deposit balance exits that you had talked about. So how you thinking about 2023, maybe also in the perspective of the non-interest bearing mix as a percentage of the total, how you expect that shifting as well? Thanks. Tim Spence : Yes, Bryan, why don't you address the first part of the question, and then I'll talk a little bit about why we think we can grow deposits in 2023. So go ahead. Bryan Preston : Yes. I mean our goal is always to grow deposits and take share every year. We've obviously got a strong consumer household growth or investments in our southeast markets, our leading TM business. We have confidence that we can take share. We obviously have some full year headwinds on average balances due to the excess commercial balances. We intentionally let run off in 2Q. But we do expect to grow from these 3Q levels from into 4Q, probably up 1% to 2% kind of range. You obviously have normal seasonality that we should expect to benefit from a commercial perspective as we also continue to grow households and grow our commercial relationships. Tim Spence : Yes. I think I just would add John, to put a point on it. We do feel good about our ability to grow deposits for the remainder of this year and as Bryan said, about our ability to grow deposits on an on-going basis. If you just step back and look at the engines that drive deposit growth here, the integration of the branch and the digital offering has been very powerful for Fifth Third, right? And over the course of the past few years, the investment we were making in the Southeast have really accelerated. And that is evident in the rate of growth that we see in those markets. Like I mentioned 8% household growth as an example there. The only bank that has built more branches in the last three years in the Southeast and Fifth Third is JPMorgan Chase, okay? So we have a very fresh branch network. We have another 20-plus branches that will be opened before the end of this year and are on pace to do another 35 next year, all of which are in really high-growth markets. I mentioned the millionth Momentum Banking household when it was opened in the third quarter of this year. I don't think I could overstate the way in which that sort of a product offering changes the nature of the relationship with the customer. Like if you just assume the checking account has a $5,000 average balance, a point of interest on $5,000 equates to about $4 a month. And I mean think about how many other places you spend more than $4 a month and get less value than we're providing now in Momentum as it relates to helping you to manage cash flow and achieve savings goals and move money efficiently and otherwise. And I think that is going to be a very powerful driver of growth. It just makes those core retail deposits stickier than they were in the past. And lastly, then we talked about the treasury management business and they've shared in some of our investor conference presentations, this ratio of turnover to average balances in commercial. So if you just look at ACH volumes over average balances and compare that across banks in our peer group, Fifth Third has by far and away the highest turnover, which is a really good thing because what that means is that the balances that are sitting here being used to support the cash flow velocity of the business as opposed to being treated like an investment alternative, right? And so if you take that as the foundation of the deposit business here, and take into account how hard it is to build those sorts of capabilities over a period of years, it's going to be a pretty powerful moat for the bank going forward. And I think we'll be able to grow from there. Jamie Leonard : And then, John, on your DDA mix question, when we look back the last tightening cycle, our total DDA to total core deposits dropped 5 points from 35% to 30%. This cycle, we started at 38%, and we model a similar 5% decline, or I should say, we're forecasting a 5% decline. And then we actually model in the rate risk disclosures in the presentation, additional migration even beyond that. So we're assuming a similar mix shift as last tightening cycle. But as Tim mentioned, our product lineup is certainly different and better in the treasury management, market share certainly has improved since the last cycle. But either way, we feel good about how we're forecasting it and think it will be manageable. John Pancari : Got it. Okay thanks Jamie. And then separately on credit. If you could just give us some color on the drivers of the higher loan delinquencies in the quarter, it looks like both 90 days and 30 to 89 went up. And then separately, maybe just thoughts on the trajectory of the loan loss reserve ratio, excluding what you're doing with Dividend Finance, do you expect additions here on the underlying reserves beyond that portfolio? Thanks. Richard Stein : Yes. It's Richard. I'll start with the delinquency comment, and I'll let Jamie talk about the ACL changes. Look, the starting from a small base, we have a couple of deals roll into delinquency you have a couple of rollout. There's really no trend. There's no pattern with respect to industry or borrower type. I think it's just a little bit of seasonality in terms of -- or a little bit of -- just a small change in terms of borrower impact as we get through the end of the quarter. Jamie Leonard : On the ACL, the driver of the coverage ratio this quarter was certainly Dividend more than anything else, but the other impact being a little bit worsening in the Moody's scenario. So from here, if Dividend loans continue to grow and be an outsized portion of our originations and that coverage ratio just because of that loan mix shift will continue to increase. But otherwise, you wouldn't expect the ACL coverage ratio to go up or down unless the economic scenario changes or the credit profile improves or worsens more than what we currently have modeled. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thank you Jamie. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Mayo : Hi, can we start off the call talking about virtualizing 90% of your workload? Or I missed some of what you had to say. But what does that mean for your efficiency ratio of 53.3%. Where do you think terminal efficiency ratio is? How much do you have in stranded costs? And on the other hand, the inflation rate costs that are your expenses. So I guess I'm looking for longer-term expense and efficiency guidance and the implications of some of these tech moves. Jamie Leonard : Yes. I had you in mind as we were right in that paragraph, Mike, in terms of the data centers and virtualizing applications. I think the way to think about what we are getting to at this point as we have talked for many years now about the opportunities that we have to use the cloud, whether it was private or public, to take some of the load off of legacy mainframe infrastructure and to put it into an environment that allow it to be much more scalable and resilient over time. And we hit a couple of important milestones in the quarter in that regard, hence, the commentary about the data center move and having virtualized now 90%, a little over 90% of the servers inside the company. Look, long term, I think we feel very good about the ability to drive efficiency on the maintenance and network infrastructure side of the IT business. But we also intend to be able to continue to invest on an on-going basis, new front-end application development and in building new capabilities into the products and services. So I think what we said in the past is the technology spend has been growing at, call it, 10% on an on-going basis but you should expect that sort of growth to continue. But that it would be offset by our ability to eliminate manual processes and drive automation into the company. And if you look at banks in totality, people expense is about half of our total expense on an annual basis. So there's still a lot of opportunity in front of us in a 3- to 5-year time frame to substitute technology for work that has to be done manually today. That's where I think the efficiency opportunities are. And as it relates to the long term, a 53% efficiency ratio, I believe, is as we were looking at it this morning, the best of any of the commercial banks over $100 billion that are reporting. So I feel really good about where we're at at the moment and the intent is to be able to run the company and that's sort of 53% to 55% range on an on-going basis. Michael Mayo : Okay. So how many data centers do you have left? And is it your goal to eventually have no data centers as -- indicated? Jamie Leonard : We'll have to. We'll always have to. There's a lot of [indiscernible] to run certain applications and then be able to store data in your own private environment, you need to have redundancy. Michael Mayo : Okay. And so with the moves that just happened, can you size those cost savings or those savings are simply going to help fund your new tech investments? Tim Spence : There'll be the mechanism to fund the new tech investments. Michael Mayo : Okay. Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi good morning. Tim Spence : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : I just wanted to ask a couple of questions. One, I heard the commentary around deposits earlier and the outlook for deposit growth from effectively benefiting from the new branches, etcetera, that you've been putting in. Could you just give us a sense of that branch trajectory from here and what you're anticipating over the course of the next year or two? And then also give us a sense as to what your deposit pricing strategies are as well for the next several quarters? Tim Spence : Yes, sure. I'll take the branch trajectory, Bryan, you can handle it. I think we have been running on a pace to open, call it, 20 to 30 new branches a year. We'd like to see that be in the more of the 30 to 40 range. So we'll hit mid-20s this year. The expectation is to end up somewhere between 30 and 35 next year and to have the 30 to 40 a year range be what we run in the Southeast markets until we achieve the market position that we want to be able to achieve in each of the MSAs that we are focused on down there. Now on a net basis, the branch network has not been growing that fast because we have taken advantage of opportunities as customers have done more of the transactional activity online to thin out or relocate branches in the legacy network which has provided a basis for funding several of the investments that we're making down in the Southeast. Bryan, do you want to talk about rate? Bryan Preston : Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Tim. We continue to feel good about what we've been able to do on the deposit front. The pricing is obviously starting to get more competitive, especially in the commercial portfolios. But we feel good about the 30% cumulative beta that we have talked about for that first 300 basis points in hikes. Certainly, as rates move higher here, we're going to continue to see some increase in betas. And we've previously talked about maybe that next 100, 125 basis points of hikes, those betas will get over 50%. But we think we're going to be able to manage to the below 40% cumulative beta from here, certainly a little bit higher on commercial than on the consumer side. But we recognize as rates move higher, you are going to start to see more consumer beta flow through as well. Betsy Graseck : Right. I noticed you opt your CD offers and matched JP, which is, I know, a competitive positioning that you've got a lot of your footprint. So that's helpful color on the from here beta that you're looking for. Maybe you could just give us a sense on loan growth trajectory because one of the things, obviously, we're all thinking about is loan growth and dollars deposit growth? And any expectation that you would need to lean on wholesale funding a little bit more. I did notice in the quarter, your averages went up in wholesale funding, but that looks like it was action that you took at the end of 2Q. So maybe just give us a sense as to how you see that all trajecting. Thanks. TimSpence: Yes. So Betty, from my standpoint on loan growth, I think the guide in the fourth quarter is stable to 1% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. That feels like a pretty good benchmark, right? If you were to start on something for where we see loan growth go in. We have really strong production coming out of dividends, as we mentioned, and are very pleased with the performance there and also strong production on Provide. On C&I, more broadly, I think we have been deliberate about moderating production over the course of this past year, you can see that in the numbers. But the production itself is still really good. It's more granular than it had been in the past, which is an important strategic priority for us. What I think I don't see a catalyst for is a material move from here on utilization rates, right? And against the strength in the fintech platforms and good core middle market production in C&I, you're going to have the drag from the slowdown in the auto production and mortgages that I think we started on perhaps earlier than others and therefore, will make its way into the numbers faster than you may see it in other places. Against that, the goal is always to grow deposits. We like to be able to grow deposits faster than loans that we as tannin [ph] of the way that we try to grow the company that doesn't always happen in any one quarter. But we do expect fourth quarter, 1% to 2% deposit growth. And while we're still in the early stages of the planning process, we intend to grow deposits next year. Bryan Preston : Yes. And Betsy, from an overall funding perspective, our wholesale funding portfolio as a percent of our asset base is obviously down a decent amount from where we were pre-COVID. It was kind of closer to 9% of total assets, pre-COVID from a long-term debt perspective that number is down to more like 6% right now. Our loan-to-deposit ratio, obviously, is still near those historic lows. And so over time, we do expect to have more structure in our liability base as well as a little bit more long-term debt. So even if we were to see some moments of loan growth faster than deposit growth, we have confidence in our ability to fund it and adding some of that structure to our balance sheet is a decent place to be as well. Betsy Graseck : Right. No, I noticed your liquidity sources. It's a very fulsome slide, so I really appreciate that. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kenneth Usdin : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of questions on the fee side. Understanding your guidance flat to the 727, I just wanted to understand, Tim, in your intro you mentioned that mortgage servicing will continue to be a benefit. So is the mortgage business hang in from here going forward? And then the second question is just can you flesh out a little bit for us just the impact of earnings credit rates on service charges and what type of impact that could have going forward as well? Thank you. Jamie Leonard : Ken, it's Jamie. I'll take that one. Since we've had long discussions over the years on the strength or lack thereof in our mortgage business and happy to report that the third quarter was a very nice mortgage performance for Fifth Third. I do think from a top line perspective, volumes will be down given the environment into the fourth quarter. But what you're seeing in the strength of the business is really that servicing revenue shine through. And as Tim mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're one of the top servicers rated in the industry, and the improvement in that revenue stream is part of why we beat the outlook for the third quarter and will help support the mortgage fee business going forward. We were running the mortgage banking in the first half of the year, total mortgage banking fees. I think in the first six months of the year were $80 million, and we're going to grow that 60% over the back half of the year simply driven by the strength of that mortgage servicing business that we operate. So we feel good about that. That's a run rate servicing fees, net of MSR decay should be around $40 million to $45 million a quarter going forward, and that's going to be a 10% yielding asset for us. But again, the top line will be a little bit challenge so that net-net, assuming no MSR valuation changes, I would expect the mortgage banking fee line to be in that $60 million to $65 million range in the fourth quarter. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. And sorry, on the service charges with regards to the ECR impact there? And does that continue to -- how does that trend going forward? Jamie Leonard : Yes. When we look just at the fourth quarter, the top line fee equivalent, as Tim mentioned, we have very stronger pipeline and good business. And so top line will be growing 2% or so. But to your point, the earnings credit, just given the rising rate environment, will result in total service charges being down 2% to 3%, and we have earnings credits moving similar to the deposit betas. And so they'll continue to edge higher the Fed keeps moving on rates. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. If I could just ask one more, just on your Slide 24, you added 5 billion more swaps since the end of the second quarter, and we can see how you've laddered that all out. Can you help us just understand, as you start to look past 4Q in terms of NII, can you continue to show positive NII growth given the positive beta comments you made earlier and just the trajectory of the protection that you've put on to the balance sheet. Thanks, Jamie. Bryan Preston : Yes Ken, it's Bryan. Thanks for the question. Based on where we stand today, we feel good about our exit rate NIM in 4Q 2022 carrying over into 2023 with some upside as our balance sheet continues to benefit from the 2022 hikes. We've previously talked about that 4Q NIM in that kind of 335 to 340 range. Assuming a 450 terminal funds rate, we think our NIM will peak in mid-340s in the first half of 2023. We do expect to give some of that upside back as deposit repricing lags catch up. But given the balance sheet actions we've taken to date to monetize our asset sensitivity, we expect we can maintain a 330 plus NIM over the next couple of years even if rates were to fall 200 basis points. Obviously, 2023 and beyond results are subject to significant uncertainty given the economic outlook, and we'll give you additional color on 2023 expectations as part of our fourth quarter earnings in January. Kenneth Usdin : Great. Thanks a lot, Bryan. Tim Spence : Yes. If I'm just going to throw one editorial comment in here, Ken, because you hit on two of the topics that we're spending a lot of time talking about internally is I think, perhaps, because we operated for 15 years in a near zero interest rate environment, people forgot about what long-term drives performance in the banking business. And if there's anything at that current point in the cycle is reminding us is that deposits matter and the diversified fee income business lines matter and an interest rate risk and credit risk management matter. And by those measures, if you look at where we are right now. I mean, the company has been around for 164 years. And this is literally going to be its best year ever in terms of profitability and the strength of some of these fee lines like mortgage servicing, right? Like what we have been able to do on top line with treasury management and the quality of the deposit base, coupled with the prudence that I think our treasury, which has done really an outstanding job here and that we have in the credit organization is going to set Fifth Third up to be able to perform very well regardless of what 2023, 2024, 2025 look like. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks for the color, Tim. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Tim Spence : Hey Erika. Erika Najarian : Hey good morning. Actually, my questions have been asked and answered. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Tim Spence : Hey, Matt. Matthew O'Connor: Good morning. Any impact to the Dividend Finance business from recent legislation. I guess, it's called the Inflation Reduction Act, but there's a lot of climate initiatives in there that I know help from broader areas, but any impact to that business in terms of volumes and reducing the credit versus what you thought it would have been before? TimSpence: Yes. It will be a tailwind for the business. When we underwrote the business and entered into the agreement to buy Dividend, the assumption we were using in our base case was that the federal tax credits would expire and the actions and the Inflation Reduction Act are only going to help support it. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. And then as you think about how big this portfolio can get or you're willing to let it that, obviously, there's a lot of room to run. But if you're originating over $4 billion a year, and it's pretty long duration, the balances could build pretty quickly. Any thoughts on kind of how big? I know I've asked you before, but how big it can get and you're willing to let it at go. Bryan Preston : Yes. I mean, we -- obviously, there's a lot that can change over the next couple of years as outlooks and things adjust and rate expectations change. But as we look at it now and given the capacity that we have on the consumer side because we are going to continue to let our auto portfolio run down getting that portfolio north of $10 billion doesn't cause us any concerns. And we also know that there is a pretty robust market, whether it's securitizations or whole loan markets where we're going to have the ability to manage the portfolio risk associated with these assets, so we feel good about our options associated with it. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. And then actually, just following on my first question, I'm a [indiscernible] that was always a long week. But the benefit of this credit, does this increase the volume? Reduce the kind of long-term expected credit cost? Or what's -- or a little bit about. Tim Spence : It increases the volume. The way to think about it is that from the homeowner's perspective, clearly, there's an incentive to impact your own personal carbon footprint. But these decisions ultimately get made on an economic basis. So the trade-off that the homeowner is making is the cost to install the panels and then to service the debt attached to that relative to the cost to pay an energy bill for energy that you buy from a utility company on a month-to-month basis. So anything that reduces the installation cost on the side of solar or that increases the cost of buying energy off of the grid is beneficial to the size of the overall market is the way to think about it, Matt. And Dividend being one of the largest players, anything that positively impacts the TAM for residential solar or positively impacts the outlook from an origination perspective. So that's why I expect the impact benefit primarily to be as it relates to the extension of federal tax credits. Matthew O'Connor: That makes sense. And obviously, higher energy prices could also increase demand. Tim Spence : Yes. Matthew O'Connor: Would there be an opportunity to securitize or like figure out a way to increase the ability to originate even more without keeping it on balance sheet over time, maybe it's more 3, 5 years out? Tim Spence : We -- I think Bryan mentioned that Dividend has been a top 5 originator. Jamie mentioned that we believe it's a top 3 originator today. The other players in the top are all funding through whole loan transfers or securitizations. So there is a very liquid market for the asset. We have the ability to run at an origination level that is above and beyond what we would hold in the portfolio, if we elected to do it. But that, as you said earlier, we have a long way to run between where we're at today and where we would stop and add very attractive yields from the standpoint of NIM enhancement and overall credit performance. Matthew O'Connor: Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Hi Tim, hi Jamie. Jamie Leonard : Hey Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Tim you talked about Fifth Third is one of the most active branched openers in the Southeast, along with JPMorgan Chase. Can you give us some color on the cost of opening, I know each branch is just different, but a typical cost of opening a branch one type of deposit level you need to reach to make it breakeven? And how long does it take you to get to that deposit level, if you use deposits as the measure for breakeven? Jamie Leonard : Yes, Gerard, it's Jamie. Thanks for the question. We've really reduced the square footage in the branches so that the cost between land and construction is much lower than it used to be and it can range from $3 million to $4 million of book value, maybe a few hub branches would go higher than that. But for the most part, that's where the investment cost is. And as you know, the people side, the staffing is about half of the cost of operating a branch. And so you start to make money when you get into the 25 million-plus deposit range and so that usually takes us 2.5 years or so, sometimes 3, sometimes 2, but our recent de novos are tracking well against the model and actually outperforming on a household growth basis. So that's part of the reason why we're continuing the strategy. And as we look ahead to next year, we did 22 new branches this year in total, and we should do 35 or so next year, primarily in the Southeast. Gerard Cassidy : And Jamie, when you get to that breakeven point, how many -- how much long does it take to get to a return on investment or return on equity, however you measure it to have it at the level that you're very satisfied with? Jamie Leonard : Yes, 5 years is really where leading up to the 5-year mark, you then become profitable, flip over probably at that 4.5% on a cumulative basis. And then the earnings power really starts to accumulate beyond that. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up. Yes, go ahead, Tim. Tim Spence : I was going to say that these are investments with extremely high terminal values, right? If you look at the branches that we have across the network today, it is especially in the world where I think we have done a very good job of being able to integrate the digital investments that we make and the access to a human being in the local market, right? We've talked a lot about the ways in which we're using analytics and other direct connection points to make sure that that's a seamless experience for customers. It just has proven to be a very strong, long-term recipe to grow the franchise. And the longer the Fed stays up, the faster the breakeven on those branches materializes and they are more attractive that the returns look like, right? Gerard Cassidy : Yes, very true. Thank you. As a follow-up on credit, obviously, your credit quality is very strong, similar to your peers. Maybe just remind us why are the customers, I mean you look at all the economic outlook, you mentioned, Jamie, about Moody's. It was a little worse than what you had in the prior quarter in terms of building up the reserves. How is it that credit just remains so strong in view of these crosscurrents, particularly in the housing market starting to weakening. And then and as part of this, can you just share with us also about the used car prices, obviously, they're finally starting to come down. You guys are in that market? And how does that impact maybe future charge-offs or delinquencies if prices continue to fall down? Tim Spence : Yes. I'm going to let Richard provide more specificity. But Gerard, if you just step back and look at it because this is the conundrum that I think we find ourselves in as we look forward and think about how we run the business relative to the signal we've got today. On the consumer side of the equation, if you look at Fifth Third consumer checking deposit balances, they are essentially exactly where they were about between 60% to 80% depending on the cohort you're looking at above where they were at in February of 2020. And that ratio has stayed more or less perfectly constant since the third stimulus check pay. So there were temporary spike as tax refunds came in this past year, that money got spent down by and large over the summer, but it restabilized in that sort of 60% to 80% range you know one, two [ph], at least in our case, such a significant percentage of our consumer exposure is to homeowners, right? It's 85% of total exposure and 75% of our credit card and auto customers are homeowners that they had an opportunity to lock in historically low fixed rate mortgages and to manage housing costs in the past couple of years that will allow them as long as they're seeing 4% to 5% wage inflation, which is kind of where we've been running to manage 7%, 8% headline CPI pretty well, right? And the by product that is the liquidity buffer is there and they have leverage over their costs in a way that others didn't. I think equivalently, Richard and I have been out together in several markets, recently talking directly with customers. And what we hear, by and large, is that customers have been able -- demand has stayed very strong and that customers have been able to exercise pricing leverage and to push input costs through to their customers, right? I think the dynamic, in fact, with them, and in each case that they all remain more concerned by is, although supply chain pressures have eased a little bit, they're still concerned about the stability of global supply chains and are making investments to support that. And then labor is the other primary constraint right now. And there, again, I think where there is good activity going on, a lot of it is going on to fund CapEx to drive labor productivity so that labor requirements can go down at a given level of demand. Now first principles would tell you that with the Fed moving as rapidly as it is and with rates having headed the direction they have that at some point here, the rate cycle has to turn into a credit cycle. And that, I think, is the reason why we've been maybe more cautious in terms of some of our actions, then it feels like we hear other people being because we just think that's prudent at this point in time. But I mean, Richard, do you want to talk a little bit about some of the other specifics. Richard Stein : Yes. I think the 1 thing to add on commercial, Gerard, is remember, there's a loss emergence period, so it takes a little while for the stress to ultimately roll through loss. And I think what we see and Tim articulated a lot of it is our customers are adapting, and they've had to adapt, honestly, for about 3 years now. Let's -- if you go back to 2019, the tariffs were a challenge for a lot of supply chains and manufacturing. They had to adapt. They've learned that. In COVID, you've had inflation. And so we see resilient business owners do what they do, and that's adapt to the challenges and run their business as well. And I think that's part of the conversation, and that's what we get from our relationship and our relationship managers talking to customers really get good insight to what's happening on the ground. And I think, as Tim said, there's more strength there from a fundamental perspective than perhaps people would otherwise believe. Now to your question on auto, I think the answer is auto is going to be a really classic example of a normalization. And again, you've got a shorter -- generally shorter duration in terms of the asset and the loss emergence period, and you have 2 things that are happening at the same time. One, clearly, you can see it with Manheim, used car prices are down 12% and trending down normalizing. At the same time, we're going to be rolling into originations where we bought it -- where customers bought at higher car prices. So -- we don't really see anything abnormal except for an acceleration of this intersection between car values and the originated loan to value, getting back to something that looks more normal. Again, it's a super prime book for the most part. We're disciplined on the underwriting, the resilience when you look at things like delinquencies continue to be very, very good. In fact, they're- continue to be at seasonal lows. So I think it's just this intersection of prices coming down and origination prices coming up. Gerard Cassidy : And then just one quick follow-up on that. During the financial crisis with housing and many times, houses fell below the mortgage value and people. If they were unemployed and couldn't afford it, walked away from the house. If auto loans really go upside down and loan-to-values start to get up to 120%, 130% because of the Manheim number keeps falling, have you guys seen any history of people literally just turning the keys over to the car because the loan is upside down? Or is that really not a factor in the auto market? Richard Stein : It's certainly not a factor today. In fact, Gerard, if anything, think about where auto prices have gone. You're seeing -- we're seeing customers, and we see this across the spectrum that we don't lend into. I don't want to have to go turn the car and buy a new one. It's too expensive. So they're doing a lot of things to keep their car and to stay current or work through with the lenders. We don't see a lot of that because we don't really have that situation given the the quality of our consumer. But right now, I think people -- if they have a job, they want to keep their car, they don't want to go buy new. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Okay, thank you. Operator : Today's final question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Jamie Leonard : Hey, Bill. Bill Carcache : Hi good morning. Thanks, hey good morning. Tim and Jamie, I really appreciate hearing your thought process on the earlier question about TCE. Would your response to that question change at all, if we had a credit cycle and the Fed wasn't able to lower rates due to inflation? So the securities portfolio wasn't able to add as much of a shock absorber as you described earlier? And then to bring that back to the broader question, is there a point where decreases in TCE would become a concern for you in that scenario in particular? Jamie Leonard : Well, I guess, first off, we've been accreting capital just through the strong earnings power of the company. That's going to continue. As Tim mentioned, CET1 will grow in the fourth quarter. So obviously, that will help the TCE ratio. And then when we pick up the buybacks next year, we'll run the company at that 925 [ph] CET1 level. That's our expectation. If there's a credit cycle credit events, I think we will be very happy that we have the portfolio we do given the structure as well as the duration that we have. So I'm not worried about the performance of the investment portfolio. I would say that it's probably the best portfolio in the industry. So we feel good about that. Bill Carcache : That's helpful. Thank you. And then separately, on the funding side, can you speak to your ability to bring off-balance sheet client funds back on balance sheet and the potential amount that is available in theory? Jamie Leonard : Yes. Right now, there's about $4 billion in our client liquidity portal. And then there's also opportunity within the Wealth and Asset Management business. But again, that would just come down to the willingness to pay 100% beta type of pricing. And at this point in time, there's no need to do that. But if we wanted to match money market rates, we could certainly bring more deposits back onto the sheet. Bill Carcache : Very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Jamie Leonard : Thanks, Bill. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Chris Doll for any closing remarks. Chris Doll : Thanks, Dennis, and thanks everyone for your interest in Fifth Third. Please feel free to contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Dennis, you can now disconnect the call. Operator : Thank you Ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the Fifth Third Bancorp Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Chris Doll, Head of Investor Relations, Fifth Third Bancorp you may begin your conference. Chris Doll : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard will provide an overview of our fourth quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Richard Stein; and Treasurer, Bryan Preston have also joined the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of January 19, 2023 and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim. Timothy Spence : Thanks Chris and good morning, everyone. To start, I would like to thank our employees for the job they did, supporting our customers, communities, and shareholders in 2022. You really held true to our core values and our vision to be the one bank people most value and trust. JUST Capital and CNBC recently released their annual study of America's Most JUST Companies, a comprehensive ranking that recognizes companies who do right by all stakeholders has defined by the American public. Fifth Third ranked 23rd out of the roughly 1000 companies covered in the study and was the highest ranked category four bank. It's a great achievement. Thank you for it. Earlier today, we reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. The strength and quality of our franchise are evident in the numbers. We generated record full year revenue of $8.4 billion, up 6% over the prior year. We managed expenses down 1% year-over-year, producing positive operating leverage of 700 basis points and an efficiency ratio of 56%. Net charge-offs for the year were below 20 basis points. As a result, we achieved a full year return on tangible common equity ex AOCI of 16.5%, which places us in the top quartile of our peer group. Just as importantly, we did what we said we were going to do. We have a culture of accountability Fifth Third, and it makes me proud that our full year results exceeded the guidance we provided you last January in every major caption, including total revenue, expenses, and net charge-offs. As a result, PPNR increased 18% compared to our original guide of 7%. We also made important progress on our growth strategies in 2022. We grew consumer households at a peer leading organic growth rate of around 2.5%, led by our Southeast markets at 7% and surpassed last year's record for new quality relationships in our Commercial segment. We opened 18 new branches in the Southeast in 2022, bringing our three-year total to over 70 new branches in those markets. During the year we also made meaningful progress in our technology modernization initiatives and enhanced our peer leading, digitally enabled treasury management managed services, and our momentum banking product offerings. You may have seen that most recently we extended momentum's early pay feature to include income tax refunds. Our FinTech platforms, dividend finance, and provide continue to scale and achieve top national market shares with dividend ranking third and provide ranking second in their respective markets. Our fee generating businesses are better diversified than most peers and continue to be a key focus for investment. Strong performance in our capital markets business related to helping client hedging activities, mortgage servicing and treasury management, all helped to offset market headwinds that all banks faced as did continued net AUM and flows in our wealth management business. During 2022 we remained focused on delivering stable long-term results instead of chasing short-term earnings. We maintained our discipline in our credit underwriting with continued focus on granularity and diversification. The outcomes of this are evident in our NPA, NPL and early stage delinquency ratios, all of which have remained well behaved and well below normalized levels. Our balance sheet management approach remains centered on providing strong and stable NII performance across various rate environments. We extended our advantage in our securities yield by waiting to deploy excess liquidity until we were able to earn positive real yields and we added derivatives to provide hedge protection through 2031. These actions will provide significant long-term benefits in the event of a lower rate environment. With respect to capital, given our strong PPNR growth and benign credit losses, we exceeded our target CET1 ratio in the fourth quarter and resumed share repurchases. Our capital priorities for 2023 are to maintain a 9.25% CET1 ratio and support organic balance sheet growth, pay a strong dividend, and continue our share of purchase program. We expect repurchases to steadily increase each quarter for a total of approximately $1 billion during the year. Jamie will provide you with the detail on our financial outlook for 2023, but it is a strong one that is consistent with our priorities of stability, profitability, and organic growth. We expect to produce another year of strong revenue growth and operating leverage with full year PPNR growth in the mid to high teens, a return on tangible common equity ex AOCI exceeding 17% and an efficiency ratio below 53%. We will continue to invest in organic growth and efficiency initiatives. We'll add another 30 to 35 branches in our Southeast markets, including our first three in Charleston, South Carolina, and several more in the Greenville, Spartanburg, South Carolina corridor. We'll continue to increase investments in marketing and product innovation to accelerate household growth and we'll invest in scaling dividend and provide. Lastly, we'll make significant progress on our tech modernization journey and begin to realize savings and improve the client experience by leveraging these investments to drive automation into our most labor intensive processes. You have my commitment that we will continue to make decisions with the long-term in mind to invest where we can strengthen the value and resiliency of our franchise and to hold ourselves accountable for doing what we say we will do. With that, I'll now turn it over to Jamie to provide additional detail on our fourth quarter financial results and our current outlook for 2023. James Leonard : Thank you, Tim and thank all of you for joining us today. Our quarterly and full year financial performance reflect focused execution and resiliency throughout the bank. We generated strong loan growth in both commercial and consumer categories and generated record revenue. NII was positively impacted by higher market rates as deposit repricing has lagged the repricing of our earning assets, combined with the benefits of fixed rate asset generation at higher rates. Fee income has remained resilient despite the market related headwinds and expenses were well controlled while we continue to reinvest in our businesses. We achieved a full year adjusted efficiency ratio of 56%, which improved throughout the year with the fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio below 52%. Our fourth quarter PPNR grew 12% compared to last quarter and 40% compared to last year. Net interest income of approximately $1.6 billion was a record for the bank and increase 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. Our NIM expanded 13 basis points for the quarter. While interest-bearing core deposit costs increased 64 basis points to 105 basis points, reflecting a cycle to date interest-bearing core deposit beta of 24% in the fourth quarter. Total non-interest income increased 9% sequentially driven by our TRA revenue and commercial banking fees. That growth in commercial banking fee income was primarily driven by higher M&A advisory revenue and client financial risk management revenue, and it was partially offset by softer results in mortgage banking origination fees. Non-interest expense increased just 1% compared to the year ago quarter. This expense growth was driven by our acquisition of Dividend Finance during the year combined with continued investments in Provide compensation associated with our minimum wage hike, as well as higher technology and communications expense, reflecting our focus on platform modernization initiatives. Excluding the impacts of Dividend and Provide, total expenses would've been down 1% year-over-year. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases increase 1% sequentially. Average total commercial portfolio loans and leases increased 1% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting an increase in C&I balances. Growth was led by our corporate bank and robust in almost all of our industry verticals. Among our verticals, production was strongest in energy, including renewables, which increased over 50% year-over-year. Healthcare growth was led by Provide with Provide balances up 150% year-over-year. The period end commercial revolver utilization rate remains stable compared to last quarter at 37%. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increase 1% compared to the prior quarter, led by Dividend Finance as well as growth in home equity. This was partially offset by a decline in indirect secured consumer loans. Average total deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter as an increase in commercial deposits was partially offset by a decline in consumer deposits. Period end deposits increase 1% compared to the prior quarter. After the deliberate runoff of surge deposits in the middle of the year, we have achieved solid deposit outcomes throughout the second-half of 2022 reflecting our strong core deposit franchise. Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends remain healthy and our key credit metrics remained well below normalized levels. The MPA ratio of 44 basis points was down two basis points sequentially, and our commercial MPA ratio has now declined for nine consecutive quarters. The net charge-off ratio increased just one basis point sequentially to 22 basis points within our guidance range. The ratio of early stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due also increased only two basis points sequentially and remains below 2019 levels. From a balance sheet management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on high quality relationships. In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We also have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in non-prime consumer borrowers among our peers. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in CRE. Across all commercial portfolios, we continue to closely monitor exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress and continue to closely watch the leverage loan portfolio and office CRE. We have focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong stable NII through the cycle. Our strong deposit franchise, our investment portfolio positioning, and our cash flow hedge portfolios will provide protection against lower rates well beyond just the next few years, as well as the addition of the fixed rate lending capabilities from both Dividend and Provide should continue to support our strong through the cycle outcomes. Moving to the ACL. Our ACL built this quarter was $112 million, primarily reflecting loan growth. Dividend Finance loans contributed $96 million to the ACL build. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. The base economic scenario from Moody's assumes the unemployment rate reaches 4.2%, while the downside scenario underlying our allowance coverage incorporates a peak unemployment rate of 7.8%. Given our expected period end loan growth, including continued strong production from Dividend Finance, we currently expect a first quarter build to the ACL of approximately $100 million, assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios. Moving to capital. Our CET1 grew from 9.1% to 9.3% during the quarter. The increase in capital reflects our strong earnings generation, which was partially offset by the impact of a $100 million share repurchase completed in December. Moving to our current outlook. We expect full-year average total loan growth between 3% and 4% compared to 2022. We expect most of the growth to come from the commercial loan portfolio, which is expected to increase in the mid-single-digits in 2023. We expect line utilization to be stable in the first-half of 2023, but then decline slightly to 36% as capital markets conditions improve a bit in the second-half of the year. We expect total consumer loans to increase modestly as an expected increase from Dividend Finance and modest growth from home equity and card will be mostly offset by a decline in auto and mortgage reflecting the environment. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect average total loan balances to be stable sequentially. We expect commercial loans to increase 1% reflecting strong pipelines in middle market and corporate banking, and assuming commercial revolver utilization rates remain generally stable. We expect consumer balances to be stable to down 1%, reflecting lower auto and residential mortgage balances, partially offset by dividend loan originations of $1 billion or so in the first quarter. From a funding perspective, we expect average core deposits to be stable to down a 1% sequentially, reflecting seasonal factors before resuming modest growth in the subsequent quarters of 2023. We expect continued migration from DDA into interest-bearing products throughout 2023 with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits ending the year in the low 30s. Shifting to the income statement. Given our loan outlook and the benefits of our balance sheet management, we expect full year NII to increase 13% to 14%. Our forecast assumes our securities portfolio remains relatively stable from the second-half of 2022 levels and reflects the forward curve as of early January with Fed funds increasing to 5% in the first quarter and the first 25 basis point rate cut occurring in the fourth quarter of 2023. Our current outlook assumes total interest-bearing deposit costs, which were 112 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2022 to increase in the first-half of 2023 before settling in around 2% or so in the second-half of 2023. Our outlook contemplates an environment of continued deposit competition, which would result in a cumulative deposit beta by the end of 2023 of around 42%, given the two additional rate hikes in our forecast over our October guidance. The future impacts of deposit repricing lag combined with the dynamics of our loan portfolio should result in our full year 2023 net interest margin, increasing five basis points or so relative to the fourth quarter of 2022 NIM. We expect NII in the first quarter to be down 1% to 2% sequentially reflecting the impact of a lower day count in the quarter combined with stable loan balances. We expect adjusted non-interest income to be relatively stable in 2023, reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments and talent and capabilities resulting in stronger gross treasury management revenue, capital markets fees, wealth and asset management revenue and mortgage servicing to be offset by the market headwinds impacting top line mortgage revenue and higher earnings credit rates on treasury management, as well as subdued leasing remarketing revenue. If capital markets conditions do not improve, we would expect to generate improved NII and lowered expenses in the second-half of 2023. We expect our fourth quarter TRA revenue to decline from $46 million in 2022 to $22 million in 2023. Our guidance also assumes a minimal amount of private equity income in 2023 compared to around $70 million in the prior year. We expect first quarter adjusted non-interest income to be down 6% to 7% compared to the fourth quarter, excluding the impacts of the TRA, largely reflecting seasonal factors. Additionally, we expect to continue generating strong financial risk management revenue, which we expect will be offset by slowdown in M&A advisory revenue and the impacts of higher earnings credits and software top line mortgage banking revenue given the rate environment. We expect full year adjusted non-interest expense to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2022. Our expense outlook includes a one point headwind each from the FDIC insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on January 1st, the mark-to-market impact on non-qualified deferred compensation plans, which was a reduction in 2022 expenses and the full year expense impact of Dividend Finance. We also continue to invest in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth of around 10% consistent with the past several years. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid-single-digits area. Our outlook assumes we close 25 branches in the first-half of 2023 that will deliver in year expense savings and also add 30 to 35 new branches in our high growth markets, which will result in high-single-digits growth of our Southeast branch network. We expect first quarter total adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 6% to 7% compared to the fourth quarter. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal expenses associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, expenses will be down approximately 2% in the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of 9% to 10%, resulting in PPNR growth in the 15% to 17% range. This would result in a sub 53% efficiency ratio for the full year, a three point improvement from 2022. We expect 2023 net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range with first quarter net charge-offs in the 25 to 30 basis point range. In summary, with our strong PPNR growth engine, discipline credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees, and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, guys. How are you? Timothy Spence : Morning Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Can you share with us, Tim, when you talk to your business customers, it seems like there's a real disconnect between everybody's outlook for loan loss reserve building. We understand, of course, at CECL, and you're going to be proactive life of loan losses. And you and your peers are building up the reserves, but then you look at the spreads in the high yield market, they're coming in. One of your competitors yesterday pointed out that the commercial loan spreads haven't widened out. Where is the disconnect? Or are we just going to fall off a cliff possibly in the second-half of the year? But can you share with us what are your commercial customers seeing in their day-to-day business? And are they seeing the weakness that everybody is projecting that will happen later this year? Timothy Spence : Yes. Sure, Gerard and thanks for the question. I don't think we're going to fall off a cliff in the second-half of the year. That's certainly not consistent with what I hear. I was out and went and looked at the calendar the other day. I got to get into eight of our 15 markets in the fourth quarter of this past year. And I think I probably saw 40 or 50 clients while I was out there. I mean, here's what I hear. Like if you look at the manufacturing clients as an example, they're all feeling much more optimistic about moderation as it relates to raw materials. And I think by and large, they solved the supply chain issues that they were facing either through inventory builds or through restructuring the supply chain or because the overseas suppliers that they were relying on to come back online or there isn't an issue in the ports or otherwise. I think the issues they're running into are twofold. One, labor continues to be a challenge and it's labor cost, but it's also just labor availability. Two, because they solved their supply chain challenges through building inventory. When you think about lower inventory turns, you add in rising interest rates, now debt service costs to revenue or higher proportion. And so, while they got the costs associated with raw materials through this last year in price increases, they're all looking to the next 18 to 24 months to try to figure out how they pass on just this sort of continued slow grind on labor, and debt service costs. The services clients are having no problem pushing through costs, which I think is like evident in the inflation data and personally to anybody that took a vacation over the holidays this year. And they continue to be optimistic because demand has remained strong. I think what I hear more than anything else is that we're going to have a little bit of a slow grind down here in terms of growth, and that if anything, the thing I'm more worried about is not do we end up with plus 5%, 0.5% GDP or minus 0.5% GDP, but rather that the market may be overly optimistic about how quickly the Fed is going to be able to bring rates down. And that the byproduct of that is from an operating standpoint, you have to be thinking a lot more about how you position the balance sheet for the next three to five years and for more tepid growth and higher rates than worrying about the next, call it, 12 months in terms of the outlook. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Very helpful. Jamie, circling back to you on one of your favorite topics, AOCI. Can you share with us two things? One, what does the accretion look like coming into 2023 for the AOCI number? And second, in your securities portfolio, I think you showed in your release that the taxable securities are yielding 3% today. What are you guys seeing in new yields as you put money to work? James Leonard : Yes. Thanks Gerard. And yes, I knew when we put you in the queue, I was going to get an AOCI question, so, thanks for living up to that. In terms of the AOCI, if you look at year-end levels with the 10-year at roughly 387, the AOCI, earns back with our duration at 5.4. It earns back pretty evenly across that time period. So, a billion or so of TCE earn back per year. Obviously, no capital impact given that we're category four. If you fast forward to today and where the 10-year is, certainly we've had a significant improvement in the AOCI just in the first 19 days of January. So that would be helpful to the TCE as well. In terms of the securities yields, obviously, we're very pleased with how the portfolio is positioned at a 3% yield. I would expect that what's going to happen with the investment portfolio is that it will continue to grind higher each quarter and finish the year at a 310 level. So, the average for the year is probably in the 305 range, because as we're reinvesting cash flows or seeing opportunities on new investments, we're looking at entry points in that 475 area right now. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from a line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Michael Mayo : Hi. I know you guys walk -- I think it was your phrase that how the maturity securities were like being in the ROTCE motel, if I got that right. And you have hard -- what it's like hardly any securities held to maturity, which gives you flexibility and I'm not sure how much that matters. And maybe just gives you more flexibility as you look ahead, but you're also one of the few banks that are -- if you take the midpoint of your guidance, you're guiding for higher NII off fourth quarter levels. And I'm -- is there a connection between how you're managing your securities book and that guidance, or are they separate? But really the question is, NII guide as it relates to your securities. James Leonard : Yes. Mike, it's Jamie. Yes, I did reference the ROTCE motel few quarters back. And I guess today's theme, it's -- the held to maturity is more like a hide the maturity. And it certainly helps having that flexibility to reposition as environments change. But really there's no one thing that's driving the strong NII outlook and NIM expansion for us. It really is the result of years of hard work of deliberately positioning the balance sheet for really what is a range of outcomes that still could play out given all of the uncertainty. And it really is a total company effort. And that comes from the household growth, new commercial relationships, product innovation, the FinTech acquisitions, and ultimately sales execution both on loan pricing and deposit generations. So that's really what is giving us the ability to grow NII during the course of 2023, as well as expanding NIM at the same time. And I think it's one of those capabilities of Fifth Third that we've proven over the past decade that's perhaps underappreciated by the market. And like you said, the securities are certainly going to be a higher level of gross income over the course of 2023, in part because we were patient in deploying the excess cash that we had and not buying securities when the 10-year was below 2% or even below 1% like some of the other banks. I think one of the bigger differentiators for us will be the fixed rate loan businesses that we have in our ability to emphasize or deemphasize those businesses. And right now, we have a little bit of an emphasis on auto being able to generate roughly $6 billion this year. And then dividend where the gross income on dividend will exceed over $200 million of growth in 2023 relative to 2022. And so really when you package it all together with an investment portfolio that's in a net discount position of about $1 billion, a dividend portfolio that by the end of 2023 will have unamortized fees, that will roll through NII of about $1 billion. We've got a lot of downside protection and a core franchise that with its ability to grow loans and deposits really is helpful. And within all of this guide, we do not assume spread widening. So to the extent that were to happen is, Tim mentioned, that would only be upside to our guide. Michael Mayo : And then, Tim, just a broader level. I mean, do you see a recession based on your bottom up analysis based on all the markets you're visiting, based on the clients you're talking to? I mean, we hear so much recession talk and then we hear about your loan growth and everything else. What do you just think from a high level standpoint? And then what are your assumptions for reserves in terms of unemployment? Timothy Spence : Yes. I'll let Jamie fill the question on the specific assumptions on reserves, Mike. But I probably lost my crystal ball when I moved offices earlier this past year. So, I have to rely on what I hear from clients or what we get from our friends at Moody's and otherwise. If you asked me today, I would tell you we're going to have a shallow recession, I think. But I don't know that there's a big difference between a half a percent of growth and a half a percent of GDP decline in particular, given the amount of derisking that's been done inside the banking sector and certainly inside Fifth Third over the course of the past decade. I think the more interesting dynamic really is going to be this question about the duration of a recession if we see it, and what happens if we don't get a typical recovery, right? If you have several years of below trend growth and inflation that sits above the historic, certainly above the historic 2% target. But Jamie, you want to fill the question on the inputs on the reserves? James Leonard : Yes. Mike, as you know, we used the Moody scenarios of -- their baseline scenario, and that drives 80% weighting and we maintained our weightings at 80.10% with the upside, and the S3 their adverse scenario or 10% probability scenario. So in the adverse, the unemployment gets -- almost up to 8% in the baseline unemployment ratchets is up to 4.2%. And then we blend those scenarios together to drive the ACL. So, I think it meshes well with what Tim's comments were of a shallow or mild downturn in the economy and then a recovery. Michael Mayo : So that's 20% for the 8% unemployment, and 80% for the 4.2% unemployment. James Leonard : 10% on the upside, which is the upside scenario is that the Fed delivers a soft landing, so unemployment stays in the high threes. So 10% in the high threes a baseline at 4.2% peak, and then a downside at 10%, at a 7.8% unemployment. Michael Mayo : Got it. All right. Thank you. James Leonard : Yep. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Jamie, I guess it doesn't -- based on what you said, it doesn't feel like you would get there anytime soon. But in the past, you talked about sort of the 330 margin floor in the event of low rates. Just curious, given all the sort of the ebbs and flows we've had in expectations and just the own -- pardon me -- the moves you've made with your own balance sheet, how are you thinking about that lower bound kind of as we go forward in that 330 level? James Leonard : Yes. We feel very good about the ability to have a floor on the NIM at that 330 level and a 200 down scenario should that play out, given all the work we've done on the investment portfolio with the bullet locked out cash flows along with being in a fairly sizable net discount position and the duration that we have combined with the fixed rate loan origination platforms with auto, Dividend and Provide, those should all provide yields. And then as we've talked in the past, we've layered in $15 billion of received fixed swaps that will also provide additional protection from 2025 through 2032. And that may be one other differentiator for us relative to peers is that we've been focused more on protecting that downside over a longer period of time and therefore, the duration of our swap book as well as our investment portfolio maybe a little better positioned should that downturn occur at the end of the decade. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Thank you. And then switching gears just a bit. Maybe some thoughts on kind of the trajectory of fees as we go through the year. You guys always have the seasonality that helps fourth quarter -- hurts the first. But it will be, I think a pretty substantial ramp up starting in the 2Q. Just curious, I think you alluded to capital markets kind of normalizing or recovering in the second-half of the year. Just maybe your thoughts on main drivers as the year plays out. James Leonard : Sure. Thanks. When it comes to the fee income, we did say relatively stable over the course of the year and probably is helpful to look at it from two components. The first would be a category I'll call the factors in our control that do deliver nice growth, both from a strong customer acquisition perspective as well as overall fee generation from a combination of the branch network, our wealth business, the commercial business. That will drive both credit card income as well as wealth and asset management fees in the mid-single-digit area and top line fee equivalent growth in the treasury management area in the high-single-digit area given our strong product lineup. From there, transitioning to mortgage, that's actually going to be the largest growth item for us in 2023. And it really goes back to all the work that we put into growing the servicing business in 2020 and 2021 when levels were more depressed. It was a good buying opportunity. And so, given our strong mortgage servicing platform, we'll increase those fees from $125 million in 2022 to the $160 million area. So that's a growth of almost 30%, whereas top line mortgage should be relatively stable off very low levels. So, we feel good about those items. Capital markets, certainly the wildcard in our guide, given that we do expect mid to high-single-digits growth in the first-half of the year relative to the first-half of 2022. And then we assume a little bit of additional growth in the back half of the year under the assumption that the capital markets disruption should abate once the Fed reaches its terminal Fed fund level. And again, as I said in the prepared remarks, if that were to not happen, then we would expect a little bit better loan growth, a little bit better NII and lower expenses. So, in terms of PPNR on a relative basis, I feel confident in that should the capital markets improvement not occur. And then the other category when it comes to fees, it would be the headwinds facing us. So, they're really environmental given the increase in interest rates, and that's on the earnings credit. We're managing earnings credits to about a 20 beta, which is a little bit better than what we thought as we entered the cycle. But even with that, service charges ultimately will be down mid-single-digits for the year, which more than offset that strong top line fee equivalent growth. On the consumer overdraft and NSF side, we probably do a little bit better relative to peers, just given that we move sooner on some of those fee and structural changes. But overall, the first-half of the year will be a little bit softer as we lap those changes that occurred mid year 2022. And then as we said in the prepared remarks, the TRA will decline in 2023 as well our expectations on lower private equity income so that other fees will be down 20%, 25% or so. Timothy Spence : I think if there's one thing I might add there, it's -- while we expect capital markets to improve this year, I would not say we expect them to normalize or recover with the investments that have been made in that business. A full recovery in capital markets would result in a substantially larger business and revenue footprint than we're anticipating this year. We just don't expect it to be as bad or as locked up as we saw in 2022. Scott Siefers : Excellent. That\u2019s terrific color. Thank you guys very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Manan Gosalia : Hey, good morning. Timothy Spence : Good morning. Manan Gosalia : I was wondering, can you just walk through the puts and takes around deposit growth in 2023? I mean, it seems like the expansion in the Southeast is definitely a tailwind here. So, how are you thinking about deposit growth, especially given the more challenging macro backdrop? Bryan Preston : Yes. This is Bryan. Certainly, we feel good about our franchise and the improvements that we've made over the years. We have a very strong new customer origination engine, both across consumer and commercial. We've got strong new consumer household growth, strong in QRs from a commercial perspective. We have a very high performing treasury management business that provides a lot of deposit support as well as growth. And as you mentioned, our Southeast branch expansion, obviously, is going to create a tailwind for us as well. And finally, we have proven and analytically driven customer offers that have done a really nice job through the cycle and driving the balances when we need them. So, we continue to maintain a lot of confidence in the environment that we're going to be able to deliver and gain our fair share of deposits as the environment changes. Obviously, we can't grow in all environments, but we are cautiously optimistic and well positioned. Timothy Spence : Yes. And just to put a number on the -- narrowly on the Southeast, like we grew consumer deposits by over 6% in the Southeast this past year to Bryan's point. That is anti has been a tailwind for us. Manan Gosalia : Got it. Helpful. And then, maybe the flip side of that is the wholesale funding. We saw you had some wholesale funding earlier in the year. So, are those balances where you'd like them to be for now? And how does that fit into the overall funding strategy? Bryan Preston : Yes. We're very comfortable with where we are from a wholesale funding perspective. We continue to have very significant contingent liquidity sources that help us manage through uncertainty in the environment. If we see decent deposit growth, we could see those wholesale funding balances come down over time. But we have a lot of flexibility across our funding base to help us manage through both liquidity needs as well as net interest income. Manan Gosalia : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess, I just had one follow-up question on the credit comments earlier, Tim. You mentioned about the resiliency of the bank. But when you think about your scenario of higher for longer rates, do you think that begins to weigh on your customers when you look at either on C&I or on the CRE book that the longer the Fed has to stay at the five-plus rate, their cost of equity, capital is going higher, demand is falling off? And does that lead to a lot more pain on credit, maybe not in later in the year into 2024 absent Fed rate cuts? Timothy Spence : Yes. Let me give you the quick answer, and then I'll let Richard comment. Absolutely. I think that is our view is that it's more of a slow growing dynamic here than a cliff, right, as Gerard mentioned earlier. And that the longer that we go with rates at elevated levels, the more pressure that it places on business -- commercial borrowers, in particular. I think our consumer borrower is a little bit different because such a significant share of our consumer lending is done to homeowners that they've had the ability to inoculate themselves a little bit from inflation because they locked in these historically low fixed rate cost of housing. Richard, do you want to talk a little bit about where specifically you think that grind may take a toll? Richard Stein : Yes. Ebrahim, I think there's a couple of things here. To your question specifically, clearly higher interest rates for longer is going to put pressure across the board. And I think that's, frankly, by design from a Fed standpoint to get things to slow down. The biggest impact is going to be in the leverage lending portfolio. We're starting with higher levels of leverage. Clearly, higher interest rates impact free cash flow. One of the things that we do is when we do our underwriting, and frankly our quarterly monitoring is we will go back and look at the rate curve. And in fact, we look at -- we underwrite the rate curve, forward curve plus 200 basis points to make sure that there's enough cushion in free cash flow so that when we're underwriting and taking on these loans, we can -- we believe these borrowers can withstand the pressure of higher rates through their margins and free cash flow. I think the other thing we're watching for, and as we think about the economy and Tim referenced labor, both cost and availability that in certain segments continues to put pressure on margins, particularly for those industries that have a mismatch between the revenue management and their expense management. So, maybe they've got long-term fixed price sales contracts they've got to manage through with short-term labor. And probably the most acute example of where this is happening is in pockets of healthcare, senior living. We've talked about not-for-profit hospitals, which have low margins. The cost to deliver care and service has gone up pretty dramatically. You can look at nursing availability and wages is a really good example. And there's a lag there in the revenue cycle in terms of reimbursement rates, whether it's public or private, where these companies -- for these companies to maintain margins, profitability. And so, in those cases, we're looking at other things the quality of the balance sheet, liquidity and liquidity burn rates. But no question that the higher -- as rates are higher for longer, it puts pressure on businesses. I think the last thing, and this is part of client selection is understanding the ability of our borrowers to adapt and the resilience to these things. So, it's not just a situation where rates are higher, and companies don't adapt or consumers don't adapt. And it's part of the relationship model and part of the way we go to market in terms of the advice and counsel with our customers, understanding what's happening, looking for alternatives, finding new ways to finance these customers. So that resilience through the cycle will continue to endure. Ebrahim Poonawala : That was helpful. And I guess, just one quick follow-up, Jamie, on Dividend Finance. About $100 million of provisioning. Anything else around Dividend Finance in terms of growth outlook this year versus last year that we should be aware of? Are things picking up or slowing down as we think about just the underlying growth in the business? James Leonard : Yes. We feel very good about the business that Dividend is doing, especially on the solar side of the aisle. And for us, we're expecting roughly $4.5 billion of originations in 2023 with a weighting of 90% solar, 10% home improvement. Home improvement we're less enamored with. But again, it's a good product offering for other points in the cycle. So, it's being deemphasized, and solar continues to do incredibly well. And if anything, there's perhaps a little bit of upside to our NII guide on Dividend for 2023, just given the strength of the business as well as the pricing power. Ebrahim Poonawala : Noted. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : Morning. Timothy Spence : Morning. John Pancari : On the credit front, I know you gave us really good detail on delinquencies and non-accruals. Do you have what criticized assets did in the quarter? And what areas of criticized they have migrated negatively? Richard Stein : Yes. This is Richard. Thanks for the question. Criticized assets were flat for the quarter, both nominally. I think we had a little bit loan growth, so about three basis points of commercial improvement across the board. I would also point out that in addition to credit being stable, delinquencies 30 to 89, 90 and above, NPAs charge-offs were all down for the quarter on the commercial side. I think the things we're watching, and I hit on it a little bit, healthcare, specifically not-for-profit hospitals and senior living for the reasons we just talked about, we've seen some pressure there because of the mismatch between the revenue management and expense management. A little bit of pressure in watching in commercial specialty products, consumer specialty products, right? That's a function of consumers shifting from durables and discretionaries to consumables and non-discretionary and supply chain and inventory management issues. That's the trading down issue. And that's where we've seen most of the movement. The leverage portfolio from an asset quality standpoint has been stable and operating within our expectations. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then sticking to credit, just my follow-up is around both commercial real estate and home equity. In commercial real estate, it looks like you did see pretty noteworthy move up in delinquencies as well as the non-accruals. And so, can you guys talk a little bit about property types within commercial real estate where you're seeing the distress and where your loan to value ratios are? And then in home equity, it looks like you also saw a pretty noteworthy increase in delinquencies there. Just want to get color around that portfolio. Thanks. Richard Stein : Let me take commercial real estate. I think when you think about the delinquencies, if you look at the delinquencies and this is on the slide deck on slide 30, 90 plus is still zero. We've got none. Movements in 30 to 89, six basis points, it's off a really, really low, low base. So, it's not something that we're concerned about from a commercial real estate perspective. I think the thing we're watching for -- we're watching -- I know a lot of people got questions on office. We're watching office. That's a small number for us. In fact, our performance in office is actually in line with or better than the rest of the commercial bank. But there is some pressure there as occupancy attendance and lease rates continue to -- and sublease rates continue to fall. I think there's a couple of things. We've got a very small amount of urban central business district office. That's where most of the pressure is in terms of subletting rates. That for us is Class A property. I would also tell you that in addition to class, vintage matters. That's all new product. It's a new product. It's ESG, qualified lead golden platinum. It has all the modern amenities. So, we feel really good about those particular properties. The rest of our office portfolio sits more in suburban markets. And again, you don't have the same pressure from a lease rate, sublease rate and a tenant perspective across the board. Across the rest of commercial real estate, multifamily continues to perform very well. The demographic trends, the household formation continue to be strong. Rental rates continue to accelerate faster than construction costs. So, again, there's a positive tailwind there. Same thing with industrial. Industrial demand, this kind of goes back to the reshoring thing, trend. Industrial demand is really strong, continues -- lease rates continue to hold in. So, we feel really good there. Hospitality is stable. And that continues to be a good trend and then in retail is stable. So, feeling really good about where we are from an overall perspective in commercial real estate. You want to add a comment? Timothy Spence : John, I just was going to say on the equity side, all you're seeing, I think, in the consumer for us at the moment is just seasonality. Like a sequential comp from the third quarter to the fourth quarter are the wrong comparisons. Just given the natural seasonality in those businesses, I think it's better just to look at year-over-year. And we expect consumer credit to normalize over time. That's reflected in the guide that we gave. But the delinquency dynamics there are really no different than what you would have seen pre-pandemic, other than the fact that they're still muted relative to what we would have had in the past. So, I -- personally, home equity is not the area that's been an area of focus for me. That's for certain. John Pancari : Yes, yes. No, I got that. I just saw the reserve addition as well to the home equity allowance. Timothy Spence : Well, actually, the dynamic there is that for the first time in as long as I've been at the bank, we actually had quarter-over-quarter home equity growth. What's driving that outcome, but not a change in perspective for us on the quality of the credit or the likely outcomes there. John Pancari : Right. Good problem to have. Okay. Alright. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matthew O'Connor: Good morning. I might have misheard the comment on the indirect auto kind of loan growth expectations for this year. Can you just repeat that, what the strategy is and what you're seeing in the spreads there? James Leonard : Yes. Actually, spreads have done well and are actually off to a very solid start in 2023. We finished the year in 2022 with 7.1 billion of production, if you take auto as well as the RV, marine and specialty business combined. So that fixed rate consumer secured loan category. Our expectation for 2023 for that asset class is to be down to about 6 billion or so. So, loan balances in that caption, we would expect to be down. However, yields, we expect to improve 100 basis points from the fourth quarter 2022 levels to fourth quarter 2023 levels. So, it is a nice accelerator to the earlier question around how are you able to deliver both NII growth and NIM expansion. That certainly is a helpful driver. Matthew O'Connor: Got it. And then just separately on the capital level, we're seeing some divergence in targeted capital out there. Obviously, there's like upward pressure at the biggest banks, not really relevant to you. But then some of your peers are targeting closer to 10%. And I'm certainly on board with 9%, seeming very high. But I'm wondering, is there any kind of behind the scenes pressure whether it's rating agencies or regulators to just hold a little bit more, given some of the macro uncertainty or anything else that we're not seeing? James Leonard : Yes. Great question, Matt. Thanks for asking. I would say that as this environment unfolds, it really is, to your point, going to create differentiation in both performance execution and overall balance sheet positioning. We've, I think, for a number of quarters and years now been discussing how cautious our outlook is. And that has really informed what we're willing to do from a credit risk appetite perspective. So, the capital levels ultimately are a factor of the credit profile of what's on the sheet as well as the reserve levels that we have. So, the CET1 level at 925 and an ACL level of 198 creates a very sufficient loss absorption capacity. And given our SCB level is the at the minimum, I think external factors or forces would say that we're very well-positioned from a credit profile perspective as well as from a loss absorption capacity. So, we feel good about that. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is Ben Reseck [ph] on for Ken. Just a quick follow-up on the Dividend Finance. As those originations continue to ramp up and mortgage loans go on balance sheet, when do you ultimately see that NII benefit overcoming the reserve builds and becoming accretive to earnings? And then, can you just remind us of what type of loss rates you're assuming on those dividend loans? Thanks. James Leonard : Yes. Great question. The PPNR levels for Dividend will be positive in the back half of -- or in 2023. The net income of Dividend post ACL will be positive or accretive in 2024. Certainly, if prepayments accelerate faster than what we have modeled, then that large amount of unamortized platform fees will come through the P&L, would it improve or accelerate the return profile. But for now, that's how we have it playing out. And we model roughly an eight-year life on the dividend asset and that we would expect to have loss rates in the 125 basis point area on a blended basis for the portfolio per year over those eight years. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Chris Doll, I turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks. End of Q&A: Chris Doll : Thank you operator, and thanks everyone for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the investor relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Operator, you can now disconnect the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Chris Doll : Good morning everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third\u2019s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning our President and CEO, Tim Spence and CFO, Jamie Leonard will provide an overview of our first quarter results and outlook. Our Treasurer, Bryan Preston has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements and our materials which can be found on our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding to the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third\u2019s performance. These statements speak only as of April 20th 2023 and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim. Timothy Spence : Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The past six weeks have seen a great deal of volatility in the banking sector. Markets have been trading on narratives over fundamentals and the term regional bank has been used to describe such a broad cross section of business models that it has lost any real descriptive value. While we at Fifth Third take any instability in our sector very seriously, there was no crisis inside our four walls. We\u2019ve been running the company with the expectation for a higher, for a longer rate environment for many quarters now. We\u2019ve consistently communicated in these calls and at investor conferences. As our first quarter results demonstrate our balance sheet remains well fortified, and our capacity to generate strong profitability through the cycle is strong. Excluding items noted in the release, we reported earnings per share of $0.83, a 20% increase compared to the year ago quarter. We generated nine points of year-over-year positive operating leverage driven by an 18% increase in revenue. During the quarter we held average and period end deposits flat sequentially despite the industry wide impact of quantitative tightening and normal seasonal pressures. Our key credit metrics remain near historical lows with net charge-offs of 26 basis points coming in at the low end of our guidance range. NPAs NPLs and early stage delinquency ratios remained below normalized levels, and criticized assets decrease modestly during the quarter. Moreover, we accomplished all this while also being recognized by Ethisphere as one of only two U.S. banks on their world's most ethical companies list. We were named by Fortune as one of America\u2019s most innovative companies. And we saw our FinTech platform provide named by Fast Company as one of the world's most innovative businesses. The strong outcomes achieved this quarter and in particular in the month of March highlight the strength, granularity and well balanced nature of our deposit franchise. In the weekend, following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank alone, we open more new commercial deposit accounts than we would in a typical month. Similarly, our consumer household growth accelerated after the March turmoil. Our commercial deposit franchises led by our peer leading treasury management business where we rank in the top 10 nationally and most major commercial payment types, 88% of our commercial deposit balances are attached to relationships that utilize TM services today, and the average age of our commercial deposit relationships is 24 years. These characteristics contribute strongly to stability regardless of balance size. Our consumer deposit base is granular with nearly 90% of total consumer deposits, FDIC insured and is anchored by our flagship mass market momentum banking offering and strong branch presence in the markets we serve. Annual consumer household growth finished the quarter above 3% led by our southeast markets above 7%. During the quarter, we opened five branches in our southeast markets on top of the 70 add ins in the past three years, and we expect to open an additional 30 branches by the end of 2023. All said, end of period total deposit balances ended the quarter above the level on March 8. Looking forward while we face the same headwinds that all banks do from increased deposit competition, economic uncertainty and the potential for regulatory change, I am confident in Fifth Third\u2019s ability to achieve top quartile returns through the cycle with a focus on stability, profitability and growth. Our long-term discipline managing interest rate and liquidity risks positions us well to generate differentiated outcomes in a range of economic environment. From a credit risk perspective, our low CRE concentration and commercial and in particular in office CRE, along with our focus on homeowners in consumer should prove to be significant advantages. Jamie will provide more information on our forward guidance, but the implied profitability and return metrics for our full year 2023 expectations are well ahead of our core 2019 results. Considering the uncertain and environment, we have elected to deposit [Ph] share repurchases for the second quarter and we\u2019ll evaluate resuming them in the second half of the year. Last, but certainly not least, I want to thank our 20,000 employees for their hard work and dedication and supporting our customers, communities and shareholders. Your commitment to living our purpose and making sure we do the right thing every day is evidence. With that, I\u2019ll now hand it over to Jamie to provide more details on our financial results and outlook. James Leonard : Thank you, Tim. And thank all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter results were strong despite the market volatility during the quarter. Average and period and total deposit balances were flat compared to the prior quarter. Average core deposits declined in line with our guidance of down 1%. We grew loans modestly during the quarter while adding new quality relationships in both commercial and net new households and consumer. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of 59% and a seasonally challenged quarter, which is a six point improvement compared to the year ago quarter. Our first quarter core PPNR grew nearly 40% compared to last year, reflecting the diversification and growth of our revenue streams combined with disciplined expense management. Net interest income of approximately $1.52 billion increased 27% year over year, but declined 4% sequentially. Our sequential NII performance was impacted by our shift to a more defensive balance sheet position given the volatile environment, the impact of lower day count and seasonally strong investment portfolio income in the prior quarter. Fee income exceeded our expectations despite the market related headwinds, and we remain disciplined on expenses while continuing to invest in our businesses. PPNR was impacted by the expenses associated with higher than expected fee income. Our NIM declined six basis points for the quarter, while interest bearing deposit costs increased 64 basis points to 176 basis points, reflecting a cycle to date interest bearing deposit beta of 36% through the first quarter, which includes the impact of CDs. Total adjusted non-interest income increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter driven by -- commercial banking and mortgage fee income, which more than offset a decline in deposit service charges due to the elimination of consumer NSF fees last year and the impact of higher earnings credits from higher market rates this year. Growth in commercial banking fee income was primarily driven by increased loan syndication, fixed income sales and trading and M&A advisory revenue, partially offset by a decline in corporate bond fees. The improvement in mortgage revenue was driven by increased servicing fees and lower asset decay. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 6% compared to the year ago quarter, excluding the impact of non-qualified deferred compensation expenses from both periods. Expense growth was elevated due to the dividend finance acquisition in the second quarter of 2022 and growth in the provide franchise. Excluding the FinTech growth impacts and the FDIC assessment, total expenses increased approximately 3% compared to the year ago quarter as discipline throughout the bank, combined with automation initiatives were offset by compensation associated with our minimum wage hike, higher fee income and higher technology and communications expense, reflecting our focus on platform modernization initiatives. Moving to the balance sheet, total average portfolio loans and leases increased 1% sequentially reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer portfolios. Commercial was led by C&I where payoffs were muted and production was stable in our regional middle market banking business but down in our corporate bank. The subdued production and the corporate bank reflects our focus on optimizing returns on capital in this environment, combined with less robust demand. Compared to a year ago quarter, C&I loans, excluding PPP have increased 13%. The period and commercial revolver utilization rate remains stable compared to last quarter at 37%. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases increase 2% compared to the prior quarter led by dividend finance while balances from the rest of our consumer captions remained relatively stable. Average total deposits were flat compared to the prior quarter, as increases in CDs and interest checking balances were offset by a decline in demand deposits. By segment, wealth and asset management average balances increased sequentially, consumer was stable and commercial modestly declined consistent with normal first quarter seasonality. Period and total deposits were also flat compared to the prior quarter. Notably, we have grown deposits 1% since the end of last June compared to a 4% decline for the top 25 banks as shown in the Feds AJ data. We have included additional materials in our earnings presentation to highlight some of the key attributes of our high quality deposit franchise that may be relevant in this environment. Moving to Credit, as Tim mentioned, credit trends remain healthy and our key credit metrics remained well below normalized levels. The ratio of early stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased four basis points sequentially to 26 basis points and remained below 2019 levels. The net charge-off ratio of 26 basis points increased four basis points sequentially, and was at the low end of our guidance range. The NPA ratio of 51 basis points was up two basis points compared to a year ago. From a credit management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on high quality relationships. In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which are 85% of our consumer portfolio. We have also maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in nonprime consumer borrowers among our peers. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall portfolio concentration in CRE at 14% of total loans. Across all commercial portfolios, we continue to closely monitor exposures where your inflation and higher rates may cause stress and continue to closely watch the leveraged loan portfolio and office CRE. Office loans of $1.6 billion represented just 1.3% of total loans, with a criticized ratio of 8.2% and only one basis point of delinquencies. While the leveraged loan portfolio has declined 65% since 2016, and is now less than $3 billion outstanding today. We have focused on positioning our balance sheet to deliver strong, stable results through the cycle. Moving to the ACL. Our reserve change this quarter was a net increase of $37 million, or a build of $86 million excluding the onetime impact of adopting the accounting standard eliminating TDR accounting, which reduced the reserve by $49 million. Our bill primarily reflected loan growth, notably from dividend finance loans which contributed $88 million of the increase. The ACL ratio increased one basis point sequentially, or five basis points excluding the accounting change. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. The base economic scenario from Moody's assumes the unemployment rate reaches 4% while the downside scenario underlying our allowance coverage incorporates a peak unemployment rate of 7.8%. We maintained our scenario weightings of 80% to the base and 10% to each of the upside and downside scenarios. Moving to Capital, our CET1 ratio remained relatively stable compared to last quarter, and in the first quarter at 9.25%. Our capital position reflects our strong earnings generation offset by the impacts of returning capital in the form of dividends and repurchases, risk weighted asset growth primarily in consumer loans and a seven basis point decline from the CECL phase in. Our tangible book value per share increased 11% sequentially, partially impacted by our AOCI position, which improves 17%. Tangible book value grew 7% excluding AOCI compared to the year ago quarter. Moving to our current outlook, we expect full year average total loan growth between 2% and 3% which reflects our cautious outlook on the economic environment. We expect total commercial loans to increase in the low to mid-single digits area compared to 2022 which implies modest incremental growth from the first quarter through year end given our outlook for a tempered lending environment in the second half of the year. We expect line utilization rates to remain stable. We expect total consumer loan growth to also be modest as a strong increase from dividend finance will be mostly offset by a decline in auto and mortgage. We continue to expect approximately $4.5 billion in dividend loan production for the year given the secular tailwinds and our investments in the business combined with market share gains. We expect deposits to be stable or grow from the first quarter average level as we progress throughout 2023 consistent with our strong customer acquisition trends. Within that, we expect continued migration from DDA into interest bearing products throughout the remainder of 2023 with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits, declining from 32% today to 30% by year end. For the second quarter of 2023, we expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% sequentially with growth fairly balanced between commercial and consumer portfolios. We expect average deposits to also be stable to up 1% on a sequential basis. Shifting to the income statement, we expect full year NII will increase 7% to 10%. As other banks have noted, industry wide deposit pricing pressures intensified in the wake of the Silicon Valley and Signature Bank failures. Therefore, as shown in our presentation materials, we are providing NII guidance under a range of deposit betas given potential diverging levels of intensity with respect to deposit competition going forward. The upper end of our NII guidance assumes an approximate terminal beta of 43%, and the lower end assumes approximately a 49% terminal beta compared to our January expectation of 42%. The midpoint of our NII outlook translates to a 47% beta with total interest bearing deposit costs increasing 45 basis points or so in the second quarter, and another 25 basis points in the second half of the year. Our outlook also considers the lag effects from previous rate hikes and continued DDA migration and assumes the Fed hikes 25 basis points in May, and then holds short term rates of 525 basis points for the remainder of the year. Our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances decline a couple billion dollars between now and year end, and that we hold closer to $10 billion in excess cash for most of the year. Assuming we continue to defensively position the balance sheet for the remainder of the year by maintaining an elevated excess cash position combined with continued intense deposit competition, we are assuming NIM will be in the 320 to 325 range for the year. We expect second quarter NII to be down approximately 1% sequentially reflecting the deposit loan and cash dynamics I mentioned. We expect adjusted non-interest income to be stable to up 1% in 2023, reflecting continued success taking market share due to our investments and talent and capabilities, resulting in stronger gross treasury management revenue, capital markets fees wealth and asset management revenue and mortgage servicing to be partially offset by higher earnings credit rates on TM, subdued lease remarketing revenue and a reduction and other fees reflecting lower TRA and private equity income this year. We expect our fourth quarter TRA revenue to decline from 46 million in 2022 to 22 million in 2023. We expect second quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 2% to 3% compared to the first quarter. We expect to continue generating strong revenue across most fee captions and that will be partially offset by a slowdown in debt capital markets revenue. We continue to expect full year adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2022. Our expense outlook incorporates the FDIC insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on January 1. The mark-to-mark can impact on non-qualified deferred compensation plans which was a reduction in 2022 expenses, and the full year impact of investments to grow the dividend finance and provide businesses. Excluding the dividend acquisition, FDIC assessment and NQDC impacts, we would expect our full year 2023 core expenses to be up less than 3%. Our guidance reflects continued investment in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth in the low double digits for the year. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid to high single digits area. Our guidance also factors the run rate benefits from the severance expense recognized in the first quarter, which reflected proactive actions taken to reduce on-going expenses given the operating environment. We expect second quarter adjusted non-interest expenses to decrease 8% to 9% compared to the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of 6% to 8%, resulting in PPNR growth in the 9% to 10% range. This would result in an efficiency ratio below 55% for the full year. We expect second quarter PPNR to increase 10% to 11% compared to the first quarter, and for second quarter efficiency ratio to be around 54%. We continue to expect second quarter and full year 2023 net charge-offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis points range. Given our expected period and loan growth, including continued strong production from dividend finance we continue to expect a quarterly build to the ACL of approximately $100 million, assuming no changes in the underlying economic scenarios. In summary, with our strong PPNR growth engine, discipline, credit risk management, and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to continue to generate long-term sustainable value for customers, communities, employees and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Please proceed. Scott Siefers : Good Morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Let\u2019s see, Tim, you talked about the much higher than typical commercial account openings in during all the turmoil. Can you talk about sort of early reads on what has happened with those and sort of generally speaking how you\u2019d expect commercial customers to behave going forward, whether they\u2019ll keep the same amount with their primary institution or diversify sort of permanently? How would that all work in your mind? Timothy Spence : Yes, so good. Good morning, Scott. Thanks for the question. Just a note for everybody. We know you have a busy day here. So with the exception of the soliloquy that Jamie has prepared on regulation going forward, we\u2019re going to try to keep our answers. pretty crisp. We were delighted to see the activity obviously and to see that continue to carry forward through the end of the quarter. All but I literally had single digits you could count on, I think one hand and two fingers, the number of the accounts that we opened, that didn\u2019t fund up between the that weekend immediately following Silicon Valley and the end of the quarter. So I\u2019m very pleased with the activity level there. I think in terms of account behavior going forward, I think we\u2019re going to see a much more prominent bifurcation and behavior between operational accounts and non-operational accounts, right. In effect on the corporate treasurer side, cash as an investment versus cash as a tool in terms of the way that you manage the business. And that is reflected in the operational account behavior that we saw during the period I think probably contributed very significantly to the stability. The Fifth Third experienced in terms of commercial account balances. But Jamie, you have anything you want to add? James Leonard : Yes, and Scott, what we also saw in the first quarter was that clients were focused on getting money to the best vehicle possible. So for us during the quarter, we moved almost a billion dollars more into the money market portal that we manage for them. And even with that incremental movement, we were only down about a billion dollars in commercial and a seasonally challenged quarter when last year, we were down 2 billion in the quarter, seasonally and the year before that we were down 3 billion. So to Tim\u2019s point, the money has been moving to the optimal investment vehicles. But the good news for us is we were able to overcome that headwind and actually posted a very solid commercial deposit quarter. Scott Siefers : Perfect, thank you. And then Jamie, maybe additional color on you gave the thoughts on non-interest bearing the total deposits and certainly that go forward mixer and of your mix. What in your thinking makes that the right number? Why not -- why not lower, why not higher? What was sort of the inside baseball on that? James Leonard : Yes, the last tightening cycle, we moved down five points. This time we\u2019re forecasting to go down eight to finish the year at a 30% DDA to core deposit level. Given that our rate outlook now has the 525 and a lot longer hold with no cut. We think we\u2019ll see continued migration and higher earnings credit rates that will result in more DDA migration. And then the challenge over time is, can you sell enough treasury management services to rebuild that DDA balance and given our strong treasury management business, we feel confident in our ability to do it. So hopefully, we do bottom out at 30. But for every 1% more than that, it translates to 40 to 50 million of NII erosion. So, it\u2019s, while not tremendous impact, we would still want to ensure that we get that 30% higher as we head into 2024 and things like that. Scott Siefers : Perfect. All right. Thank you, everyone. James Leonard : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Tim. Hi, Jamie. James Leonard : Morning. Gerard Cassidy : Jamie, you\u2019ve touched on the credit and how strong it is particularly in the commercial real estate office. I think when you guys look at the scene I portfolio is there anything on the horizon whether it\u2019s I know your leverage loan balances, as you pointed out, are down dramatically from 2016. What are you guys seeing or sensing on the scene in the C&I portfolio not CRE? James Leonard : Yes, on C&I, that was the driver of the NPA increase this quarter. So on the surface NPAs, were up seven basis points, this sector that drove it the most within C&I would be restaurants, entertainment as well as professional services. But with that said, the delinquency levels in commercial and certainly in C&I continue to be benign. And Tim and I were looking back at where we were on NPAs. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we were at 62 basis points versus the 51 that we\u2019re at today. And if you look at the 10 year average, for us, we\u2019re at a 69 basis point average. So while we\u2019re up that seven basis points sequentially, it\u2019s really more of a normalization. And we\u2019re still 25% or so below a normal run rate when it comes to commercial NPA. So it\u2019s really normalization within some of these sectors. And for us, at least right now, it\u2019s entertainment and professional services. Timothy Spence : And if I if I just add one thing on that drawing, scale is going to matter in terms of the clients that you bank, in C&I, because if you think about the dynamics that are creating headwinds for the economy, they\u2019re related to your ability to manage input costs, or production. And ultimately, right the higher costs of carrying inventory to offset concerns around supply chain resiliency on an on-going basis. So when you the sense you get I do when I\u2019m out talking with clients is the manufacturing businesses and the businesses attached to the resurgence of manufacturing in the U.S. are doing really, really well. The businesses that are attached to more discretionary spending. The larger clients have been able to pass input cost increases higher cost of labor through the smaller ones are having a more difficult time. And I think that arm wrestling we're seeing going on right now as an example between the not for profit hospitals and the health. The health care insurance companies is a really good example of where the larger not for profits are having a easier go of extracting concessions to cover increases in nursing costs and otherwise, and the smaller ones, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s been more of a standoff. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Then, as a follow up question, Jamie in the outlook on in interest revenue obviously, you guys got it down a little bit. But if you\u2019ve had to paint two scenarios, one is the bullish scenario, what would rates have to do where you could actually see maybe deposit betas stall out faster? Or net interest revenue picks up? And then what\u2019s the more cautionary view? Is it higher rate, not the frozen rate, five and a quarter, but we get the six and a half or something like that on Fed Funds rates in the first quarter of 2024? Can you give us those two variables? James Leonard : Yes, I would say that. On the positive side of net interest income, if the industry and the competitive dynamics settled down over the next couple of months, couple of quarters, then we would expect that we would operate in that low to mid 40s beta and that would deliver the higher end of our NII guide. We\u2019re a little cautious though, in what we\u2019re seeing from a competitive standpoint, as banks are clearly focused on driving, more insured retail deposit growth, and therefore the retail beta is the wildcard in our guide, and why we show the range of deposit betas that could play out and therefore the range of the NII guide is a little wider than what we normally would do just given the uncertainty with how competition will react. So in the near term, that is the wildcard that perhaps retail deposit betas which had been very well behaved actually double by the end of the year. And that would take us to the low end of the guide. I think longer-term when it comes to rates progressing beyond five and a quarter. It really comes down to what are the credit implications as the Fed reaches an even higher level. We think the magnitude of the rate increases have certainly created some shock across the country. And you saw that obviously, in what we\u2019re calling the March Madness. But I think from an NII perspective, those higher rates could continue to be productive as long as the deposit beta dynamics stay in the 40% range. But if competition heats up, and we get into a 60% plus beta environment, that would be unproductive to NII. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please proceed. Ken Usdin : Hey guys, good morning. As you as you as you think further out, I know Jamie would talked about that, that trying to channel that downside, NIM. Obviously, the rate environment has changed and all the points about the mix and the deposit growth have as well. But just in terms of just how the how you expect the balance sheet mix to change over time, given that you\u2019re running down the securities book and your points about the DDA mix. How do you just think about that NIM protection angle, and does it make you think any differently about your, the way you built the swaps portfolio and protecting that? Thanks. James Leonard : Yes, we feel very good about how the balance sheet is positioned, especially for a downgrade environment. Obviously, the swaps we\u2019re very pleased with the entry points there. We\u2019ve talked at length about in 2025, there\u2019ll be a nice increased NII as the new swaps kick in. In terms of the investment portfolio positioning, we\u2019ll have a bit of a decline in the second quarter as we don\u2019t reinvest cash flows, but from there should be relatively stable. We may continue to reposition non-HQLA and the level ones but ultimately that\u2019ll be regulatory dependent, but overall feel good about the bullet locked out nature, the structure that we have. So I think for us, it\u2019s going to be more of operating in a high 70s loan to deposit ratio and continuing to maintain that while being very disciplined on credit which is why the loan growth guide was trimmed a bit to that up, up 2% to 3% level. Ken Usdin : Got it. And then on the same point about that deposit repricing isn\u2019t when the Fed does got in and obviously a lot of banks are guiding with the with the curve right now, how does your models work in terms of timing of Fed cuts versus your ability then change the direction of deposit pricing? James Leonard : Yes, I mean, in general, it\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s a balance of that nature of when the cuts actually occur. If you\u2019re in a foreign liquidity environment where things still are relatively tight, the Fed has gotten inflation under control, but there\u2019s not a big credit event obviously, the measured cuts would be one where you\u2019re going to have a little bit more challenging time, reversing all the beta, you\u2019re still going to get some of the beta out. But in this scenario, where the Fed is having to loosen liquidity conditions pretty rapidly, you\u2019re going to have an opportunity to get a little bit more aggressive on your rate cuts from there and get some more of that beta out. So it really is going to be a little bit of a balance of how things play out. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time positioning the commercial book in particular, to make sure that we stay with the appropriate amount of price sensitivity there so that we can reprice down as necessary. We\u2019re up to about $20 billion of index deposits. So we\u2019re taking a lot of actions to make sure that we\u2019re well positioned, whether they stay high, or if they cut that we\u2019ve got the flexibility to navigate through those different environments. Ken Usdin : Understood, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please proceed. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. James Leonard : Morning, Erica. Erika Najarian : My first question is on the potential coming regulatory environment. And Jamie, you probably need something stronger than coffee for this question. But the first is on CT1, you generated 30 basis points of capital organically this quarter. And I\u2019m wondering as there\u2019s no NPR yet, but the market is anticipating tighter capital and liquidity standards. Tim, how do you think about the endpoint of capital for an institution like [Indiscernible] from this nine and a quarter? And how should we think about, what that sort of endpoint is over the medium term, and the role of share repurchases, and potentially more RWA optimization? Timothy Spence : Sure. I\u2019m going to let Jamie start on that one, Erica, and then I\u2019ll follow. James Leonard : So from a short term perspective, obviously pausing the buybacks, and given the second quarter guide, we would expect to your point that we would continue to generate, call it 25 basis points of capital, even with some RWA growth in the second quarter. I do believe that it will be dependent on what the regulations ultimately come out with in order to then answer the medium term part of your question, because if I were king for a day, I would not change the AOCI opt out rules because this was not a capital crisis. I think the capital regime works as stated. But should they decide either to eliminate, held to maturity and force everybody in the AFS and then force AFS into an AOCI mark, perhaps the core earnings capacity of the company along with you, we included in the deck additional capital accretion measures, that we would improve the AOCI levels by 45%, by the end of next year. But it would be a manageable item for us; we just don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessary. We have a balance sheet that our target capital level is 9%. All stress testing says 9% is great. But, in this environment, we\u2019re going to accrete capital here in the short term and will get to 950. And hopefully have a little more clarity for everybody next quarter. Timothy Spence : And I think just to add two thoughts. Our capital stress testing indicates you could run the bank at below 9%, which is the reason that hasn\u2019t been the binding constraint for us. We just elect to do it at the level we do because we like stability, right? And I think we were clear with everybody when we reset the capital target last year, we did it because we were concerned about uncertainty in the Outlook, and we felt that it was prudent to start building capital early as opposed to having to do it later. So I am pleased in our positioning, I think more broadly one caution I would give everybody is I think some will take the discussion about change in regulation on capital liquidity and just bake it into models. Without assuming that there\u2019s any sort of evolution in the business model. The FDIC has been publishing quarterly data on the sector, I think since 1934. At least the dataset goes back that far. And there\u2019s been more than one regulatory regime change during that period. And if you adjust for tax, the tax policy at a given point in time, the return levels in the sector have been remarkably consistent. So to the extent that more banks are required to hold more capital, or more liquidity, or to change the structure of funding, I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that the business model is going to evolve, as well. Erika Najarian : Got it. It\u2019s amazing how resilient banks can be when there\u2019s some level to rates. Right. And just a follow up question to that, for -- this management team is sort of well known for being more forward thinking, whether it\u2019s your balance sheet resilience to what\u2019s been happening in the right environment, or that, ACL ratio. And as we think about, like you mentioned Tim sort of the market trying to force the regional banks into a tighter regime in terms of how they\u2019re valuing the stocks, versus what we know to be, what tends to be a very slow regulatory process in terms of NPR comment period season, how do you balance that sort of market demand for higher capital? And TLAC eligible debt, greater cash liquidity versus the, the regulatory timeline? And what, that we don\u2019t know, nothing concrete today? Timothy Spence : I mean, I think the answer is you the way that you manage that proactively as you would have started doing something on each of those topics last year, right. So we were in the market, after every earnings call last year, four times. And as a result, have the lowest incremental need in the event that TLAC had no phase in period, right. As an example, you were deliberate about the way that you manage the ACL to reflect uncertainty in the forward outlook, and therefore you\u2019re carrying good coverage today, right, which we certainly feel we are. And you would have allowed yourself to a CRE capital during a period when the market was certainly more robust for regional banks, which I think, of course we did as well. I think lastly, what we\u2019re going to see here coming out of this, even if there is no change in regulation, as we all will flow, the empirical data from March Madness, through our models, and it\u2019s going to dictate a very different value for non-operational money and operational money, right. And the by-product of that is the banks that have good core retail deposit franchises, and who have good commercial operational commercial franchises. So linked to payment activity, treasury management services, and otherwise, that that is going to be the place that you want to be because while we think the Fed obviously at some point, rates are going to stay higher than zero on an absolute basis, and our ability to make money on both sides of the balance sheet is going to be a big driver who does well if there is more capital requirements or liquidity requirements are higher. Thank you. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed. Michael Mayo : Hi. So you think you expect deposits to be stable or increased from here but for NII to go down in the second quarter. Did I get that correctly? So the driver on NII is really twofold. One is the DDA mix, into interest bearing. And then the second element of the guide is that the movement up in rates in March to have a full quarter effect of that rate increase will bleed through into the second quarter and then that\u2019ll be offset by some benefits from day count as well as some of the consumer loan growth. And how are you or are you becoming more cautious, firm wide and why? So you trend your loan growth guidance down by 1% and in terms of maybe expenses, are you ratcheting that back? Are you preparing for tougher times? Or are you preserving the infrastructure for the potential for growth? That maybe others don\u2019t expect? Timothy Spence : Yes. So I mean us, Mike, we like to try to toe the line. We\u2019re an and company more than we are and more companies. There\u2019s no question that I think we all feel more cautious about the prospect for loan growth. Part of that is the Feds been abundantly clear, they\u2019re going to tamp down demand, right, no matter what it takes that but I note that the 1% decline for us comes on top of what I think was already the lowest full year loan growth guidance. So we have been pretty cautious as it related to loan growth. And in terms of expenses, I think you noted the actions we took during the quarter; we continue to be surgical about pruning the branch network, which creates the capacity to invest in the southeast. We had little more than 12 million bucks and severance that rolled through attached to expense actions that were designed to take capacity out of businesses that we just don\u2019t believe are going to need it, given the outlook. And I think the discipline that we have had, which is we believe in self-funding investments, because it drives good discipline around capital allocation, and effort is going to be the same here. So we do not intend to pause, the strategic investments we\u2019re making in the southeast or the investments we\u2019re making in the technology platform, those are going to be too valuable for the franchise in the long-term. But we are not going to be spending money on a discretionary basis that we don\u2019t think, is going to generate a near term return, outside of our strategic investments. Michael Mayo : And then last one was interesting, as you talked about, you said, you could go ahead and recognize your security losses and AFS. It\u2019d be manageable. And I guess you could sell those or do all sorts of things with that. So you have the capacity. I guess, how much more in TLAC would you need? You said you\u2019ve been in the market for the last four quarters. And if you had to go ahead and do that and be the only bank that did that, would that set you apart? Would that just be uneconomic? James Leonard : Yes, just to clarify on the AFS, my comment was about the AOCI, should it be a capital requirement that we would have significant improvement based on the implied forward curve through the end of 2024 about 45% of that would roll down the curve, given the bullet structure of the portfolio, not necessarily selling at all. So we do like the portfolio. But in terms of the TLAC challenge. At the end of the year, our gap to the 6%, RWA bank level would be about $4 billion. So for a bank our size that is certainly manageable, and then the question then becomes, what would the regulations change with what you would do with the proceeds. So right now, we\u2019re sitting on $10 billion of excess cash, which is, frankly, the biggest driver of the NIM erosion as we look forward on a full year basis, because that 10 billion of excess cash costs about 16 basis points of NIM. And so if we were to issue 4 billion more in debt, obviously, we would prefer to lend it to customers. But if the liquidity rules tighten, and we have to hold a higher Reg YY liquidity buffer, then we will be forced than any of their just holding an in cash or buying more level ones. And so it starts to become a challenge with the distribution of the proceeds. When you say what, what it sets you apart, and what your earnings profile improve, I think it would just be a gross up on the balance sheet and, and really not productive. And so that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t done it. Michael Mayo : That\u2019s clear. Lastly, $4 billion gap for TLAC, how much have you issued or obviously have? James Leonard : We haven't issued any this year, but total long term debt is $13 billion right now. Bryan Preston : Yes, Mike this is Bryan. That\u2019s about 6.6% of assets, pre-COVID, we were at 9% of total assets. And that gap is about $5 billion. So we\u2019re just getting back to levels where we were before COVID. So that TLAC requirement is just not a big deal for us relative to our historic balance sheet structure. Michael Mayo : Right. All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Please proceed. John Pancari : Good morning. James Leonard : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Just a question on the securities book, I appreciate the detail you gave on 525 on the commercial mortgage backed securities, I know there are 52% of your securities book. Can you maybe give us an update there? Are you seeing any stress there in terms of the performance of those securities amid the commercial real estate stress? And then, what type of stress and would be needed to pose risks to valuations or other than temporary impairment in that portfolio? Thanks. Bryan Preston : Absolutely. It\u2019s Bryan again, so you need to break the CMBS portfolio into two components, the agency portfolio, which is effective it is Fannie, Freddie, and Ginnie guaranteed, so that portfolio looks just like RMBS that many people are invested in. So from a credit perspective, no issues on $29 billion of that portfolio, as its GSE guaranteed. The non-agency portfolio, which is only $5 billion, it is all super senior AAA rated. And we perform very significant analysis from a stress perspective, and from an underwriting perspective, every time that we buy and, and as well as when we monitor the portfolio. To give you some color on our recent stress tests that we\u2019ve performed. We assume a 50% decrease in property values across all the underlying properties within the structures. And even in that scenario, we would record we would realize no losses on that portfolio and still have 23% heart enhancement. The Office loans within that portfolio are about 30% of the underlying loans. If we assume that from a weighted average perspective that does office loans, that the underlying properties would experience a 90% decrease, that\u2019s when we would get to our first dollar of credit loss on that portfolio. So we feel very confident and there would be significant loan losses across the entire industry before we\u2019d even recognize our first dollar loss on this on the structure associated in this portfolio. John Pancari : Got it? Thank you, it\u2019s very helpful. And then separately. I was just wondering if you can update us on the status of your core systems conversion, the March Madness at all impact the progression of the conversion of the timing of the expected conversion? And then lastly, can you maybe help us with the sizing up of the cost of the conversion and how much is expected to be capitalized? James Leonard : Yes, John it\u2019s Jamie. Thanks for the question. As you saw in the expense numbers, this quarter, we did have continued ramp up in technology cost that ultimately is a good thing, because it means we\u2019re getting things accomplished. And we continue to track on all of our deadlines for this year. We have new ledger going in in the third quarter, followed by CD platform as well as continued rollout of the nCino platform across the commercial business. And then we\u2019re really at this point about halfway through the game, because 2024, 2025 has additional deadlines associated with it on ATM and TM billing as well as the core checking conversion, but so far, so good. We do capitalize and follow the appropriate accounting standards on the total spend here. I think the spend over a multiyear period could reach as much as $100 million, of which a little less than half would be capitalized. And from there, I think you just continue to see us invest in cloud core technology. And that\u2019s part of what\u2019s driving that expense growth. You\u2019re seeing both in the first quarter and for the year. John Pancari : Got it. Thank you, Jamie very helpful. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Manan Gosalia : Hey, good morning. I was wondering if you could give us some more color on why you expect deposits to grow as we get into the remainder of the year, what are you seeing in your underlying account openings and conversations with clients that gives you the confidence in that outcome? I guess my question is, why shouldn\u2019t some of these new deposits just go back to the banks, where they have longer relationships? So once the volatility in the in the system settles down. Timothy Spence : Yes good question. So I don\u2019t think we took a lot of deposit share from banks that were non-operational in nature. The new accounts that we opened Manan were linked to treasury management sales and inclusive of our embedded banking business. And we\u2019re had been on the sales pipeline, in some cases for as long as 18 months, and there had been technology work that ended up getting accelerated. In a handful of other places like we do a very good business with payroll processors. We were a net beneficiary of folks who needed the payments infrastructure that Fifth Third provides, and those relationships which were not on the sales pipeline previously moved. And because they\u2019re embedded in the day to day operations of the business, they tend to be very sticky. And I mean, look that you kind of have to go back to first principles for us on the deposits to say why do we believe that we can continue to be stable or to generate a little bit of growth. So big part of the growth that we\u2019re generating on the retail side is coming out of that sort of sustained primary household growth that we\u2019ve been able to generate. We\u2019ve run in the 2% to 3% range for several years now. We\u2019ve breached 3% in the first quarter. We were running faster than that. And that is led by the southeast markets where I think the year-over-year growth rate was like 7.3%. So very significant there. In addition to that, the branches we\u2019ve added in the southeast are driving really, really strong growth. So if you look at the southeast, overall, same store sales and deposits were a plus 5% year-over-year for the quarter, if you include the de novo the markets like North and South Carolina, Georgia and Florida in totality grew 10% year-over-year, and if you just annualized the first quarter, over the fourth quarter, they grew 20% in terms of deposits, so really strong production come in from those investments. And then I think we\u2019ve talked a lot about the treasury management business, but that on the commercial side of the equation continues to be the thing. That is the driver, we have a disclosure in one of the slides here on the percentage of commercial relationships that are linked to Treasury Management, it\u2019s about 88%. If memory serves, maybe slide nine. And then the length of a that balance weighted average relationship tenure and commercial is 24 years. So we\u2019re not talking about people who were parking money here, because we were a ratepayer, I think we have only about a half a billion dollars in total in all deposits in the bank that are priced ahead of Fed funds. And it\u2019s reasonable to assume that whether it\u2019s because the Fed raises or because we take other actions that that number is going to be zero by the end of June. So we just have a very stable deposit base, the growth is coming from investments that are multiyear in nature, and that are proven in terms of their ability to support the company and very little deposit gathering activity that would have been on economic relative to alternative funding sources, less than a half a billion dollars, I believe in total. Manan Gosalia : Got it, very helpful. And then maybe as a follow up, and maybe the response to this is the same. But as I look at the deposit beta assumptions on slide 11, they look pretty conservative relative to the rest of the street. But if I look at the slope of their line, it is flattening as we look into the forecast period. So why shouldn\u2019t we expect the same rate of change that we\u2019ve seen there more recently? Timothy Spence : Yes, our base view, as I said in our prepared remarks are the midpoint of our guide is a 47% beta. And that is really driven by our assumption that the battle for retail deposits continues to be very competitive, and that that retail beta actually doubles over the course of the year. If that were to not happen, then we would be at the at the low end. So on the commercial and wealth and asset management side, the betas have been running, 65% to 70%. And those betas will flatten out as the Fed stops hiking. So part of what\u2019s assumed in the slide is that the Fed gets to 525 and stops and so that would have a flattening effect. And the reality here is that there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty as to how competition is going to behave over the next several quarters. And you can see on the slide thus far, we\u2019ve done well versus the industry from a deposit beta standpoint, but we definitely want to defend our book as well as continue to have strong new customer acquisition. Manan Gosalia : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please proceed. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. Timothy Spence : Morning, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Just two quick follow ups, one on credit. I think, Jamie, you mentioned about 80% base case, unemployment 4%. Give us a sense of just sensitivity if that 4% were to be 5%, what does that mean for your allowance or the consumer allowance? James Leonard : Yes, the ACL would go up 250 million for every 1% assuming all other assumptions stay, as is. Ebrahim Poonawala : Okay, helpful. And other quick follow up on going back to Tim, your comments around capital. And Matt, given just the uncertainty around regulations, Mac, macro economy, the nine and a quarter CT1 like, do you? Should we anticipate that drifts higher at least for the next few quarters until there\u2019s more visibility? Or do you expect to be more proactive and return back to sort of buybacks in the back half of the year? Timothy Spence : Yes, I think just given the guidance that we provided, if you assume no buybacks in the second quarter, which is right, it would imply we get to nine five by June 30. Ebrahim, I, Jamie and I both feel confident we could run the business at nine and a quarter, it just feels prudent at this point in time to make sure that the environment does fully settle out before we resume repurchases. Ebrahim Poonawala : And just on the environment. I think last quarter, we talked about things worsening maybe back half of this year into 24. Do you have any better visibility in terms of just the shape of the credit cycle, how deep it could be? And just when we begin to actually see the first sort of deterioration, show up in the numbers on credit metrics. Timothy Spence : We continue to think the back half of this year it is the beginning of next is probably the right period. I think we have been operating under the belief that some of the rosier data that came out in the winter was a little bit of a head fake because you had unseasonably good weather and the by-product of that was you had spending in a variety of under other indicators, Flash more positive than I think people had anticipated. And in part, that\u2019s why you saw the Fed, ramp up rhetoric. Again, the IFM indices are, from my point of view, the best thing to watch here, they certainly are in our footprint, and they all are signaling a slowdown. And the Fed is not going to be able to relent and get inflation under control just based on what we hear from clients without sticking at, a five plus level for some extended period of time. And when that happens, that\u2019s very restrictive, right things are going to break. My own view is that this is light, we\u2019re likely to return to a period where there\u2019s more regional divergence than you\u2019ve seen. And the most recent two cycles. I\u2019m I am very happy to be Midwest and southeast Bank is a moment like the data that\u2019s come out of the Census Bureau on spending on factories, right, we had 108 billion in spending on factories last year, which was an all-time record that Financial Times did nice work on commitments that have been made, there\u2019s more than 200 billion in capital commitments. This is all stuff that\u2019s tied to the $2 trillion that the government intends to invest and rebuilding supply chains here in the U.S. And if you just look at the manufacturing jobs that were added last year, like there were 348,000 manufacturing jobs added in the U.S., compared to I think 6000 in 2010, as an example and 60% of those were in our footprint. So the markets that are going to benefit from the government\u2019s investment in infrastructure and domestic supply chain. And that sort of broader trend and reshoring are going to do better than markets that were more reliant on technology and professional services or that have more profound challenges as it relates to state budget deficits, or challenged city centers, there just is going to be a divergence that materializes there. So I at least think you should be more focused on regional economic data than on the economy overall, as you think about where losses may materialize. Ebrahim Poonawala : That\u2019s great color. Thanks. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Christopher Marinec from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed. Christopher Marinec : Thanks for taking my question. Tim, just want to ask about dividend finance kind of skewing the loan growth this year maybe in a positive way to where the loan growth ex dividend is very conservative. Is that a fair way of thinking it through? Timothy Spence : Yes. Yes, the two areas of the portfolio where there is any material loan growth this year Chris are the dividend finance portfolio as we see the benefit of the balances rolling on because we are portfolio in their production. They were originated to sell before we bought them. And then in C&I which is really good core steady production in the middle market where I have been a part because of the dynamics around manufacturing, you\u2019re seeing really solid production out of our legacy markets in the Midwest and the continued growth and provide right which is of course linked to healthcare and primarily, non-elective dental invent. Christopher Marinec : Got it. And the rest is rolling off and not\u2026 Timothy Spence : It\u2019s kind of receivable or in modest decline. Christopher Marinec : Got it? Very well. Thank you, Tim. I appreciate it. Operator : I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Doll for closing remarks. Chris Doll : Thanks, Molly. And thanks everyone for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the IR department if you have any follow up questions. Molly, you can now disconnect the call. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Chris Doll, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Chris Doll : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fifth Third Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard, will provide an overview of our second quarter results and outlook. Our Treasurer, Bryan Preston and Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, have also joined the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures, reconciliations to the GAAP results and forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of July 20, 2023, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim. Timothy Spence : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the quarter, I'd like to welcome our new Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck to the call. Greg has been a part of Fifth Third for 35 years, and during that time, you see more than a few credit cycles. He previously held leadership roles in both credit risk and the line of business, including serving as our Chief Commercial Credit Officer for several years and is our Head of Leasing, asset-based lending and structured finance. We're fortunate to have him as part of the Fifth Third executive team. Despite heightened market volatility over the past four months, Fifth Third has delivered consistent top quartile financial results while investing strategically to position the bank for the long term. Our operating priorities have been and continue to be stability, profitability and growth in that order. Earlier today, we reported second quarter earnings per share of $0.87, excluding items noted in the release, a 10% increase compared to the year ago quarter. Adjusted revenue increased 9%, reflecting our diverse fee sources and resilient balance sheet. Expenses increased 4%, excluding items noted in the release. And credit quality was strong with net charge-offs and early stage delinquencies remaining below normalized levels. Our key return metrics improved even as we increased our capital levels and credit reserves. We generated an adjusted return on assets of over 1.2% and adjusted return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, of 15.4% and an efficiency ratio below 55% for the quarter. These will be important bellwether metrics for all banks as we adapt to impending regulatory changes. Deposits continue to be in focus for the entire sector in the second quarter. Fifth Third's total period-end deposits increased 1% sequentially and increased 2% year-over-year as compared to a 5% decline for the HA [ph] over the same period. Our commercial banking and commercial banking business segments both generated period-end deposit growth. Given the year-over-year decline in deposit system-wide, it's reasonable to ask how Fifth Third has continued to outperform. The answers are deliberate multiyear strategies to expand distribution in our Southeast markets to launch innovative operational deposit-oriented solutions like momentum banking and our treasury management offerings and our sustained focus on primary household growth. We have added over 70 de novo branches in our Southeast footprint since 2019, more than any other bank except JPMorgan. As a portfolio, these branches are outperforming their original business cases on deposit production with several producing at a rate of 200% to 300% of plan. In consumer, we generated year-over-year net household growth of 3% once again this quarter, continuing a strong multiyear trend and punctuated by 7% year-on-year growth in the Southeast and continued success in our Momentum banking product. In commercial, we have added a record number of new quality middle-market relationships this year, up 30% from 2022. Our embedded payments business, Newline, has also been a strong catalyst for deposit growth. We expect the environment in the back half of the year to remain highly competitive for deposits. While we will continue to protect our house relationships and manage to a strong and stable liquidity profile, we will not match a rational pricing competition in a way that prioritizes headline growth over profitability. Turning to pending regulation. We are taking steps to adapt our balance sheet in anticipation of higher capital and liquidity requirements across the industry. We finished the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 9.5% having accreted around 90 basis points of capital from retained earnings over the course of the past year. We are balancing three capital priorities, continuing to build capital on an accelerated pace, supporting a dividend increase in the third quarter subject to Board approval and supporting clients to drive organic growth. We will continue to pause share repurchases until the final capital rules are published and new capital targets are established. We are also taking several actions to boost on balance sheet liquidity and optimize returns. -- in reducing our indirect auto lending origination volumes by approximately 15% through the exit of noncore states, trimming outsized lines and closely evaluating select areas of our corporate banking business. While we acknowledge the market's more optimistic outlook, we remain vigilant on the potential for a recession in 2024. Our commercial clients continue to perform well, but they are being cautious by slowing their growth plans. Many are closely watching the impact that regulation may have on credit availability and pricing. Consumers have held up well in aggregate, but there has been a divergence between homeowners who were able to lock in historically low mortgage rates and renters who have had to face persistent inflation in their largest monthly expense. Compared to three years ago, homeowners in our deposit base have maintained strong deposit balances, whereas renters deposit balances are down meaningfully. I want to thank our nearly 20,000 employees for their unwavering commitment to serving clients in our communities. Last year, you volunteered more than 117,000 hours to community organizations and you provided leadership to roughly 1,200 not-for-profit boards. Due to your hard work, we have already delivered nearly $30 billion of our 10-year $100 billion commitment to provide affordable housing, access to essential services and renewable energy. In June, we celebrated Fifth Third's 165th anniversary. Given the current pace of technological and regulatory change and the logical questions about market structure and competitive model to follow. It was an interesting time to reflect on our history and what it could tell us about this moment. Since Fifth Third's founding in 1858, the company has withstood a civil war, two World Wars, two global health pandemic and 33 recessions. The company adapted its business model to take advantage of technological innovations including the telephone, electric white bulbs, the automobile and the Internet. We were an early adopter of the wire and ACH Windows, anchored the rollout of the credit card networks in the Midwest, invented the network ATM and were one of the 15 initial launch bankers. We witnessed the creation of the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC and have continued to thrive through many different regulatory regimes. I believe that companies that stand the test of time, develop a character of their own that extends beyond the people who work there. Fifth Third's character is rooted in hard work, ingenuity and insistence on excellence and the sense of responsibility for the communities we serve. I'm as confident as in Fifth Third's positioning, our ability to outperform through the cycle and to deliver innovations that improve lives for all our stakeholders. And frankly, I'm just thankful to be part of [indiscernible] steward the bank into the future. With that, I'll now hand it over to Jamie to provide more details on our financial results and outlook. James Leonard : Thank you, Tim, and thank all of you for joining us today. Our second quarter results were once again strong despite the market headwinds. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of just below 55%, which is a 4-point improvement compared to the prior quarter. Our second quarter adjusted PPNR grew more than 8% compared to both the prior quarter and year ago quarter, driven by the continued diversification and growth of our fee revenue streams combined with disciplined expense management throughout the bank. . Net interest income primate $1.46 billion increased 9% year-over-year, did decline 4% sequentially. Our sequential NII performance was the result of our deliberate actions to grow on balance sheet liquidity to support a defensive balance sheet position, given the uncertain macroeconomic outlook and tightening liquidity conditions. Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 54 basis points to 2.3%, which represents a cycle-to-date beta of 45% on interest-bearing deposits, which includes the impact of CDs. Adjusted noninterest income increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter, with increases in mortgage fee income and commercial banking revenue partially offset by a decline in deposit service charges due to the impact of earnings credits from higher market rates and the elimination of our consumer NSF fees in July of last year. Adjusted noninterest expense increased 10% compared to the year ago quarter as elevated compensation and benefits expense was driven by nonqualified deferred compensation costs, the minimum wage increase that went into effect in July of 2022 and continued investment in dividend finance. Additionally, expenses increased from higher technology and communications expense and the impact of the increased FDIC assessment that began in January. Excluding the impacts of nonqualified deferred compensation, which are offset by a gross up in securities gains, the FDIC assessment increase and incremental expense growth from dividend finance, Total underlying expenses increased approximately 4% compared to the year ago quarter. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases were stable sequentially in both commercial and consumer portfolios due to our continued discipline with respect to client selection and optimizing returns and also reflecting softening demand. The period-end commercial revolver utilization rate of 35% decreased 2% compared to last quarter. C&I balances were flat compared to the prior quarter as strong middle market loan production and muted payoffs were offset by the lower revolver utilization. Corporate banking production was also tempered due to our focus on optimizing returns on capital in this environment and lower customer demand. Average total consumer portfolio loan and lease balances reflected growth from dividend finance, offset by declines in indirect auto and residential mortgage. Average total deposits were flat compared to the prior quarter as increases in CDs and interest checking balances were offset by a decline in demand deposits. By segment, consumer deposits increased 1% and commercial deposits decreased 1%, while wealth and asset management deposits declined 12%, reflecting the impact of tax payments as well as clients' alternative investment options. June activity reflected continued momentum such that period-end total deposits were up 1% compared to the prior quarter. Notably, we have grown deposits 2% since the end of last June compared to a 5% decline for the top 25 banks as shown in the Fed's H8 data. Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit trends were stable with our key credit metrics remaining below normalized levels. The net charge-off ratio of 29 basis points increased three basis points compared to the prior quarter. The NPA ratio of 54 basis points was up three basis points compared to the prior quarter. In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which represents 85% of our consumer portfolio. We have also maintained one of the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in nonprime consumer borrowers among our peers. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall CRE concentration as a percent of total loans relative to peers for many years. Within CRE, we have limited office exposure with a low and improving criticized asset ratio and almost no delinquencies. We continue to watch office closely and believe the overall impact on Fifth Third will be limited. We had deemphasized office even before the pandemic, and we are not currently pursuing new office CRE originations. From an overall credit management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on generating and maintaining high-quality relationships. As many of you know, we have been and remain cautious in our economic outlook. We tightened underwriting standards during COVID, including stressing credits to an up 200-basis-point scenario off the forward curve, which limited our growth but improved the stability of our balance sheet. Since we began tightening underwriting standards, roughly 90% of our commercial portfolio has been re-underwritten. Our criticized assets have been stable over the past several quarters. Across all loan categories, we continue to closely monitor exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress. Moving to the ACL. Our reserves increased $87 million, reflecting the impacts of dividend finance and Moody's macroeconomic forecast, which eroded slightly. The ACL ratio increased nine basis points sequentially. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. The base economic scenario from Moody's assumes the unemployment rate reaches 4.3%, while the downside scenario incorporates a peak unemployment rate of 7.8%. We maintained our scenario weightings of 80% to the base and 10% to each of the upside and downside scenarios. Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio increased 25 basis points sequentially, ending the quarter at over 9.5%. Our capital position reflects our ability to build capital quickly through our strong earnings generation. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 11% compared to the year ago quarter. We continue to expect a meaningful improvement in our unrealized loss position, assuming the forward curve plays out, resulting in approximately 36% of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of 2024 and approximately 50% by the end of 2025. Looking forward, we expect to build capital at an accelerated pace given our RWA optimization initiatives and by extending our share buyback pause. As Tim mentioned, we will postpone repurchases until we have more clarity on the regulatory environment in order to determine the new level of required capital dollars. Assuming we do not buy back shares through year-end, we would anticipate accreting capital such that our CET1 ratio ends this year at or above 10%. Moving to our current outlook; we expect full year average total loan growth between 1% and 2%, which reflects our cautious outlook on the economic environment and our decision to proactively adapt our balance sheet to the new regulatory regime. We expect total commercial loans to increase in the low single digits area compared to 2022, which implies a decline in the second half of the year relative to the first half. This outlook assumes the revolver utilization rate of 35% in the second quarter remained stable throughout the remainder of 2023. Our commercial loan outlook also assumes that we meaningfully reduced originations in certain areas of the commercial franchise, predominantly in the corporate bank to meet our higher risk-adjusted return thresholds, while continuing to increase the generation in our core middle market business, we expect total consumer loans to be stable to down slightly from reduced originations of the lower-yielding out-of-footprint auto and specialty lending channels, combined with portfolio residential mortgages, partially offset by growth from dividend finance. We currently expect to need approximately $4 billion in dividend loans for this year, which is a modest decrease from our previous expectations. We continue to expect to grow deposits in the back half of 2023, assuming stable or even slightly tighter market liquidity conditions Consistent with our track record over the past year of taking market share and maintaining high levels of core operating relationships in both consumer and commercial. Within that, we continue to expect migration from DDA into interest-bearing products throughout the remainder of 2023 with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits declining from 30% in the second quarter to 27% by year-end as we discussed last month. For the third quarter of 2023, we expect average total loan balances to decline 1% to 2% sequentially with commercial down in the low single digits area and consumer stable to slightly down. We expect average deposits to be up 1% on a sequential basis, impacted by our strong finish to the second quarter, some seasonal uplift and the benefits of our multiyear investments in the franchise that Tim discussed earlier. Shifting to the income statement; we estimate full year NII will increase 3% to 5%, consistent with comments from the mid-June investor conference. Our AI guidance assumes a cumulative beta of 53% by the fourth quarter, assuming an additional 25 basis point rate hike in July and no further rate movements in 2023. Our outlook translates to total interest-bearing deposit costs increasing around 40 basis points in the third quarter and another 15 basis points or so in the fourth quarter. Our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances remained relatively stable between now and year-end. As a byproduct of strong deposit growth, combined with lower loan growth and stable securities balances, we expect to hold closer to $15 billion in cash and cash equivalents by year-end. We expect our loan-to-core deposit ratio to end the year in the mid-70s area. It will keep Fifth Third in a strong liquidity position in anticipation of more stringent regulatory environments. We expect third quarter NII to be down approximately 2% to 3% sequentially due to the continued impacts of the balance sheet dynamics I mentioned. We expect adjusted noninterest income to be stable in 2023, resulting from continued success, increasing market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities. with stronger gross treasury management, capital markets, wealth and asset management and mortgage servicing revenue to be offset by higher earnings credit rates on treasury management, subdued leasing remarketing revenue and a reduction in other fees due to lower TRA and private equity income this year. We expect our fourth quarter TRA revenue to decline from $46 million in 2022 to $22 million in 2023. We expect third quarter adjusted noninterest income to be down 3% to 4% compared to the second quarter. We expect to continue generating strong revenue across most fee captions, which we conservatively assume will be more than offset by a slight erosion in debt capital markets and mortgage revenue. reflecting the environmental headwinds as well as lower other noninterest income. We continue to expect full year adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4% to 5% compared to 2022. If capital markets fees improve relative to our current expectations, we will likely land at the upper end of the range. Our expense outlook incorporates the FDIC insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on January 1, the mark-to-market impact on nonqualified deferred compensation plans which was a reductant in 2022 expenses but an increase in 2023 and full year impact of investments to grow the dividend finance and provide businesses. Excluding the FDIC assessment and NQDC impacts, we would expect our full year 2023 core expenses to be up 3%. Our guidance reflects continued investment in our digital transformation, which should result in technology expense growth in the low double digits for the year. We also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid- to high single digits area. Our guidance also factors in the run rate benefits from the severance expense recognized in the first half of the year, which reflected proactive actions taken to reduce ongoing expenses given the operating environment. We expect third quarter adjusted noninterest expenses to decrease 1% to 2% compared to the second quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue growth of 3% to 4%. This would result in an efficiency ratio of around 56% for the full year. We expect full year total net charge-offs to continue to be in our previously stated 25 basis point to 35 basis point range. However, as you would expect, with normalizing credit costs in this environment from record low levels, there may be a little lumpiness in C&I in the second half such that total Bancorp's third quarter losses are expected to be 35 to 45 basis points and then fourth quarter losses improving relative to the third quarter. Given our reduced loan growth outlook, we expect a lower quarterly build to the ACL in the $25 million to $75 million range, assuming no significant changes in the underlying Moody's economic scenarios. This considers strong production from dividend finance of around $750 million in the third quarter, which, as you know, carries a higher reserve level. In summary, with our proactive balance sheet management, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to continue generating long-term sustainable value for our customers, communities, employees and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A. . Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : The first question I wanted to ask is -- and I think if I've done the math correctly, the fourth quarter NII could kind of level out, even at the low end of the range, it could kind of level out or at least really slow the rate of decline. And I guess, in your view, what would allow NII to find a bottom at that point? I guess, I asked specifically in the context of you all having been bought the most conservative out there on your funding cost outlook for the second half of the year. James Leonard : Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. It really comes down to the rate environment with the Fed in our forecast, the assumption being that the Fed reaches 5.5%, and holds. And therefore, by the end of the fourth quarter, we've gotten through all of the repricing lag that would occur. So that right now, the third quarter guide is down 2% to 3% and then the full year guide implies a little bit of a step down from third quarter into fourth quarter, and then we'll see what 2024 holds when we get there. Implicit in the guide is an increase in our deposit costs so that the terminal beta is 53%. And I guess, coming out of listening to some of the other earned calls, the one comment we would have is that our June, like everyone else's was quite strong and could -- and I think to the point in your head could result in better NII outcomes than what it reflects. But from our standpoint, spotting one robin doesn't make it spring. And therefore, we're going to continue to be cautious in the outlook and play defense in this environment. We've got a long way to go from the liquidity conditions tightening with at $80 billion a month, $1.5 trillion or more of trade issuance, the student loan repayments kicking back in, and then the competitive dynamics that we're seeing across the footprint. So we're going to play a good defense, and we think defense wins championships in this environment. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay. And then I think I take tack one that you might have addressed towards the end of your prepared comments. But as it relates to the reserving needs, which look less in the second half in aggregate than in the first half is. No change to the reserving needs for dividend, right? I think you mentioned that's just due to the anticipated commercial growth. James Leonard : Correct in that the dividend reserve coverage ratio, we're assuming, remains in that 9% area. The reduction in the guide for the ACL build is driven by all of the loan production changes that we are forecasting with the RWA diet and reducing the balance sheet for the new capital regimes that will be forthcoming. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Erika Najarian : My first question is for Jamie. According to your first quarter Q, we're down 100 basis points parallel, I believe, your NII would be up 44 basis points over a full year. A lot of investors are now thinking about the potential for a Fed rate cut in 1Q '24. So I'm wondering, as we think about that 4Q '23 exit rate in all else equal, do you expect relative stability in NII if in the scenario as the Fed cuts? And how does that play out in terms of deposit costs? In other words, is just -- is there an absolute level where deposit costs don't move that much. Do deposit costs continue to increase even in the first few cuts? You are the most trusted CFOs out there. So it would be interesting to hear your perspective on all of that. James Leonard : Now you've just given the publicity then I'm going to have to live up giving you a 2024 NII guide. There's no question that Bryan and I have positioned the balance sheet to be currently neutral to benefiting for the rate cuts when the rate cuts ultimately occur. The down rate scenarios continue to be the most difficult for a bank earnings profile to manage as credit costs would ramp up and recession kicks in. So for us, I believe that the deposit cost pressures will mitigate as the Fed begins a cutting cycle. We just don't see that happening this year, which is why the guide on NII is what it is that we continue to expect a competitive environment. But should the Fed move to the cuts, we really like how the balance sheet is positioned for that environment. Our guide the exit run rate on fourth quarter NII, if you took our guide and multiplied it by 4, it's about where consensus is for 2024. So I don't think there's necessarily a gap at this point in time, but 2024 is a very long way from July 20. Erika Najarian : Understood. And my second question maybe is for Tim. It took a lot of years of hard work, but Fifth Third has put itself in a position where you're pretty down the middle in terms of the results you're not talking about taking expenses down next year. You're not talking about RWA mitigation. And while I'm sure there's something on LCR and long-term debt as those requirements come in that you're working on, the business seemed to be something that would change strategy. The question really here is as you think is Fifth Third is positioned, and there seems to be now appreciable differences on how peers are positioned for this sort of new world order. How are you going to take advantage of it from a market share perspective? . Timothy Spence : Yes. That's a good question, Erika, and I appreciate it. I will say, I think all of the things that you described, the RWA diet, a continuous focus on expenses, thinking about liquidity profile and in particular, the value of different sorts of deposits in the new world are all things we're doing here today. But we have the benefit of having made multiyear investments in either asset classes or in particular, on the operational deposit side of the equation that are benefiting us in this environment, and they're going to continue to be very valuable going forward. I think narrowly, the hardest thing on an organization, if you're trying to deliver predictable long-term results is to have to move into a binge purge mode, right? And whether that is outsized growth followed by shrinking or letting expenses run up, followed by deep cuts later it creates -- the two things happen. One, the first thing that people cut tends to be the last thing that came in the door. And the byproduct of that is your cuts end up being concentrated in the areas you are investing for future growth, one. Two, your people actually become more reticent to stretch and to try to give better outcomes because they don't want to get outsized and have to work backwards. So I think what -- the advantage we're going to have next year and the year after that and the year forward is our ability to be consistent about investing in the franchise. And that will mean that we stay on the pace that we've been on the last several years in building branches. It will mean that we continue to add to the middle market teams because I think the economics of these middle market banking relationships are going to continue to be excellent regardless of what happens to capital and liquidity. And we're going to continue to focus on having the best retail deposit franchise and best treasury management franchise in our peer group. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Panc from Evercore. John Panc : On the -- back to the loss reserve, just to clarify, the $25 million to $75 million build in -- per quarter in the back half for dividends and is that again, is for growth expected in dividend stance, but it's no change in the reserve ratio that you're assigning to that business? James Leonard : Yes. And let me clarify one thing from what you said that just to make sure we're on the same page. Our guide for the ACL is for the total Bancorp balance sheet. However, the primary driver of that ACL build is dividend. Dividend, we expect to do $750 million a quarter of production, that reserve rate ballpark it in the 9% range. But the rest of the balance sheet, as we discussed in the guide is actually going -- from a loan standpoint is actually going to be down a bit. And so the net of those growing dividend, shrinking other parts of the balance sheet, inclusive of auto where we exited the states west of the Mississippi, but for Texas, combined with our efforts in shrinking the corporate banking book will result in a lower ACL build than what we've been running at this year because those other businesses will essentially be reducing the ACL coverage due to lower volumes, whereas dividend call it, in that same area, but the net effect is, let's call it, a build of $25 million to $75 million a quarter going forward. John Panc : Okay. No, that helps a lot. And then separately, on the credit front, can you just talk a little bit about your C&I portfolio and how that's performing just as we've started to see some larger bankruptcies develop. But curious how the book is performing on the C&I side. And I know you mentioned that commercial book has been re-underwritten. How does that typically work with shared national credits? I know they're about 30% of your book. So how does the reunderwriting work for that portfolio? James Leonard : Yes. Let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Greg Schroeck to add a little bit more color. But in terms of -- as we discussed in the outlook, we continue to have a total Bancorp charge-off guide in the 25 to 35 basis point range. Within commercial over the past couple of years, it's obviously bounced around from 36 bps in 2020 down to 10 bps in '21 and 13 bps last year. And this year on commercial, we continue to be in that 20 to 30 basis point range. And then within total commercial, C&I is expected to be at the high end of that range given some of the lumpiness that we're seeing with a few credits that resulted in a little bit of that uptick in the NPA ratio at the end of the quarter. But with that, I'll turn it over to Greg for thoughts on C&I underwriting and other views. Greg Schroeck : Yes. I agree with Jamie. First of all, the portfolio monitoring really doesn't change, whether it's a SNC, middle C&I loan regardless. We have a robust portfolio management structure and discipline in place that keeps us out ahead of these emerging trends. We're really not seeing a significant trends in that C&I book. We're not seeing it certainly in the shared national credit book. So I still feel really good about the middle market. As Jamie said, we're going to have some lumpiness. You've probably seen our guidance into the third quarter from a charge-off perspective. the headline there, I think, is twofold. And we're starting from a very low base. And so because of that low base, one or two loans can move the needle, and that's exactly what happened, right? We've got two credits, one in the professional services industry and the other in the manufacturing that are going to move the needle in the third quarter. But overall, I feel really good about portfolio, and I would expect fourth quarter charge-offs to be back in line with what we saw in the first and second quarter. . Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : I just wanted to ask on the securities book. I know you guys do daily LCR calcs and you got still the two third portfolio in the locked out and bulleted as you contemplate what the LCR requirements might look like, and I know we're going to learn that ton, do you think are you comfortable with the structure of the portfolio and meeting any push down requirements to category 4? James Leonard : Yes, Ken, great question. And embedded in all of our comments and outlook today, we should have outlined the strategy that our approach here for our company is that we fully expect TLAC to get pushed down. We expect the more draconian capital rules on ops risk to get pushed down, but not any of the benefits from the credit rating risk weighting, and we expect to have to be compliant with the full LCR. So that is the underpinning of all of our strategies for managing the balance sheet, and we want to do that expeditiously. And therefore, we are going to be holding higher levels of cash. We will be rotating more into Level 1 securities. But we love the bullet locked-out structure because that provides the shock absorber to potential low rate environment. And so the flip side to all of this will be the AOCI impacts with the capital rules. And so we'll wait to see what those final rules look like, but it sounds like, obviously, AFS inclusion, HTM exclusion. And so we may have to pivot a bit on the HTM classifications given that we've not done anything to date. But that might be an outcome from the brave new world that will have to adapt to. Ken Usdin : Right. And I guess in the near term, with rates high, the move to cash is actually helpful, right, because you're now earning five and change versus the average yield of the book, which seems like it's kind of just held in. So it's fair to say that, that's kind of what we expect to see as the securities book for now just continues to shrink back down. And as to your point, we just see that cash build continue. James Leonard : Yes. What we did in the second quarter was we let the portfolio cash flows of $600 million roll off and not get reinvested. So essentially, to your point, bolster cash. For the rest of the year, we're assuming stable, give or take, $1 billion. We may let it run down, we may rotate into treasuries just depending on the day and the opportunities. But what you should expect from us is continued rotation into Level 1, whether cash or treasuries. Ken Usdin : Okay. And if I can ask one quick one. In terms of your deposit growth outlook and the higher beta assumptions, I know you talked about 3% year-over-year household growth. I guess, can you parse out deposit growth just coming from the franchise as opposed to pricing up to get it? . James Leonard : Yes. It's just that there is a several factors impacting that. So in terms of consumer on the household side, we do have a very strong and consistent growth of 3%, but offsetting that tailwind is the headwind from consumer spending and the declines in the average deposit balance. So when you look at the consumer, the average deposit is still 20% higher than pre-COVID levels, but it is down 10% from the COVID average balance peaks. And so we're modeling that, that erosion does continue and therefore, it creates a little bit of a headwind. So for us, the majority of the growth is obviously coming from the Southeast de novo market and they're growing at a 7% rate. But the Midwest, whether it's same-store sales or the total Midwest networks growing households at 2%. So we like what we've been able to do, and I would say it's more about core new customer acquisition than anything else. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess just first question around reserves and less to do with the mechanical finance and what you -- the ACL. But when we think about the 80% base case, Jamie, that you mentioned, I think if I heard you correctly, you said that had an unemployment rate of 4.3%. I guess, philosophically, I guess, Tim, like in the past, you've talked about 2024 could be worse in terms of debt maybe we do get a delayed recession. So just give us a mark-to-market around your operating outlook over the next, I guess, 12 to 24 months. Are you expecting a recession? And if that's the case, shouldn't you be weighted a lot more to the downside than just the 80-10-10 split that you have? . Timothy Spence : Yes. So let me answer the question about the outlook, Ebrahim and then I think we'll go to Jamie to talk about the dynamics around the specific ACL. So look, I think our outlook is that it's hard to know. Like I watch -- we watch the same equity market indicators that you do. We see the trends on unemployment. We see that signal around inflation moderating. And I hear a lot from folks about the increased probability for a soft landing. We just don't get paid to manage to a Goldilocks scenario outcome here, right? Because for every positive indicator, you still have like a yield curve that's more inverted than it has been in decades. You have data coming out of the red book that suggests that same-store sales in retail across the US has been negative since the beginning of the year, the consumer spending on a real basis, so take the impact of inflation out, like flat or down in five of the last seven periods you have a negative ISM in terms of what we're seeing their freight levels, whether it's exports and imports or the over-the-road stuff here in the U.S. continuing to be depressed, like those are not positive signs. And if you buy the thesis that the -- what we're experiencing today is the interest rate environment we had 12 months ago, that we're seeing all of that in a world where Fed funds was 150, 175, right? So at least from our point of view, while it's very possible that we end up with a soft landing here. And I think even if we end up with a mild recession that it is not one that's characterized by unemployment levels, that we still are going to end up in a recessionary environment. The last thing I just want to make sure that I flag because I think sometimes words matter is, we talk about an RWA diet where other people talk about balance sheet optimization. What we're really saying is tightening credit supply and higher risk spreads, right? And those things have an impact on M2 that compounds whatever gets done on M1, that are the other factor that's sort of lingering out there that I think that we need to take into account as we're looking at the outcomes. So that's probably a long way of saying, I don't know any more than you do in terms of where we settle, but we're going to always plan around a more conservative outcome because if we're wrong, everybody does well. And if we're right, we're better positioned to deliver stable earnings for you. James Leonard : And in terms of scenario weightings, we anchored to the 80-10-10 distribution because that is the probability assignment by Moody's for each of those scenarios occurring. So that as you saw in this quarter, the scenarios eroded, unemployment ticked up about 30 basis points or so on a peak basis in their baseline scenario. And as Tim mentioned, it's certainly possible that we have a full employment soft recession. But we believe that obviously, the reserve is adequate and at 208 basis points of coverage, we feel good how we're positioned. Ebrahim Poonawala : Understood. Just as a follow-up to that, I guess spreads widening, tightening credit is one thing. Are you also seeing demand fall off? Like as you look through your commercial customer base, both in West and Southeast, we've heard from some other banks where things have really cooled off in the last month or 2. Are you actually seeing that from your customers where they are pulling back around investment spend and activity? Timothy Spence : Yes. We are seeing some softening in demand. There's no question about that. I think in general, part of its conservatism on the part of the clients. I think and the lack of visibility that they have into what the economy is going to look like 18 months from now. I think the other dynamic that we hear from clients is they are saying they're a little bit nervous about credit availability. So there's an interaction effect here that you have to take into account. But I was on the phone with two large clients, one in the medical field, one in the real estate field, in the past 1.5 weeks. And in both cases, they had gone out and surveyed their bank groups, and there were a lot of, hey, we've allocated all the capital we have available to invest in the second half of the year sort of responses that they were hearing back and/or real constraints on the way that they have to spread ancillaries. So I think there is a dynamic that will materialize here where demand will be lower for credit because the cost of credit will be higher. And that's the interaction effect that I think as we roll forward here, we're going to continue to see in addition to just general caution. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Mayo from Wells Fargo. Michael Mayo : I'm not sure if Jamie was quoting Aristotle earlier. One Robin does not make a spring. But we'll stick to the Aristotle quotes. So excellence is never an accident. So in terms of operating leverage or positive operating leverage, I mean, you did guide revenues lower by 350 basis points, taking the midpoint, and you didn't change expenses, and that's consistent with the industry. It looks like you could still have a shot at positive leverage, but doesn't look that way a whole lot or -- and for next year, and there's only so much you can do about higher rates and inverted curve. But do you think you have a shot for this year? How do you think about next year? Do you double up on your expense plans or do you preserve the infrastructure for potential additional growth? Timothy Spence : Yes. Mike, it's Tim. I'm going to take that one. I mean we are working on expenses. The severance item that we called out as part of an exercise that we ran, just to try to rightsize the resource base here for demand, given the outlook in the environment. And as you know, the primary outcome of all of this investment we're making in the core platforms is to bring more automation and straight-through processing to the business, which we think is going to provide a lot of intermediate-term expense positive expense outcomes. I think what we're trying to do is to manage the expense base and the focus on positive operating leverage around sort of three-year increments. So if you look back over the course of the past three years, we have the lowest expense growth. It's something like half of what our peer group average is in terms of noninterest expense, annual compound annual growth. And we were growing revenue at a little more than 2x the rate we were growing expenses during that period. I think we have every intention to do exactly the same thing over the course of the next three years. What we want to make sure that we're doing though is that when we make an investment, we finish the play, we get the outcomes of the investment and we move on. And I try to correct at the midpoint, you run the risk of having started a lot of things. And then you don't get the excellence that you mentioned at the beginning. It's the bench bird cycle I referenced when I talked to Erika. Michael Mayo : And I'm sorry, the start of the 3-year period now is -- was when? Timothy Spence : The last three years, we will have grown expenses less than anybody else. The next three years, we intend to do the same thing. We intend to generate positive operating leverage over the next three years. The same way we have to last three years. Michael Mayo : Got it. And then let's just go back to that quote One Robin does not make a spring. You said June was better, but you're not extrapolating that. Your guidance may be conservative, may not be, but Jamie, what is it that you saw in June and why. James Leonard : Yes. there were two -- yes, two things, Mike, that happened in June that are certainly opportunities for the back half of the year to be better than what we're guiding to. But like most things, I'll give you another quote. The beauty is in of the beholder. So some folks look at the credit spread widening and the C&I coupon expansion that occurred in the market, and we experienced that as well in June. Spreads were up a bit. We're not guiding to continued spread expansion in the back half of the year in C&I. And then on deposits, June was a very good month for the industry, whether you watched the H8 or you've heard from all the banks that have been reporting, and you see it in our numbers. We're up 2% on deposits year-over-year. We're up 1% on an EOP basis sequentially. We had a very nice June from a deposit gathering, a new customer acquisition perspective. So what we're seeing from here is we actually are forecasting on an average basis, some deposit growth in the third quarter. But frankly, if you look at the guide on an average basis, it's about one point lower than our balances. So maybe we do better, maybe not, maybe it gives us a little bit of pricing power to do better on the beta. But with all that being said, we just still are cautious about the liquidity environment in the back half of the year, and we want to make sure that we prioritize stability until these challenges are behind us, and we start to enter into at least a Fed pause cycle, let alone a Fed cut cycle. Michael Mayo : And then last follow-up. Just how comfortable are you that your NII guide kind of captures it? And is that the kind of entry point for thinking about 2024? Bryan Preston : Mike, it's Bryan. We certainly feel comfortable with our guide. As Jamie talked earlier and as we've talked consistently the Fed hiking cycle ends, we expect a quarter or two of impact as the deposit repricing lags play out. And we still feel like we're going to see stability then both from an NII and NIM perspective. and growth as earning asset growth starts to pick up from there or from an NII perspective. And so we feel very well positioned with the actions that we've taken and the optionality that's going to give us as we manage the balance year. But certainly, a lot can change from an outlook perspective, a lot can change in terms of what happens in 2024. But with what we see right now, we feel very good about our guide and what it's going to allow us to grow in 2024. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Jamie. I'd like to come back to Jamie and Greg on credit for a moment. Greg, you talked about -- and we all recognize your credit is very strong. The numbers are very low. But I'm curious, you mentioned about how you guys have a very robust management structure that allowed you to stay ahead of these emerging trends. Can you share with us what is that robust structure. And what do you mean by keeps you ahead of those trends when you say something like that? Greg Schroeck : Yes. I think it's the ongoing review of the portfolio. As an example, in the second quarter, our team completed a complete review of our office portfolio, right? And so as we continue to stress that portfolio increasing rates using the forward curve to try to get out ahead of where those cash flows end up if rates continue to increase, but also looking at the softening rental rates in that portfolio in the real estate portfolio. That's how we stay ahead of it. We're not waiting for a covenant to forge, we're not waiting for borrowers to come to us. We're active, proactive in again, stressing the portfolio across the board, not just in commercial real estate. So we see what's coming. I think it's one of the lessons learned and a lot of us have the battles cars from the last crisis of being much more proactive state out ahead of it and then bringing forward solutions to our clients that, again, that are more proactive as opposed to, again, waiting for the covenant defaults, waiting for something to drop off the table. So that's what I'm really referring to in terms of the merchant risk. James Leonard : The other one, Gerard, that we've talked about in the past has been some of the proprietary systems we have from an early warning perspective, keeping an eye on real-time liquidity metrics out of the book that we've learned, whether it's through some of the ABL monitoring that was doing that we've adapted as the best practice inside Fifth Third as well as then what other banks do always with regard to covenant monitoring and other vulnerability assessment. Greg Schroeck : Real-time liquidity metrics was kind of what Jamie is referring to. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just as a follow-up, Greg, you mentioned one to two loans, the little pop that you'll likely see in the third quarter. were those shared national credits? And second, how big were the individual loans? And are you still making shared national credit loans today? . Greg Schroeck : So second question, yes, on a select basis, we are still making shared national credit decisions. One of the credits that I was referring to that could impact is a shared national credit. The second one is not. Operator : And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Chris Doll for some closing remarks. Chris Doll : Thank you, Rob, and thanks, everyone, for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the IR department if you have any follow-up questions. Rob, you may now disconnect the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Chris Doll, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Chris Doll : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Fifth Third's third quarter 2023 earnings call. This morning, our President and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Jamie Leonard, will provide an overview of our third quarter results and outlook. Our Treasurer, Bryan Preston; and Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, have also joined us for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of October 19, 2023, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Jamie, we will open the call up for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim. Timothy Spence : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We believe that great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate challenging ones. That is why we focus on stability, profitability, and growth in that order. It is also why I am so pleased that our key return and profitability metrics remain resilient despite the market-related headwinds that all banks are facing. Earlier today, we reported earnings per share of $0.91 or $0.92 excluding a one set impact from our Visa swap, reflecting strong PPNR results and favorable credit outcomes. We generated an adjusted return on tangible common equity ex-AOCI of nearly 16%, which increased 50 basis points sequentially, and a return on assets of 1.26%. We generated strong fee growth compared to the year ago quarter, supported by a more diverse range of fee income streams than peers, and our investments in treasury management, capital markets, and wealth management. Our third quarter total non-interest expense increased less than 2% compared to the year ago quarter, and we generated an adjusted efficiency ratio below 55%. In the last four years, we have managed expenses to the lowest growth rate among peers, despite also investing in growth by building more new branches, raising our minimum wage, modernizing our technology platforms, and acquiring four fintech companies. Expense management at Fifth Third is a continuous process and not a program. Since March of this year, full-time equivalent employee headcount is down 3.5%. Turning to the balance sheet, we generated 4% average deposit growth compared to the year ago quarter versus a 5% decline for the industry. New relationship growth remains strong. Consumer households grew more than 2%, led by 6% growth in the Southeast, a continuation of our multi-year growth base. New middle market relationships added year-to-date remain 25% ahead of last year's record base.  Thanks to the release of the annual FDIC summary of deposits, the third quarter provides a unique opportunity to understand market share gains and losses on a metro area by metro area basis. This year, Fifth Third maintained or improved our market rank in every single one of our 40 largest MSAs.  In the Midwest, we maintained our #2 overall position behind JPMorgan Chase. In the Southeast, where we are just 4 years removed for opening our first next-gen branch, we have reached or are approaching target locational share in 8 of our original 11 focused markets. We intend to continue to open approximately 35 branches per year through 2028, at which time nearly 50% of our branches will be in Southeast markets. These market share gains are the byproduct of multiyear strategies that are not easily replicable by competitors. They include innovative operational deposit-oriented products like Momentum Banking, AI-driven customer acquisition strategies and the top quartile customer service model in addition to our investments in new branches.  Our key credit metrics remained strong during the quarter. Charge-offs were in line with our July expectations in both early stage delinquencies and non-performing assets improved sequentially. The ACL increased 3 basis points given slight changes to Moody's macroeconomic forecast.  Turning to liquidity and capital. We made significant progress against our goal to adapt early to expected changes in the regulatory framework. Our focused efforts throughout the bank enabled us to end the quarter with $103 billion in total liquidity sources and to achieve full Category 1 LCR compliance at the end of both August and September. During the quarter, we also made significant progress on our RWA optimization initiative. Total RWA declined 1% compared to the prior quarter. Our exercise should be complete by the end of the fourth quarter, so we can return to growing loans next year. We created over 30 basis points of CET1 capital during the quarter, reflecting our strong earnings power while we also raised our quarterly dividend by 6%. With respect to the economy, while aggregate figures on spending and employment remains strong and market sentiment has shifted more in favor of a soft landing. We continue to be more cautious given concerning signals disguised beneath the aggregates. For example, while the most recent headline payroll numbers were strong, most, if not all, the job growth is a byproduct of more people working part-time jobs. Real average weekly earnings slipped every month during the quarter and the lower end of the consumer spectrum now maintains deposit balances below pre-COVID levels. Anecdotally, the last time Google searches for soft landing was this high was in May of 2008.  Before I turn it over, I want to say thank you to our employees for everything you do to take care of our customers, strengthen our communities and support one another. Your efforts are why Time Magazine recently recognized Fifth Third as one of the world's best companies, and why I am as confident as ever in Fifth Third's ability to outperform through the cycle and to deliver innovations that improve lives for all our stakeholders.  With that, Jamie will provide more details on our third quarter financial results and outlook. James Leonard : Thank you, Tim, and thanks all of you for joining us today. Our third quarter results were once again strong despite the market headwinds. We continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity levels ahead of pending regulations while also managing our business very efficiently. We achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio below 55%, reflecting ongoing expense discipline throughout the bank and the continued diversification and resilience of our fee revenue streams.  Net interest income of approximately $1.45 billion decreased 1% sequentially. Our NII and NIM results reflect our proactive and continued defensive positioning given the uncertain economic and regulatory environments. Our short-term investments, which primarily represent our cash held at the Fed, increased $5 billion on an average basis and increased $8 billion on an end-of-period basis to $19 billion. This increased level of cash was the primary driver of our 12 basis point NIM decline.  Adjusted noninterest income increased 1% compared to the year ago quarter, driven by growth in capital markets and deposit service charge revenue, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage revenue driven primarily by lower origination volumes. Our ability to produce strong capital markets revenue in a volatile market has become a key distinction for Fifth Third compared to many peers.  Adjusted noninterest expense increased just 2% compared to the year ago quarter, reflecting growth in compensation and benefits, occupancy and technology expenses partially offset by continued expense discipline across the company. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases decreased 1% sequentially and due to softening customer demand and our RWA optimization efforts. Average C&I balances decreased 2% sequentially. As Tim mentioned, clients remain cautious with respect to their growth plans. Consequently, production was muted in corporate banking. Also, average CRE balances decreased 1% compared to the prior quarter. The period-end commercial revolver utilization rate of 36% increased 1% compared to last quarter, partially due to our exit of certain lower returning unused commercial commitments.  On a sequential basis, total corporate banking commitments and unused commitments decreased 3% and 4%, respectively, while total middle market commitments and unused commitments increased 5% and 7%, respectively. This trend highlights our capital optimization efforts while we continue to grow share in the middle market. Average total consumer portfolio loan and lease balances decreased 1% sequentially due to our intentional decline in indirect auto and the overall slowdown in residential mortgage originations, given the rate environment, partially offset by growth from dividend finance. Our card balances increased just 1% this quarter, reflecting our conservative risk culture and focus on transactors. Balances have increased 3% relative to the year ago quarter compared to 11% for the industry. Average total deposits increased 3% sequentially as increases in CDs and interest checking balances were partially offset by a decline in demand deposits given the mix shift we have seen for several quarters. DDAs as a percent of core deposits were 28% for the quarter compared to 30% in the prior quarter. The 2-point decline was primarily due to the strong deposit growth in the denominator that Tim highlighted from our net new relationship growth in both consumer and commercial, which are obviously skewed to interest-bearing products in this environment. As a result, we added more than $4 billion in core deposits during the quarter, the most since the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the DDA migration continued to show signs of deceleration this quarter and marked the smallest dollar decline in DDA balances since the onset of the rate hiking cycle. By segment, average consumer deposits increased 2% sequentially, and commercial deposits increased 4%, while wealth and asset management deposits declined 2% and reflecting clients' alternative investment options.  As a result of our balance sheet positioning and success adding new deposits, we achieved a loan to core deposit ratio of 74% and at quarter end, which should be one of the best, if not the best, compared to our regional peers. We also achieved full Category 1 LCR compliance at 118% at quarter end. Moving to credit. As Tim mentioned, credit has remained resilient. The net charge-off ratio of 41 basis points increased 12 basis points compared to the prior quarter as we expected, reflecting two credits, which had been fully reserved. Early stage delinquencies decreased 7% compared to the prior quarter, while loans 90 days past due, of just 2 basis points or a record low for Fifth Third.  Non-performing loans decreased 9%. This quarter marked the lowest inflows of commercial NPLs since the second quarter of 2022. From an overall credit management perspective, we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on generating and maintaining high-quality relationships. As many of you know, we tightened underwriting standards during COVID, which limited our growth but improved the stability of our balance sheet.  In consumer, we have focused on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained conservative underwriting policies. In commercial, we have maintained the lowest overall CRE concentration as a percent of total loans relative to peers for many years. Our criticized non-performing and delinquent CRE loans have all improved sequentially and remain very well behaved.  And within that, the same is true for our office exposures. For instance, criticized office loans represented just 5.4% of total office CRE, which improved 180 basis points sequentially. Additionally, we have zero delinquencies and zero charge-offs. We also decreased loan balances by 8% in the office book without any loan sales. These credit quality metrics are significantly better than peers who have reported their office exposure so far this quarter. While credit quality in the office portfolio has remained very strong, and we continue to believe the overall impact on Fifth Third will be limited. We nevertheless continue to watch it closely given the environment.  Our shared national credit portfolio also remains very strong from a credit quality perspective, with criticized assets, non-performing loans and net charge-offs consistently lower than the overall commercial portfolio across a multiyear period. Our credit resilience highlights our proactive risk culture. We continue to closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress throughout the entire portfolio as well as the fallout from the ongoing labor strike in the auto manufacturing sector, where we think our exposures are very manageable.  Moving to the ACL. Our reserves decreased $5 million, but the coverage ratio increased 3 basis points sequentially to 2.11% as the impact of lower period end loans was offset by a slightly worse overall base case economic outlook. As you know, we incorporate Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance. Both the Moody's base scenario and the downside scenario used for the third quarter ACL assume a slightly worse average unemployment rate compared to the prior quarter. We maintained our scenario weightings of 80% to the base and 10% to each the upside and downside scenarios.  Moving to capital. Our CET1 ratio increased 31 basis points sequentially ending the quarter at 9.8%. Our capital position reflects our ability to build capital quickly through our strong earnings generation, combined with the impact of our RWA diet. Our tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 10% compared to the year ago quarter. We continue to expect improvement in our unrealized securities losses resulting in approximately 35% of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of 2025 and approximately 2/3 by 2028, assuming the forward curve plays out.  Looking forward, we expect to build capital at an accelerated pace given our RWA optimization initiative and our continued deferment of share buybacks. We anticipate accreting capital such that our CET1 ratio ends this year above 10%.  Moving to our current outlook. We expect fourth quarter average total loan balances to decline 2% to 3% sequentially with consumer loans down 2% and commercial loans down 3%. The reflects our overall cautious economic outlook combined with one more quarter of our RWA diet as we are responding quickly to higher risk-adjusted return thresholds throughout the bank considering the economic and regulatory environments. We expect average deposits to be up slightly on a sequential basis. Within that, we expect core deposits to increase 1% due to our multiyear investments in the franchise to add households and primary commercial relationships, along with the benefit from seasonality. While we continue to expect modest migration from DDA into interest-bearing products in a higher for longer interest rate environment, specifically for the fourth quarter, we expect the mix of DDA to core deposits to remain relatively stable given those seasonal benefits.  Shifting to the income statement. We expect fourth quarter NII to be down approximately 1% to 2% sequentially due to the continued impacts of the balance sheet dynamics I mentioned. Our NII guidance assumes no additional rate hikes and a cumulative beta, which includes CDs and excludes DDAs of 55% by the fourth quarter. Excluding brokered deposits that we have been using as a replacement for other wholesale funding, given the pricing considerations, our cumulative beta expectation continues to be 53%. This outlook translates to total interest-bearing deposit costs increasing 15 basis points to 20 basis points in the fourth quarter.  Our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances remain relatively stable through year-end. As a byproduct of our strong deposit growth, combined with our loan outlook and stable securities balances, we expect to hold closer to $20 billion in cash and cash equivalents by year-end. Given these balance trends, we expect our loan to core deposit ratio to continue to move lower through the end of the year, which will keep Fifth Third in a strong liquidity position in anticipation of more stringent regulatory requirements, including remaining compliant with the full Category 1 LCR.  We expect fourth quarter adjusted noninterest income to increase 1% to 2% compared to the third quarter. We expect revenues to remain resilient across most captions driven by our multiyear focus on growing a diverse portfolio of fee businesses that should perform well in different economic environments. We expect fourth quarter TRA revenue of $22 million compared to $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect fourth quarter adjusted noninterest expenses to be stable to up 1% compared to the third quarter. Our guidance excludes the pending FDIC special assessment, which we currently estimate at $208 million for Fifth Third.  With respect to credit quality, we expect fourth quarter net charge-offs to be 30 basis points to 35 basis points. We do expect to gradually normalize from here. We continue to believe that are through the cycle, annual charge-offs will be in the 35 basis point to 45 basis point range given the credit risk profile of the bank. Given our reduced loan outlook, we expect the change in the ACL for the fourth quarter to be stable to up $25 million, assuming no significant changes in the underlying Moody's economic scenarios. This considers production from dividend finance of around $700 million in the fourth quarter, which as you know, carries a higher reserve level of around 9%.  In summary, with our proactive balance sheet management, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we believe we are well positioned to meet the proposed regulatory requirements while continuing to generate long-term value for our shareholders.  With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A. Chris Doll : Thanks, Jamie. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. ScottSiefers: Jamie, I was hoping maybe you could expand even a little more on your thoughts on bringing in so many deposits in the third quarter. I know you're trying to get your liquidity to a certain very high level and you achieved it. But it was just a kind of astonishing number. So just curious as to what the thinking throughout the quarter was. I guess additional forward look though you provided some of the deposit commentary or expectations in there. But just any additional thoughts would be helpful, please. JamesLeonard: Thanks, Scott, for the question. We were certainly bringing the Victory bell on deposits this quarter. Really, when you take a look back, coming out of March Madness, one of the biggest drivers of our deposit success in the second quarter and the third quarter was really transitioning our customer recommendation engine from household growth to deposit growth. And while that sacrificed a little bit on the household growth numbers instead of our typical up 3% or up 4%, we were up 2% on households, but that translated to very strong consumer deposit growth. And so within the deposit growth we did have during the quarter of almost $4.8 billion, about 60% was commercial, 40% was consumer. And within consumer, 70% of that growth was in the Southeast markets, while 30% of that growth was in the Midwest. So again, the retail franchise at Fifth Third is just performing at an extremely high level.  And on the commercial side, the growth was surprisingly high given the corporate banking book growth within the commercial deposit growth. About 80% of the growth was in corporate banking. So at the time, we were targeting, let's get LCR, full LCR north of 100%. We actually came in at 118%. So definitely did better than we initially expected. But when we were dissecting the quarter end results, it really makes sense that the corporate banking book did better. And as one of sort of hidden benefits of the RWA diet is that we are getting better share of wallet within that corporate banking book, and that also helped drive the deposit growth. So overall, a very strong quarter. Again, for us on the deposit side, we expect continued growth in the fourth quarter, albeit at a little bit lower growth rate but still up a bit in the fourth quarter. ScottSiefers: That's very helpful. And then if I could switch gears for just a second. The securities portfolio remarks, I guess you all might come out looking a little heavier than some others. But by the same token, you guys have been more hesitant to use the HTM classification as well. I guess just any updated thoughts on sort of how you're thinking about that. It at least optically, would help out levels, if not in terms of real world. But just curious to hear your updated thoughts. JamesLeonard: If you break it down between real world and regulatory world, that's really how we are looking at this in the real world with really the economic risk. Whenever you have a fixed rate asset, whether that's in AFS, HTM or in the loan portfolio, you have that economic risk to higher rates. We have elected to hold our securities in AFS, and we'll continue to do so, given that it gives us better flexibility and opportunity to reposition as the environment changes. But when you are in the real world managing the balance sheet, how we approach balance sheet management is in totality. And you can look at our strong NII results, our interest-bearing liability results, any of the measures relative to peers, the total balance sheet is performing very well. We're going to grow NII this year, 3% to 5%. Others are shrinking. So our philosophy is paying off in the real world. The challenge simply comes from the fair value of a single line item and putting that into capital. We're not insensitive to how that looks on the face of the balance sheet and the tangible book value per share. But we still believe it is prudent to have that flexibility because flexibility has value. In terms of the regulatory risk, perhaps one of the details that we continue to evaluate as something we've not really communicated to all of you externally, is that given the burn down that you have in the presentation and the significant, whether it's static rate, forward rate, you're looking at 60%, 65% of the ASC burn down during the transition into the new capital regimes, assuming the rules play out as currently written, and that burn down is going to happen on our portfolio because our portfolio has structured. We have defined maturities unlike those portfolios that are in residential mortgage-backed, instruments with convexity and extension risk, we know our portfolio is going to pay down. And we know that this is going to be very manageable from a regulatory capital perspective. When we model the capital impact at a fully phased-in level on AOCI, the impact on CET1 is about 125 basis points when you reach the third quarter of 2028 and that's why we continue to accrete CET1 is to be able to have sufficient regulatory capital for that world. And in fact, should rates get north of 8%. We would still be maintaining a CET1 well above regulatory minimums would be over 8% CET1 in that environment.  So we feel good about how we're positioned, how we will roll down the curve and ultimately, the regulatory capital. It's just one of the challenges in this environment with everything in AFS is that you have that mark on the tangible book value per share, that erosion. But at the same time, should rates fall. I think all of you would be very pleased with how much tangible book value accretion, we would report in that environment. TimothySpence: And Scott, if I just put a point on the last thing, Jamie you said. I mean, we believe investors want us to do what is best for managing the business and for recognizing the fact that options have value but if you believe that the AOCI mark is weighing on the stock, then the other way to look at it is the burn down is 25% accretion in tangible book value per share in the next two years, just given the current outlook on rates, which is a pretty unique buying opportunity, be the other way to look at it. ScottSiefers: Yes, I agree. All right. That's perfect. So Tim and Jamie, thank you both. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. ErikaNajarian: Jamie, this first one is for you. Not to belabor the earlier point, but all the PPNR metrics and balance sheet metrics look great and also did the forward look? And I guess, if you could just explain what happened in the quarter, I think given that your portfolio -- your securities portfolio is 61% CMBS. I think investors that know you well, expected not as much negative convexity -- was there something unique that happened in this quarter in the portfolio that -- where the AOCI was that much wider? JamesLeonard: Not really. It was a pretty vanilla quarter for us where we had cash flows in the quarter of about $500 million. We put about $700 million to work of the excess cash in short duration Level 1 treasury floaters. When you look at the AOCI walk that happened in the quarter, the securities portfolio because everything is in AFS, worsened about $1.2 billion and if you look at how the 5-year move increased about 45 basis points, the 10-year moved to about 75% and then spreads widen 5 bps on the CMBS and about 15 bps in mortgage. So when you add it all up with the DV01 of about $25 million, that gets you to the AOCI movement for the quarter on the investment portfolio. And so it was in line at least with our expectations with how rates were moving during the quarter. ErikaNajarian: And my follow-up question was for you, Tim. I think it was a very powerful statement you said in the beginning of the call in terms of confidence that you could return to loan growth next year. I think several of your peers that have similar CET1 ratios and similar AOCI marks are still talking about dieting. Could you give us a sense of, first of all, if you could confirm what the AOCI was in basis points, Jamie? And second, Tim, how are you balancing on one hand, the market wants you to continue to build capital as we approach that transitional date on CET1? And on the other, we're still hearing low demand from corporates for financing. TimothySpence: So there's a lot in there. But that's the right question, Erica. So a few things here. One, I think, we have tried to be consistent in how we confront change or a need for change in how we operate the company. And the underlying principle here is that if you have to make a change, it's better to do it quickly so that you can get it behind you and return at normal mode of operations. So we have been aggressive in building liquidity. Jamie talked about the fact that we were Cat-1 LCR compliant in both August and September this year. And I think equivalently, we have tried to be very proactive about how we manage through the RWA diet. So we have one additional quarter to go of dieting to hit our RWA target, which was about a 2% reduction, if you just look at what we're expecting in the fourth quarter. And from there, we'll have achieved what we think we need to achieve in order to be able to refocus on growing the balance sheet. Prudently, I should say, growing the loan portfolio prudently sequentially over the course of the next year. We have the benefit of a very high level of profitability right now, right? We obviously don't have all of the peer reports at this point. But if you look at the core profitability measures here, they're excellent. We're generating 30-plus basis points of CET1 a quarter, which is quite helpful as it relates to being able to both build capital and fund loan growth.  And then while demand is tepid, across the sector. We have some idiosyncratic benefits here that probably have been a little bit lost behind the diet in the form of both dividend and provide, which continue to perform very well and generate growth. And the sustained multiyear investment we've made in expanding our middle market coverage in the Southeast markets, the middle-market relationships in terms of the new relationships we've added in the company year-to-date, are 25% ahead of our all-time record pace.  And we still have bankers who are seasoning in in terms of building their portfolios that we have been fortunate to hire over the course of the past few years. So that -- those are the things that really provide the catalyst in an environment where demand in aggregate is a little bit more tepid and then the raw capacity in the form of capital generation to be able to support that statement that we can return to growth next year. JamesLeonard: And then, Erika, on your other components of the question, CET1 for us finished the quarter at 9.8%. Excluding the investment portfolio, AOCI, that number would be 6.3%. And then the RWA bloat from the pending rules would be about 2% to 3% of RWA, which is about 20 basis points. So we would look to be at a 6.1 level. But as we talked about then, the earnings power of the company is very strong. We continue to defer the buybacks. We'll continue to accrete capital and with the passage of time, given the structure in the investment portfolio. The burn down of that AOCI will be 65% or so by the time we reach the fully phased-in level. So we feel that this is a very manageable timeline for the company. In fact, have a lot of cushion should rates even go higher. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. GerardCassidy: Tim, coming back to your opening comments about your corporate and commercial customers being cautious and you yourself seeing some of the economic cross wins or cross currents being cautious. I noticed yesterday that the real GDP number that the Atlanta Fed puts out for the third quarter, is calling for a 5.4% real GDP growth in the third quarter. It's probably too high. But the point is there are a lot of cross currents. Can you share with us when you talk to your customers, what do you think is going to take them to become more optimistic and most cautious? Is it a Fed halting and increasing short-term interest rates? Is it better inflation numbers? What do you think they're waiting for before they really start committing to borrowing more money and growing their businesses? TimothySpence: That's a great question, Gerard. I think, honestly, it's less uncertainty, right? So to your point. So you have a lot of variables underway here. You have the Fed and rates, as you mentioned, you have an immense amount of government spending right now, which is propping up economic growth in certain sectors of the economy that otherwise wouldn't be there. You have sort of unusual times in the housing market, where we have both high rates and still stable or even in some markets, slightly growing home prices, even the home affordability is at an all-time low.  And it's just, I think, more than anything else, we need to see some of those variables get fixed, right, in terms of what happens. So if the Fed stops raising rates and then introduces a cut, I think that would be helpful. I think that we have to see the last of the stimulus dollars come out of consumer accounts and see what the floor looks like in terms of consumer spending. And then I think we have to have a better sense for what the underlying economic activity looks like in areas where the government spending the $2.3 trillion that are coming out of the various government programs are not driving a lot of the economic activity for people to get a little bit more focused. Because again, what I hear and went out to the opportunity to get feedback from about 3 dozen clients shortly before the call here, is they're seeing a gradual slowdown that is essentially disposable income. They're seeing disparities on the consumer side between either the businesses or take hotels, hotel properties that either cater to retired people or to high-end consumers in high-end destinations continue to do well, whereas the mass market properties are starting to soften. We hear them on the B2B side being much more guarded as it relates to liquidity and monitoring cash and adjusting staffing levels and just delaying the larger CapEx investments here.  And I think an interesting data point, as I had the chance to spend a little bit of time with the head of economic development for one of the large states in our footprint and I was asking about the new project pipeline. So yes, pipeline is still robust. There's a lot of discussion going on, but the time to decision from when they're initially contacted about a potential opportunity for either a new plant or a headquarter relocation or otherwise to the award in a given state has moved from 200 days as recently as 18 months ago to over 500 days. So you can just see the grind down here of economic activity as people sit on the sidelines and wait to get a better sense for what direction we're headed on the economy. GerardCassidy: Thank you, Tim. Very insightful. And then on credit, tying into maybe the economic comments that you just made, and I don't know if this is sort of Greg and Jamie. But can you share with us -- Jamie, you showed some very strong credit numbers prepared remarks. And can you tell us, is it better underwriting, if you look back to the financial crisis, through the cycle, net charge-off ratio, I guess it's quite a bit higher than what you're thinking today?  And then second, is it also your customers, because of the pandemic and what they went through, are they just better managed today from a balance sheet perspective than was the case pre-financial crisis? GregSchroeck: It's Greg. It's a great question. I think it's all of the above, right? I think we have been very disciplined, very fundamental about our through-the-cycle underwriting for the past several years. We've been very disciplined around our concentration in geographically or by product, right? So we have a very well-diversified portfolio. As a result, we're not seeing trending one way or the other. So we've just been disciplined around that. We've been disciplined around ongoing portfolio management, right? So we are proactive. We're getting out ahead of issues when they arise. We are stress testing 200 basis points ahead of the yield curve, forward-looking yield curve. And we've seen throughout the cycles. To the extent we get out ahead of this and we identified issues earlier, we minimize. We also have the ability then to bring solutions to our clients, right, to help them through some of these cycles.  And so we're seeing all of that across the board, be it in our commercial real estate portfolio, very diverse. We weren't as aggressive in that portfolio as some other banks were when rates were 550 basis points lower and the same thing through our C&I book. So it's fundamental, sticking to those fundamentals, staying disciplined, both on the front-end underwriting, client selection and then staying on top of the portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. EbrahimPoonawala: I guess maybe just following up on Gerard's question on the macro and credit. Tim, just if you can add to your comments there's still some concern that we could hit a recession first half of next year could drive significant deterioration in credit quality. One, how much of a visibility do you have into credit change over the next few quarters where you can safely say that's unlikely. And maybe, Jamie, just talk to us about the ability of the CECL model to capture that kind of deterioration ahead of time. TimothySpence: So good morning Ebrahim, it's good to chat. I think a couple of comments. So narrowly to your point, I think we have fairly good visibility into what the first half of the year is going to look like. And we're not seeing anything at the moment that would suggest that we're headed toward credit deterioration in the first half, right? We talked about it in the script delinquency formation that delinquency rates are actually down on the early-stage basis. NPAs are down sequentially, and we have a roll forward for you in the appendix. The slides, which would indicate that, that trend is likely to continue through the fourth quarter. And on the consumer side, just as an example, the nice thing about the way that we manage delinquencies is it's like an assembly line. So you can see in the zero to 29 and then the 30-plus buckets what you're going to be dealing with or early next year, and there just isn't anything in there to be worried about.  With that said, the base case we're using as we think about the management of the company, strategic investments, how we manage expenses and otherwise, continues to assume that maybe the market is a little bit too bullish on the idea of a soft landing here. I mean again, you just look at the payroll numbers, so -- and apply a human lens to it. So jobs are up, but job participation is flat. Labor force participation is flat. And average hours worked are down and unemployment stable. What that means is you have more people working two jobs because they're not getting enough hours or earning enough money at the job that they were working, the base job that they were working to be able to cover their expenses. So when you then look at declining real incomes, the only thing that really would be standing between somebody who is having to work two jobs and is still suffering from a declining real income and credit delinquency is the fact that there was the stimulus buffer that built up because people had forbearance on loan portfolios and stimulus dollars. Well, the student loans are back now. Housing inflation is still very high at 7.2%, I think, in the most recent prints. And those are just early indicators that there are people across the country that are struggling a lot more than the headline numbers would suggest.  So I feel good because the two areas I would say the market is most worried about right now are subprime consumers and renters where we have very little in the way of exposure on virtually no subprime, I think the lowest level there of any of our peers who provide information on that front and 85% of the consumer exposure is to homeowners. And then in commercial real estate, where, again, our exposure relative to total capital is lower than anybody else's. And because we weren't trying to grow that portfolio materially, we're able to be much more selective, which is reflected in superior credit metrics right now when you look at our commercial real estate book relative to others. So it's both smaller and better performing. JamesLeonard: And in terms of how the consumer is doing and what we see in our data, the average consumer balance is still deposit balance is still 15% above pre-COVID levels. But to Tim's point, renters are back to pre-COVID levels and sub-660 FICOs are actually below pre-COVID level. So the averages can be a little bit misleading in terms of what credit outcomes may bring in 2024. But as Tim said, we're certainly well positioned from a credit perspective on our balance sheet.  And from an ACL perspective on the second part of your question, the scenarios we use from Moody's have GDP contracting almost near zero. So the modeling certainly picks up erosion in the forecast. In this quarter, you had a slight erosion both in GDP and unemployment as well as with corporate profits and that was part of the reason or the primary reason why our ACL coverage increased from 208 basis points to 211 basis points. It's just we had the benefits of the loan balance reduction and the unused commitment reductions from RWA optimization efforts that offset that. EbrahimPoonawala: That's helpful. And just as a separate question. In terms of deposit pricing, as we look through next year and if rates don't get cut in higher for longer, are you observing any differences within your geographies, Midwest versus Southeast? Clearly, you're opening a lot of branches in the Southeast. So you have a different strategy there. I assume relative to the home market. Just give us a sense of pricing competition, any differences? And in your view, is deposit pricing now essentially national in nature? Or is it still localized where certain markets could meaningfully outperform or lag in -- on the pricing side? JamesLeonard: Excellent question. I'll start and then turn it over to Bryan. In terms of total deposit cost and deposit pricing, the quarter played out as expected with our beta ticking up from total deposits, excluding brokered to 50%. We expect that to hit the 53% beta we talked about a quarter or two ago. So the pricing is playing out as we had expected. And I think most of the bank's beta guides are coming up to where we've been at this hire for longer scenario. But in terms of each geography, Bryan, do you want to touch on that? BryanPreston: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, Jamie. In general, I think what we're seeing is that it's a combination of -- it is local and a national impact right now. And what you're seeing is that you may have periods of time where the dominant players or the bigger players in specific markets may just have a lower liquidity need. And so that gives you a little bit of an opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive and do well from a share perspective. But what we've seen since March is that tends to rotate around a little bit.  And ultimately, as people start to realize as deposit competition is moving in the market, you're just seeing people then start to react. Your most rate-sensitive customers are absolutely focused on the national markets. They tend to be the ones that are most willing to use a non-traditional provider, and so you definitely see some of that. But in general, it tends to -- you still tend to have some opportunity to take advantage of some geographic differences, but those geographic differences can rotate over time. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. KennethUsdin: I think you guys said in the conference season that the fourth quarter would likely be the bottom for NIM and the first quarter of next year will be the bottom for NII dollars. Just wondering, given the guide you gave today, if that still foots to that and anything we should be thinking about in terms of getting to that NII bottoming? JamesLeonard: The first quarter, the day count is what will drive that NII trough. The NIM whether it's the fourth quarter or the first quarter is going to be driven solely by how much excess cash we have from the strong deposit performance. So we'll see, but it's going to be one of those 2 quarters. KennethUsdin: And then as you think forward, how do we understand the benefit that you'll get once rates get to a peak about fixed rate loan repricing. I think it's clear to understand how the securities book moves. But on the loan side, can you walk us through just how much benefit you might be able to see as we get into next year from that side being able to offset any lagging deposit pricing? JamesLeonard: The consumer book, in particular, is where most of the fixed rate repricing benefit resides. If you look at 2024, we'll have about $8 billion of consumer loan payoffs is how we model it. And front book rates are 200 basis points to 300 basis points higher than back book rates. And so if you take that, coupled with, call it, $4 billion in security maturities and cash flows you end up with about $300 million tailwind on an annualized basis. Obviously, that will happen during the course of 2024, so take half of that for the in-year effect. But you're looking at $300 million type of run rate benefit just from one year's repricing. KennethUsdin: If I could just ask one last one. The swap slide you have just talks about the '25 -- 2025 versus '23 update. Is there anything different or any thought process different about some other banks have been adding securities based swaps to protect capital and add a little variable rate juice? Have you done anything like that incrementally? Or is that slide looks pretty intact in terms of how you're approaching swap portfolios of both loans and securities? BryanPreston: We've done nothing incremental at this point. Obviously, we're paying attention to the market and evaluating opportunities. I think more than anything the, as Jamie mentioned, the lower lockout structure of our portfolio ultimately is our hedge to higher rates right now because we now have those defined maturities that are going to come in, and we think that keeps us relatively well positioned. But we're constantly keeping an eye on the market and figuring out if there are opportunities for us to continue to improve our positioning. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. MichaelMayo: I guess this goes in the category of no good deed goes unpunished. Your efficiency ratio of 55%, do you think that can improve next year, which is another way of saying is there any shot at getting positive operating leverage? And when I give the positives and negatives, and correct me, it looks like from the negative, the RWA diet certainly helps capital, but has a cost to NII. And I think you mentioned NII not bottoming maybe until first second quarter. You have the cumulative beta going up to 53%. It's in line, but still going higher. You're opening 35 new branches a year.  On the other hand, your RWA will end and maybe you can lean into the balance sheet more. You mentioned the deposits, the smallest DDA increase since March, the excess cash, which you could choose to put to work, so really part of the tailwind is the asset beta relative to the deposit beta. So does your efficiency improve next year? Can you get positive operating leverage? Is that too much of a stretch? How do you think about that? JamesLeonard: I think it will be environment dependent, which I'm sure is not the answer we want. But I think you hit on all the right points, Mike, which is the RWA diet makes positive operating leverage difficult in 2024. With that said, we will do everything in our power to deliver as good a results as we can, but I think it will be a challenge in 2024. TimothySpence: The old saying is Cincinnati invented hustle, so we're going to work as hard as we possibly can on that front. MichaelMayo: And just clarification on the credit side. Did I hear you correctly, you have zero office delinquencies, zero office charge-offs. Commercial, you have the lowest inflows to NPA since 2Q '22. You reiterated 35 basis points to 45 basis points through the cycle. Is that correct? And I know it's been asked already, but you're saying the economy is grinding lower doesn't look good. So you just say you're credit is economically insensitive at this point? I mean that's like -- do you think you could maybe be wrong if things don't go so well. TimothySpence: Until you got to the last part there, I was going to say in a word, yes. But then you made the question a little more complicated. If you want to...? JamesLeonard: All of those facts are correct, and we feel very good about all of the work we've done on the credit portfolio over the last 15 years. In terms of it being economically insensitive, no, but within any industry, there are going to be winners and losers, and that's where it comes down to that client selection that Greg referenced. We just believe we are very well positioned, and we've been very diligent and part of the benefit that we're getting right now is the fact that we were not stretching for loan growth over the past several years and we probably had the lowest loan growth guides over the past several years running. And so back to our priorities of stability and profitability ahead of growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI. JohnPancari: Just on the credit side. I know you mentioned that the new NPA inflows were the lowest since the second quarter of '22, excluding the large charged-off items, I guess, could you maybe talk about the sustainability of that? What are you seeing in terms of risk migration and some of your internal risk ratings and everything? Do you think the inflows are likely to remain that low at this point? And what's the driver of the pressure? Is it the areas everybody suspects in terms of CRE or is it more on the C&I side? TimothySpence: It's not on the CRE side, great question. Not on the CRE side, we're not seeing. It doesn't mean we're out of the woods yet. We're watching that portfolio. Clearly, there's stress in that portfolio, but we have so little of it, that's not driving. And as I said earlier, we don't have any geographic or product trends. There's not an industry that's driving our NPA numbers as we sit here today, we have very little from a delinquency standpoint. And so again, it gets back to how diverse the portfolio is. Yes, I still think we've got some pressure on the 550 basis point rate increase that will flow through to our clients. But we're on top of the portfolio. It's why we're stressing 200 basis points ahead of the yield curve. So we get out ahead of that stuff. And so could it go up a little bit given all the cross-currents, sure, but I think we're in a great spot. Our client selection has been outstanding. Our through the cycle, very disciplined fundamental underwriting I think gets us through this cycle. And so I feel good about where we are today. And even if it goes up a little bit, it's very controllable. JohnPancari: And then secondly, kind of a two-parter. Do you have -- I know you mentioned the criticized loans are down in total this quarter versus last. You have the magnitude of that decline? And then on the Shared National Credit side, the portfolio of 29% of loans, I think over the past year that maybe is down a touch. I mean, do you expect that you're going to reduce the size of the Shared National Credit book? And also what is the criticized ratio for that portfolio? TimothySpence: So we reduced the -- it is about 29%, you're right. We reduced that portfolio by about 7% year-to-date, given the diving that Jamie talked about earlier, I would expect that number to probably continue to decline between now and year-end. Our portfolio -- that SNC portfolio performs better than on every metric than the rest of the portfolio. So it's under 6% from a criticized asset standpoint. Delinquencies are less than we see in the rest of the book. NPAs are less. So it is some of our strongest performing of the portfolio -- the commercial portfolio. JamesLeonard: John, it's Jamie. The crit office loans were what I referenced that declined 180 basis points. Crits overall, were up just a little bit. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia Morgan Stanley. MananGosalia: I wanted to follow up on the RWA diet and the trajectory of rates. I guess does it move into the annual impact how you manage that. So from here, we get the annual moving up 1% or down 1%. Does that impact how you will manage loans? And as we look into next year, what would cause you to maybe lean into low growth? And what would cause you to peel back? Is it just the outlook on credit, what you're seeing there? Or could the rate outlook impact that as well? BryanPreston: Yes, it's Bryan. I would tell you that the outlook on rates has a modest impact on how we think of loans, but it's more about just composition and more in consumer where we may see some additional opportunity or relative asset classes, you might feel a little bit better about some of the spreads in auto. You're going to see almost no mortgage production in a higher rate environment, obviously. And that's probably the biggest implication just given that our commercial portfolio is primarily floating rate, doesn't really have a big impact from a floating rate portfolio perspective. And it really for us comes down to overall macro, how we feel about what the credit outlook is going to be and whether or not we're earning adequate returns on the capital we're deploying. MananGosalia: And then just from a cash perspective, it seems like the build was a little bit more than you guided to before? I think you had said about $15 billion or so in cash is what you were targeting before. I think you're target has now moved to $20 billion. What's driving the change? Is it the volatility in rates? Is it just preparation for LCR? Or is it also just that you can get 5.5% of cash and makes more sense to hold cash over securities? JamesLeonard: It was mostly the fact that deposit growth outpaced expectations. And in this environment, we want to hold excess cash as opposed to doing anything, adding it to the investment portfolio. We certainly view cash as an asset allocation at these rates, as you referenced. MananGosalia: So it sounds like at some point, you'd be able to bring that $20 billion down. It might not be in the next 6 months or so. But as rate volatility improves, you might be able to bring that down? JamesLeonard: Yes, I would say that our balance sheet is elevated due to a couple of reasons. One, the unrealized losses, whether you have an AFS or HTM, you do have to fund those losses in your liquidity buffers. And so should those losses come down, that certainly frees up cash to shrink the sheet or over time as our non-HQLA allocation matures, we will reinvest that in shorter duration level 1s and also allow us to maintain an above 100%, while also shrinking the sheet. It's just -- both of those things are going to be measured more years than in quarters in terms of the cash coming down. MananGosalia: So just as a clarification then, does that make you more asset sensitive, all things equal now versus, say, last year? JamesLeonard: We're pretty neutral right now, how that lines up versus last year, probably a little asset sensitive a year ago, whereas today, we're neutral to at least in the disclosure showing liability sensitive. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott. ChristopherMarinac: I know you mentioned a little bit about credit and previous questions. But generally speaking, is the criticized and classified number is going to be within a certain band in the next several quarters? Or do you see them rising more than that? JamesLeonard: I would say steady based on what we're seeing now from the delinquency and NPA, all the above and our ongoing portfolio, in the last 12 months, we have rerated 95-plus percent of the portfolio. So based on all of that underwriting or reunderwriting, if you will, I'm expecting steady. ChristopherMarinac: And if it went higher than you think that would obviously drive more provisions and obviously more reserve build next year, just all things being equal. Is that fair? JamesLeonard: Sure. Yes. ChristopherMarinac: Great. Thanks for all the background and information this morning. We appreciate it. Operator : And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Chris Doll for some final closing remarks. Chris Doll : Thanks, Rob, and thanks, everyone else, for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the IR department if you have any follow-up questions. Rob, you can now disconnect the line. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the conference over to Matt Curoe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matt Curoe : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Fifth Third's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning our Chairman, President, and CEO, Tim Spence; and CFO, Bryan Preston will provide an overview of our fourth quarter results and outlook; our Chief Operating Officer, Jamie Leonard and Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck have also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of January 19, 2024, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Bryan, we will open up the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim. Timothy Spence : Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe that great banks distinguish themselves based on how they navigate challenging and uncertain operating environment. 2023 was certainly a challenging year for the industry, but I am very pleased with how we measured up. A defensive balance sheet positioning, strong execution, and multiyear strategic investments produce top-quartile profitability, the best core deposit growth, and the best total shareholder return among all regional peers who did not participate in an FDIC-assisted transaction. We generated an all-time record full-year revenue of $8.7 billion. Deposits grew 5% compared to an industry-wide decline of 3%. Credit performance was strong with net charge-offs remaining below historical averages. And although it would be foolish to expect it to repeat forever, in commercial real estate we experienced zero net charge-offs in 2023 and only two basis points in delinquent loans as of early January. These strong outcomes combined with our multi-year expense discipline produced a full-year adjusted return on assets of 1.25% and adjusted return on tangible common equity ex-AOCI of 15.9% and an adjusted efficiency ratio of 55.9%. All among the best of our peers. We also continue to take market share organically by growing our customer base and deepening relationships. We grew consumer households by 3% overall punctuated by 6% growth in the Southeast. In commercial, we added a record number of new quality middle market relationships up 11% over the prior year. As a result, we grew or maintained our deposit market share position in all 40 of our largest MSAs. As we turn the page to 2024, we remain focused on differentiating Fifth Third based on the strength and consistency of our financial performance by prioritizing stability, profitability, and growth in that order. Bryan will take you through the detail on the fourth quarter and our outlook for the year shortly. But before that, I would like to touch on a few points. The first of these is the strength of our balance sheet. Our defensive positioning and decision to move quickly to adapt to proposed regulatory changes have put us in a position to play offense in 2024. Having achieved full Category 1 LCR compliance on August 31st and maintained it since, our liquidity position is very strong. We completed our RWA diet in the fourth quarter and accreted nearly 50 basis points of CET1, putting us on pace to reach a 10.5% CET1 ratio by mid-year 2024. Given our strong earnings profile and the significant rally in interest rates in December, our tangible book value per share grew nearly 30% during the fourth quarter. At the beginning of January, we moved $12.6 billion of securities to held-to-maturity, representing roughly one quarter of our AFS portfolio. We expect this move will de-risk potential AOCI volatility to capital by about 30% in the event that market rates rise again. If the economic outlook remains stable and the capital rules are finalized, no worse than the current NPR. These actions put us in a position to resume share repurchases of up to $300 million to $400 million in the second half of 2024, including $100 million to $200 million as early as the beginning of the third quarter. Should the final rules prove less stringent than the initial proposals, we'll have additional flexibility in deploying excess capital and liquidity to further improve profitability and position Fifth Third for growth. The second point I'd like to highlight is profitability. Expense discipline, strong returns, and positive operating leverage remain core areas of focus for Fifth Third. Supported by our technology modernization investments and a focus on leaning out key value streams, we reduced full-time equivalent employee headcount by 4% from our peak in 2023 to the end of the year without the need for a company-wide expense program. The run rate benefits of these efforts put us in a position to sustain the peer-leading annualized expense growth that we have averaged the past several years, even as we continue to invest for growth. While the carryover effect of the RWA diet makes it unfeasible for the full year, we do anticipate returning to positive operating leverage in the second half of 2024. The third point I'd like to highlight is about growth. Our strategies have been consistent, building out our Southeast markets, producing a strong fee to total revenue mix, and leveraging software that differentiates our product offerings and improves productivity. These are multi-year investments that cannot be replicated easily by competitors to one to two years of hiring a few new branches or small tuck-in acquisitions. In 2023, we opened 37 new branches concentrated in the Southeast, bringing us to 107 opened over the past five years. We plan to open another 31 branches in the Southeast in 2024. As a portfolio, these branches have continued to outperform our expectations on both household acquisition and deposit growth and should provide a tailwind for several years forward. We also continue to invest in treasury management, wealth and asset management, and capital markets. All three of these businesses grew for us in 2023. We expect mid-to-high single-digit growth in each in 2024. In treasury management, our acquisitions of Rize and Big Data Healthcare and the launch of Newline, our embedded payments business, should continue to support peer-leading performance. In wealth and asset management, Global Finance recently named our Private Bank as the Best US Regional Private Bank for the fifth consecutive year and Best Private Bank for Entrepreneurs globally for the first time. In our capital markets business, we have seen more robust activity levels to start the year, including an M&A pipeline that is 1.5 times the full-year revenue target embedded in our guidance. Overall, we expect 2024 to be a solid year of improving revenue trends and continued to expense discipline. Given what we believe to be a less certain outlook than the markets would imply, we are positioned to perform well under a range of economic and interest rate scenarios. Before, I hand it over to Bryan, I want to say thank you to our employees for hustling to deliver great results in 2023 and for the job you do every day to take care of our customers and communities. You make our company a special place for this. With that, I'll now turn it over to Bryan to provide additional details on our fourth quarter results and our current outlook for 2024. Bryan Preston : Thanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. 2023 was a very different year than what we were expecting 12 months ago. For Fifth Third, our success in outperforming this year was driven by our intentional actions to create and maintain flexibility for navigating uncertainty. As we enter 2024, we are very pleased with the results from 2023 and how we continue to be well-positioned for a wide range of economic outcomes. We have optionality in our balance sheet and diversification on our business mix that will allow us to adapt to changing environments. As Tim mentioned, achieving this positioning requires discipline and years of deliberate investments. Our full-year financial performance in 2023 benefited from this long-term investment. Fifth Third delivered industry-leading deposit growth of 5%, record revenue of $8.7 billion, and 100 basis points of capital accretion during the year, all while maintaining expense and credit discipline. We delivered another solid quarter to end the year. Adjusting for the FDIC special assessment and the other discrete items listed on page two of our release, return on assets was 1.3%, RoTCE was 17%, and our efficiency ratio was 55%. Additionally, we completed our risk-weighted asset diet in the fourth quarter, which reduced RWA by 3%, which was a little more than we previously estimated. The diet combined with our strong earnings led to a nearly 50 basis point increase in CET1 during the quarter, which ended at 10.3%. This capital accretion combined with the rally in market rates during the fourth quarter resulted in our pro forma CET1 ratio including the AOCI impact from unrealized losses on AFS securities, increasing to 7.7% at year-end, well above the 7% minimum. Net interest income for the quarter was $1.4 billion, which was consistent with our expectations. While NII continues to be impacted by the increasing cost of deposits, due to higher market interest rates. We've been able to build a robust liquidity position by generating peer-leading core deposit growth. Our core interest-bearing deposit costs increased 24 basis points sequentially, reflecting a cycle-to-date interest-bearing core deposit beta of 54% in the fourth quarter. We believe maintaining significant liquidity on balance sheet. It's a prudent decision given the uncertain economic and regulatory environments. Our short-term investments, which are primarily comprised of our cash at the Fed increased $8.6 billion in the fourth quarter on an average basis and drove all of the 13 basis points sequential decrease in NIM. Excluding the impacts of securities gains losses and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest income increased 3% sequentially due to the growth in commercial banking, mortgage, wealth, and card and processing revenues. As well as the normal fourth quarter impact of the CRA. The growth in commercial banking fees was driven by strong institutional brokerage and improved corporate bond fees, partially offset by lower lease from marketing revenue. Fourth quarter non-interest income was also impacted by the decision to eliminate our extended overdraft fee, which was the driver of the decrease in service charges on deposits. Compared to the prior year, non-interest income decreased 3%, primarily due to a $25 million reduction in CRA revenue. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 2% sequentially, primarily driven by the impact of the non-qualified deferred compensation mark-to-market, which is mostly offset in securities gains losses. Excluding the impact of the NQDC mark, which was a $17 million expense in the fourth quarter compared to a $5 million benefit in the prior quarter, expenses were flat sequentially. Compared to the prior year, fourth quarter expenses were down 1%, which reflects our ongoing commitment to expense discipline, Tim mentioned earlier. Moving to the balance sheet. As expected, total average portfolio loans and leases decreased 2% sequentially. Most significantly driven by the 3% decrease in average total commercial loans. Our corporate banking business experienced the biggest reduction due to the RWA diet. With period-end, corporate banking total commitments decreasing 6% and unused commitments decreasing 4%. Period end, the commercial revolver utilization rate was 35%, a 1% decrease from the prior quarter. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases decreased 1% sequentially due to our intentional pullback in indirect auto and the overall slowdown in the residential mortgage originations given the rate environment, partially offset by growth from dividend finance. Average core deposits increased 3% sequentially, driven by the growth in interest checking, money market and customer CD balances. DDA migration is showing signs of deceleration with fourth quarter showing the smallest dollar decline in DDA balances since the onset of the rate hiking cycle, even when adjusting for normal seasonal strength at year-end. DDA as a percent of core deposits were 26% for the quarter compared to 28% in the prior quarter. In addition to the migration impact, this measure is negatively impacted by the strong interest-bearing core deposit growth from new consumer and commercial relationships. By segment, average commercial deposits increased 5% sequentially while both consumer and wealth deposits increased 1%. As a result of our balance sheet positioning, RWA diet and success growing deposits, we achieved a loan to core deposit ratio of 72% at year-end, which continues to rank as the best compared to our regional peers. As Tim mentioned, we ended the year with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 129%. The strong funding profile provides us with great flexibility as we enter 2024. Moving to credit. Asset quality trends remained strong and below historical averages. The net charge-off ratio was 32 basis points which was down nine basis points sequentially and consistent with our guidance. 30 to 89 day delinquencies are flat compared to the end of 2022, the NPA ratio increased eight basis points to 59 basis points, but remains below our 10-year average of 65 basis points. We will maintain our credit discipline, focusing on generating and maintaining granular high-quality relationships. In consumer, we remain focused on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained our conservative underwriting policies. However, we are beginning and expect to continue to see normalization of delinquency and credit loss trends from the historically low levels experienced over the last couple of years. From an overall credit risk management perspective, we continue to assess forward-looking client vulnerabilities based on firm specific and industry trends and closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higher for longer interest rates may cause stress. Moving to the ACL, while our reserve coverage increased one basis point sequentially to 2.12%, the ACL balance decreased by $41 million due to lower period-end loans, which was the primary driver of the release. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings. Our capital build is pacing ahead of the expectations we set at the beginning of the RWA diet. We are highly confident in our ability to build our CET1 ratio to 10.5% by June 2024. As Tim mentioned, on January 3rd, we made the decision to hold $12.6 billion of securities until maturity, resulting in the reclassification to HTM during 2024. This decision reduces the risk of potential capital volatility associated with investment security market price fluctuations under the proposed capital rules. We continue to expect improvement in the unrealized losses in our remaining AFS portfolio, resulting in approximately 32% of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of 2025 and approximately 66% by 2028, assuming the forward curve plays out. After the transfer to HTM, 65% of the remaining AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked out securities which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. We continue to believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level for our capital. And as Tim mentioned, we expect to resume share repurchases during the second half of 2024, assuming the economic environment remains stable and the capital rules are finalized, consistent with the NPR. Moving to our current outlook. We expect full year average total loans to be down 2% compared to 2023, with the decrease primarily driven by the impact of the RWA diet on commercial loans and indirect consumer as well as lower mortgage production due to the higher rate environment, partially offset by the continued growth of dividend and provide. While we expect full year average total loans to decrease, we expect average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Commercial balances are expected to be up low single-digits by the end of 2024 and dividend originations are projected between $2.5 billion and $3 billion for the full year. We are also assuming commercial revolver utilization remained stable. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect average total loan balances to be down 1%, again, driven by the full quarter impact of the RWA diet. Both commercial and consumer loans should be down around 1%. Dividend finance originations are projected to be $400 million to $500 million in the first quarter. Total loan balances should be relatively stable throughout the first quarter. We expect deposit growth to continue during 2024 with full year average core deposits increasing 2% to 3%. While we expect DDA migration to continue given the high absolute level of interest rates, the pace of migration will be sensitive to the path of the Fed funds rate in 2024. If rates remain at current levels, we could see the DDA mix dip below 25% by the fourth quarter of 2024. However, we would expect to show a more stable composition if the more aggressive rate cut forecast were to be realized. Shifting to the income statement. Given the impact of the RWA diet on average loan balances, and the impact of higher deposit costs, we expect full year NII to decrease 2% to 4%. Our forecast assumes our security portfolio remains relatively stable and our cash levels began a slow, but steady decrease throughout 2024. This outlook is consistent with the forward curve as of early January, which projected six total rate cuts. Given the uncertainty regarding the rate outlook, our balance sheet is positioned such that even with fewer rate cuts, such as the three cut scenario being projected by the FOMC, we would expect to see only a modest deterioration in our NII outlook and would still fall within our full year guidance of down 2% to 4%. We expect NII in the first quarter to be down 2% to 3% sequentially, reflecting the impact of the lower average loan balances, a lower day count in the quarter and higher deposit costs. Our current outlook assumes interest-bearing core deposit costs, which were 289 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2023, increase 5 to 10 basis points in the first quarter, a deceleration from the 24 basis point increase experienced in the fourth quarter. With rate cuts forecasted to begin in late March and continue through the end of the year, we would expect deposit costs to decrease throughout the remainder of 2024. Under this outlook, the terminal beta for the rising rate cycle would be in the mid-50s for interest-bearing core deposits. We continue to believe we are at our NIM trough in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, another quarter of outperformance in deposit growth resulting in a higher-than-expected cash position, while a good outcome could impact NIM by a few more basis points. Barring a significant change in economic outlook, we would expect NII to stabilize and then begin growing sequentially during the remainder of 2024. We expect adjusted noninterest income to be up 1% to 2% in 2024, reflecting continued growth in treasury management revenue, capital market fees and wealth and asset management revenue partially offset by the full year impact of the elimination of our extended overdraft fee. We expect mortgage origination will remain muted in 2024 and net servicing revenue to decrease modestly as the servicing portfolio UPB continues to amortize lower. Adjusted other noninterest income, which excludes the impact of the Visa total return swap, is expected to decline by over 15% as TRA revenue will decrease from $22 million in 2023 to $10 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, and we are not including any large onetime private equity gains in our forecast. We expect first quarter adjusted noninterest income to be down 3% to 4% compared to the fourth quarter excluding the impacts of the TRA, largely reflecting seasonal factors. Normal seasonal items include lower capital markets activity and M&A activity partially offset by seasonal strength in wealth from tax planning. We expect full year adjusted noninterest expense to be up around 1% compared to 2023. Our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the mid to high single digits and sales force additions in middle market, treasury management and wealth. We will also close 29 branches in 2024 to offset costs associated with the 31 new branches opening in our high-growth Southeast markets. We expect first quarter total adjusted noninterest expense to be up around 8% compared to the fourth quarter. As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding the seasonal items, expenses would be flat in the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be down 1% to 2% and PPNR to decline in the 4% to 5% range. This outcome will result in an efficiency ratio of around 57% for the full year, a modest increase relative to 2023, driven by the decrease in NII. As Tim mentioned, we expect positive operating leverage in the second half of 2024 compared to the second half of 2023. Moving to credit, we continue to expect 2024 net charge-offs to be in the 35 to 45 basis point range as credit continues to normalize with first quarter net charge-offs in the 35 to 40 basis point range. As we return to loan growth, we expect to resume provision builds. Assuming no change to the economic outlook, loan growth and mix is expected to drive a $100 million to $150 million of provision build for the year, with the first quarter being in the $0 to $25 million range. The provision build over the last three quarters of the year should be fairly even. In summary, 2024 is expected to be a year of transition as we begin the shift to a rate cutting cycle with our well-positioned balance sheet, disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle, we will continue to generate long-term sustainable value for shareholders, customers, communities and employees. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call up for Q&A. Matt Curoe : Thanks, Bryan. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. A lot of good color on the NII expectations, so I appreciate that. I guess just within there, I think, Bryan, you noted your comment about deposit costs decreasing through the course of this year. Maybe a thought or two on how those trajectories will differ in your view between the commercial and the consumer portfolios. Bryan Preston : Thanks, Scott. Great question. We tell you that obviously similar to what we've seen from a rising rate perspective. The commercial and the wealth betas in particular, were -- have come through recently at a much higher level. We're in the range of probably low to high 80s from a beta perspective in both of those businesses. Cumulative betas have started to reach that point. So we're going to get a lot of repricing out of those portfolios as rates move lower. To give you a little bit of perspective, our indexed commercial deposits right now are up around $30 billion. So that gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to get some price out of that book. The consumer book is one that the betas -- the cumulative betas in that book is kind of in the mid-30s right now. It certainly moved up from a marginal perspective and we continue to have a lot of optionality between our promos and exceptions as well as what we've done from a CD perspective. We're going to be able to get rate cuts out of those portfolios as well. Our CD book, which is $10 billion now is fairly evenly laddered across the year with about 25% maturities across each quarter. We've been very careful as part of our pricing strategy to make sure that we could be able to reprice those down quickly as the rate environment were to change. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Thank you. And then separately, so given that you're done with the RWA mitigation efforts, it sounds like you've got the option to be on your front foot to the extent that you choose to be going into the year. Just sort of curious what your expectation is in terms of loan demand as the year plays out. Timothy Spence : Yes. Scott, it's Tim. I'll take that one. I mean, look, when we talk to customers today, I think in general, they're cautious but not pessimistic. So rates in the election uncertainty are definitely weighing on the appetite for new investments in the near term. I don't know of anybody who stopped an existing program or an existing investment, but they are being very careful about new expansion. So I don't expect that we're going to see a big pickup in loan demand. And I'm sure we'll get a question later on the economy. We're not expecting robust growth to drive the top line there. It's going to have to come from market share gains. So -- in our world, the key areas of investment there are very clearly in the middle market, where we have been very focused in driving more granularity into the C&I portfolio. Our middle market loan production this past year was nearly 50-50 split between the Midwest markets, including Chicago and then the Southeast markets and our expansion markets in California and Texas. And our sales force in those locations across the entire footprint is going to be up about 20% over a three-year period here for 2024. So we've got a good pent-up sales capacity there and high activity levels that will drive the outcome. And then I think the other area of strength has been in the health care and telecom, media and technology verticals. And then in the fintech platforms, right, the continued seasoning in of both provide and dividend portfolios. The last thing is the absence of a negative here, which is the auto business, our deliberate rundown of the outstandings in the auto business have created a little bit of a drag on loan growth. And the combination of credit unions being a little bit more funding constrained than all the banks who exited have created a much more favorable environment for auto originations. So we expect volumes there to come up. We're generating volume today with a weighted average FICO north of 780 and very attractive risk-adjusted spreads and that should stop the headwind and give us a more stable platform from which we'll get growth through the rest of the year. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay, great color. Thank you very much. Timothy Spence : Absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Tim. Hi, Bryan. Bryan Preston : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Congratulations, Bryan, on a new role. And if Jamie is listening, congratulations to him as well. Bryan Preston : Worse than that, Gerard, Jamie is here. Gerard Cassidy : I hear that laugh. That's great. Here's like and you touched on it Tim about the economy -- many of the banks, you as well, are following the forward curve for rates, which is understandable. And there continuing to be signs that the US economy is proving more resilient than we all expected. And so the question is this for the upcoming year, what if we're all wrong -- and all of a sudden, we see 2% plus real GDP growth, the Fed doesn't move on rates, maybe one or two cuts like what we saw in '95. And credit remains even better. How does that affect the way you approach what you've set up for '24? I know Bryan gave us some color on the different interest rate scenarios. But wants just come into this year, at the end of this year, it proves to be much stronger than any of us are expecting and inflation stays around 3%. Timothy Spence : Yes. I'll leave it to Bryan to provide more detail, drag. But I'm glad you asked that question because if there is one frustration, I have, in particular, on the way that the media is reporting on economic activity is the treating the world like it's deterministic and it's not, right? It's stochastic in terms of the outcomes here and while you can see the slowdown in inflation, you can see some slowdown in the economy, in particular, in specific sectors. It's just hard to be certain, given the impact of deficit spending and the way that has continued to provide a buffer against any consumer slowdown. And I think the possibility that maybe we return to a world where recessions in the US are regional as opposed to being national phenomenon, which I think people have forgotten about because of the last two were driven by global health pandemic and a global financial crisis. So we're trying to run the company in a way that provides an outlook on the expected outcomes in the middle of the distribution, but that manages to a much more stable return profile in the event we get into either of the tails, right, more robust economic growth, stickier inflation on one side of the equation and therefore, the Fed not being able to come off of its restrictive policies and stuff. And the other alternative, where I think you have to say you have some sort of a geopolitical event that creates a price shock and energy or another supply chain issue or otherwise, which could trigger an unexpected slowdown. So Bryan, maybe a little color on the upside. Bryan Preston : Yes, absolutely. I think the scenario that you're laying out there with fewer Fed cuts, continued strength from an economic perspective, that's not a remote scenario in our view. We feel like that is something that could very easily happen, especially in the first half of the year as we continue to see potentially some strong resiliency from the consumers. What that means for us, and it's a big part of the actions that we've taken thus far is that we think that could cause the long end of the curve to move up a little bit, that would actually be beneficial for us as we get an even greater benefit from the fixed rate asset repricing. We've talked previously that full year impact of fixed rate asset repricing should generate about $300 million of annualized run rate NII improvement. And that number would look even better if we saw that long and move up. It also is part of the rationale associated with shifting some of our securities into HTM. So a stronger economy is one that we're actually would obviously always hope for because we're very well positioned for that. To quote Jamie, you can't spell flexibility without FITB. That's something that we have been very focused on and recognizing that we can be wrong on both sides, the economy weaker or stronger, and we're well positioned for that. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. And then another bigger picture question, Tim. I think you touched on your middle market business, customers grew 11% year-over-year. And then later in the comments, I think you said that you got to take these customers or clients from maybe other banks. How are you guys doing that? And then if you could tie it into that loan-to-deposit ratio, I think you guys said you're at 72%. What's the ideal level that you eventually like to get to? Thank you. Timothy Spence : Yes. I mean I think it's a combination of things, Gerard. The first one is we've been very deliberate to select a few places and invest multiyear when we think about how we invest strategically, right? So the Southeast is obviously a key point of focus there. And I know a lot of people are investing in the Southeast, but it bears reminding that we've been in nearly every one of the markets down there for more than 15 years. And we're not running small LPOs. We have more than 200 client-facing people in those markets across commercial banking and wealth management alone. And then like another 1,700 that said in more than 300 branches. And the brand is seeded in those markets. So those investments when you make them, you make the investment in year one, but they don't actually hit the sort of peak benefit until year five or six. So you have this accumulation I guess a coiled spring for lack of a better term that supports then more sustained growth. We have the same benefit in the Midwest in Chicago, in particular. I mean, we added nearly 100 new quality relationships in Chicago in the middle market alone last year and have been gaining share pretty steadily at least if you use the FDIC deposit share measures as the guide. In Chicago because we're still seeing the benefits that we got out of the combination between Fifth Third and MB in those markets. The other area that we are winning, where we win is through the strength of the treasury management and the capital markets platform, which really is a middle market-focused offering for Fifth Third. About 1/3 of the new quality relationships we added in treasury management last year were treasury management only. So as opposed to being a follow-on product that you deliver into a customer that you lend money to, they're actually contributing to the relationship acquisition. And that's an engine that just wouldn't have existed here in the past, and I think still doesn't exist inside most of our peers. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Timothy Spence : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hey, I'll ask a question about the quarter, then requeue for bigger picture question. But what you don't hear too many regionals talking about buybacks like you are right now. So -- but you have a lot of numbers you're tossing out there. You have a 7% CET1 minimum, 7.7%, 10.5% by mid-year. It might be better on the buyback of $300 million to $400 million depending on the rules. So I guess, I just want to be a little more concrete. So -- are you sure that you want to be talking about buybacks as much as you are now? And what gives you confidence in doing so? And then the other side of that is you say if the rules get eased, then you might be able to buy back more than the $300 million to $400 million. So just give us the kind of the whole range of options, if you could. Bryan Preston : Yes, Mike. And what we would tell you on the buybacks and in particular, on the rule, the -- there's a lot -- there appears to be momentum associated with some relief on both the ops risk side and the credit risk RWA. As we've continued to refine our estimate from an RWA perspective, the rule as proposed is a low single-digit impact from an RWA perspective. And almost seven points of RWA is created by the ops risk rule. So if that is pared back, we could actually see our RWA go down under the new rule, which obviously creates a lot of incremental capacity for us as we think about how much capital we need to help run the company from a long-term perspective. Additionally, we have a lot of confidence in the stability of the capital ratios going forward and the pace at which we're accreting capital, that in combined with the actions that we've taken from a security portfolio perspective to de-risk the portfolio with the HCM election as well as just the continued benefit that we're going to get from roll-in on the remaining AFS portfolio. It just puts us in a position where we are going to have a lot of capital generation and a lot of ability to have flexibility to return capital if the organic growth opportunities aren't there. Timothy Spence : Yes. And Mike, I think the one thing I would add to what Bryan said we've tried to be very clear and transparent that our belief is it's always better if you have to make a change to adapt to new regulation, it's better to get there first. We did that as it related to consumer deposit fees, right, and very deliberate about being early there because we just viewed those profit pools as being unsustainable. I think we were clear this past summer and through the fall and winter that our intention on putting ourselves on the RWA diet and focusing as much as we did on building liquidity was that we wanted to get to the rules there first because of the flexibility that it provided. So we ended the year at roughly 10.3 in terms of the CET1. We said we wanted to get to 10.5. We'll get there just based on the current run rate in the middle of the second quarter, you had to pick a particular spot. And that gives us then the ability to return to share repurchases subject to the environment not changing, maybe a little bit earlier than others. Mike Mayo : And a short follow-up. So Basel III gets gutted, I guess, not a high probability, but some have mentioned that recently, then your RWAs, obviously, would be flat. So you might be better off if they change the ops rule -- and it passes. Did I get that right? Timothy Spence : Yes. Bryan Preston : Other than if it truly gets gutted and the AOCI impact, that would be a better option than even if ops risk rule got gutted, so. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. Timothy Spence : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess two questions. One, first on trying to make sense of the loan-to-deposit ratio at 70% relative to Fifth-Third's history prior to the pandemic. And even relative to some of your peers -- is a 70% loan-to-deposit ratio, the new normal for the bank or trying to understand if there's anything idiosyncratic about the deposit base that requires you to hold and operate with a lower loan-to-deposit ratio. Timothy Spence : Great question. I would tell you that 72% is not our long-term target, but I would say that our loan-to-deposit ratio has come down relative to pre-pandemic levels. And a big portion of that is just heightened expectations regarding liquidity. So I would expect us to operate in the mid-70s more than likely from a long-term perspective with loan-to-deposit. We were probably mid-80s pre-pandemic. So that is something that we would expect to continue. But we do think that we can move up from the current levels. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess a separate question maybe for Tim. I think you tried to sort of draw some distance between you and some of your peers around the Southeast technology investments. If we take those statements and account for how do you think this should reflect into should fiscal become a higher growth bank relative to these banks, a more efficient bank? Like what should we be measuring you against and do we start seeing that this year and next year? Or is this more of a longer-term process? Timothy Spence : Yes, great question Ebrahim. And I think maybe a nuance, I'm less trying to draw a distinction between us and others than I am to say that you can't get what we think we have in terms of the advantages overnight, right? They're not advantages that can be built in one to two years. They require a steady and consistent investment, which, of course, has been the philosophy here, along with the belief that you have to find ways to self-fund it through efficiency and better productivity along the way. And I'm hesitant to say Fifth Third is going to be a growth bank because I think four or five of the people who are described as growth banks failed this past year. Our belief, though, is that great companies should be able to take market share on an organic basis. So if you assume that the base market growth is somewhere around 2% or at least the financial services sector should be able to track GDP. There's a headwind with the emergence of all of these nonbank competitors. Therefore, the more realistic goal from my perspective is to try to beat GDP by a couple of percentage points on an annualized basis, which probably means you need to have 3% to 4% outsized growth relative to your market. These granular investments we're making across the Southeast are definitely part of the way that matriculates in the performance. I think the other place then you should expect to see it, given where we're investing is continued support for a better fees to total revenue mix, which is going to be really critically important in the event that the rules as they are proposed do pass because of the impact that higher capital and liquidity requirements are going to have. And you're seeing that today. The core Fifth Third consumer franchise, if you just look at household acquisition as a measure is outgrowing Midwest population growth by about 1.5% per year. It's outgrowing the Southeast markets by about four percentage points per year. So you can see the impact of the incremental investment, if you just disaggregate our business and look at it on a market-by-market basis. Jamie, maybe you want to add something here? James Leonard : Yes, Ebrahim, on maybe to tie your two questions together, on the loan-to-deposit ratio, part of the improvement has been the strong deposit growth we've been able to get both from the RWA diet, which I talked about a couple of quarters ago, just how customer reaction resulted in more deposits and a better share of wallet. And that continued in the fourth quarter and commercial deposits, you see in the numbers are up nicely. And then on the Southeast, we actually grew deposits in the Southeast, 5% just in the fourth quarter. And so you do get that growth in the numbers, but the Midwest still grew in total about 1%. So we've got a very nice balance here of Midwest and Southeast. And I was down in South Carolina on Wednesday, we opened our 10th branch in South Carolina this week and have plans to do 25 more over the next five years. So I think you'll continue to see the benefits of the investments over the last three years as we continue to really expand that Southeast presence. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open. Nicholas Holowko : Good morning. This is Nick Holowko on for Erika. I think in the past, you've talked about a curve where the front end is in the low 3% range as an ideal rate environment for the bank. Is that still the right way to think about it? And if we get to that range, do you think we could see NIM migrate back to the 3.20% to 3.30% range that you're producing back in the 2018, 2019 period. Thank you. Bryan Preston : Yes, absolutely. We're turning to a normal curve where we would have, I'd say, a 3% front end and maybe 100 to 200 basis points of spread between the front end and the 10-year rate is a very ideal environment for us because, one, we are going to get the benefit of deposit repricing lower, and at the same time, still being able to pick up a lot of benefit associated with that fixed rate asset repricing. So being able to achieve a 3.20% plus NIM in that kind of scenario, a year or two forward would be something that would be easily -- that should be very easily achievable, and we feel good about that environment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Congrats, Bryan and Jamie. A couple of quick questions for you guys. One is in your NII outlook that you've given for the year, what are you assuming for deposit betas on the way down. Sorry if I missed that, trying to keep an eye on bunch of different releases this morning. Bryan Preston : Glad you asked the question. It's the first time it's come off, actually, and it wasn't in our scripted remarks. We are expecting betas on the way down to look very similar to what we saw in the last couple of hikes which is in a 60% to 70% range. We don't expect a significant difference in betas between like the first cut and the third cut. You're still at such a high level that, that beta should be relatively high from a marginal perspective. Our rate risk disclosures, we talk about, say, 60% to 65% beta on the way down. We tend to be a little bit conservative on those disclosures. So we think we're going to be able to deliver that, if not a little bit better. Vivek Juneja : Great. Another little one. Other consumer loans, the NPLs moved up quite a bit linked quarter to a little over 1%. Any color is that coming from dividend finance? Or is that something else? James Leonard : Yes. It's Jamie, Vivek. Yes, it is actually from dividend finance. And the driver of that -- there's some element that's just normalization as you go through growing a new company, but that's a smaller part of it. The larger part of it of the increase is actually from our decision to deliver a good customer experience for the borrowers that have had instances where there are delays in getting the solar panel installations to receive permission to operate from the utilities that could also be delayed due to installer performance issues or supply chain shortages. So what we've elected to do is different forms of deferment or modification in order to assist the borrowers. And then I would expect this to improve over time as we continue to improve the installer network as well. Vivek Juneja : So not much loss content you'd expect from that, Jamie then, since it seems like you're deferring rather than that. James Leonard : There will be lost content in there. It is appropriately reserved, so not an income impact. But from a solar perspective, we continue to run solar losses around 1% or so. And as we talked about, our deal model was 130 basis points on solar. The challenge we've had from a loss content perspective has been on the home improvement side, where dividend had a subprime component to their portfolio that has higher losses. And we stopped originating that product back over a year ago. So there will be some loss content, but I don't think you would see it impacting income. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was wondering if you guys can elaborate a bit on the commercial real estate exposure. Obviously, it's a bit less than peers. And as you noted, no charge-offs last year, but your nonperformers are also into this event and even the office criticized is a relatively low 6% compared to others. So how is it so good? And I guess, are you confident that the marks and estimates are up to date. Thank you. Greg Schroeck : Yes, it's Greg. Great question. So yes, very confident in our marks and where we currently are. Also very, very comfortable with the overall asset quality. We've been, for the last several years, very disciplined in terms of our client selection. We're underwriting commercial real estate, specifically office at something below 60% loan to value. We've got 90% recourse on that portfolio. And so our borrowers are continuing to exhibit the right behaviors. They're supporting their projects. They're writing checks to reduce the debt as necessary. We're out ahead of that portfolio. The maturities are evenly split over the next four to five years. We don't have that so-called wall of maturities that we've heard from some other banks and you've heard in the marketplace. So I do feel very good about the overall portfolio, our office included. Matt O'Connor: And then just more broadly speaking, obviously, the overall charge-off outlook for this year is fairly benign 35 to 45 basis points. Any more color in terms of drivers of call it, the midpoint of that range versus 2023 levels? Greg Schroeck : I think we're going to continue to see a lot of what we saw in 2024 with what we saw in 2023, right? We don't have any significant trends geographically or by product. And so what we saw in 2023 was a little bit more episodic. And based on what we're seeing on the C&I side right now, I mean, our borrowers have done a nice job both on the executing on the revenue expense management side, there's obviously margin compression. But overall, as Tim said earlier, they're looking for the same things we're looking for, which is what is the Fed going to do and when. We hear a lot about labor costs, so they're keeping their eye on that. So I think we're going to have a lot of the same old same old, certainly as we get into the first and second quarters in terms of what we're seeing both from a loss content and commercial real estate minimal and C&I, right? We will have a name pop up every once in a while we'll deal with it. But again, we're not seeing trends that would lead me to believe that our criticized assets -- our overall asset quality is going to move much from where it is right now. Again, as we sit here today heading into the first quarter. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open. Christopher Marinac : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Can you remind us how the commercial C&I DDAs behave on a down rate environment? And is there any reason to believe that they wouldn't kind of behave positively in your favor this time? Bryan Preston : Yes, absolutely. We would expect DDAs to especially the migration to stop migrating into interest-bearing and begin growing as rates cuts begin to occur. We talked about that a little bit in the scripted remarks that if we were to see more aggressive cuts, we'd see some opportunity there. We've typically modeled somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion of DDA migration per 100 basis points of rate hikes or rate cuts. We'd expect that to be a fairly similar migration level on up or down, just positive or negative. We would tell you that probably the beginning cut or two, maybe it's a little bit slower, but if you were to see a much more aggressive path, and if the Fed funds rate got down into the 3s, we would expect a decent reversal. Christopher Marinac : Got it. That makes sense. Thank you, Bryan, and then just a quick follow-up on reserve build -- would you still build reserves kind of within the current level we have today? I'm just trying to compare the guide of 35 to 40 basis points in the average life of the portfolio is less than four. There's really strong coverage. So just curious if you would build that same level. Bryan Preston : Yes. As long as the economic scenario is similar and the mix of the portfolio, obviously, is very important in terms of what drives a build. Certainly, dividend, some of the things that we're talking about from an auto perspective, where can carry a little bit more reserve that has an impact from a build perspective that drives more of the dollar built than anything else at this point. Christopher Marinac : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Bryan Preston : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Matt Curoe for some closing remarks. Matt Curoe : Thank you, JL and thanks, everyone, for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. JL, you can now disconnect the call. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand over the call to Matt Curoe. You may now begin the conference. Matt Curoe : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's first quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, our Chairman, CEO and President, Tim Spence, and CFO, Bryan Preston, will provide an overview of our first quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of April 19, 2024. And Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Bryan, we will open up the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim. Tim Spence : Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe that great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate challenging ones. In that sense, the uncertainty we face in the current environment provides us with an opportunity to demonstrate that our focus on stability, profitability and growth in that order will produce consistently strong, some might even say boring, financial results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.70, or $0.76 excluding the Visa, Mastercard settlement litigation charges and the additional FDIC special assessment. All major income statement captions were in line with or better than the guidance that we provided in our January earnings call. Our adjusted return on equity and return on assets are the highest of all peers who have reported thus far and the most stable when compared to results from the first quarter of 2023. We grew period-end deposits compared to the prior quarter and generated annualized consumer household growth of 3%, punctuated by 7% growth in our Southeast markets. Since 2018, we have built more than 100 de novo branches in the Southeast. As a portfolio, they are exceeding our expectations, having achieved 112% of their household growth goals and 132% of the deposit goals built into the business cases. Florida is our top performing de novo market, with deposit dollars at 195% in gold. J.D. Power also recently named Fifth Third number one for retail banking customer satisfaction in the Florida market. Importantly, net interest margins improved in the quarter, driven by stabilizing deposit costs with interest-bearing deposit costs increasing only 1 basis point sequentially. Consistent with our guidance last year, the fourth quarter of 2023 marked the low point for NIM and we believe the first quarter of 2024 will mark the low point for NII. While end-of-period loan balances were down 1% compared to the prior quarter, we saw solid middle market loan growth across our footprint with Tennessee, the Carolinas, Kentucky, Indiana and Texas achieving the strongest results. Our footprint continues to benefit in an outsized way from federal incentives to bolster investments in domestic manufacturing and energy infrastructure. The Midwest and Southeast have received more investment per capita than other US regions in industries as diverse as multimodal logistics, semiconductors, batteries and pet food. Treasury management and wealth and asset management were the strongest contributors to fee income, driven by the strategic investments we have been making in both areas. Treasury management revenue grew 11% year-over-year, driven by our software-enabled managed services payments offerings, and Newline, our embedded payments business. Over one-third of the new treasury management relationships added in the quarter were payments led and had no credit extended. Wealth and asset management fee revenues grew 10% year-over-year, highlighted by strong growth in Fifth Third Wealth Advisors. The RIA platform we launched in 2022, which recently crossed $1 billion in assets under management. Our credit performance remained stable, highlighted by continued strength in our commercial real estate portfolio. We posted another quarter of zero net charge-offs in CRE and have less than $3 million of NPAs in our non-owner-occupied portfolio. While we expect that broader credit trends will continue to normalize, our emphasis on client selection and credit discipline helps to ensure that we have a well-diversified portfolio, not overly concentrated in any asset class, industry or geography. Expenses are well controlled. Adjusted for discrete items highlighted in the release, expenses declined 1% year-over-year driven by savings realized through process automation and our focus on value streams. Expense discipline is what has allowed us to make the long-term investments in our business necessary to generate superior returns and operating leverage through the cycle. Looking forward to the rest of the year, we remain cautious given the wide range of potential economic and geopolitical scenarios that could materialize. Depending on how you read the most recent data, inflation is either sticky at 3%, slowly moving down to 2%, or moving back up past 4%. Geopolitical tensions remain elevated and deficit spending, green energy investments and the domestication of supply chains are all inherently inflationary in the medium term. We believe the best way to manage in uncertain times is to stay liquid, stay neutrally positioned and stay broadly diversified while investing with the long-term in mind. That is what we intend to do. I want to thank our employees. Your hustle, heart and dedication are why we've been recognized thus far in 2024 as one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune, one of the Best Brands for Customer Service by Forbes, and one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere. Thank you for keeping our shareholders, customers and communities at the center of everything we do. With that, I'll now turn it over to Bryan to provide additional details on our first quarter results and our current outlook for 2024. Bryan Preston : Thanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. Our first quarter results were a strong start to the year, reflecting our balance sheet strength, disciplined expense and credit risk management and diversified fee revenue streams. We saw new household growth accelerate and new quality relationships in commercial post steady gains. For over a year, we have highlighted the importance of maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility in an uncertain economic and interest rate environment. Our first quarter results evidence the strength of our current position, which should produce strong and stable returns across a wide range of economic outcomes. This approach has served us well as rate cut expectations are pushed out. As Tim mentioned, our profitability remains strong as we have the highest ROA and ROE, and among the best efficiency ratios of our peers that have reported to date in a quarter in which we have outsized seasonal compensation expenses. On a year-over-year basis, we were the most stable for both ROA and ROE, and among the most stable for NII and the efficiency ratio. Our consistent and strong earnings added 15 basis points to CET1 during the quarter inclusive of absorbing 8 basis points impact from the CECL phase in. Turning to the income statement. Net interest income for the quarter was $1.4 billion and consistent with our expectations. Interest-bearing deposit costs were well managed and increased only 1 basis point compared to the prior quarter. The balance sheet continues to be reflective of defensive positioning with optionality to navigate the changing economic and interest rate environments. Net interest margin improved 1 basis point for the quarter. Increased yields on new production of fixed rate consumer loans and day count benefits contribute to the growth and were partially offset by the deposit balance migration from demand to interest-bearing accounts. This increase in NIM is the first sequential improvement since the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding the impacts of security gains and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest income decreased 1% from a year ago quarter due to lower revenue in commercial banking, leasing and mortgage, partially offset by strong growth in treasury management and wealth and asset management fees, where both saw double-digit revenue growth over the prior year. The securities gains of $10 million reflected the mark-to-market impact of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which is more than offset in compensation expense. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 1% compared to the year ago quarter due to our continued focus on expense discipline and the ongoing benefits from our process automation efforts. While expenses are down versus the prior year, we continue to invest in opening new branches and increase marketing spend to drive household growth. Adjusted non-interest expense increased 8% sequentially as expected due to seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes in addition to $15 million of expense from the previously mentioned non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Moving to the balance sheet. Total average portfolio loans and leases decreased 1% sequentially. Average commercial portfolio loans decreased 2% due to lower demand from corporate banking borrowers and the average balance impact of last year's RWA diet, which reduced both total commitments and loan balances during the second half of 2023. Middle market loans increased during the quarter as we drive for more granularity and our winning private bank relationships. As Tim discussed, we saw solid middle market loan growth across our footprint. Period-end commercial revolver utilization was 36%, a 1% increase from the prior quarter, also driven by middle market. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially due to the overall slowdown in residential mortgage originations given the rate environment, offset by growth from solar energy installation loans and indirect auto originations. Average core deposits decreased 1% sequentially, driven primarily by normal seasonality within our business. Decreases in DDA balances and CDs were partially offset by increases in interest checking. By segment, average consumer deposits decreased 1% sequentially, while both commercial and wealth deposits were flat. Consumer deposits rebounded towards the end of the quarter to finish slightly higher than at the start of the quarter. As Tim mentioned, we are very pleased with the results of our multiyear Southeast branch investments, which are driving both strong household growth and granular insured deposits. DDA as a percent of core deposits was 25% as of the end of the first quarter compared to 26% in the prior quarter. Migration of DDA balances continued during the first quarter and we expect that trend to carry on in 2024, but at a slower pace than in prior quarters. We ended the quarter with full category 1 LCR compliance at 135% and our loan to core deposit ratio was 71%. The strong funding profile continues to provide us with great flexibility. Moving to credit. Asset quality trends remained well behaved and below historical averages. The net charge-off ratio was 38 basis points, which was up 6 basis points sequentially and consistent with our guidance. The ratio of early stage loan delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased 2 basis points sequentially to 29 bps. The NPA ratio increased 5 basis points to 64 basis points. We have maintained our credit discipline by generating and maintaining granular high-quality relationships and by managing concentration risks to any asset class, region or industry. In consumer, our focus remains on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained our conservative underwriting policies. We continue to see the expected normalization of delinquency and credit loss trends from the historically low levels experienced over the last couple of years. From an overall credit risk management perspective, we assess forward-looking client vulnerabilities based on firm-specific and industry trends and closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higher for longer interest rates may cause stress. Moving to the ACL. Our reserve coverage ratio remained unchanged at 2.12% and included a $16 million reserve release, driven by lower end-of-period loan balances and modest improvements in the economic scenarios. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings. Moving to capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.44% and we continue to believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level. As a reminder, at the beginning of the quarter, we moved $12.6 billion of securities to held to maturity. This represented one quarter of our AFS portfolio and was done when the five- and 10-year treasury rates were below 4%. The move reduced AOCI volatility to capital due to our investment portfolio by around 50% during the first quarter. Our pro forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the AFS securities portfolio, is 7.8%. We expect improvement in the unrealized securities losses in our portfolio given that 60% of the AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked-out securities, which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. Approximately 26% of the AOCI related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025 and approximately 62% by the end of 2028 assuming the forward curve plays out. Moving to our current outlook. We expect full year average total loans to be down 2% compared to 2023, consistent with our prior expectations. The decrease is primarily driven by the impact of the 2023 RWA diet on average balances as well as lower mortgage production due to the higher interest rate environment. While we expect full year average total loans to decrease, we expect average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2024 to be up 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, with both commercial and consumer balances up low single-digits by the end of 2024. We are also assuming commercial revolver utilization remains stable. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect average total loan balances to be stable. We expect softness in commercial due to uncertainty on the interest rate and economic outlooks to be offset by consumer loan growth, which is expected to be up due to solar and auto originations. Our retail household growth and commercial payments growth remained robust in the first quarter, and those outcomes will drive deposit growth in 2024. However, we are mindful of potential economic and market headwinds for monetary policy. Therefore, we are forecasting full year average core deposit growth of only 2% to 3% compared to our 5% growth realized in 2023. While we expect DDA migration to continue given the high absolute level of interest rates, the pace of migration has declined. If rates remain at current levels, we expect to see the DDA mix dip below 25% during the middle of the year. Shifting to the income statement. Given the stabilization in our deposit costs and the benefit we are seeing from the repricing of our fixed rate loan book, we continue to expect the full year NII to decrease 2% to 4%, and as Tim mentioned, we expect the NII and NIM trough is behind us. This outlook is consistent with the forward curve as of early April, which projected three total cuts. However, our balance sheet is neutrally positioned so that even with zero cuts in 2024, we expect stability in our NII outlook. The primary risk to our NII performance would be a reacceleration of deposit competition. Our forecast also assumes our cash and other short-term investments, which ended the quarter at over $25 billion, remain relatively stable throughout the remainder of 2024. We expect NII in the second quarter to be stable to up 1% sequentially, reflecting the impact of slowing deposit cost pressures and the benefit of our fixed rate loan repricing. Our current outlook assumes interest-bearing deposit costs, which were 291 basis points in the first quarter of 2024, would increase about 6 basis points sequentially if we see no rate cuts. We expect adjusted non-interest income to be up 1% to 2% in 2024, consistent with our prior guidance, reflecting growth in treasury management, capital market fees and wealth and asset management revenue. We expect second quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 2% to 4% compared to the first quarter, largely reflecting higher commercial banking revenue. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect full year adjusted non-interest expense to be up 1% compared to 2023. Our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the mid-single digits and sales force additions in middle market, treasury management and wealth. We will also open 30 to 35 new branches in our higher-growth markets and close a similar number of branches in 2024. We expect second quarter total adjusted non-interest expense to be down approximately 6% compared to the first quarter due to the seasonal compensation and benefits cost in the first quarter. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be down 1% to 2% and PPNR to decline in the 4% to 5% range. This outcome will result in an efficiency ratio of around 57% for the full year, a modest increase relative to 2023, driven by the decrease in NII. We continue to expect positive operating leverage in the second half of 2024. Our outlook for 2024 net charge-offs remains in the 35 basis point to 45 basis point range as credit continues to normalize, with second quarter net charge-offs also in the 35 basis point to 45 basis point range. We expect to resume provision builds in connection with loan growth assuming no change to the economic outlook. Loan growth and mix is expected to drive a $75 million to $100 million build for the full year with the second quarter build being approximately zero to $25 million. As we mentioned last quarter, our consistent and strong earnings provides us the flexibility to resume share repurchases of $300 million to $400 million in the second half of 2024, including $100 million to $200 million in the third quarter, assuming a stable economic and credit outlook and capital rules that are no worse than the current NPR. In summary, with our well-positioned balance sheet, disciplined expense and credit risk management and diversified revenue growth, we will continue to generate long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, customers, communities and employees. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open up the call for Q&A. Matt Curoe : Thanks, Bryan. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : Hi. Can you hear me? Tim Spence : We can. Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hey. I'm just trying to figure out how you get away with interest-bearing deposit cost going up only 1 basis point quarter-over-quarter when the group is like around up 10 basis points? And I mean, is this sustainable? Is it due to your tech? Is it because of your Southeast expansion? What's your secret here, or maybe it's just ways to bite you in future quarters? Thanks. Bryan Preston : Thank, Mike. It's Bryan. Great question. I think one of the things on this front, we very early last year made the decision to grow deposits very aggressively. We viewed it as a very consistent theme with being focused on the long-term, focused on stability, and quite honestly, focused on returns. We viewed it as worst case. We're going to generate some low cost wholesale funding with no prepayment penalties. Best case, it gave us an opportunity to have 12 million interactions with prospects and customers. And we have a lot of confidence in our ability to win relationships, when we can get our team in front of our customers. And so with that, as we've moved into this more stable environment, there clearly was some costs as we brought those promo balances in, but it gives us an ability to actually manage and recycle interest expense where we're able to pulse offers through different markets, where we can basically harvest some savings and reintroduce that back into interest expense on new offers and ultimately have a lower net overall cost. We just feel like it's being very efficient with every dollar we're utilizing. As I mentioned in the guidance, there's certainly some risk that the competition can reaccelerate, but it does feel like overall deposit competition did soften at the end of last year and that continued to [indiscernible]. Mike Mayo : And just to follow up, I mean, you are expanding share in the Southeast. You said you went from, what, 8% to 6% year-over-year. I mean, don't you need to price competitively and offer higher rates to gain that share? Tim Spence : We definitely took advantage of the fact that we have I think at this point with the investments that have been made down there, Mike, a higher natural share than we did existing market share rights. So, we were able to use the Southeast as a mechanism to raise deposits without repricing existing relationships to the same degree that we would have if we were using those rate offers in markets where we had high existing shares. I think though, what's important is that what's driving the growth in the Southeast is the household growth. And those relationships are that vast majority momentum banking relationships, which means the core deposit product is a non-interest-bearing deposit product. So, the 7% growth in the Southeast when you break it apart, the research triangle is like 25% year-over-year. Most of the major markets in Florida were in the mid to high teens, Tampa 11% or 12%, Broward County and north in Southeast Florida 17%, 18% year-over-year household growth rates. So, we're gaining share in a way that then allows us to make decisions about whether we want to move more of the deposit wallet where obviously rate is part of it, or where then we have the opportunity to introduce the fee-based businesses on the consumer side of the equation, and in commercial third of the relationships that we added in treasury managers, we mentioned this last quarter, were payments led. So, they're not driven by deposit rates or credit as the entry point. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Tim Spence : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Was hoping you could spend a moment discussing on demand trends in more detail. Kind of soft for the group, though, you noted some specific states that have generated stronger middle market growth. And then maybe within the response, if you could also please discuss the outlooks for the specialty businesses such as dividend and provide? Tim Spence : Yeah, sure. Happy to. I'll start that one, and if need be, Bryan can fill in here, Scott. So, I mean, listen, I think in general, the commentary we've provided about what we hear from clients is more or less the same. They are not pessimistic at that current point, but they're also not leaning forward in the saddle here, whether it's capital investments or pushing forward on M&A opportunities or building inventories or otherwise. The prospect we now face with rates being higher for longer definitely will weigh on plans. And so, I do expect that in general that if we're going to get growth, we have to get it principally through taking market share. I mean, the byproduct of that is that the places where we are expecting to see growth in the second half of the year are the places where we made investments to be able to do it. So, middle market C&I was strong in the first quarter. I gave a little bit of a breakout on the markets. A driver there in the Midwest and the Southeast both is the benefit that we get, the early benefit that you see from the federal stimulus programs on manufacturing, energy transition, infrastructure and otherwise, because our regions have gotten a disproportionate share of those dollars. I think in addition to that, we have a much larger sales force in the Southeast today than we did three years ago, and again the byproduct of that is we will continue to see an accretion of market share attached to those investments as those RMs become fully productive. Texas has been a really nice story for us. We've been in Texas for a little more than a decade now. We have I think it's 175 employees there roughly and it's a really nice complement to the strong commercial banking team that we built out in California a few years back in terms of expanding the middle market footprint. So, we expect to see growth in that area. And then lastly, on the industry vertical side, aerospace, defense, transportation and TMT are the places where the pipelines have -- we're seeing some pickup in the pipelines. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. And then, Bryan, I was hoping you could discuss -- I know that the numbers aren't huge here, but maybe you could discuss sort of the fluctuations in kind of reserve building versus reserve releasing outlook. I know it sounded like from your comments it'll be a little reserve build in connection with loan growth, but I think you were among the fewer sort of mid quarter when you said maybe a little release. So, just curious sort of the puts and takes as you see now. Bryan Preston : Yeah. Thanks, Scott. I think the main thing there is two items. For the guidance for the rest of the year, that is under the assumption that there is no change to the economic outlooks as provided by Moody's. A big driver of the release this quarter was the economic outlook from Moody's did get better. So that was a factor. We also had end-to-period decrease in loans sequentially. So that was an item that drove the release as well. Next quarter, we did guide to stability on loans. So that's what we're saying kind of zero to $25 million. Mix could cause a little bit of build, but we do expect end-of-period loan growth in the second half of the year and that's where you get the larger numbers. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay. Wonderful. Thank you very much. Operator : Next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital. Your line is now open. Gerard Cassidy : Hello. Can you hear me? Tim Spence : We can. There we are. Good morning, Gerard. We couldn't for a minute there. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Tim. Yeah, thank you. Bryan, just to pick up on your comments about Moody's and the outlook, can you share with us how it's kind of evolved over the last two or three quarters? And what is their current outlook for the US economy in '24? Are they still calling for a slowdown or a recession, or are they actually in the camp now that we're going to have positive real GDP growth for 2024? Bryan Preston : Their baseline scenario has had a bit of stability. It's certainly -- I don't think it is a significant -- there's no slowdown in 2024. They continue to push out their baseline expectations. They've also improved their downside scenario. That's had a little bit of a bigger impact on our reserve calculation. But overall, they're now in the camp of the economy continues to be moving well, and I don't think that they're expecting a significant slowdown at this point in 2024. Gerard Cassidy : Got it. Thank you. And then, Tim, coming back to the growth, particularly in the commercial side, you gave us some very strong numbers, of course, particularly in your Southeast franchise. Can you take it a little deeper or give us a little more color? Once you bring on these clients like you mentioned about the customers that came in this quarter based on payments, how long does it take to get them to a return that you find -- passes your hurdle rate and you guys are happy with it? Is it a 12-month, 24-month period? Can you walk us through that kind of waterfall on how you get there? How many more products do they need in addition to payments or in addition to a loan to get them to your return levels? Tim Spence : Yeah, sure. So, I'm going to do payments first and then we'll start with the loan, because payments is easy. So, the payments clients meet their return thresholds essentially out of the gate, Gerard, because you don't have credit attached, which means the capital you're holding is op risk capital. And it can take as long as 30 to 45 days to board a client, but because of some investments we made fortuitously for us prior to the deposit crisis last spring, we can board a client provided that the client is ready to do it in six days now on average. And that then allows for a very quick ramp and that's what's supporting the -- I think it's 11% growth in commercial payments fees year-over-year, that current pace. A high single-digit pace has been the goal there for a while and it requires us to get ramped quickly every time we add a new client. On the credit side of the equation, I think the beauty of the focus that we have on granularity right now is when we move a middle market relationship, it's generally a single bank relationship. And that means the credit comes on. It will take a month or two to move payables and receivables and otherwise and to get the payments flowing, but you hit the return threshold very quickly I would say generally well within a year on what we do in middle market. Where we are playing either at the upper end of middle market or in corporate banking, the return profile can develop over a longer period because quite often then the ancillary that we're focused on is not payments. It's the capital markets revenues. Where we lead, we get the returns quickly. Where we are a participant, we're a participant because we believe we can grow the relationship over time. And then, there is a strong discipline here to go back through the book every year. We do an operating review in every region with every corporate vertical and we have them show us the 25 lowest returning relationships in their portfolio, and there's either a relationship plan that we believe, or we exit. Gerard Cassidy : And real quick, Tim, just to follow-up on that payments, the new customers that you've referenced. Tim Spence : Yeah. Gerard Cassidy : Are you -- are those customers that don't have a payments product already or are you taking them from a fintech company or a competitor? Tim Spence : The disproportionate share of the clients that we are moving with conventional payments products and managed services are moving from another bank. So, it would be either they are a business that doesn't run with any leverage and that relationship moves, or they make a decision to move their payables or receivables business to Fifth Third because we can provide a superior service. So, that is a share shift. In the case of the embedded payments businesses, we are quite often helping people to build products into their software applications that didn't necessarily exist previously or where they had a smaller bank who had agreed to provide simple services and they're looking for somebody who's more robust controls the ability to support higher volumes. And then, in the case of the work we're doing on the technology side now, a simpler process to do integration and future product development. Gerard Cassidy : Appreciate all the color. Thank you, Tim. Tim Spence : Absolutely. Operator : Question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. Tim Spence : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess just one question for you, Tim. You've been fairly cautious on the macro outlook the last 12, 18 months. Has that changed today? And the reason I'm asking is I'm trying to sync that up with your messaging around buybacks both in terms of the back half and third quarter seem quite front-footed. So, just give us a sense of, do you feel better about economic outlook in your markets today than you did six or 12 months ago? And just broadly as a result of that, how are you thinking about capital allocation where should we expect some -- this level of sort of second half buybacks continuing absent growth reaccelerating next year? Thanks. Tim Spence : Yeah. Ebrahim, thank you. And as you know, we're big believers in accountability here. So, I actually asked Matt to go back and look through the Q&A in the scripts from prior quarters to see when we got the first question on higher for longer rates, and you were the one that asked it, so -- in the fourth quarter of '22 earnings call. What we said was we thought the market was overly optimistic on how quickly inflation would come down, and I don't remember what event it was last December. But the comment that I made then was that we thought either the bond market or the equity market were wrong. The question was just which one. And then, if we had to guess, it was bonds. So, I think for certain we know now that the bond market was the side of the trade that was wrong at the beginning of the year. The factors that have influenced our more cautious outlook are pretty much exactly the same today as they were the last time we talked about it. We just view the current fiscal and monetary policies to be at odds and that the fiscal side in particular is unsustainable and inflationary over time. And the longer it goes on, right, the more that the Fed will need to remain higher for longer, which puts pressure on the long end of the curve. And then, I think as a knock on to that, we know that longer rates stay elevated, the more likely it is that you see adverse consequences either in asset prices or in credit performance. The big question is just how long does that take, right? When does that play out? And that is an area where we have low conviction. So, what we are trying to do and what we will always try to do in low conviction environments is be liquid, be neutral and be diversified. Because historically, when you had a change, things slowly but suddenly or slowly then suddenly sort of a dynamic plays out in terms of big environmental shifts. On capital priorities, we do continue to expect to buy back between $300 million and $400 million in shares in the second half of the year. Our level of confidence in that just comes from the strength of the capital generation of the franchise. As Bryan and I both mentioned, we had the highest ROE and the most stable ROE, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis of any of our investor peers, and that is the basis of the confidence. If the environment ends up softening and we don't see the loan growth, that will then create a capital opportunity because the capital need to support organic growth won't be there. So, you do have a buffer here if we do see a turn in the environment and softening in loan growth expectations. And if not, then we have more than enough capital generation to do $300 million to $400 million in second half of the year. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. That was helpful. And to be clear, it wasn't a planted question. But the other thing that caught my attention, you mentioned Texas and obviously you mentioned so we think about that Fifth Third Southeast. Just talk to us, remind us in terms of the strategy in Texas. Are we opening a lot of de novo branches there? And I'm assuming there's no near term M&A, but that does open up potential opportunities I guess down the road? Thanks. Tim Spence : Yeah, absolutely. So, we got into Texas in 2012 when we formed our energy vertical. We have deeply experienced folks there who have done a really excellent job. And then, over the course of the past several years added middle market offices in Houston and Dallas, where we were able to attract very strong talents from trillionaire banks, who understand the focus we have on whole relationships and we're able to do what I think for us is a little bit unique, which is a heavy focus on C&I and then the delivery of the value-added services, whether they're capital markets or payments as opposed to a focus on either loan-only relationships or buying participations or investor real estate or otherwise. That business now also has specialty products, so ABL equipment leasing coverage. It has coverage dedicated treasury management. It has wealth and asset management support and then a non-public branch office, which allows us to do things on the pub fund side. What it does not have today is any retail banking presence. I wouldn't rule that out, but those are very large markets that we're talking about here. They're not markets of between 0.5 million and 3 million people, which has been the expansion strategy in the Southeast. So, any effort that we elect to make with branches in those markets will be a thing that we communicate to you in advance, because we'll be talking about committing 50 to 100 branches in a single city in many cases as opposed to what we're doing in the Southeast right now, which is really building 10 to 25 at an individual market level and getting to that top five presence that we know we need to be able to support the primary banking model. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful color. Thank you. Operator : Question comes from John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is now open. John Pancari : Good morning. Tim Spence : Good morning. John Pancari : On the NII outlook of down 2% to 4%, I know previously your -- last quarter your forecast was forward curve as well and you had five or six cuts in that assumption and now you're sticking to the forward curve, so much less of three cuts I'd say is in the forward curve now. However, your NII guide has remained intact despite that. Can you maybe just talk a little bit around it -- around the ability to keep that outlook without changing it? And then, what does that mean in terms of your margin forecast? I know you indicated that it's bottomed as well as NII now, but as you look through the year, what type of trajectory do you see in the margin? Thanks. Bryan Preston : Yeah, John, thanks for the question. It's one where the main thing that I would highlight for you is that we continue to have very strong benefits from the fixed rate asset repricing at this point. And you can see this -- for us, you can see that in our actual numbers. Year-over-year our indirect secured consumer business, which is primarily our indirect auto business, that's up 100 basis points year-over-year on a $15 billion portfolio. So, $150 million of annualized benefit in a year where we were actually constraining production in auto because of the RWA diet. So, those businesses we have, those medium-term fixed rate lending assets, whether it's the auto business, RV Marine, whether it's solar provide, generate a lot of power for us in terms of earnings capacity. Over the next 12 months, we'll have enough fixed rate assets reprice that will generate $350 million, $400 million plus of annualized NII benefit. So, even in a higher rate environment and with the curve selling off some, that benefit is increasing for us. So that is a good outcome for us that helps support and offset some continued migration from a DDA perspective, as well as some continued forecasted increases in deposit costs overall. We're not making any assumptions that the deposit environment and the competition and the increasing cost is over, but it is definitely moderating. From a NIM perspective, we do expect positive NIM from here as well. We're only talking about a couple of few basis points a quarter trajectory. A big wild card on the magnitude of the NIM increases just ultimately is where the cash position ends up. If we continue to have really strong performance out of our deposit franchise above the 2% to 3% that we're guiding to, NIM will be a little bit lower, but NII will be better as a result of that. But overall, we feel really good about the absolute positioning. John Pancari : Got it. Thanks, Bryan. Very helpful. And then separately on the credit side, NPA is up a bit this quarter. If you could just give us a little bit of color on what you're seeing in terms of credit migration and maybe by sector. We're hearing a bit of stress on the transportation sector. We have aviation credit impacted some of the names as well as some banks flagging healthcare. So, if you could just give us a little bit of color there and maybe also your confidence in your 35 basis point to 45 basis point charge-off guidance? Thanks. Greg Schroeck : Yeah, great. Thanks. Great question. So, of the $59 million increase that we saw in NPAs this quarter, $49 million of it was in commercial, two names, not in the industries that you had indicated. We had a retail trade name and a senior living trade name. So, we are continuing to see stress on the healthcare side, specifically in the senior living. That's not a huge portfolio for us and we think we have our hands around it, continue to review that portfolio on a consistent basis. So, not overly concerned. The thing that we have been consistently saying and we continue to see is we just -- we are not seeing trends by geography, by product, by industry. Our issues that have bubbled up have been more episodic and we've been able to deal with those episodic events on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So, I am not expecting to see a linear increase in our NPAs. To your last question, I still feel very good about the guidance. Bryan talked about earlier, 35 basis point to 45 basis point for the year based on -- again, Tim mentioned our commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform very, very well. The rest of our C&I borrowers continue to perform well. They've done a nice job with expense cutting. They've done a nice job passing along pricing. They're operating about as efficiently as we've seen them. We're taking a cautious view as well, not sure where rates are going to go. So, we're not seeing a lot of CapEx. But overall, we like the behaviors of our C&I portfolio, and I think the results of our commercial real estate portfolio speak for themselves. John Pancari : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Tim Spence : Absolutely. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Ken Usdin : Thank you. Good morning. Just want to follow-up with Bryan. Bryan, you mentioned the annualized dollar impact from those fixed rate securities and loans. I think you said previously that was $12 billion. I'm just wondering if you have an understanding of what you know will be also repricing in '25, and is that -- I would assume that would also then be incremental to that annualized benefit you referred to earlier? Bryan Preston : That's right. We do have a similar amount that will happen in '25. And actually, we've been in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion a quarter repricing overall on the portfolio between loans and investment portfolio. The investment portfolio has actually been, say, $600 million to $800 million a quarter range. That number is actually going to start accelerating later this year as we start to get some maturities on the bullet/locked-out structures. We're expecting over $1 billion in the fourth quarter and a pace similar to that in 2025. So, this benefit and the repricing is going to continue and actually pick up a little bit and that's where the higher for longer environment, as long as the frontend stays relatively stable, because that will help keep deposit costs stable, the higher long end will actually help and contribute to higher income over time. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then also you mentioned keeping the cash and securities at around the same level. Can you talk about just how you're preparing for liquidity rules and what that will mean in terms of that -- how you think about the mix of -- across portfolios and the amount of cash you want to keep? Bryan Preston : Yeah. We are there today for whatever comes out from a liquidity rule perspective. So, we will not have to make any material changes to the balance sheet compared to what we have today. What will happen over time as the loss position on the investment portfolio burns off, that will actually increase the liquidity contribution from the investment portfolio, so we can take the cash -- start to take the cash position down. Also we will start to remix the composition of our investment portfolio to continue to shift more into level one securities which will also help us take the cash position down over time. So, it will be just a natural transition where the balance sheet will get a little bit lighter from a cash and securities perspective as time passes. But we're very well positioned for any pending liquidity rules. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thank you, Bryan. Operator : Next question comes from Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Tim and Bryan, a question for you on the Southeast. How much do you have in deposits there now? And what are you doing in terms of consumer side loans? Where do those stand relative to deposits? Tim Spence : Sure. Let me start on the consumer loan side and then Bryan will fill in on the detail on deposits. So, the balance sheet in the Southeast on the consumer side for the core banking relationships is a net funding provider for us. Vivek, the sort of general development of a customer relationship is acquire the primary DDA via direct marketing and the work that we do around the new branches as we build them. The payments products are an important part of primacy. So, credit card would come after that. And then, from there, you have the episodic opportunities whether that's home equity, because there is some improvement going on or mortgage, although there obviously hasn't been a lot of that in the environment over the course of the past few years. The auto business, the dividend solar finance business in particular do have strong production in Florida, just because of the size of the population relative to the other states where we do business. But they're really unconnected to deposits. Bryan, you want to talk about the individual markets and deposit balances? Bryan Preston : Yeah, absolutely. We've got about overall about $31 billion in deposits in the Southeast now. About -- over half of that relates to the consumer franchise. So, we're doing very strong in consumer on that front. And as Tim mentioned, we are -- it is a net provider of funding. We only have about $18 billion worth of loans in the Southeast. Vivek Juneja : And I would imagine most of those are on the commercial side, as Tim said, at this point? Bryan Preston : Yes. Tim Spence : Yeah, absolutely. Vivek Juneja : Separate question. Solar, I noticed your growth has slowed as you've been indicating. Any update on what you're thinking in terms of originations, loan growth as well as credit? Tim Spence : Yeah. Well, I'll start and we'll get Greg to answer on credit. We are still number two, right? We are the number two largest financer in the residential solar market. And the byproduct of that is our growth opportunity has as much to do with the market size as it does anything else at this stage. And right now with rates being high and with net metering having been rolled back in a couple of places, you just have an affordability issue where the cost of purchasing energy off the grid is cheaper than it would be to finance solar installations. I think the other dynamic is that as rates rise, and this is I think ironically it's the same phenomenon in auto is as rates rise, the mix of leased financed installation shifts toward leases, which means as a lender, the solar is going to be down. I think the estimate from the industry is like 13%, 14% this year, Vivek, in terms of total installations. You're going to see a more significant decline in the financing volumes. So, we built our plan around being down 30% year-over-year. And I think in a higher for longer environment, that's probably right. If it's any softer than that, it's just going to be a byproduct of this continued dynamic on the lease versus finance, and does it make sense to -- can you offset energy costs on a zero basis with the cost of the equipment that's being installed. Greg? Greg Schroeck : And on the credit side, the solar dividend credit losses are performing right as we model right around 1.3%. We actually think we'll run a little bit better for the remainder of this year. Early volume within the portfolio is seasoning. So, we saw a little bit of seasonality this quarter, but we feel good about what we're seeing. And we certainly have more optimistic view for the rest of this year. Bryan Preston : And then just on the volume front for originations for solar, I know this question came up earlier as well, we're probably talking closer to $1.7 billion to $2 billion of originations this year, just given the dynamics that Tim mentioned earlier. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Manan Gosalia : Hey, good morning. I wanted to touch on deposit competition. You compete with several of the money center banks in several markets. How are you thinking about deposit competition as QT continues, as RRP balances continue to decline and the focus shifts back to bank deposits? How do you think deposit competition will trend in that environment? Bryan Preston : We think that is certainly a big question for us and for the industry, and it's one of the items why we highlighted that our NII guidance at this point is less rate environment dependent and more dependent on just the overall level of deposit competition. As you mentioned, we do compete against the money center banks as well as a lot of regionals across our different markets. In the Midwest, we compete against JPMorgan primarily. They're the number one bank in most of our markets. We're the number two bank in those markets. So, we see them and face off against them. And obviously, in the Southeast, we deal with Bank of America, Wells and Truist, so very significant competition. In general, it does feel like the broader liquidity environment has stabilized versus what we saw midyear last year. So, even with a little bit of weakness from an overall industry deposit perspective at this point unless something really breaks in the liquidity system, we're not expecting the significant food fight for cash that happened last year as people were just scrambling to show that they had a stable balance sheet. But it does mean that over time that you're likely to see just a potential increase in competition. The big counter for this is really going to be whether or not loan growth shows up or not. If there's no loan growth for the industry, there's not going to be a need for significant competition for deposits. And so, broadly speaking, we think competition probably stays lighter than what we saw last year, especially in a stable environment, also at a time where we think the whole industry is going to be focused on maintaining profitability. So, we do think that will moderate some of the pressures, but the bottoming of the RRP and potential decreases in bank reserves as QT continues, certainly could create some pressure in the medium term. Manan Gosalia : Got it. And then maybe a bigger picture question. Tim, in your annual letter, you talked about rationalizing the business model in response to the tougher regulatory environment. You used the RWA data as an example. Bigger picture, what do you think the evolution of the model for Fifth Third and other banks of your size will look like going forward? Maybe there's more partnerships with private credit or there's a pivot to more fee-based businesses. But in what ways will Fifth Third look different in five or seven years from now versus today? Tim Spence : Yeah. So, a few things just on the industry in general and Fifth Third on that front. One, we've got to find a way to reignite growth in labor productivity, right? I think that's true of the economy in total, but you'd see the same thing if you look at the banking sector is despite all the investments that have been made in technology over the course of the past 10, 15 years. Aside from branch rationalizations, you can't really point to a lot of examples where there were big productivity lifts. So, whether it's the cloud platforms we're putting in, where we should be able to drive more straight-through processing, or the use of AI or otherwise, overheads have to come down. That is going to be an important point of focus for us through the value streams and through the tech modernization work that we're doing. I think secondarily, there are going to be businesses that regional banks or community banks just don't compete in, in the future, if there isn't a rationalization of the way that the non-credit wallet is shared. And large public companies would be a good example of that space, right? We did our diet last year. We walked away from companies where we were an important lender, but we weren't getting a fair share of the ancillaries because they were being consumed by the money center banks. That's either going to require the money centers to make larger individual commitments in order to justify the ancillary or it's going to require that the treasurers that those companies reallocate the wallet proportionally. So, I and -- my own view is at least initially you're going to see a shift there. I think private credit is going to be an interesting one to watch. Like there isn't a great track record historically for people growing as fast as private credit is growing and completely avoiding mistakes. I also have a hard time figuring out what the comparative advantage is there that's defensible if the model works. And I would prefer always, since we are a good deposit gathering institution, that we'd be able, if there's good money to be made and the valuations that are being placed on these credit fund providers, certainly suggest there is, that we'd be holding those assets on balance sheet. So that is not been an immediate point of focus for us. And then lastly, as we've talked about in the past, it's hard to imagine that whether it's 1,000 or 2,000 or 3,000, it's hard to imagine that there are going to be 4,000 banks. And you're just going to have to see some consolidation and people retreating to places where they have density and focusing on markets where they can neutralize the scale advantages that the large banks have because you're the same size in the area where you compete versus being seven, eight, nine, 10 ranked in every market across the US, which is just fundamentally less defensible business strategy. Manan Gosalia : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Christopher Marinac from Janney. Your line is now open. Christopher Marinac : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about possible changes on risk grades in criticized and classifieds. I know it might be premature to see anything upgraded, but just curious on the path of those that you saw and how that may evolve this year. Greg Schroeck : Yeah, it's a great question. So again, probably not going to be linear, it's going to be lumpy. It has been for us in the past given current previous comments I made about episodic, more episodic events and the fact that we're just not seeing trending by industry, by geography. And so, I would expect it to continue to be lumpy. But as I said earlier, we're still liking the way our C&I portfolio is behaving. We like our commercial real estate track record an awful lot. But with higher for longer, maybe higher forever interest rates, we're going to continue to see stress and we're going to continue to proactively manage the portfolio as we have. We're not doing deep dives because on an ongoing basis, we are stressing the C&I portfolio by 200 basis points. We're getting out ahead of any potential issues, but that could lead to some criticized assets, a special mention. We're doing the same thing, do something on the commercial real estate side, exit stress testing. So, we're taking a look at maturities and we're stressing by 100 basis points a forward curve on what that loan looks like at maturity. And so, if we see weakness there, we could see an elevation in criticized assets, but 99% of our accruing criticized assets are current, right? And if you include our non-accrual, we're still 93%, 94% current within that portfolio. So, we'll see episodic kind of lumpiness for the remainder of the year. Christopher Marinac : Great. Thank you for that. And just a quick follow-up. I mean, the loss content ultimately is reflected in the reserve. So that would have to change a lot for you to kind of change your guide on reserve overall? Greg Schroeck : Exactly. Tim Spence : Thanks for that, Chris. I think we don't have any other questions in the queue, but we'd be remiss if we didn't say congratulations to [Erica] (ph) and her family since she wasn't able to join us today before we wrap up our call. Matt Curoe : Thanks, Tim. And thanks, Ellie, and thanks everyone for joining -- for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any other follow-up questions. Ellie, you may now disconnect the call. Operator : Thank you for everyone attending the call today. We all hope you have a wonderful day. Stay safe.",

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2024 Fifth Third Bancorp Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Matt Curoe. Please go ahead. Matt Curoe : Good morning everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This morning our chairman, CEO, and President, Tim Spence, and CFO, Bryan Preston will provide an overview of our second quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of July 19, 2024, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Bryan, we will open up the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim. Tim Spence : Thanks, Matt and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe great banks distinguish themselves, not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather how they navigate challenging ones. In that context, I am very pleased with how we are executing as a company and what continues to be an uncertain economic and interest rate backdrop. Our focus on stability, profitability, and growth in that order have produced consistent predictable results and strong profitability since the bank failures last spring and we remain confident in our ability to deliver PPNR and earnings outcomes in-line with or better than our original expectations for the full year in 2024. This morning we reported earnings per share of $0.81 or $0.86 excluding certain items outlined on Page 2 of the release, which exceeded the guidance we provided in our first quarter earnings call. Our resilient balance sheet, diversified fee revenues, and expense discipline continued to produce strong profitability. Our adjusted return on tangible common equity of 15.1% and adjusted return on assets of 1.22% over the last 12 months rank as the best of all peers who have reported so far and the most stable when compared to the same period last year. The second quarter marked the first sequential growth in NII since 2022 and NIM improved for the second consecutive quarter. That trajectory, along with the benefits we are seeing from strategic investments and continued expense discipline should allow us to return to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter of this year and carry over into next year. Strategically, our investments in the southeast and middle market expansion markets, in commercial payments, and in wealth and asset management, continue to produce strong growth and market share gains. We grew consumer households by 3% year-over-year in the second quarter, punctuated by 6% growth in our southeast markets. Middle market loan production and new quality relationships were the strongest in Indiana, the Carolinas, Texas, and California. In our industry verticals, production was strongest where federal government spending has had an outsized benefit, including in aerospace and defense contractors and with manufacturing and infrastructure construction firms. Commercial payments revenue grew 12% year-over-year, driven by our investments in our software enabled managed services and Newline our embedded payments business. Commercial payments is a scale business for us. In the first half of 2024 alone, we processed more than $8 trillion in volume. Nearly half of all new treasury management relationships we added year-to-date were payments-led and have no credit extended. Wealth and asset management fee revenues grew 11% year-over-year, and total assets under management grew to $65 billion, a 10% increase compared to the same quarter last year. Fifth Third Securities, the private bank, and Fifth Third Wealth Advisors, the RIA platform we launched in 2022, all generated strong performance. Digital Banker and Global Private Banker recognized us again as the best private bank for high net worth clients for the third consecutive year. Turning to capital, our strong profitability allowed us to resume share repurchases during the quarter while also increasing our CET1 ratio to 10.6%. The Federal Reserve stress test results highlighted our strong capital levels, consistent profitability, and simple yet well-diversified business model. Importantly, we maintain the capacity to increase our dividend, support organic growth, and continue share repurchases. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we remain cautious due to the wide range of potential economic and geopolitical scenarios that could unfold. As a result, we will remain disciplined and will not chase loan growth at the expense of our return targets. We'll continue to maintain flexibility by staying liquid, neutrally positioned, and broadly diversified, while investing in the long-term. Before I hand it over to Bryan to provide additional details on our second quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, I want to express my gratitude to our employees for the consistent hard work, innovation, and passion for service that you bring to our customers. This morning, your money named us the best super regional bank in the US, as part of their 2024 awards for excellence. I'm honored to be part of your team. With that, Bryan over to you. Bryan Preston : Thanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. Our second quarter results were strong, reflecting our balance sheet strength, diversified revenue streams, and disciplined approach to expense and credit risk management. For more than a year, we have emphasized the importance of maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility in an uncertain economic and interest rate environment. This approach has proven effective as the market's expectations on rate cuts, changed dramatically from the start of 2024. Despite this change in rate outlook, our NII has been consistent with the performance trajectory we discussed back in December, increasing sequentially during the second quarter from the first quarter bottoming, and NIM has increased for two consecutive quarters from the fourth quarter low. Additionally, our full year 2024 NII outlook remains unchanged. As Tim mentioned, our profitability remained strong and stable, which allowed us to resume share repurchases early and grow our CET1 ratio to 10.6% up 13 basis points. As noted on Page 2 of our earnings release, our reported results were impacted by certain items including the valuation of the visa total return swap, an update to the FDIC special assessment, and the impact of certain legal settlements and customer remediations. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted net interest income for the quarter increased 1% from the prior quarter to $1.4 billion. And adjusted net interest margin improved 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter. Increased yields on new loan production contributed to this improvement and offset the impact of increased interest bearing core deposit costs, which were well-managed and increased only 4 basis points compared to the prior quarter. While total average portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially, we continue to benefit from fixed rate asset repricing, led by our indirect auto business. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially, primarily reflecting the increase in indirect auto originations, offset by a decrease in other consumer loan balances. Average commercial portfolio loans decreased 1%, due to lower demand from corporate banking borrowers. Period end commercial revolver utilization remained at 36% consistent with the prior quarter. Middle market loan production increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, driven by strong performance in our southeast markets, primarily in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida, as well as continued success in Indiana, Texas, and California. The pipeline for the second half of the year is improving, and we are continuing to invest in our middle market banking teams, including our recently announced expansion in the Alabama market. However, we remain cautious on commercial loan growth expectations in the second half of the year, as customer demand for credit remains muted. Our investment in analytics continues to help us optimize deposit outcomes, demonstrated by our strong deposit growth in 2023 and prudent management of deposit costs in 2024. Our strong track record of liquidity management, combined with data-driven analytics, will aid in maintaining pricing discipline and optimizing liability costs. Average core deposits were flat sequentially, driven by higher CD and consumer savings and money market balances, offset by lower interest checking and commercial demand balances. Our current focus remains on prudently managing deposit costs with the Fed on hold and preparing for potential rate cuts later this year. By segment, average consumer deposits increased 2% sequentially while both commercial and wealth deposits decreased 2%. The Southeast branch investments are driving both strong household growth and granular insured deposits. Demand deposit balances as a percent of core deposits were 25% as of the end of the second quarter, stable with the prior quarter, as migration of DDA balances continued to slow. Consistent with our prior expectations for a higher for longer rate environment, we expect DDA mix to fall below 25% during the third quarter and stay around 24% for the remainder of the year. We ended the quarter with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 137% and our loan to core deposit ratio with 72%. We are well-positioned to continue to grow net interest income and our balance sheet provides flexibility to navigate the evolving economic and interest rate conditions. Moving on to fees. Excluding the impacts of security gains and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest income decreased $32 million or 4% compared to the year ago quarter. This year-over-year decrease is attributable to a $34 million private equity gain recognized in the second quarter of 2023. Within our businesses, commercial payments and wealth and asset management fees continue to deliver strong results, both achieving double-digit revenue growth over the prior year, driven by our continued strategic growth investments in products and sales personnel. These areas are not only fast growing but are sizable contributors to fee income and profitability today given our strength and scale in these businesses. We expect these businesses to continue to deliver strong revenue growth. Our market-sensitive businesses such as mortgage and commercial customer hedging have been impacted by the higher rate environment, the reduced demand for credit, and reduced market volatility. The combined impact for these businesses was a $20 million decrease versus the prior year. Leasing business revenue was down $9 million versus the prior year due to our decision to de-emphasize operating leases, but it is offset by a $9 million decrease in leasing business expense. The securities gains of $3 million reflected the mark-to-market impact of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which is more than offset in compensation expense. While we have continued to invest in strategic growth initiatives and technology, we managed our adjusted non-interest expense flat to the year-ago quarter due to our focus on expense discipline and the ongoing benefits from the process automation efforts. Adjusted non-interest expense decreased 7% sequentially, primarily due to seasonal items during the first quarter related to compensation awards and payroll taxes. Moving to credit, consistent with our guidance, the net charge-off ratio was 49 basis points, up 11 basis points sequentially, driven by two commercial credits for which we had previously established specific reserves. Consumer charge-offs were 57 basis points, a reduction of 10 basis points sequentially, primarily due to improvement in our indirect consumer-secured portfolio. Other credit metrics showed strong sequential improvement with the ratio of early-stage delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreasing 3 basis points to 26 basis points, which is near the lowest levels we have experienced over the last decade. NPAs decreased by $100 million, or 13% during the quarter, and the NPA ratio decreased 9 basis points to [55] (ph) basis points. In commercial, our credit discipline is grounded in generating and maintaining granular, high-quality relationships and by managing concentration risks to any asset class, region, or industry. We continue to see no material signs of broad-based industry or geographic weakness and believe potential future commercial credit losses will be idiosyncratic in nature. In consumer, our focus remains on lending to homeowners, which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures. We have maintained our conservative underwriting policies and will continue to evaluate our positioning as economic conditions change. Our ACL coverage ratio decreased 4 basis points to 2.08% and included a $47 million reserve release, driven by the previously mentioned specific reserves. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings. Moving to capital, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.6%, significantly exceeding our new buffered minimum of 7.7%, reflecting strong capital levels. As we assess our capital priorities, we believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level. During the quarter, we completed $125 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by 3.5 million shares. Our pro forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the securities portfolio, is 8.0%. We expect continued improvement in the unrealized securities losses in our portfolio, given that 61% of the AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked-out securities, which provide the high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. Assuming the forward curve is realized, approximately 26% of the AOCI related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025, increasing tangible book value per share by 10%, before considering any future earnings. 62% of the securities-related AOCI will accrete back to equity by the end of 2028. Moving to our current outlook. While the rate environment and customer credit demand have played out differently than we were expecting at the start of the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver PPNR and earnings outcomes in-line with or better than our original expectations for the full year. We expect full-year NII to decrease 2% to 4% consistent with our guidance from January. This outlook assumes the forward curve as of early July, which projected two rate cuts in the second half of the year, September and December. We also believe we can deliver this NII outcome with no interest rate cuts and no loan growth in the second half of 2024. Given the year-to-date trends in customer activity, we now expect full-year average total loans to be down 3% compared to 2023. Average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2024 are expected to be stable to up 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, with similar performance in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. Customer demand is the primary driver of this change, given the interest rate environment and other economic uncertainties. If there's more economic optimism in the second half of the year, we would expect to see loan growth in-line or better than market growth. We are forecasting fourth quarter average core deposit growth of 2% to 3% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Our forecast also assumes commercial revolver utilization and our cash and other short-term investments remain relatively stable throughout the remainder of 2024. We expect full-year adjusted non-interest income to be stable to down 1% in 2024, reflecting the impact of weaker than previously expected credit demand and customer hedging activities. We expect strong growth in commercial payments and wealth and asset management revenue to continue. In response to this expectation of lower customer activity in the second half. We expect to manage full year adjusted non-interest expense stable to 2023 levels. Our expense outlook assumes continued investments in technology with tech expense growth in the mid-single digits and sales additions in middle market, commercial payments, and wealth. We will open 30 to 35 new branches in our higher growth markets and have already closed a similar number of branches in 2024. Our outlook still projects an efficiency ratio of around 57% for the full year. For full year 2024, the net charge-off outlook remains in the 35 to 45 basis points range. While we expect to resume provision builds in connection with loan growth and mix in the second half of 2024, we expect the second half build to be less than the first half of 2024 release. Therefore, we expect full-year provision to be a 0 to $10 million release, assuming no change to credit quality of the portfolio or projected economic conditions. Moving to our quarterly outlook, we expect NII and NIM growth to continue in both the third and fourth quarter. We expect NII in the third quarter to be up 2% sequentially, reflecting the impact of slowing deposit cost pressures and the continued benefit of our fixed rate asset repricing. Our current outlook assumes interest-bearing core deposit costs, which were 295 basis points in the second quarter of 2024, to increase just 4 basis points sequentially if we see no rate cuts. We expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% from the second quarter. We expect modest middle market, auto, and solar production to offset continued low credit demand from corporate banking customers. We expect third quarter adjusted non-interest income to be up 1% to 2% compared to the second quarter, largely reflecting strength in commercial payments and wealth and asset management and a modest increase in commercial banking revenue. We expect third quarter total adjusted non-interest expenses to be up 1% compared to the second quarter, due to the impact of the previously discussed investments in branches, technology, and sales personnel. Third quarter net charge-offs are projected to be in the 40 basis points to 45 basis point range. As mentioned in the [four-year] (ph) outlook, loan growth and mix are expected to drive a provision build, which should be around $25 million in the third quarter, assuming no change to the economic outlook. The trajectory of our income statement performance should deliver positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter 2024 and a net interest income exit rate for the year that positions us for record results in 2025, assuming no major economic or interest rate outlook changes. Finally, moving to capital. With our consistent and strong earnings, we expect to execute share repurchases of $200 million per quarter in the second half of 2024, assuming a stable economic and credit outlook and capital rules that are no worse than the current NPR. In summary, with our well-positioned balance sheet, disciplined expense and credit risk management, and diversified revenue streams, we are positioned to generate sustained, top quartile profitability and deliver long-term value for our shareholders, customers, communities, and employees. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call up for Q&A. Matt Curoe : Thanks, Bryan. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ebrahim Poonawala at Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Tim Spence : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hi Tim. Maybe first question For Bryan, just looking at Slide 49 in the deck around rate sensitivity, it implies that rate cuts should benefit NII. So you talked about the second half guide, I think as we think about 2025. But just talk to us around the comfort level. I think it says 75% to 80% effective betas on the downside. Just talk to us in terms of the deposit beta assumptions. What's contractual within your deposit mix that should repriced lower, and is it fair to assume that rate cuts are positive for Fifth Third? Bryan Preston : Thank you, Ebrahim. We certainly believe that rate cuts are positive for Fifth Third\u2019s. If you look at slide 42, we actually give a little bit more detail on the mix of the interest-bearing deposit book. 64% of our book right now would be classified in kind of the higher beta categories. This represents our index deposits, which are up to $35 billion. The CDs that we have in place, we've done a nice job of managing the maturity of the CD bucket so that most of our CDs will mature by the end of the year. That's another $14 billion of balances and our promotional balances as well. So we have a lot of captions where within that book that we are going to be able to reprice down. Overall, that's about 64% of the deposits. We certainly have some lower rate buckets still that we think the betas are effectively zero. We have a high amount of confidence though that we're going to be able to get cost out and be able to manage. We really only need to be in a kind of mid-50s to low-60s beta to be able to be neutral to liability sensitive and we're confident we can deliver that. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's clear. And I guess maybe one for you, Tim. I think you put it back in terms of your loan growth much earlier this cycle. As you think about with creditors, your comments on reserve outlook, is it all clear if you get rate cuts, do you just worry less about something really bad happening systemically on credit quality for Fifth Third? And then the other side of that is what's the trigger that leads to that growth? I heard you say you should have about average loan growth if things pick up. What's the catalyst we should be working for? Thanks. Tim Spence : Yeah. Good question. I think that's the million dollar question for the industry right there. There's no question that if we see some relief on rates, it is a positive, both for loan demand and for credit quality. Jamie Leonard, and I have been out in several of the markets this quarter doing market visits, and we've been running a straw poll on where rates need to be before activity picks up. And the wisdom of the crowds, at least inside Fifth Third at the moment is about 4.5% the Meridian, where we'll see a pickup in more activity. That said, while rates would be constructive, I think, I continue always to worry about the broader macro issues. We've got land wars and two volatile regions in the US right now. We have an election that's upcoming. We have massive fiscal deficits in the US. We have a ton of Treasury Issuance that's going to be required to reload the TGA at some point here, and they're going to have to turn that out, and that's going to put pressure on the long-end of the curve. And while I think we have some stability here, I'm uncomfortable with the level of support that the federal government is having to provide to keep GDP growth at where it is at the moment. I mean, the jobs numbers, this most recent batch, unless I'm mistaken, a third of the new jobs that were created, were created by the government. When we look at our footprint and we look at where the activity is, where there's federal stimulus, we're seeing robust activity everywhere else. We've got a client in Tennessee tell us that the current environment was quote, half speed ahead, right. So we will continue to be mindful about that. I'm a believer that in uncertain environments, you have to focus on getting growth from the businesses that you know and the strategies that are proven. You're not going to see us stretching into categories we don't know or doing things that we're uncomfortable with from a credit perspective and where we have to bet on a favorable macro to bail us out in terms of getting repaid. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's great, color. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Scott Siefers at Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Let's see -- actually, Bryan, I was hoping you could speak a little bit about the fee trajectory. You discussed sort of the second quarter softness a month or so ago, feels like it might persist a bit into the third quarter, but I imagine we are still feeling like that'll rebound. Just hoping you could maybe share some thoughts on sort of when and how that ends up looking. You know, there's just a little more color on the fee trajectory, please. Bryan Preston : Yeah, absolutely, Scott. You know, the second to third quarter increase, we're talking about not too aggressive of a fee growth perspective. We continue to expect continued performance out of our wealth and asset management business, as well as commercial payments. Payments has been taken along at $3 million to $4 million a quarter increases, and we expect that to continue and feel really good about it. We're also going to see some seasonal impacts actually come out associated with our mortgage business. We've benefited a lot from the servicing portfolio, all the servicing ads that we did right at the end of the low rate cycle has benefited us and generated a lot of great income, but there is a seasonal headwind, 1Q to 2Q that we felt that was about $7 million. That's not going to repeat. So we're set up really well for that 2Q to 3Q growth that we've laid out. And then in the fourth quarter, we'll get some additional seasonal benefit out of the MSR. The payments and card spend will continue to pick up, especially the seasonal card spending consumer. We'll get the $10 million TRA benefit. And then we always see some pickup in both commercial banking and leasing in the fourth quarter that should both generate some additional income as well. That gets us to that little bit higher growth rate trajectory that you could see that's implied throughout in 3Q and 4Q. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Okay, good. And then maybe switching gears just a second, something you might be able to sort of put into context, the CFPB news from earlier this month, that just based on my read, kind of felt like we closed the book on the account issues from a few years ago, which is good. But then there were the auto-related items. So I know there are just sort of questions floating out there about sort of cost to comply, cost to remediate, what's within the existing outlook. Can you maybe address those kind of broadly, please? Tim Spence : Yeah, Scott, it's Tim. I'm happy to do that. And I think you hit on the most important thing here, which is the best thing for you to do is focus on the statements of fact as opposed to the press releases on this one. I think that by the Bureau's own statements of fact here, these were old issues. So one was nearly five years old, the other was nearly 10 years old respectively. There are things that we identified and reported. And in case of auto, we completely canceled the program before they ever even started their investigation. And I think while of course, we always take anything that impacts customers seriously, Fifth Third the size of the fines, which are a fraction of what you've seen in other places, probably speak for themselves in terms of the limited scope of the issues here. We elected to close these things out because given the fact that they were small in the past, it just didn't make sense to continue to spend more money litigating than it was going to spend to settle. So, you know, we put them in the rearview mirror. We have the one-time expense this quarter, and that's where it is going to stay. You shouldn't expect any incremental ongoing expense because these are issues that are so old, anything that needed to be done was already done from an ongoing [operational perspective] (ph). Scott Siefers : Okay, wonderful. Good. Thank you for taking the questions. Tim Spence : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo at Wells Fargo. Tim Spence : Hi Mike. Mike Mayo : I [might want to requeue] (ph). Operator : We'll go next to Ken Usdin at Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, good morning, guys. On the deposit side, I heard your comment about 4 basis points increase in 3Q with no cuts. And I'm just wondering, you talked about the mid-50s to 60 downside beta. Can you give us a little bit of context on how that starts and then how that moves forward? And you talked about having a two-thirds of your deposit-based high beta, but just wondering like how you kind of expect some of the pricing stuff you've been doing to grow deposits in the southeast to juxtapose against that downside beta. Thanks. Bryan Preston : Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Ken. Great question. You know, what we would tell you is that what it will create is, it will create some opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive on some of the rate cuts associated with the CDs and the promo portfolios that we've seen. Historically, when we've navigated through these down rate cycles, those first couple cuts on the consumer side do have a pretty decent impact on customer mentality and sentiment and your ability to create some sticky balances. We've been through this a few times now where we've seen the ability to convert those balances into a lower rate balance and cause them to stick around. And on the other side of that, the commercial balances, in particular the index balances, those are immediate impacts and will just move with the market. We have really no concern around that index strategy. It's another one that we've executed in prior cycles. I think we've done a nice job of kind of navigating and managing those balances up in those index portfolios as we've reached the grades. It gives us a lot of confidence in the ability to very quickly get those costs out. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And then just calling up on your comments about record [25 versus 23] (ph) NII, can you talk just about how much of that do you expect to be growth related and how much of that you expect to be just the outcome of rate scenarios? Bryan Preston : I would actually tell you that most of it is just the natural transition of the balance sheet in the business today. I think our NII story is actually pretty simple. Right now it's the continued fixed rate asset pricing and slowing deposit cost. And if you look at just the trends that we're laying out, you know, we're adding about $8 million a quarter right now, just on the natural repricing of the existing balance sheet. And you think with, we've talked a lot about $4 billion to fixed rate asset repricing. That's happening at about 200 basis points. That's $20 million a quarter. And then the deposit costs up 4 bps this quarter on $120 billion interest bearing book [versus 12] (ph) of incremental costs to take us down to that net 8. We get a little bit of continued slowing on deposit cost side. That can approach $10 million, $15 million, $20 million a quarter. Day count, we're going to pick up $10 million here in the third quarter. And then that sets us up for an exit rate where if you just take the 4 times the fourth quarter math, you're right around what is our record NII of [$58 million, $52 million] (ph). Throw on a little earning asset or loan growth on top of that and the path is there for us. That's what gives us confidence. The big wild card, like we always talk about, is just how competitive deposit pricing ultimately ends up being. But if we start to see rate cuts, we would expect to see some decent relief on the liability side. Tim Spence : Yeah, Ken, it's Tim. We talked a while ago, and maybe we haven't been doing enough of this recently, but about the power of having these intermediate duration fixed rate loan origination platforms was, by that I really mean you think about provide, you think about the auto business, you think about dividends. Like if you just look at the yields on the indirect auto and specialty business year-over-year, we've added almost 100 basis points to the yield in the portfolio. And if you look at the solar product, it's north of 200 basis points that we have been able to add year-over-year. And that just speaks to the power of both the one, the sort of origination capacity that exists there that we can dial up in an environment where spreads widen and it makes sense for us to do it. And two, the fact that these are asset classes that are going to reprice a lot faster than the 3% mortgages that were originated at the low point in the rate cycle and that are going to persist much longer than the jumbo mortgages and the other fixed rate product that you see being available to banks out in the market today, which are all likely to prepay if we get any sort of meaningful movement out of the Fed. So that will be an important part of the way that we continue to drive outcomes, even in an environment where you don't get a meaningful improvement in loan demand across the industry. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thank you for that color. Operator : We'll go next to Gerard Cassidy at RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Tim. Hi, Bryan. Tim Spence : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Tim, Bryan, can you give us a little color? On slide 29, the transfers to non-accrual status of loans fell nicely this quarter and when you go back you know you give it -- give us the data back to the second quarter of 2023, and it's a meaningful drop from those levels. Any color that you can give us on what led to that drop? And then second, and I apologize if you addressed this already, on the commercial loan charge-off number that jumped in the quarter, were there any specific idiosyncratic loans that caused that to happen? Greg Schroeck : Gerard, hey it's Greg. Great question. So I'll answer the second one first. So yeah we had the two names that Bryan mentioned that were two different industries. We're not seeing any thematic concerning trends emerging out of the [technical difficulty] geographically by [technical difficulty]. But we've talked about lumpiness on the commercial side. And that's what we experienced this quarter. We're normalizing off very low loss rates, and so when we have one or two of these episodic events, they're going to get highlighted, and that's what we saw. But as Bryan mentioned, they were not a surprise. We had reserves against those two loans, and so we think we're through those. The overall credit metrics remain really solid. Our delinquencies were down quarter-over-quarter. The NPAs that you referred to were down 13%, quarter-over-quarter at 55 basis points. That's below our 10-year average. We're up 1 basis point year-over-year on NPAs, and it's really across the Board. We had about $80 million in commercial losses this quarter, but we are down almost $100 million. So we are working the portfolio very hard. We're working out of some of the NPA loans without experiencing the loss rates, but it's really across the board. What we're not seeing the NPAs are in the commercial real estate portfolio. We had about $3 million in NPAs there. So that portfolio continues to perform very, very well. It had virtually no delinquencies in that portfolio. So it's really across the board where we're seeing the improvement in our NPA numbers. Had a little bit on the consumer side, both sides have been driven on the commercial side. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, thank you for the color. And then second, when you look at your Shared National Credit portfolio and you give us good details, once again on the Slide 25, the financial services slice of that portfolio, how much, if any -- is in sectors that is considered private equity or private credit? Because as we all know, it seems like the banking industry has been de-risked since the financial crisis and the private equity, private credit side of the equation might be taking on more of that risk. Do you guys have many loans to the Blackstone\u2019s or the Carlisle\u2019s or any of those types of companies and where there might be indirect exposure to that industry? Greg Schroeck : Yeah, another great question. So we've got subscription lines to some of those type of companies, highly rated borrowers. But as you know, those are mostly predicated on and underwritten, overcollateralized to the LP Capital. But we're not in that leverage -- on leverage space. We're not active there. We've got a couple direct lending lines of credit. They're totaled about $30 million, so about [$15 million fee] (ph). So we're not active in that space. Gerard Cassidy : Good, okay, good. Thank you again. Greg Schroeck : Thank you. Tim Spence : Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Bill Carache at Wolfe Research. Bill Carache : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on your credit commentary and ask for your thoughts on the longer-term trajectory of charge-offs given what you're seeing in both consumer and commercial. Crystal clear on all the sources of uncertainty that you highlighted, Tim, but if we assume that the soft landing scenario materializes and think about the loss content implicit in your loan book today, would you expect Fifth Third\u2019s MCR rates to level off from here, drift a little bit higher, revert to 2019 levels. I know you can't give 2025 guidance, but any help on how you're thinking about that long-term trajectory would be super helpful. Greg Schroeck : Yeah, it's Greg again. So Yeah, certainly, as Tim mentioned, any kind of rate cut is going to help us from an overall asset quality. It will on the consumer side. It will on the commercial side. It takes a little while for those rate cuts to play through the portfolio. So as Bryan mentioned in his prepared remarks, we still feel good about the 40 basis points or 45 basis points for the rest of this year. Then we'll see how the rest of the marketplace plays out. But as I just mentioned in the previous question, still feel really good about the overall metrics of the portfolio. Our NPA rates is a good indicator of potential loss rates moving forward, and those numbers continue to come down and improve. And so I think even without rate increases, still feel really good about our portfolio, get a little bit of goodness from the rates and yeah, I think it certainly helps as we get into 2025. Bill Carache : Thanks, That's helpful. And then separately, you talked about some of the variables impacting the curve. Can you discuss how a Fifth Third\u2019s position for either a flatter or a steeper yield curve environment? Greg Schroeck : Yeah, absolutely. You know, we're typically, our normal business is about two-thirds sensitive to the front end of the curve. You know, I will tell you with our current cash position, we're probably closer to 75% sensitive on the front end of the curve. So relief on the front end is part of what would be the big driver from an asset sensitivity perspective. And the interesting thing about how this environment could play out is we could potentially get some of that relief on the front end of the curve and still benefit from the fixed rate asset repricing that we're expecting over the next couple of years. Because what's rolling off right now is a lot of that loans that were originated in those periods of really low interest rates. So even if you see a little bit of lower rates on the longer-end of the curve, you would still have a nice pickup relative to the [prompt of back] (ph) with dynamic. So that front end relief and as Tim mentioned around our concerns around their -- concerns around continued treasury issuance, if that's the scenario that were to play out, it would be one that would be a nice situation from an NII perspective. But it would probably continue the longer-end of the curve could cause some additional challenges for the economy from a growth perspective. Bill Carache : Understood. Very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Tim Spence : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Erika Najarian at UBS. Erika Najarian : Hi. Tim Spence : Hi, Erika. Erika Najarian : Hey, just a few follow up questions. Your cash position was twice that of last year. You know, as we think about, obviously that makes you more sensitive to short rates coming down. How do we think about how you are managing that cash position from an interest rate standpoint versus an anticipation of liquidity rules coming standpoint? And maybe give us a sense of how much is there sort of supervisor encouragement today to keep, \u201cliquid liquidity\u201d as we anticipate new rules? Bryan Preston : Yeah, I would tell you that we are very focused internally on maintaining plenty of liquidity to deal with any uncertainty associated with potential rules, as well as the market. So that has just been a big driver of our positioning and why we've done that. But the other thing that it allows for us, yes it is a good liquidity risk management tool, but it does allow us to have a little bit more confidence on the interest rate risk management side as well, because we can be more aggressive on our liability management actions because of that cash position. So it really is the combination of that liquidity and liability management benefits that we are focused on and why we continue to keep those levels that we have. As rates come down, and as we get through that environment and see stability in the market from a liquidity perspective, we really have an ability to take that down over time. As you pointed out, it was a big increase year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was a 20 basis point impact on our NIM. So, getting back to more normalized levels would be a nice trend for us from a NIM perspective. Erika Najarian : Got it. And I'll follow up with that on the liability side later. So I wanted to squeeze in the second question, and this is for you Tim. Tim, I think that you and management and the board have done such a great job in terms of the makeover of Fifth Third and now investors, essentially take for granted and see you as a high quality bank among your peers. To that end, it seems like the CFPB stuff in terms of your response to Scott's question is in the rearview mirror. The one question I keep getting from investors is, are you still the proper owner for dividend? And it made sense in terms of when you did the deal and obviously solar is the future, but it's clearly something that is a product that's sold, not bought. And given all the litigation against you, it just doesn't feel on brand from a quality perspective in terms of how you've rebuilt Fifth Third\u2019s. So how are you thinking about, it's so small, but it comes up in conversations often, right? Like the impact to your stock, it feels like more than the impact to earning. So, love your thoughts here. Tim Spence : Sure. So, just to make sure that I'm clear, and I know you were, But I mean, dividend has nothing to do with the CFPB. So those are two separate issues. Right, right. Okay. Yeah. look, on the dividend front, we are believers that the best way to get growth is to attach yourself to long-term secular trends. So the focus on the Southeast was to get the bank linked to the demographic migration that was going to support the growth in that market. The focus on commercial payments has been about attaching ourselves to this trend of digitization in general and in particular the intermediation of these legacy workflows with software. And in the case of dividend and what we've elected to do on the project finance on the commercial solar side of the equation. The focus is on both the diversification of energy sources with a focus on renewable, and I think in particular in the case of dividend, the need that we are going to have across the country to have more distributed power generation and storage, if we're going to avoid rolling brownouts and other sorts of issues that come from the fact that we have a very old energy infrastructure. And in particular now with the explosion in data centers that are going to be required to support AI and otherwise, a lot of very power intensive commercial applications. So we view the residential solar and battery storage, as an important part of the way that our customers and people we don't do business with today are going to be able to meet their power needs in the future. And I actually think that for our products like this with an intermediate duration and a super prime credit risk profile, banks are the best source of liquidity, not the worst. The focus is just making sure that you do business with the best because you're right, the same way that in auto we're reliant on the quality of care that the dealer provides to ensure that you know our borrower has a good experience, we are reliant on the quality of the installer and you know the actions that we took shortly after acquiring dividend to refocus the business on the 150 best installers in the portfolio are going to continue to be, we think a very viable and high quality way to go to market. Erika Najarian : And just to follow up here, I'm sorry that I'm taking up a third question. Are you confident that after the vendor changes that you've made that, Fifth Third is not going to be in the news with like, you know, some older lady saying like she got sold solar panels, you can't afford, right? That's the risk. I totally get the secular trend. And everything that you have said makes so much elegant sense, but I think that's the risk that investors are trying to -- make sure that \u2013 it\u2019s not embedded in your stock, which is obviously not an EPS impact necessarily, but a reputational litigation. Tim Spence : Sure. There were some installer failures. As interest rates rose because the volume went down. I think as a matter of policy here, we take care of the customer. So if an installer is unable to complete a job, we complete it on behalf of the installers. We have done that in every case where we had an installer who was unable to complete a project and get it to PTO and you would expect that we \u2013 you should expect that we're going to continue to do that. That's the standard of care that we would provide for any customer inside the bank regardless of the channel that they came through regardless of the product. And so as those installer failures work their way through the system, we're going to take care of the customer. Erika Najarian : Thank you so much, Tim. Operator : We'll go next to Manan Gosalia at Morgan Stanley. Manan Gosalia : Hey, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on your comments on the level of cash. You noted that the LCR is 137%. Is there room to take on a little bit more duration and deploy some of this excess liquidity because you really need to be that far above the 100% threshold? Tim Spence : No, I think the other issue that you're facing right now is you're actually not getting paid to extend your duration given the inversion of the yield curve. I mean, the 10-year rate this morning is 4.2%, but we're earning [5.5%, 5.40%, 5.5%] (ph) on the front end of the curve. And given our rate outlook, we just don't think it makes sense at this point to be adding duration, giving up earnings today when we think over the horizon that we are not sure that [4.20%] (ph) is a good entry point. Manan Gosalia : Got it. And then Bryan, at our conference last month, you noted that you were seeing some competition driving loan spreads lower across the industry, and that's not necessarily a level that you're always comfortable with. Has that continued since then? And if yes, I know you don't want to lean in here, but with deposit costs coming down, is there some more room to lean in there and do? Bryan Preston : We're looking for the spots where it makes sense to continue to evaluate where loan growth should come from. As Tim talked about, we're certainly not going to sacrifice on earning appropriate returns as part of this. But just given some of the confidence that we have in terms of that we think we are going to see a cut this year, that we are going to start to see some relief and we are starting to see a little bit of the animal spirits in the market start to build. Like our pipelines are looking better than where they were three months ago, six months ago. So we think there's going to be opportunity to continue to see some growth in those areas and feel good about positioning. Manan Gosalia : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Matt O'Connor at Deutsche Bank. Tim Spence : Hey, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Hi, guys. There was an article earlier this week just talking about risk in the commercial bond market. And you guys have commercial real estate bond market that is. You guys have a good Slide on 43, just reminding all of us that a lot of it or most of it is agency. Can you talk to the non-agency CMBF and I guess kind of like almost like dumbed down what these [technical difficulty]. Tim Spence : You cut out there right at the end. Could you repeat the end of the question? Matt O'Connor: Just a line [technical difficulty] there thanks. Bryan Preston : Yeah. So we obviously have had a very cautious outlook from a commercial real estate perspective for a really long time. We do think that there is some value in participating in the market, and so where we've chosen to do that is in that non-agency portfolio in structured form. Because we do think those structural enhancements create a lot of credit protections for us. The article that you were mentioning this week was in regards to a specific structure called a SASB, a Single Asset Single Borrower structure, which funny enough, basically every commercial real estate loan is a Single Asset Single Borrower structure. But in our case for our broader portfolio, we have very little SASB within our portfolio. I had mentioned about a month ago at Morgan Stanley that amount was about $150 million for us and all of our bonds in that structure are continuing to be performing very, very strongly. The broader structure, we have nearly 40% credit enhancement that is in front of us from a first loss perspective. And the weighted average loan-to-value on the non-agency portfolio is still around 60%. We use some advanced analytic tools that the industry has available and we stress the portfolio regularly. As part of our process, our credit underwriting team underwrites and evaluates the top 10 loans in every structure to make sure that we are comfortable. We monitor the portfolio very closely and continue to have no concerns on what we're seeing. Matt O'Connor: Okay, perfect. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Christopher Marinac at Janney Montgomery Scott. Christopher Marinac : Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the commercial criticized and the fact that you had some of the charge-offs this quarter, would that improve those? And do you see any other kind of upgrade trends that could happen in future quarters? Bryan Preston : I mean yeah, the charge-offs are going to make both of those loans. And overall, charge-offs are coming out of the criticize. So yeah, any time we're going to have commercial charge-offs, it's going to improve. We were pretty stable quarter-over-quarter in our criticize. And we're starting to see it level off. And so we\u2019re not overly worried that we're going to see continued increases based on what we know today, based on unforeseen economic conditions. Tim Spence : Yeah, I think that the trend in criticized in general has actually been encouraging from my perspective. Greg, you may want to talk about this, but the only real growth we've seen in criticized are a few ABL facilities. If you look at it over the last 12 months, and we're well secured there and well within the collateral. Greg Schroeck : Exactly right. That was the driver of our first quarter increase in criticized assets. About 16% of our criticized assets are in that ADL fully conforming. We're not doing [SOFR] (ph), we're within assets. So I think the loss content. Now that said, you could have a weakness or well-defined weakness that we'll work out of. But I feel good about the trending that we've seen. And for the rest of this year, again based on what I know today, you know I would expect stable, criticized levels. Christopher Marinac : Great. Thank you both for the background. I appreciate it. Operator : And we'll go next to Gerard Cassidy at RBC. Tim Spence : Welcome back. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. I got a follow-up for you. Talking about loan growth, I noticed there was a small uptick in growth in the home equity portfolio. I think it was Slide 35, you guys showed this data. What's the opportunity for you? Because one of your Bank Americas are in uptick as well in home equity lending. In view of the fact that people are not refinancing their houses because of where rates are but there is a ton of equity in houses. Have you guys considered looking at this and maybe as an area of potential growth? I know the home equity has got a bad reputation from what happened in [\u201808, \u201809] (ph), but obviously the world is different today. Any of your thoughts here? Bryan Preston : Yeah, I tell people here all the time that the first rule of whole is that you have to stop digging. So it is nice after many years of having brackets around the change in balance number for home equity to see a turn of the tide there. I would not anticipate that it's a big driver of our loan growth over the course of the next few quarters, not because we wouldn't like it to be, but if you look at the amount of spending and home improvement in general right now, just look at the big home improvement retailers, you'll see that that's a category that remains pretty depressed. That said, I do think that the right strategy here for homeowners who have these 3% fixed rate mortgages is going to be to improve where they are as opposed to moving. And home equity is a great way to do that. So we would like to see more growth in home equity. We like the credit quality there. It just -- it's going to be slow and steady here in terms of the pickup. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Appreciate the color. Tim Spence : Absolutely. Operator : And that does conclude our Q&A session. I want to now turn the conference back over to Matt Curoe for closing remarks. Matt Curoe : Thank you, Audra, And thanks everyone for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the Investor Relations Department if you have any follow-up questions. Audra, you may now disconnect the call. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Curoe, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. Matt Curoe : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's third quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, our Chairman, CEO and President, Tim Spence, and CFO, Bryan Preston, will provide an overview of our third quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck, has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of October 18, 2024. And Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Bryan, we will open up the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim. Tim Spence : Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate uncertain ones. Our focus on stability, profitability and growth in that order has served us well in this dynamic operating environment and continues to produce strong and predictable results. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.78 or $0.85 excluding certain items outlined on Page 2 of the release, exceeding the guidance we provided in our Q2 earnings call. We produced a return on equity of 12.8%, the best among peers who have reported thus far and the most stable on a trailing 12-months basis. Our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 56.1% in the third quarter. Headcount declined 1% year-over-year despite continued investments in our growth strategies. We achieved sequential positive operating leverage for the second consecutive quarter without the need to expend shareholder capital on an investment portfolio restructuring charge and are in a position to achieve positive operating leverage on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. Despite changes throughout the year on interest rates, economic activity and market demand, as we come into the home stretch for 2024, I am pleased to say that Fifth Third should deliver NII, fees, expenses and credit costs within the full year guidance ranges we provided back in our January earnings call. Before I hand the call over to Bryan to provide additional detail on our financial results and outlook, I would like to take a minute to highlight the ways in which our strategic growth investments, which have been consistent over several years, are providing long-term organic growth that is not macro environment dependent. In our consumer bank, consumer households grew 2.7% over the prior year, punctuated by 6% household growth in the Southeast. The release of the FDIC's annual summary of deposits during the quarter provided an additional means to benchmark our performance. For the second year in a row, Fifth Third was number one among all large banks in year-over-year retail deposit growth measured on a capped branch deposit basis. We maintained or improved our market position in every market where we compete. In our Midwest markets, we maintained our number two overall position behind JPMorgan. In our Southeast markets, we maintained our number six overall position and significantly closed the gap to our top five goal. We grew retail deposits nearly 16% year-over-year and gained meaningful market share in 14 of our 15 focused MSAs in the Southeast. We will open up 19 de novo branch locations in the fourth quarter and plan to accelerate the pace of openings through 2028, at which time we will have nearly half our network from more than 500 branches in total in the Southeast. In our Commercial Bank, we continue to expand our middle market presence and to invest in commercial payments. Over the past 12-months, we have increased relationship manager headcount by over 20% in our Southeast and expansion markets, including opening commercial banking offices in Birmingham, Kansas City, and in the Central Valley. Third quarter middle market loan production was the highest in five quarters, led by the Southeast markets, which were up 20% sequentially and over 30% over the prior year. Our Commercial Payments business grew net fee equivalent revenues by 10% year-over-year in the quarter and we processed $4.3 trillion in dollar volume. Newline and our managed service offerings continue to lead the way in terms of growth that is delinked from our balance sheet. Over 40% of all new commercial payments relationships added this year have been payments led with no credit attached. In our Wealth and Asset Management business, we achieved record quarterly revenues growing by 12% year-over-year. Total assets under management have grown $12 billion in the past year or up 21% to $69 billion. Our Fifth Third Private Bank, Fifth Third Securities, and Fifth Third Wealth Advisors business units all continue to generate strong performance. Turning to capital, our strong profitability and disciplined balance sheet management are providing growth capacity and the opportunity to increase capital return to shareholders. This quarter, we increased our common dividend by 6% to $0.37 per share and executed $200 million in share repurchases. Even with these actions, our CET1 ratio increased to 10.8%. This will allow us to increase share repurchases in the fourth quarter to $300 million with the potential to increase further depending on the level of loan growth realized during the quarter. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year and the beginning of next, while we feel more optimistic today about the near-term outlook for the economy, we also recognize that crosscurrents, including reversals in interest rate rallies, volatility in jobs reports, stickiness in inflation, and geopolitical uncertainty could produce a wide range of potential economic outcomes. We will continue to manage Fifth Third with a focus on stability, profitability and growth in that order and to stay liquid and conservatively positioned while investing with the long-term in mind. Lastly, I'd like to take a moment to express our sympathies to all those who have been impacted by Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. We recognize the hardships that arise from such devastated events, and I would like to also thank all our employees who have answered the call to support our customers and communities at this time. In the day since the hurricanes, we've worked tirelessly to reopen branches and check-in on customers. We staffed the Fifth Third Financial Empowerment Bus to enable those who lost power and Internet access to apply for FEMA disaster relief. Your dedication to serve in the face of these natural disasters is inspiring. Thank you for living our core values. With that, I will turn it over to Bryan to provide more detail on the quarter and our outlook. Bryan Preston : Thanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. We're pleased that our third quarter results once again demonstrate the strength of our company. Our well positioned balance sheet and diversified fee income streams drove 3% sequential adjusted revenue growth. Net revenue performance combined with our ongoing expense discipline resulted in 5% sequential pre-provision net revenue growth in the third quarter on an adjusted basis. As Tim mentioned, our profitability remains strong, which allowed us to continue to accrete capital while we are purchasing shares and raising the quarterly common dividend 6%. Our CET1 ratio grew to 10.8% at the end of the quarter and our tangible book value per share, inclusive of AOCI, increased 14% compared to June 30, and 47% from a year ago. Highlighted on Page 2 of our release, our reported results were impacted by certain items, including costs related to the Visa, Mastercard interchange litigation and some severance recognized during the quarter as we continue to work to drive efficiencies and automation. Net interest income for the quarter was over $1.4 billion and increased 2% sequentially and net interest margin improved 2 basis points. Increased yields on new loan production were the primary driver of this improvement and more than offset the impact of increased interest bearing core deposit costs, which were well managed and up only 2 basis points compared to the prior quarter. With the Fed Funds rate cut at the end of the quarter, in September, we experienced our first month over month decrease in interest bearing core deposit costs during this rate cycle. While total average portfolio loans and leases were flat sequentially, we are seeing some signs of life. Loan production rebounded for both middle market and corporate banking with strong contributions from the Georgia and Chicago regions, as well as the energy and TMT verticals. For the commercial portfolio, average loans decreased 1% primarily due to increased paydowns and softness in revolver utilization, which declined 1% during the quarter to 35%. Average total consumer portfolio loans and leases were up 1% from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in indirect auto originations, which continued to be a significant contributor to our fixed rate asset repricing. During the quarter, we saw a 200 basis points of pickup on the front book, back book repricing in this portfolio. Diving further into deposits. Average core deposits were up 1% sequentially, driven by higher money market balances, offset by a decrease in savings and CDs. This core deposit balance performance combined with our well timed long-term debt issuance during the quarter has allowed us to pay down higher cost short-term wholesale borrowings. As a result, our rates paid on total interest bearing liabilities decreased 1 basis point sequentially. Our current focus remains on prudently managing deposit costs as we have officially entered the rate cutting cycle. Since mid-2023, we have been increasing our testing of price sensitivity in our deposit book to be well prepared for this phase of the cycle. We remain confident in our ability to manage liability costs to drive net interest income performance in the fourth quarter and beyond. Demand deposit balances as a percent of core deposits were 24% during the third quarter, down 1% from the prior quarter. This level is consistent with our expectations from July and we expect DDA mix to stay around 24% for the remainder of the year. By segment, average consumer and wealth deposits were stable sequentially, while commercial deposits increased 3%. We ended the quarter with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 132% and our loan to core deposit ratio was 71%, down 1% from the prior quarter. Moving on to fees. Excluding the impacts of the security gains and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest income increased 2% compared to the year ago quarter. As Tim mentioned, our commercial payments and wealth businesses delivered strong fee results with both achieving double-digit revenue growth over the prior year, driven by our sustained strategic organic growth investments in products and sales personnel. In commercial payments, revenue increased 10% as we continue to acquire new clients in traditional treasury management products, our managed service offerings and in Newline. In wealth, our AUM increased to $69 billion up 21% over the prior year, driven by strong inflows from Fifth Third Wealth Advisors and market performance. Fees were $163 million this quarter were a record high led by strong transactional activity at Fifth Third Securities and the fee benefit from the AUM growth. Our capital markets business rebounded this quarter as bond issuance and trading, as well as rate hedging activities picked up. Fees grew 9% over the prior year, also led by our debt capital markets business. The security gains of $10 million were from the mark-to-market impact of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which is more than offset in compensation expense. Moving to expenses, excluding these items noted on Page 2 of our release, our adjusted non-interest expense was up 3% from the year ago quarter and increased 2% sequentially, primarily due to increases in performance based compensation due to the strong fee generation, the impact of the previously mentioned non-qualified deferred compensation mark-to-market, and continued investments in technology, branches, and sales personnel. Shifting to credit, the net charge-off ratio was 48 basis points, slightly better than our expectations from early September and down 1 basis point sequentially. Commercial charge-offs were 40 basis points, down 5 basis points sequentially and consumer charge-offs were 62 basis points, up 5 basis points from a seasonally low second quarter. Early stage delinquencies 30 to 89 days past due decreased 2 basis points to 24 basis points, which remain near the lowest levels we have experienced over the last decade. NPAs increased $82 million during the quarter and the NPA ratio increased 7 basis points to 62 basis points, in line with our 10 year average and remains below the peer median level. Commercial NPAs increased $60 million from the prior quarter. Within our C&I portfolio, NPAs increased $20 million due to increased inflow activity, which given the nature of the commercial business will be uneven from quarter-to-quarter. On a year-over-year basis, C&I NPAs are down $7 million. Our CRE portfolio continues to perform well with no net charge-offs during the quarter and an NPA ratio of only 46 basis points, the increase in our commercial mortgage NPAs is related to a single senior living credit in our owner occupied portfolio. Consumer NPAs increased to $20 million from the prior quarter. Approximately half of this increase was driven by a recent change in policy related to our consumer nonaccrual processes to better align our policies across asset classes and primarily impacted our return to accrual timing for loans that are paying in full and current. Overall, we are not seeing any broad credit weakening across industries or geographies. From a credit perspective, we do not expect Hurricane Helene to have a material impact on losses and we are continuing to assess the impact of Hurricane Milton. Our ACL coverage ratio increased 1 basis point to 2.09% and included an $18 million reserve bill. We continue to utilize Moody's macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance and made no changes to our scenario weightings. Moving to capital, we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.8%, significantly exceeding our buffered minimum of 7.7%, reflecting strong capital levels. Our pro-forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the securities portfolio is 8.7%. We expect continued improvement in the unrealized losses in our securities portfolio, given that 59% of the AFS portfolio is in bullet or locked out securities, which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. Assuming the forward curve is realized, approximately 24% of the AOCI related to securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025, increasing tangible book value per share by 6% before considering any future earnings. 61% of the securities related AOCI should accrete back to equity by the end of 2028. During the quarter, we completed $200 million in share repurchases, which reduced our share count by 4.9 million shares. As we assess our capital priorities, we continue to believe that 10.5% is an appropriate near-term operating level. Moving to our current outlook, we anticipate continued growth in NII and NIM during the Q4, with NII up 1% sequentially, reflecting the impact of lower deposit rates and the continued benefit of fixed rate asset repricing, partially offset by the decrease in yield from our floating rate loan portfolio. This outlook assumes a 25 basis point cut in November and a 50 basis point cut in December. We would not expect any change to this outlook if fewer rate cuts were to occur. We expect average total loan balances to be stable to up 1% from the third quarter, with middle market and auto production offsetting mix demand in other asset classes. Fourth quarter adjusted noninterest income is anticipated to rise 3% to 4% compared to the strong Q3, largely due to a continued rebound in capital markets revenue and continued growth in commercial payments. Additionally, we expect fourth quarter TRA revenue to be $10 million down from $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Fourth quarter total adjusted noninterest expenses are expected to be stable compared to the third quarter as the increases in revenue-based compensation and the investments in branches and technology are largely offset by efficiencies achieved in other areas. Fourth quarter net charge-offs are projected to be similar or slightly down from the third quarter. Given the expected increase in loans during the fourth quarter, we anticipate an ACL build of $20 million to $40 million assuming no major change to the economic outlook. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis, and our PPNR guidance for the full year remains in line with our guidance from back in January. Our net interest income trajectory exiting the year continues to position us for record results in 2025, assuming no major economic or interest rate outlook changes. Finally, moving to capital. With our consistent and strong earnings, we now expect to increase our share repurchases in the fourth quarter to $300 million with potential further repurchases depending on the level of loan growth throughout the quarter. In summary, with our well positioned balance sheet, growing revenue streams and disciplined expense and credit risk management, we are set to generate strong and stable capital accretion, top quartile profitability and long-term value for shareholders, customers, communities and employees. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call up for Q&A. Matt Curoe : Thanks, Bryan. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up and then return to queue if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the call. Bryan, I was hoping you might be able to discuss sort of just the main puts and takes you see in the fourth quarter NII guide in particular. Curious about how you're thinking about the further trajectory of deposit betas, and sort of how that evolves over time given that you've had you've been very transparent about it and have an optimistic outlook there as well. Bryan Preston : Yeah. Absolutely. We continue to feel really good about the trajectory of the NII as well as the performance on the deposit front. As you know, we've spent a lot of time being prepared for this point in the cycle and things are playing out basically as we expected. When we look at both our results and peer results, the natural transition that you would expect is broker deposits, wholesale funding borrowings to start to come down. That's what we're seeing at the same play out. And then also then to start to see when that has been fully realized that movement in the beta. And that's exactly what we're seeing from us and the competition. For us, $35 billion of the index deposits, we were able to get the beta out of those as expected. To date, we're about in the mid-40s in terms of the betas that we've achieved since the 50 basis point rate cut. And we still have $13 billion, $14 billion of CDs that will be approaching maturities, about 75% of our CD portfolio matures between now and end of first quarter, as well as some additional promos that we'll see maturities on, and we'll continue to grind through the deposit costs in other areas of the book. So continue to feel really good about that as the trajectory plays out. And then the fixed rate asset repricing, that benefit continues to be a sequential tailwind for us and that's going to continue into the fourth quarter of next year. And that will be a big driver of the increase in NII from here. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Maybe looking at a little further, I know you've discussed generating record NII in 2025. Would love to hear any updated thoughts there, I guess, including what kind of lending rebound might be required to achieve that. It sounded like, you know, maybe a bit more optimistic on what, lending demand might look like given some of the signs of life you referred to in your opening remarks. Bryan Preston : Yeah. We are seeing some more activity there. We don't need, we don't need heroic loan growth to deliver record NII. The -- how the NII is delivered is obviously going to be very environment dependent. So shape of the curve is going to matter. We do expect to start to see some tailwinds on the loan growth side given what we've seen. The decreases from a commercial perspective, we think for the most part are behind us and we're seeing nice tailwinds in the consumer businesses that will be a big driver of how we transition into a loan growth from here. So we would like to see a little bit of loan growth. That certainly would be helpful in terms of delivering that record NII, but we feel good about the trajectory from here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys -- I posed this question to one of your peers yesterday and when I framed it out part of the response was it was a rosy outlook. So I'll give that as a caveat to you. But can you share with us, I'm curious and we're not -- I'm not asking for a specific '25 guidance, but if the Fed continues with dropping rates the way they appear to be in terms of the forward curve and their own outlook and we actually go from an inverted yield curve that we've lived with for over 2 years now to a positively sloping curve where the front end drops to 3%, 3.5%, the long end stays around 4% to 4.5%. Can you share with us what kind of impact that may have on your net interest income growth for 2025? Bryan Preston : Yes. Obviously, Gerard, we'll give more detail in next year on 2025. But if we can actually get a little bit more steepness in the curve, get the inversion out of the curve, that is very powerful for us from an NII perspective from here, because we would expect to see some relief on the liability side of the balance sheet. We do continue to have confidence that we will get cost out. And the thing that's not reflected in our forward guidance right now is an assumption that we're going to be able to maintain the fixed rate asset spreads. We do assume that there is compression as rates come down. And if we were to get to a normal shaped curve, there would be even more benefit then from the fixed rate asset we\u2019re pricing. And we would also have a little bit of opportunity to get some a little bit more economics out of duration in the security portfolio and then the swap portfolio over time. So that'd be a really productive environment for us. And we would see it over time, you would see a significant expansion of your net. Tim Spence : Yes. And at least for what it's worth, Gerard, I don't know that I see your outlook as being overly rosy in that regard. I just think it's probably a reflection of what both the Fed's actions and the data would tell us is realistic. It probably feels rosy because we just haven't seen it in an environment like that over a very long time, very long time period, right, 20 years or something like that, right? Either we had absolute rates of zero on the front end and a little bit of slope, but we've had this situation now where the front end was elevated and you had a historic level of inversion without a recession. If the Fed manages to land the plane here, the front end comes down. I think our view has been that the 10 year was probably going to be stickier. It just you're talking about on an intermediate term basis, inherently more inflationary dynamics, including the domestic manufacturing industrial policy, the green energy transition, the historic level of fiscal deficits that we're running, like those are all things that should work against the long end of the curve moving meaningfully lower. And potentially even you could see if the Fed settles out at the 3% or 3.5%, the long end of the curve move up a little bit. So you get more of a normal term premium. That sort of an environment, if it doesn't come along with some other issue, would be a really wonderful one for the balance sheet portion of our revenue. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then can you guys remind us, you talked about lifting up the buyback a bit in the fourth quarter. Bryan, you talked about how the tangible book value accretion, how it's going to come through just the burn off of that securities portfolio through the end of \u201825. Can you remind us in an environment where you know what the Basel III endgame requirements are, which hopefully we will obviously by this time next year. What should we expect in terms of how much of the capital that you guys are comfortable giving back to shareholders as a percentage of earnings, for example, in dividends and buybacks? Bryan Preston : Yeah. Our target right now in normalized environments, we like being in, say a 35% to 45% range from a dividend payout ratio perspective. The share buyback ultimately is driven by how much capacity we have relative to organic growth, because we do -- our preference would be to continue to invest on the organic front when we see good risk adjusted returns. And then with what's left, we manage capital via the share buybacks. Continue to feel good with the capital generation that we've been seeing that $200 million or $300 million of share buybacks feel about the right level. This quarter, we saw a little bit of benefit in RWA, which allows us to potentially have a little bit more share buyback. But with some loan growth coming in next year, hopefully, we'll be talking about a little bit lower buyback over time just because we've got a lot more organic opportunities to invest in. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hey. Just to follow-up on the, you said the loan production is the highest in five quarters and then quarter over quarter loan growth is flat, right? So if you could just give a little bit more detail like how much would loans have grown without paydowns? And why aren't you seeing more of this? It sounds like you said there's signs of life, but is it bigger than a bread box sort of what you think might come ahead? Bryan Preston : Yeah. Thanks, Mike. The paydowns for the quarter were around, say, $900 million a bit elevated from what we would typically see in some of the portfolios, as well as we had a utilization headwind of about 1%, because we did see the revolver utilization move down. That 1% decrease is another say $800 million. So the combination of those two were a decent driver ultimately from an overall average loan growth and in the period loan growth perspective. We're not expecting continued pressures at this point and we've seen utilization stabilize in the second half of the quarter and in the beginning of this quarter. So that doesn't feel like a headwind for us right now. The capital markets activity, obviously, it was a very robust capital markets activity in the second quarter compared to third quarter, we do think that fed into some of the pay down behaviors that we're seeing. But from here, we're expecting to get back to a little bit more normalized level and we think that helps then with loan growth from here. Mike Mayo : And as far as at the end of Penta win kind of expectations for the next several quarters over the next year, are you willing to give us any number yet? Do you think it will be more than 1% or 2% or I mean, I'm sure you're going to --? Bryan Preston : Yes, I mean, we gave average loan growth guide, obviously of up 1% sequentially. We'll get into 2025 in more detail next year. But in general, our objective would be to grow with the market plus a point or 2. Historically, the banking industry grows in line with GDP, nominal GDP type levels. And if we get back to that kind of environment and the industry gets back to overall aggregate growth, we would expect to be in line, if not outperforming the industry. Tim Spence : Yes. I think Mike, it's Tim. The one thing I maybe I'd add here, I am of the view that the factors that would lead to a more favorable environment for loan growth inside the banking system are potentially in front of us. Subject to one, who wins the election and probably more importantly, one of the things that both candidates are campaigning on actually make their way into policy and how they elect to govern. What we hear from clients when I'm out in the field is that, so one, the elevated level of rates have been challenging because there's a capital investments that don't make sense, that just don't pencil out in an environment where rates are higher. Two, because they are uncertain about what we're going to see in the election, they have been using cash flow from the businesses to pay down debt in lieu of investing it in other places. And three, you have this big buildup in inventory in the 2021, 2022, 2023 timeframe associated with people moving. I think we refer to it as the shift from just in time to just in case in inventories. As rates came up, we have seen I think the term for it that one of our distribution clients, our wholesale distribution clients use when I was out with them last week was destocking. So, less inventory, less bill of material across supply chains, which in turn and a focus on more inventory turns, just getting the balance sheet to work harder, which reduces the revolving credit borrowing needs. Like that can't go to zero, so you're not going to have a headwind there. If interest rates come down and more M&A and capital investment starts to make sense that hasn't worked, you should see a pickup on that front. And then if we continue to see more certainty as it relates to the trajectory of the economy and have the uncertainty attached to the election out of the equation, I think we could see a better environment across the banking system. And that coupled with the sales headcounts that we continue to make, we referenced that in the prepared remarks, should support the -- at to above market growth rate on the lending side of the equation that Bryan referenced earlier. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess just a couple of follow-ups. One, maybe starting with loan growth. Tim, you mentioned 2 things. 1, from a Fifth Third standpoint, are we still lapping derisking or running off the Shared National Credit book? I think it's down 11% year-over-year. Just give us a sense of is that book going to continue to decline as you kind of reduce your exposure there? And secondly, in your business, are you seeing any competition from non-bank, direct lenders, private credit that looks different today than it would have three, four, five years ago? Tim Spence : Yeah, sure. Good question. So we should be at the inflection point on the sort of impact of the RWA guide by the end of the year. I think we talked last year about the fact that we were trying to get everything done in the fourth quarter. There would be a little bit of a spillover into the first as you just got through normal timing. But we should be reaching the inflection point on that front where you don't have the less derisking, you bring in a focus on what would the profitability, the unit economics of those relationships look like in a world where you had a different perspective on capital levels and the value of the corporate cash that comes along with some of those larger relationships. As it relates to private credit, we do see it at the margins, principally in leveraged lending space. What I would tell you has happened is their focus on less structure, faster execution then has a little bit of a bleed over in other areas. And there is no question that the things that some of the private lenders are willing to do are not in line with the way that we want to run our portfolio. I think it was the Financial Times, the journal, but there was a piece about a week ago in the paper that talked about payment in kind or where I come from negative amortization lending was between 1/4 and 1/3 of the portfolios at most of the major private credit shops. That is definitely not something you would ever see at Fifth Third in an environment where the economic backdrop is benign and where you don't have a large percentage of your companies operating at distressed levels. It's just odd to see that amount of PIC lending going on. So, they're willing to do those things and we're not. By definition, they're going to scrape the most indebted companies out of the banking sector. Bryan Preston : And Ebrahim, it's Bryan. We put a little bit of detail on the PIC portfolio on Slide 24 of our slide. Yeah, $31 billion portfolio, it's down 11% year-over-year. So we are still facing lapping some of that headwind. Ebrahim Poonawala : But was the point that we are at a point where the 31.2 is close to where this book should bottom out? Bryan Preston : I think you're going to continue to see some runoff, but we do think you're getting back to the point where you'll start to see some production coming in and offsetting it. It may not be exactly at the floor, but the decreases should definitely be moderating. Tim Spence : The CIB pipeline, the middle market pipeline, which I think we referenced in response to Mike's question is that an all-time record level and the CIB pipeline, which would be where the majority of the Shared National credits would originate is at the highest level it has been in the year. So that you're seeing the turn there, which should support the decline in runoff increase in production and then inflection point in loan balances. Ebrahim Poonawala : And just the other question on capital allocation means your stock has done well. I'm not saying it's expensive, but it stayed well on tangible book when you look at it. Why not hold excess capital as opposed to picking up the pace of buybacks given that we might be in an improving economy, if that happens more capital good for growth. If it's worse it adds defensibility. Just talk through in terms of how you go through capital allocation and the whole discussion or analysis around holding on and building some more excess dry powder as opposed to accelerating buybacks from here? Bryan Preston : Yes. I mean, we feel really good, [indiscernible] about the earnings trajectory of the company. And we think given that, we feel like our stock is continues to be a good bargain for us and we think it's a good investment for us from a corporate perspective. We look at a couple of things on that front. We're generating a lot of capital every quarter. And so that actually gives us the ability to be very dynamic with our capital allocation decisions. We have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to generate the capital necessary for organic growth. And then if we wanted to slow down capital distribution via share buybacks because we see more opportunity or we need to get more defensive, we would be able to do that. Another component is just when you think about our industry and the 10% cost of equity, sitting on excess capital is a high cost for our shareholders. And so being in a position as we are right now and being able to go ahead and make some decisions and deploy at a time where we continue to feel really positive about our trajectory as a company and knowing that we have the flexibility with the income profile and the stability that we have going forward to degenerate the capital when we would need to, and if we think different opportunities would present themselves. That's really the thought process on how we're thinking about capital allocation from here. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of UBS. Erika Najarian : My first question is for you, Bryan. So you indicated that your deposit beta so far on the recent cuts are in the mid-40s. As we think about the speed of index deposit repricing and then retail, could you give us a sense of what you think the cadence could be as we go through the next 5 quarters? So a few of your peers have noted that it might not be a straight line, you know, path to the terminal beta given how quickly corporate can reprice and, you know, retail has sort of been awoken, so to speak, in terms of higher rates. So if you could speak to that and maybe speak a little bit to as you think about your deposits, you know, we haven't seen a neutral rate that's not zero for so long. So maybe help us, get a sense that if we get a neutral rate of, you know, 2.75% or 3%, what do you think your natural spread is or natural deposit rate is in that environment? Bryan Preston : Yeah. I mean, that is -- that is obviously a very interesting question. The shape of the curve is going to matter a lot, in that scenario as well. When we think about the when we think about the pacing of how the beta will come through, like you said, it is the commercial deposits will come through very quickly. The retail takes a little bit longer. The two primary drivers for us on that, it's the guarantee periods on the promotional offerings, which tend to be between say 45 and 90 days. And then it's the maturities of your CD portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, 75% of our CDs will mature between now and the end of first quarter. So to get the rest of the beta and get to that kind of cumulative beta that we have been targeting where high 50s kind of beta, For us, it will take about 2 quarters because the CD repricing is going to be a component of that now that that's $13 billion in book. From a natural level perspective, I think that is really tough to estimate. I mean, we're sitting here, at peak rates, we were at a 2.99-ish, was our peak interest bearing core deposit cost versus 5.50 Fed Funds level. We would expect to see a little bit of compression potentially in that spread. But being able to maintain 150 to 200 basis points of deposit spread seems like a potentially achievable scenario. One big question on that, Eric, another one that would obviously be a big question which is where, you have those demand through the loan growth change over time. And if you got -- if you\u2019ve done a decent curve shape back to Gerard's question and you've got opportunities for loan growth. You're going to have some opportunities to be a little bit more competitive to raise more deposits and ultimately drive better NII. And at the end of the day, we're not managing the deposit betas, we're managing the NII and profitability trajectory and those are the decisions and the trade-offs we'll make. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second question is for Tim. Tim, the feedback from investors has always been quite positive in terms of the forward looking way of how you look at the world. And as we think about 2025, I guess, it doesn't it feels like given record NII and your fee income should benefit if activity levels come back in general in an even bigger way next year. It feels like the expense run rate that you posted year-over-year this quarter to 3% sounds it feels more appropriate. Obviously assuming that revenues grow above that. As we think about 2025, is it right for us to until we get guides from you, put growth and expenses as a placeholder? And as we think about 2025, what are the big projects that you feel like you're ready to retackle and revisit that you may have pulled back on in \u201824 because the NII dollars were coming down? Tim Spence : Yeah. So thank you. I think there was a compliment and a question in there. I appreciate both. You've heard me reference, I think the old saying that Cincinnati invented hustle in the past. That dates back to Pete Rose's nickname and the fact that he sprinted to first base on a walk. I think that ethos is, I think, a part of the way that we try to run the company, right, is to sprint to first on a walk. So we try to work on next year's problems and the year after that this year as opposed to waiting for that environment to materialize. And that's part of why I think we made the NIM turn, right, our NIM trough and then grew in the first quarter before most of our peers. The NII inflected positive in the second quarter over the first quarter, which was before most of the peers. We got to real sequential positive operating leverage this quarter versus the last quarter and we're saying we'll get there year over year next year. Like none of that involved us holding back on investments we thought were important to the company or would make sense, right? We have -- we're going to have built 30 plus branches this year in an environment where we were trying to manage expenses. We continued forward on the platform modernization. The acquisitions we made on the commercial payment side of fintech companies last year, we've continued to feed this year. And the hiring, as I mentioned, on the sales force and both in wealth management and in the middle market have been pretty significant. So you should expect us to do the same sorts of things next year and to expect the company through other efficiency initiatives to help self-fund the investments along the way. We don't view strategic planning as an investment request process. It's principally a resource allocation process. So I don't know that I helped you with a specific number for 2025, you have to wait till January to get that. But the annualized expense run rate of the bank over a period of time has been call it 3%, if you look at it. So that's certainly if you were going to use the past, averaged through more benign periods and more challenging periods would be where you'd start. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia of Morgan Stanley. Manan Gosalia : I wanted to ask about index deposits. Can you talk about how they've behaved over time? So I guess the question is that as rates fall and the rates on those index deposits fall, is there a chance that some of those move into other deposit products with exception pricing? Or does that not really happen based on historical experience? Bryan Preston : You'll see some people that try to do some negotiations on deposit costs. Those are things that always occur, but those are things that we are typically able to manage fairly well. The reality is you get paid a better spread as a depository on an index deposit because you're taking the risk ultimately on market movements. Whereas on a managed account, it's typically a wider spread because we have more ability to manage it. So we it's something that we've had good experience with behaving, controlling it through our pricing and through our discipline around that process. We're not overly concerned about reverse migration from index back into managed rate being a headwind from a beta perspective. Manan Gosalia : Got it. And then maybe just separately on credit, on Slide 28, you're showing NCOs and NPAs reaching normalized levels. I know you noted that you're not seeing any signs of credit weakening. Can you give us some more color there? What gives you some confidence that things are just normalizing here? Is it that rates are going down, so that helps you on the credit side? Is it just what you're seeing on the roll rates? Maybe what helps this to stabilize from here? Greg Schroeck : Yes, it's Greg. I'll take that one. A couple of things, you look at our delinquency, the delinquencies continue to be at all-time low levels. Our criticized assets actually went down by $8 million quarter-over-quarter. We had the increase in NPAs. On the commercial side, those were driven by 5 names and 5 different industries. We've been very consistent in talking about a very diverse portfolio, and it continues to be very diverse. On the consumer side, we're seeing a little bit of softness on dividend, see a little bit of softness in the RV portfolio. When you look at the 2022, 2023 origination vintages, they're underperforming across many of the consumer asset classes. We see the same thing in the portfolio, specifically in dividend and RV. But the securitization data from other originators will tell you the same thing. We're actually outperforming those indexes, that securitization data by almost 50, 60 basis points. And so I would expect dividend to be a little bit elevated for the next quarter or two, but I'm highly confident that we will work through those vintages and it comes back down to more normalized level in that 125 level. So we're just not seeing anything within the portfolio, it's commercial or consumer that's causing additional concerns, it's been pretty stable. Our borrowers have continued to behave. We see the commercial real estate portfolio. We've got virtually no delinquencies, very, very minimal non-performing assets in that commercial real estate portfolio. So across the board, that diversification, that strategic play of building out a through the cycle portfolio has played well for us, and I would expect that to continue in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. On Slide 10, you've got some pie charts here you showed before just showing the mix shift from the Midwest to being more balanced. And, I guess the question is, as we look out the next few years, you show the split getting to 50-50, which is still a pretty meaningful reshift from here. So how do you get there? Is it simply harvesting what you've done, a combination of harvesting and building? Is there a buy component of that as well? Tim Spence : Yeah, there's no buy component in there. That's the old fashioned way, which is one new branch at a time and the right marketing and product strategies to support the increase in distribution. So if you look at the branches we've built, Matt, they're performing very well. We've talked in the past about the fact that the performance at this stage and having built more than 100 of them is pretty predictable. And they reach a point where they sort of saturate their catchment area in about seven years, right? They break even within two and then they make this pivot to continuing growth. So the average age of the de novo right now is going to be like call it 2 years, 2.5 years at most. So there is a 5-year tailwind we'll get from the 100 that are already in the ground and operational. Plus we have been building about 30 to 35 a year that number should move up into the sort of 40 to 50 range on an annualized basis, just based on what we have in the pipeline. And as those branches come online, you will see that mix shift play out first in the allocation of the physical distribution and then behind that over time as they mature the mix of the deposit base on the retail side overall. Matt O'Connor: Okay. So that's super helpful. So a lot of maturing of what you've already done will move the needle quite a bit. And then just -- Tim Spence : It will. I don't see it short over your retail deposit growth that I cited from the FDIC summary deposits. It's visible there. Matt O'Connor: Thank you. And then, just separately, I know there's been a lot of discussion on net interest income and kind of drivers of the NIM. And I'm sorry if I missed it, but have you guys talked about this concept of like normalized NIM, looking at a few years as you get the fixed rate asset repricing and whatever rates do break the forward curve, any concept of normalized NIM? Bryan Preston : Yeah. I mean, that's, again, it's another tough one. Because what does the environment look like? What does the shape of the curve look like out in the future? If you just take the cash position that we're holding today, we're at we're north of $20 billion of cash. We're up almost $9 billion year-over-year. Every $1 billion of excess cash that we're holding is a basis point to have on NIM. So just getting $10 billion out over the next year and hopefully having some opportunities to deploy that into the loan portfolio that could add 15 to 20 basis points to our NIM alone. We're going to see NIM growth from here just with the continued repricing of the portfolio. From a fixed rate asset perspective, that will continue to take that just takes a little bit more time to play out. But if you get a little bit of relief on the front end, a more normalized curve, it's front and down, I mean, it's not unreasonable to think we could be talking about getting back to what was 315 to 325 NIM in a reasonable time horizon. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac of Janney Montgomery Scott. Christopher Marinac : I wanted to ask about some of the large banks who have been placed under regulatory orders this year. Does that create new business opportunities for you beyond your already organic pipeline? Tim Spence : I mean, I think any time there is a limit on someone else's ability to grow, it means that the rest of the industry has to have the capacity to be able to absorb the growth in the market. So I guess in that sense, yes, just tactically. I think more strategically, the more disciplined you are about the way you run your business, the better you do in moments when there's any sort of disruption somewhere else, right? So I wouldn't wish significant regulatory problems on anybody. There\u2019s no fun to work through, but they do tend to create opportunities at the margins for other banks that are in a strong position and have the ability to grow in an environment where others may not. Christopher Marinac : Great, Tim. Thank you for that. And just a quick follow-up on, sort of adjusted returns over time. Does lower interest rates help you get your returns or does it make it more challenging? Bryan Preston : Lower interest rates, as long as that comes along with a, normalization of the yield curve that would certainly be very helpful to returns over time. A low flat curve is a challenging environment for the banking system. Operator : We have a follow-up question from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hey. I was just wondering, this is a big picture question. You guys give the sense that you're investing more for growth than others. Do you have any metric on how much you make in your organic investments and what sort of returns you get on those? I'm thinking about the Southeast branches or wealth or commercial payments and it kind of goes back to that earlier question, maybe you shouldn't buy back so much stock if you have so many opportunities for growth or high class problem if you get there? Tim Spence : Yes, I mean, we look at all of these things. The easiest comparable across the different investment types is probably just IRR, Mike, right, and time to breakeven. So the IRR of the branches in the Southeast has been running in the 18% to 20% range and the time to breakeven has been a couple of years, right? If you were to look at the small acquisitions we've made to support commercial payments, we were targeting IRRs in the 20s in those cases in part because you had a more nascent business and it\u2019s less predictable after than when you built 100 branches and you know what you're going to get out of the next location that you build. So in general, we feel really good about anything that we can get done in that sort of 15% to 25% range, subject to the execution risk that's attached. The more uncertain, the more nascent the strategy, the higher the return you would expect to get out of it and then what proven strategies. Obviously, lower the execution risk premium that you would need to place on them. I don't think we are constraining the investment rate. Like if you just look at the Southeast, JPMorgan has built the most branches down there over the course of the past five years, they're at 180 or something like that. I think Fifth Third is number two and I believe BofA is number three and then there's a pretty wide gap between that and everybody else. And I know I don't have to tell you that we're a little bit smaller than BofA and JPMorgan. So we are -- we think being appropriately aggressive in terms of the investment rate down there. And at least at the moment, I don't know that if we said, hey, we're not going to buy back stock, we don't have an alternative use for that capital on an organic basis that we would be thinking that we would deploy it toward. Bryan Preston : And Mike, we are accelerating the investments, as Tim mentioned, on improving strategies. It's part of why we're going from almost 20 to 30 branch builds a year to 50 plus branch builds a year. So we have more confidence that gives us point of view of an area we want to invest in. And then the other limiter for us is always going to be the analysts that are worried about positive operating leverage because that's the trade-off we care about as well. Mike Mayo : Just to push back on that last point, I mean, I hear you if you get those sorts of IRRs and you're accelerating your branch build, but it's come set at a time when I think some of the Southeast competitors have woken up, recovered, like you less unrealized securities losses going from defense to offense. Do you have that change versus the last few years? And you also have the likes of some of those big banks that you mentioned with spending so much more in technology and digital. So don't you think it might be tougher in the next few years than it's been in the past few years? Tim Spence : I don't know. I don't think that the Southeast was uncompetitive the last five years, right? I think that -- what you're just -- you're constantly looking at is, are we making the right set of investments given the competitors that we have and our value proposition relative to others. I completely agree the amount of money that is getting deployed into technology investment on the part of the large banks is eye-popping. But if you look at the value proposition, like go pull up the consumer -- lead consumer checking account offering for any of those large banks and for Fifth Third or some other regional and tell me how that materialized into some substantially better value proposition. I actually think in many cases what you would see is the opposite as it's been the regionals who led on consumer prep friendly product innovation. It's definitely been true of Fifth Third, but it's not just been Fifth Third in terms of the offerings there. So we are not running the bank to be able to take share in uncompetitive environments. We run the bank to be able to take share in very competitive environments. And I expect the level of competition is going to stay high, not that it's going to get better or for that matter get worse. Operator : That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Matt for closing remarks. Matt Curoe : Thank you, and thanks everyone for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up calls or questions. Operator, we may now disconnect the call. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Matt Curoe, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Matt Curoe : Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Fifth Third's fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. This morning, our Chairman, CEO and President, Tim Spence; and CFO, Bryan Preston, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter results and outlook. Our Chief Credit Officer, Greg Schroeck has also joined for the Q&A portion of the call. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the GAAP results, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. These statements speak only as of January 21, 2025, and Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to update them. Following prepared remarks by Tim and Bryan, we will open up the call for questions. With that, let me turn it over to Tim. Tim Spence : Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. At Fifth Third, we believe great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments, but rather by how they navigate uncertain ones. They achieved this through a diversified business mix, defensive balance sheet positioning, and by obsessing over the details in day-to-day operations while investing for the long-term. This morning, we reported earnings per share of $0.85 or $0.90, excluding certain items outlined on Page 2 of the release, exceeding the guidance we provided in our third quarter earnings call. We achieved an adjusted return on equity of 13.7%, the highest among all peers, who have reported thus far. Revenues for the quarter grew 2% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. Core adjusted PPNR exceeded $1 billion for the first-time in several quarters and our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to 54.7%. The fourth quarter capped the year was the industry outlook for interest rates, loan growth, regulation and capital markets activity all changed significantly. Despite this, we delivered strong and predictable results. Our full year return on assets of 1.17%, return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI, of 14%, and efficiency ratio of 57.1%, all finished among the top in our peer group. We were one of only a few banks to achieve full year guidance for NII, fees, expenses, PPNR and net charge-offs that was provided back in January. Our NIM inflected in the first quarter as we said it would. NII inflected in the second quarter as we said it would. We returned to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter on both a sequential and a year-over-year basis, as we said we would. We resumed share repurchases in the second quarter, and raised our dividend in the third quarter. In total, for the year, we returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, while also increasing our CET1 ratio by more than 20 basis points. Competitive barriers are exceedingly difficult to build in the banking business. The only way we know how to build them is to invest continuously in a limited number of strategies over a sustained period of time. Our growth strategies are well-known and have been consistent for several years now. Their impact is evidenced in our 2024 results and reflected in the third-party accolades that we received during the year. Our investments to expand our Southeast branch footprint and in our differentiated momentum banking platform continued to drive outsized growth in granular low cost deposits. For the second consecutive year, Fifth Third was number one among all large banks in year-over-year retail deposit growth measured on a cap deposit basis. We generated year-over-year household growth of 2.3%, punctuated by 6% growth in the Southeast. And we also won JD Power's Retail Banking Satisfaction Award for the Florida region. The 31 de novo branch locations we opened in 2024 and the 60 new branches we expect to open in the Southeast in 2025, should set us up well to continue to gain market share. On lending, our investments to generate granular diversified loan originations without compromising on pricing or risk gained momentum throughout the year and contributed to a strong finish. On a sequential end-of-period basis, we grew loans 3%, or a bit more than 1% faster than the HA. Growth was balanced between consumer and commercial and across product categories, including from our through the cycle commitment to the auto business, strong C&I production from the middle market and key CIB verticals, and continued growth from our Provide and Dividend Fintech platforms. In the middle market, we expanded our Relationship Manager headcount by 25% in the Southeast and in our expansion markets over the course of 2024. Fourth quarter middle market loan production reached a three year high, increasing over 50% sequentially and over 70% year-over-year, and we also saw a modest uptick in utilization. Our C&I pipelines in middle market are at record levels heading into 2025, and we expect to add another 5% to 10% to RM headcount over the course of the year. On fees, our Commercial Payments business grew fee revenues by 8% in 2024, and we processed $17 trillion in volume. Our managed services offerings and Newline led the way on growth and nearly 40% of all new Commercial Payments relationships had no credit attached. In addition, Care Sheet, Global Finance, and This Week in Fintech, all recognized Newline with awards for technology innovation. The ramp from new and expanded relationships won during the year, including Stripe and Trustly, will give us a head start on a strong 2025. In Wealth and Asset Management, total assets under management grew 17% year-over-year, up roughly $10 billion to $69 billion in total AUM. Our Fifth Third Private Bank, Fifth Third Securities and Fifth Third Wealth Advisors business units all delivered strong performance, and we were recognized for the sixth consecutive year as Best Private Bank by Global Finance. Last, we continued to make good progress on modernizing our operating platform. We completed general ledger and clearing platform conversions during the year and launched term deposits on a modern cloud core. Our cross functional lean value streams have achieved more than $150 million in annualized savings, and headcount declined 1% year-over-year. These initiatives continue to improve execution quality and provide funding for the investments in our growth strategies. Looking ahead to 2025, there are many reasons to feel optimistic about the banking sector. The underlying economy is solid and most business owners are more optimistic about 2025 than they were about 2024. The combination of front end rates above zero and some steepness in the yield curve is a more constructive setup than we've had in quite some time. We may also be on the cusp of a shift in the direction of regulation, which could unlock new opportunities. With that said, recent history is a good reminder that things can shift very quickly. The modern economy is the most complex adaptive system the world has ever seen and complex systems react to change in unexpected ways. Come what will, we are pleased with the positioning of our company. We remain confident in achieving record NII in 2025, and delivering full year positive operating leverage across a range of interest rate environments. Our credit portfolio remains well diversified and proactively managed, and the risks are well understood. We will continue to focus on stability, profitability, and growth in that order, and to stay balanced in our positioning while investing with the long term in mind. Before I turn it over to Bryan, I want to say thank you to our employees for the way you support our customers and our communities, and for your commitment to getting 1% better every day. You make our company the special place it is. With that, Bryan will provide additional details on the quarter and our outlook for 2025. Bryan Preston : Thanks, Tim, and thank you to everyone joining us today. Our fourth quarter results demonstrated the ongoing strength and momentum of our company. With a resilient balance sheet and diversified income streams, we achieved 3% sequential growth in adjusted revenue. That revenue performance, combined with our ongoing expense discipline, resulted in a 5% sequential pre-provision net revenue increase in the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis. As Tim mentioned, our strong profitability allowed us to return over $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2024, including the $300 million share repurchase executed in the fourth quarter. We delivered $3 billion of sequential growth in end-of-period loans and maintained our CET1 ratio consistent with our near-term operating target of 10.5%. In addition to the $630 million in stock we repurchased in 2024, our tangible book value per share, inclusive of the impact of AOCI, increased 6% from the previous year despite the 10 year treasury increasing nearly 70 basis points. The strategy in our investment portfolio to focus on investments with known cash flows through bullet and locked out securities will continue to benefit us as these positions pull to par. Even with the increase in rates, the securities we maintained and available for sale realized an improvement in our unrealized loss position since the end of last year. Highlighted on Page 2 of our release, our reported results were impacted by certain items. These include costs related to the Visa/MasterCard interchange litigation and a contribution to our foundation, partially offset by benefits related to an updated estimate for the FDIC special assessment and the resolution of a prior period state tax item. Net interest income for the quarter continued its positive momentum, increasing 1% sequentially to $1.4 billion with net interest margin improving 7 basis points. Proactive balance sheet management resulted in a 35 basis point reduction in the cost of interest-bearing deposits. These actions, along with the loan growth and the continued repricing benefit on fixed rate assets, more than offset the decrease in yield on our floating rate assets. Loan growth accelerated in December, resulting in a strong period end loan growth of 3% with average loans increasing 1% sequentially. Period end commercial loans were up 3%, and average balances were relatively stable. We saw broad based strength in production across our middle market footprint, led by our Chicago, Indiana, Carolinas and Georgia regions, as well as a rebound in our corporate banking verticals. The utilization improved a point, some of which we expect is normal year end seasonality. Average and period end consumer loans were up 2% from the prior quarter, reflecting increases in indirect auto and residential mortgages. Both asset classes also saw sequential increases in yield due to the continued front book, back book repricing benefits on these fixed rate portfolios. Shifting to deposits. Average core deposits were up 1% sequentially, driven by higher interest checking balances in Commercial. This core deposit performance combined with the flexibility provided by our elevated cash position, allowed us to meet our expected down rate beta targets and further reduce higher cost short-term wholesale borrowings. Interest bearing core deposits peaked at 2.99% in August and were down to 2.49% in the month of December, representing a core deposit beta in the upper 50s. Total core deposits have increased by $1.6 billion over that same horizon. As always, our focus remains on prudently managing total funding costs, while maintaining a strong liquidity position. We are very pleased with the 38 basis point sequential decrease in interest bearing liability costs. Our balanced approach will continue to provide us with flexibility needed to continue our NII growth trajectory to a record 2025, as we head into another uncertain rate environment. Demand deposit balances as a percent of core deposits remained at 24% during the quarter, consistent with our expectations. Balances were stable on both an end-of-period and average basis compared to the third quarter. We believe this balance level will be maintained as short-term rates are likely to be relatively stable over the near-term. We ended the quarter with full Category 1 LCR compliance at 125% and our loan-to-core deposit ratio was 73%, up 2% from the prior quarter. Moving to fees. During the fourth quarter, we updated the non-interest income captions on our income statement to better align disclosures to our most significant business activities, which includes the addition of commercial payments and capital markets line items. The appendix of our presentation provides more detail on the caption changes. Excluding the impacts of the securities gains and losses and the Visa total return swap, adjusted non-interest income in the fourth quarter increased 5% compared to the same quarter last year. Capital Markets, Wealth and Commercial Payments all delivered strong fee results, driven by our sustained strategic growth investments in products and sales personnels. Capital markets grew 16% over the prior year with increases in loan syndications, debt capital markets, and M&A advisory revenue. We continue to see activity below prior year levels in our customer hedging and institutional brokerage fees. In Wealth, fees grew 11% over the prior year to $163 million due to AUM growth and increased transactional activity at Fifth Third Securities. The new Commercial Payments caption includes TAM (ph) fees and earnings credits that were previously included in service charges on deposits and commercial card and sponsorship revenue that was previously reported in card and processing revenue. Compared to the prior year, Commercial Payments revenue increased 7%, driven by treasury management net fee equivalent growth, which was up 11%. We continue to acquire new clients in treasury management products in our managed services and in Newline. The securities losses of $8 million were primarily from the mark-to-market impact of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, which is offset in compensation expense. Moving to expenses. Excluding the items noted on Page 2 of our release, our adjusted non-interest expense was up 1% from the year ago quarter and decreased 1% sequentially. The previously mentioned deferred compensation mark reduced expenses by $7 million for the quarter compared to expense increases of $10 million and $13 million in the prior and year ago quarters, respectively. Excluding the impact of the deferred comp mark, the year-over-year expense growth was 2% and sequential expense growth was 1%. While investments in technology, branches and sales personnel have and will continue to drive expense increases, these costs continue to be partially funded through the savings generated by our value stream efficiency programs. Shifting to credit. The net charge-off ratio was 46 basis points, in line with our expectations for the quarter and down 2 basis points sequentially. Commercial charge-offs were 32 basis points, down 8 basis points. Consumer charge-offs were up 6 basis points, which primarily reflects the normal seasonal fourth quarter uptick we see in our indirect auto and card portfolios, as well as the continued seasoning of the 2022 vintages in our Solar and RV portfolios. Consistent with broader industry data, the 2022 consumer vintage appears to be a modest underperformer relative to other origination periods. Early stage delinquencies, 30 to 89 days past due, increased only 1 basis point and remained near the lowest levels we have experienced over the last decade. Our NPA ratio increased 9 basis points sequentially to 71 basis points. Commercial NPAs contributed $122 million to the increase from the prior quarter and consumer NPAs were up only $15 million. Within Commercial, our CRE portfolio continues to perform well with no net charge-offs during the quarter and a stable NPA ratio of 46 basis points. Additionally, total Commercial criticized assets decreased by $435 million, an 8% reduction during the quarter. Our provision expense for the quarter resulted in a $43 million build in our allowance for credit losses. This build was primarily attributable to the strong growth in period end loans and a modest deterioration in the Moody's macroeconomic scenarios. Our ACL coverage ratio was 2.08%, down 1 basis point from the third quarter. We made no changes to our scenario weightings during the quarter. Moving to capital. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.5%, significantly exceeding our buffered minimum of 7.7% and consistent with our near-term target. Our pro forma CET1 ratio, including the AOCI impact of the securities portfolio is 8.1%, up 32 basis points year-over-year. We anticipate continued improvement in the unrealized losses in our securities portfolio, given that approximately 60% of the fixed rate securities in our AFS portfolio are in bullet or locked out structures, which provides a high degree of certainty to our principal cash flow expectations. Assuming the forward curve is realized, approximately 18% of the AOCI related to the securities losses will accrete back into equity by the end of 2025, increasing tangible book value per share by 5% before considering any future earnings. During the quarter, our $300 million share repurchase reduced our share count by 6.7 million shares. Moving to our current outlook. We entered 2025 with strong momentum and a resilient balance sheet and remain confident in our ability to achieve record NII and full year positive operating leverage. We expect full year NII to increase 5% to 6%. This outlook uses the forward curve at the start of January, which assumed 25 basis point rate cuts in March and October. We would not change our NII guidance for 2025, even if we assume that no cuts will occur. We expect full year average total loans to be up 3% to 4% compared to 2024, with the increase primarily driven by the broad based improvement in C&I combined with continued growth in auto loans. We are assuming that the cash position, securities portfolio, and commercial revolver utilization, all remain relatively stable throughout 2025. Full year adjusted non-interest income is expected to be up 3% to 6%, reflecting continued revenue growth in Commercial Payments, Capital Markets, and Wealth and Asset Management, partially offset by the continued run-off of the operating lease business, muted mortgage originations given the rate environment and the year-over-year impact of the final TRA revenue occurring in 2024. We expect full year adjusted non-interest expense to be up 3% to 4% compared to 2024. Our expense outlook assumes accelerated branch openings in high growth Southeast markets and continued sales force additions in middle market, Commercial Payments and Wealth to increase our production capacity to support our strategic growth initiatives. In total, our guide implies full year adjusted revenue to be up 4% to 6%, PPNR to grow in the 6% to 7% range, and positive operating leverage closer to 2%. Moving to credit. We expect 2025 net charge-offs to be between 40 basis points and 49 basis points. Assuming no changes in macroeconomic forecasts, we expect the provision to build between $50 million and $100 million due to loan growth. Moving to our outlook for the first quarter. We expect NII to be flat with the fourth quarter of 2024 as the benefits of loan growth, fixed rate asset repricing and the continued reduction in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities should offset the impact of two fewer days. We expect average total loan balances to increase 2% in the first quarter due to continued momentum in C&I and auto. Excluding the impact of the TRA, we expect non-interest income to be down 6% to 7% compared to the fourth quarter, mainly due to normal seasonality in card spend, capital markets activity and other Commercial Banking revenue. First quarter adjusted non-interest expense is expected to be up 8% compared to the fourth quarter. As is always the case, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding the seasonal items of approximately $100 million, expenses would be flat in the first quarter. We expect first quarter charge-offs to be in the 45 basis point to 49 basis point range and expect the ACL build will be $10 million to $25 million due to loan growth. Finally, we expect to execute $225 million in share repurchases in the first quarter, with future quarter share repurchases dependent on the level of loan growth. We will continue to target our CET1 ratio around 10.5%, while we await more clarity around the future of the capital rules and other regulations. In summary, with our resilient balance sheet, diversified revenue streams, and disciplined expense and credit risk management, 2025 is set to be a year of continuing long-term investments, record NII, positive operating leverage, and strong returns for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Matt to open the call for Q&A. Matt Curoe : Thanks, Bryan. Before we start Q&A, given the time we have this morning, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, and then return to the queue, if you have additional questions. Operator, please open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe Tim or Bryan, I was hoping you could just provide a little more context as to how you see loan demand developing through the year. Your commentary, I'd say recently has been much more encouraging. You discussed things like the robust commercial line -- commercial pipelines, etc. So just maybe some additional color on how you see things developing. Tim Spence : Yeah. No problem, Scott. I know this will -- a little bit like salt in the wound for a Miami grad, but we just needed to demonstrate that it isn't only Ohio State that can put points up on the board early in the year. And I mean, look, we were happy with the fourth quarter, obviously, largely because we could see a building in the pipeline for a while. We just needed to get through the election to start to see some of it pull through. And I think it along with the sort of, as sales force additions, continued activity are going to set us up nicely, like, we've talked a lot about the importance of having diversified loan origination sources and because sometimes some channels would work when others didn't. I think in the fourth quarter, most of the channels did. On the consumer side of the equation, auto is strong for us all year, last year. I think we were asked a lot when there were several other banks getting out of the business why we were committed to it, and we talked about the fact that it's cyclical, but it can be great at certain points in the cycle. And we're at one of those points where it's quite beneficial. So we think we'll have good things there. Home equity, both the fintech platforms had a strong finish to the year, and I think we'll continue to grow moderately coming into this year. On the Commercial side of the equation, the growth that we saw was really broad based. We got about a quarter's worth of production in the six weeks following the election as the backlog and the pipeline started to clear. On a sequential basis, 13 of the 15 regions and two out of three verticals roughly showed growth during the quarter. And while we did get a little bit of a benefit from seasonality, in particular, in areas like mortgage warehouse and trained finance. I think the underlying characteristics would support above market growth. And we're still sitting on a record pipeline level in the middle market, that is definitely supported by the sales force additions that we made last year, you can see that in the numbers. And we got a 1% pickup in utilization, which I just think, is encouraging. And we asked clients -- we got to talk to about two dozen clients following the election, just about how they feel about the year. More than 80% of them indicated they were more optimistic for 2025 than they were 2024. About half of them indicated they were accelerating planned investments, about a third of those said they were going to support those investments through increased credit utilization or new facilities. There's definitely a lot more optimism on the M&A front. The flies in the ointment here since that's what I always worry about. Labor availability is the single biggest concern that we hear from middle market clients and more so than inflation or interest rates at this point or even supply chain issues, tied to tariffs. So overall, I think, it's an encouraging outlook. And just as the game last night reminded us of Notre Dame's late rally, you don't want to declare victory at the end of the first quarter either. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Thank you. And like all the analogies in there, so thanks. And then, Bryan, I think you had suggested you wouldn't change the guide based on more or fewer cuts implies you're, I guess, pretty agnostic to changes in rates. How would you characterize your rate sensitivity now versus where you'd like it to be? I'm guessing, it's pretty much where you wanted, but would just appreciate your thoughts. Bryan Preston : Yeah. We're pretty happy, right, where we are. We're fairly neutral right now. And as Tim talked about, the diversification of our loan origination platforms as well as the inherent flexibility that the liquidity on our balance sheet provides. It gives us a lot of levers to be modest -- a little bit asset sensitive or a little bit liability sensitive depending on what the environment provides. So we like that positioning in this environment right now. Scott Siefers : Perfect. All right. Thank you, guys. Tim Spence : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I'm going to ask a long question just looking for a really short answer. And that is -- look, you talked about record pipelines in middle market, 1% higher loan utilization, 13 to 15 markets have picked up, two of three verticals have picked up. It seems like your customers are more positive. Are you calling the turn for commercial loan growth for Fifth Third? Are you calling it for the industry? Are you calling it for both? And what's your confidence level around that? Tim Spence : If you want a short answer, then my answer is maybe. But the -- Mike, the thing that I always worry about is uncertainty, right? I think I said in my prepared remarks, the economy is a pretty complex system. It is resistant to simulation and it can change pretty unpredictably. The backdrop is more favorable than it has been. Like, if you're a customer, you have a 100 basis points benefit in rate cuts. You have more certainty over the direction of travel on regulation. I think we're going to have to watch a lot of the discussions we had on the labor market and labor ability -- labor availability related to the questions on immigration, deportations, and otherwise, we're going to have much more clarity there in relatively short order. And I think if those things come about and we don't see big supply chain disruption yet, we should continue to see some expansion on the C&I portfolio. Just don't bake in 12% annualized growth, please, into your models for Firth Third. Mike Mayo : Sounds good. All right. Thank you. Tim Spence : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Thomas Leddy : Hi. Good morning. This is Thomas Leddy standing in for Gerard. You saw a good drop in deposit rates in the fourth quarter. Could you just give us a little more color on what your outlook is for deposit rates in 2025, assuming the Fed is finished cutting? Bryan Preston : Yeah. We'll continue to get a little bit of cost out if the Fed is done at this point. We have a little bit of a first quarter tailwind benefiting in this space as we'll get some full quarter impact of the December cut. Additionally, we have almost $8 billion of CDs maturing in the first quarter, that's at a weighted average rate of about 4.3% right now, that's going to give us some flexibility as well. Beyond that, it's really going to be dependent on loan growth. If it is -- if it becomes a more robust loan growth year potentially, we do think deposit competition could tick up a little bit. But in general, we feel good about our positioning. With the cash position, we're in a spot where if we needed to, we could actually take down our loan to -- improve our loan-to-deposit ratio a little bit and fund some of that loan growth with that excess cash like we did this quarter, but we have a lot of flexibility to navigate those costs. Thomas Leddy : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just quickly, can you give us any color on the uptick we saw in C&I non-accruals this quarter? Greg Schroeck : Yeah. It's Greg. So the increase was really driven by five commercial borrowers, about an average loan size of $32 million, no discernible industry or geographic trends, no concentrations among these borrowers. We remain within a few basis points of -- above our 10 year commercial average. So relatively flat from a 10 year average perspective. And as you know, each of these credits, NPA credits get individually evaluated. We assess those based on the financial risk and those results are captured in our financial results, either through a specific reserve or a charge-off. The largest of the NPA inflows this quarter is expected to pay-off or pay-down within the first half of the year, either through debt reduction or like, I said, the full pay-off. And it's a great example of how we're working with borrowers experiencing stress to reach outcomes that are mutually beneficial. Thomas Leddy : Okay. Great. That's helpful color. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Tim Spence : Hey, Ebrahim. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, Tim. I guess maybe just going back to the very start in terms of consistent investments in branches, Southeast, just remind us around the pay-off that you had from branches opened two, three, four years ago. As we think about means, again, if loan growth picks up for the industry, that's great. Should we think of Fifth Third as someone that outperforms on loan and deposit growth given these investments? So give us a sense of what the pay-off has been as you measure these investments and maybe even talk about like any specific markets, areas where the new -- the growth for 2025 is planned? Thanks. Tim Spence : Yeah. I'll take the second half of that. I'll let Bryan talk to the pay-off -- the first half of this. Bryan Preston : Yeah. The weighted average age of our Southeast branches now, especially, the new builds are still in the early innings, right? It's like, three years on average is where we are right now, and we're going to build another 50 in 2025. And so, we're still in the early ramp periods from an average balance perspective. So it puts us in a position from a customer acquisition perspective where we can drive and continue to drive significant deposit growth, similar to what you've seen from us over the last couple of years and that will be a big driver then of the NII performance. On the asset side of the sheet, it's more related to the sales force additions that we've been making, the teams that we've hired in new markets as well as just the 20% increase in middle market headcount that we've -- middle market sales headcount that we've increased over the last couple of years. So those will be all -- will be strong tailwinds for us from an NII perspective. Tim Spence : Yeah. And I think the callback here is, what we talk about a lot is the degree to which we pride flexibility. The nice thing about having these engines online is it really does give us the ability to toggle between growing deposits when we want to do that or leveraging the fact that we have great liquidity to manage margins. So we make those decisions based on the environment, what the needs of the balance sheet are, as Bryan was saying. In terms of the markets, you can sort of think about that what we've done in a few waves here. The first wave, the new branch builds were disproportionately concentrated in Nashville, North Carolina, and Southwest Florida. The next wave here when you look at these branches coming online this year and next year. The Southeast Coast, so not Dade County, but Broward North, Central Florida and North Florida will all see material increase in branch activity along with South Carolina, and I think we get our first branch open in Birmingham this year. The other big driver in a two year to three year timeframe less so in 2025, is that we're going to see a nice pickup in Atlanta, and in the Atlanta area, we have several branches that will be coming online there. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. That's helpful. And I guess maybe just one quick one on the fees. Maybe you don't have kind of as deep of a capital markets franchise as some of your peers. But just give us a sense of when we look at Slide 7, Wealth, Payments markets, how dependent is that revenue growth on actually balance sheeting loan growth or loans? And are those -- should we view any of those as tools for client acquisition? Tim Spence : Yeah. Okay. Great question. I'll just take it by business. So Wealth, not dependent on balance sheeting loans. We have like $7 in AUM for every $1 in deposits and what $15 or something like that in AUM for every $1 in loans. It really is a wealth management sort of fiduciary focused franchise. It is not balance sheet dependent at all. Commercial Payments, it's sort of half-half, right? I gave the number there that 40% of the new relationships we added last year were Payments-led. Say that in other direction. We added almost one new Commercial Payment relationship that have no credit attached to it for every relationship that we did. But certainly, the balance sheet supports what has been high-single digit, low double-digit growth rates. It's just not reliant on it. And the Newline platform, in particular, is an important driver there. On the Capital Markets side of the equation, much more of what we do in that space is essentially cross selling to existing commercial banking clients. We built a really strong middle market franchise. The hedging activity is great there, that would happen principally to clients, who make use of the balance sheet. The M&A activity, our M&A franchise half the engagements roughly come from inside the house as opposed to being independent, which is what we want, right? It's the mechanism for monetizing the attachment point that you get out of the commercial lending business. And certainly, as it relates to the CIB strategy, the focus on capital markets growth there really does link. I just believe we have a long way to go to get to full penetration inside our existing book of business. So I'm pretty confident in our ability to continue to grow capital markets fees at a rate that exceeds the balance sheet by a healthy margin. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. Thanks, Tim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Tim Spence : Hey, Manan. Manan Gosalia : Hi. Good morning. On Capital, I hear you on keeping the reported CET1 at 10.5%. The question was, how are you thinking about CET1 including AOCI? I know some of your peers are operating or looking to operate in that 9% to 10% range. There is some volatility here on the long end of the curve. So I guess the question is, do you have a target for CET1, including AOCI? And how are you thinking about buybacks and capital management from here? Tim Spence : Yeah, we do. The expectation would be to keep CET1, inclusive of AOCI, north of 8% right now, but we would expect that to continue to increase overtime with the pull to par on the investment portfolio. The AFS portfolio is actually right now on the belly of the curve. The duration of that portfolio is below 4%. It's about 3.8% right now. And if you look at the price sensitivity of the portfolio, it has moved in significantly. So we feel really good about the AOCI accretion that we should be seeing over the next couple of years, which gives us confidence that dependent -- depending on whatever the capital rules may be, we're going to have no issues with meeting that over time. From a buyback perspective from here, our capital priorities are going to continue to be supporting organic growth, maintaining a strong dividend, and then buybacks. And so, the ultimate level of buybacks will be around at 10.5% level and where that triangulates with the end-of-period loan growth we deliver each quarter. Manan Gosalia : Got it. So on the -- I hear you that you'll keep that or you'll accrete through that CET1 including AOCI. Is there any level at which it will -- it could impact loan growth and drive RWA guides at some stage? Tim Spence : We don't see anything at this point that would create a situation where we would pull back meaningfully from a loan growth perspective. Manan Gosalia : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Tim Spence : Welcome back, Brian. Brian Foran : Thank you. So on the Commercial Payments, first of all, thank you for breaking that out and giving us more disclosure. I know, it's an area you've invested and feel like you're kind of pulling away from the pack. When we look at it being 20% of fees, up 8% year-over-year, I think you kind of gave us a couple of times 40% of new Commercial relationships, where Payments-led. Do you have any sense, like, if we got this disclosure from all your peers, are you a little higher? Are you a lot higher? And what's the main metric you think you would stand out on? Tim Spence : Yeah. Great question. So I will say to begin with the reason that we changed our reporting is because it is confusing to see it. So it was confusing for us previously. It's confusing for peers. And the metrics that I like here because they are public and they're transparent as you can do a lot of comparison on your own utilizing data from sources like Nacha or the Nielsen report or I think EY does a benchmarking study and otherwise. And you can look at total volumes per dollar of Commercial deposits. And that essentially calculates a turnover ratio for you and the higher the turnover ratio, the more payment centric the business is. So we're definitely overweight this business relative to others. Look, I think we have 3.5 times roughly the market share, if you were to look at the individual product categories nationally in major Commercial Payments rails that we would have in C&I lending just as a point of triangulation. And I know we're growing faster than the industry is overall because again, we got to look at the benchmarking data on industry growth rates. And I think the other thing that's been helpful for us is because we have this business working with third-party software developers, a little bit counterintuitively, we're actually a beneficiary when traditional FIs lose market share to non-banks because Newline grows when partners like Stripe or Corpay or whatever Toast, Nuvei, etc. Trustly bracks (ph) when they outgrow the players in their individual markets. And we get good data from Greenwich Associates that suggest we have sort of top in the peer group penetration rates in terms of active treasury management relationships with our lending customers. I'm not going to give the exact number, but it's a mid-80s number for us in terms of penetration there. So like, that's the way I would short of debt reckoning, try to triangulate our position relative to others, but it would be great if everybody adopted our captions and then you'd be able to know. Brian Foran : It would. Maybe, if I could sneak in a follow-up on the guidance on Page 15, definitely appreciate your comments going out of your way to mention that 2024, you kind of hit the guidance on all lines and very few banks did that. So you're assumingly giving us a down the fairway plan here. You've touched on all the individual line items, but maybe just kind of wrapping it up, if there were kind of one or two upside and downside risks you were thinking about for the year, what would you highlight within everything you've given us? Tim Spence : Yeah. I think loan growth is certainly going to be a question and the deposit costs will be a question. So I think just with my treasury background, I'm always going to be nervous about NII, but we certainly feel good about the trajectory that we're on. And then just overall market activity from a fee perspective. We had a fairly soft first half of 2024 in capital markets. We're not expecting that to repeat in 2025, but those markets based businesses are always the one where you can see some volatility. Brian Foran : Awesome. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. Tim Spence : Hey, John. John Pancari : Good morning. Just on the -- back to capital. On the M&A front, I just, I hear you on your deployment priorities, organic is still top priority than dividend and buybacks. How are you thinking about M&A here, both from a non-bank M&A perspective, but also for -- in the whole bank perspective, given the regime change in Washington and the regulatory posture changing and need for scale? Just want to get your updated thoughts there, Tim. Thanks. Tim Spence : Sure. No, happy to do it. I mean, the context here matters, right, like the U.S. has the least consolidated banking system in the world, and I believe the banking system is also the least consolidated sector in the U.S. economy. So -- and it's a little bit like holding back floodwaters. Eventually, there's going to be more consolidation in the space and I think it's appropriate. Treasury Secretary Bessent was pretty clear in his testimony that he wants more competition for the larger banks. And I think in our case, we could have made the math work prior to this year and I'm pretty confident we could have gotten a deal approved prior to this year. So I don't know that our posture is any different in that regard. We value the density in the markets where we compete. We've been clear about that. We're believers in the value of diversification, and having an appropriate balance inside the franchise. And we're believers in having the capacity to not just the absolute investment levels. I think people get over focused on that, but to be able to have the human capital to take advantage of a lot of the tech innovation that's going on. I mean, I was out in the valley three, four weeks ago now and the energy is all the way back there in terms of what's coming down the pike. And banks need to be prepared to compete with people who are tech native because I think this administration, in addition to lowering some of the regulatory issues that we've had are -- is going to make it easier for those guys to persist as well. And what I don't believe in and what we're never going to do is to just pursue scale at any cost. Like, we have the ability to grow without doing M&A. I don't think everybody can say that, but you can see it, when you look at the growth rates in the franchise. And so, we want to make the right decisions there as the opportunities materialize. On the non-bank front, we continue to be interested in adding to the capacity that we have in the managed services and the Commercial Payments. So that is an area where we've been active. We're not big buyers of big properties, so don't be looking for us to buy a publicly traded tech company and blow off a bunch of capital that way. But you do find businesses where the core product is proven product market fit, but they're lacking distribution on occasion. And those are things that we like because there's real franchise value when you're getting tech and a proven product that doesn't exist in the same way as when you're acquiring people and then you have to essentially buy them again every three years to five years in some of the more talent driven businesses. John Pancari : Got it. Okay, Tim. Thank you for that. That's helpful. And then, separately, it's clear you guys have certainly been executing better than many of your peers in terms of your growth and your returns and hitting your targets as you had noted earlier in the call as well. As we look at your broader returns, I mean, you're here in the high-teens, 18% to 19% return on tangible common equity here. You're in the mid-50s efficiency ratio. As you look at 2025, which is a year, where we expect some underlying improvement in the macro backdrop, how do you view the return profile for the third as you're looking at ROTCE, and operating efficiency for the year, and then possibly even beyond that, where do you think the returns are heading towards? Tim Spence : Yeah. And I mean, here's what I would say. I take great pride in the fact that you don't have to believe like a long deductive logic chain in order to get to a place where you're confident that we can achieve returns in excess of our cost of equity. Like, we're kind of in or within reach of our return targets in terms of what we think are good places to run the company. And so, if you think about it in the context of stability, profitability and growth, like, that we like the predictability of the business. We're proud of that. I don't think there's a lot of work that needs to be done there. We're neutrally positioned from -- on ALM perspective and defensive in terms of credit. I mean, the fourth quarter production as an example. The PDs were actually better on a dollar weighted basis than our existing portfolio. So we feel good there. Our profitability, like, the mid to high-teens and the return on tangible common equity in a mid-50s efficiency ratio feels pretty good. We'll get operating leverage this year, if the year plays out as we expect, as Bryan said, I think it's probably closer to 2% in terms of what we'll produce. But the goal for us then really isn't to try to find a way to get an 18% return to a 19% return or a 55% efficiency ratio to a 54%. It sustained that level and grow tangible book value per share, right, that really is where the focus has got to be in terms of that sort of the next leg in the franchise, all assuming again that we have the more benign backdrop that was sort of the setup in your question. John Pancari : Thanks, Tim. Very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Tim Spence : Hey, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. A little bit of a kind of non-fit to a question, but since you mentioned it, you said your middle market customers, the biggest thing that they're highlighting is still some challenges in labor. And maybe that's -- I would assume that's impacting some of that loan demand or pipelines churning into actual volumes. But are they hopeful that some of that dislocation will finally solve itself? Are they kind of trying to offset these challenges with tech that should kind of help at some point, or, I guess, what's the plan if they have any? Tim Spence : Yeah. No. That's a great question. I mean, it sort of depends by sector, right? So let me say that in advance. On the manufacturing and logistics, wholesale distribution side of the business, there's no question that they're hopeful that they can get gains intact. Like, I've shared some examples of the facilities that we put in place to support the retooling of manufacturing facilities or warehouses so that the peak you guys said you're getting a lot more of your picking in high volume items as an example done by robots. Including robots that based on the forward order book will actually restack racks and move SKUs around overnight so that the pickers when they come in the morning are more productive. And so there is some of that. I think in sectors like healthcare, there's a hope that at some point here that the graduating classes from nursing schools and otherwise overtakes the demand and that they can rely a little less on the traveling nursing companies. I'm less personally optimistic there for our healthcare clients, but they're hoping for that. In a lot of the other sectors like, services, construction and retail and otherwise, I think there is a concern around the direction of travel on labor because the reality is we have a negative birth rate in the U.S. And we have because of the -- just the demographic pyramid and the size of the baby boomer generation versus the exes in the millennials like we have more people retiring every year right now than we have entering the workforce. And that's a structural problem that I don't think gets better unless you can boost productivity with technology. So you hear a mix of all those things when you talk to clients, some optimism that maybe the labor market will cool, but the jobs report is not suggesting that's happening. And we just have to wait and see on whether or not there's a functioning immigration program that would support additional documented labor in the U.S. Matt O'Connor: That's interesting color. And then you guys are pretty balanced, I think, between large corporate and middle market. Are there kind of different themes in the large corporate, meaning they're less pressured by labor? And then as you think about just bringing it all together, as you think about your C&I growth, do you think it will be more large corporate or middle market driven this year if you had to adjust? And then I'm done. Thank you. Tim Spence : Yeah. I'll take the second one first. I think the goal here is balance, like, we want over time, we have gotten more granular. We made some progress on granularity, which was an important part of the strategy of Fifth Third. So the sort of small business, business banking, middle market segment, ideally we'll grow a little bit faster than corporate banking. I don't expect corporate banking to outgrow the middle market. And meaningfully, the plan was set to have good balance and consistent focus on granularity there, including within corporate banking for that matter. Do you want the other part of it, Bryan, of the question? Bryan Preston : Yeah. I mean, I think in general, we do expect corporate banking to -- and the larger companies in general have navigated the labor pressures a little bit better than the middle market. We think that's a theme that is likely to continue. A lot of that just has to do with their investment capacity, their ability to invest in automation, their ability to shift to different labor markets just tends to provide more flexibility. And they also tend to be the businesses that have had a little bit more pricing power to be able to pass through some costs so that they could attract the right labor. So we think the corporate banking, I mean, we talk about it in banking, scale matters and it matters in the C&I portfolio as well. I agree with that. Matt O'Connor: All right. Great. Thank you for all that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Please go ahead. Tim Spence : Hey, Erika. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Just two quick follow-up questions. Bryan, as we think about the net interest income outlook, could you share with us how you expect the net interest margin to traject from that 2.97%? And do you have a view if we have a 4% neutral rate, what the normalized margin would be for Fifth Third under that scenario? Bryan Preston : Yeah. We expect margin to continue to improve a few basis points each quarter throughout the year. Certainly, there's a big wildcard associated with the cash position in any individual quarter. The 7 basis point increase this quarter, obviously, was partly attributable to that cash position coming down some due to that loan growth that we saw as well as liability management actions. We've been talking for a while now that getting back into the 320s in this kind of rate environment is achievable for us. Certainly, though, the shape of the curve and the mix of the balance sheet is going to be a big driver in that. But we feel good about the trajectory that we're on in both NII and NIM will continue to improve each quarter throughout the year. Erika Najarian : Got it. And maybe the next follow-up question is for Tim. I believe the stress capital buffer that Fifth Third received was 3.2% last year. I'm wondering as you think about the embedded risk in the balance sheet, if you think it's worth it to participate off cycle to revisit that stress capital buffer? Tim Spence : Yeah. Great question. No, it doesn't make sense for us to do it just because it's not a binding constraint for us today, Erika. I am optimistic that we're going to get more transparency out of the stress tests, given the Fed's announcement and subsequently, the litigation filing from the VPI, and that'll be quite helpful. But today, whether that stress capital buffer was 2.5 or 3.2 or 3.5 really, it doesn't matter. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead. Christopher Marinac : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about additional C&I utilization as well as any upgrade downgrade trends from the criticized and classified. Bryan Preston : Yeah. On the C&I utilization front, it moved up to about a point to -- it's in the 36% range at quarter end and it stayed in that range at the beginning of this quarter. We're not forecasting any significant change in utilization throughout the rest of the year and expect it to be relatively stable. And then on the CRIP (ph) front? Tim Spence : Yeah. As it relates to the CRIP, as Bryan mentioned, we were down $435 million in the fourth quarter. Our ratio was down just over 7%. 90% of the criticized portfolio, including our NPAs are current. So I feel really good about the progress we've made. We said last quarter on this call, we expected to see criticized reduce a little bit. We continue to work through those troubled assets. So I feel good about the trend. I feel good about the portfolio. It continues to maintain a great balanced mix, a strong concentration, limit disciplines. So I feel good about the current asset quality. Christopher Marinac : Great. We'll leave it there. Thank you both very much. Tim Spence : Thanks. Matt is signaling to me that we're on the way out. So before we go, I just wanted to say quickly that my thoughts continue to be with the people in California, who've been impacted by the wildfires, and especially our employees, clients, and partners who live and work there. We've been fortunate based on what I heard from our folks and directly from clients. I'm really proud of the commercial banking presence we've built in California over the past several years. It's been like a 50% compound annual growth rate. It's all middle market and nearly self-funded. It's really -- it's been outstanding. I'm going to have a personal connection out there too. My dad grew up in the Altadena Pasadena corridor, and my grandparents were laid to rest there. And those communities are really special to me. And Fifth Third will do its part -- as part of this equation to help those communities rebuild as I know they will. Matt, go ahead. Matt Curoe : Thanks, Tim. And thanks everyone for your interest in Fifth Third. Please contact the Investor Relations department if you have any follow-up questions. Regina, you may now disconnect the call. Operator : That will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
